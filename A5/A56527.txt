HENRY, Earl of Monmouth, TO THE READERS His Countrymen.
IN my Author's Sololoquie, in the latter end of his Politic Discourses,
wherein he gives you a short Relation of his Life, He mentions this History of
his, which he terms, Opera buona, and degna, a good and gallant Work. I took
his own word for the Approbation thereof, and truly I find he has made it
good: and if I have not injured him in making it speak my Language; I am very
confident you will be of my opinion: for you will find in it, great variety of
History, handsomely woven, and delightful, intermixed with Negotiations,
Treaties of War, and Peace, Leagues, and Confederacies made between Christian
Princes, several Speeches and Orations, made upon many several occasions, and
strongly argued; and indeed, whatsoever may make a Book seem pleasing to the
Reader: Which, that it may do to thee, is the wish of

Thy Compatriot, MONMOUTH.

THE HISTORY OF VENICE, Written by PAULO PARUTA. BOOK I. THE CONTENTS.
A Preparatory Prooemium to the Description of the ensuing History; Framed upon
some Actions of the Commonwealth of Venice. Italy (being made a woeful
receptacle of foreign Nations) is miserably lacerated, and almost reduced to
slavery, which is remedied by the Venetian Forces. The Miseries of Italy are
renewed by Lewis the twelveth of France; and by the Spaniards, who occasion the
contentions in Naples. Bajazet and the Venetians are agreed. Maximilian of
Austria, is denied entrance into Italy, by the Venetians: He makes war with
them, and loses some Castles upon the Confines of the Empire. Almost all the
Kings, and Princes of Christendom, conspire together against the Venetians:
Lewis of France is the Author thereof. They re-gain some Cities; They refuse
to make Peace: The intentions of King Lewis: Of the Pope: His Treaties. Of the
Swissers: Of the Viceroy of Naples. The Senate is in dispute whether they
shall embrace Peace, or War. At last they make a League with the King of
France. War is renewed; The Articles of the League. The Election of a new Pope.
Alviano, his first successes. The Dutch go out of Verona. Novara is defended by
the Switzers. Alviano does in vain assault Verona. The attempt of taking Padua,
by Bishop Gurghense, the Emperors Lieutenant; The Siege is given over. Various
accidents which befell the Common wealth. The War by reason of the Winter, is
deferred till a better season.

THe Commonwealth of Venice, for the long continuance of her Command, and for
the excellency of her Government, is deservedly held to be the goodliest, and
most fortunate, of as many as ever were in the world; and if her remarkable
Actions, both of Peace and War, had been more lively kept in memory by writing,
and by men's mouths; so as her Fame had been equal to her deservings, she would
by this time have arrived at such Renown, as her glorious Actions would have
far exceeded the memory of all other Cities, Rome only excepted. And certainly,
that such a flourishing Commonwealth; both for good Laws, and wholesome
Institutions, should not, in so long a concourse of time, have achieved
greater Empire; And also, that the glory of her Enterprises has been so little
celebrated by famous Writers, and not preserved in that Dignity, and Splendour,
as becomes their merits, ought not to be imputed to the baseness nor
wretchlesness of her Inhabitants, but rather to their Modesty: For the custom
of our forefathers, was not to undertake War out of a desire of Rule; but to
preserve their Liberties: and being wholly intent upon the welfare of their
Country, they did not mind their own greatness; but studied more to be, then to
appear, good. Hence it was, that not placing the chiefest Glory in extent of
Empire, or in the praise of other men; but in the good Government of the City,
and in the uprightness of their own consciences; they lost many occasions of
aggrandizing their Commonwealth; and suffered many of their glorious Actions,
to sleep in silence: But in the following Age, the Commonwealth being much
increased in Citizens, Riches, and Laws, whereby she had drawn upon her, the
envy of many other people; it might easily be known by their dangers, and by
their affairs, that the Commonwealth stood in need of larger Dominions, and of
greater Forces; to the end that she might provide for her safety, and for her
plenty, both by Sea and Land: Therefore whereas formerly our Ancestors, being
provoked to war by their Neighbors, thought they had done enough if they kept
themselves from being injured by them; They began to take in Cities, and to
enlarge their borders on all sides, to the end that they might put their
Affairs into a safer, and a more honorable condition. It also often times
happened, that by their civil ways, without any noise of war, which was suppressed
by peace; by their negotiations, and hopes of tranquillity; they won upon the
Peoples good will, and did enlarge their Confines; In so much as the City being
already become very powerful, both by Sea and Land; she seemed to represent the
greatness and Majesty of the ancient Romans: Which things, if they had been
sooner done, the City of Venice would have arrived to such a height, as she
might have been paralel'd to the Commonwealth of Rome, for Empire, and warlike
Glory: But this advice was so long a taking, as that all things fell out cross
unto her: For the Times began already, apparently to favor the Ottoman Family,
which being come from a small beginning, it is a wonderful thing to say how
soon it increased; so as having by great contest in war, overcome many Kings,
and States; and by its formidable greatness, utterly ruined the Eastern Empire,
it bereft the Venetians of all hope of enlarging their Dominion in the Maratine
parts: Other hopes likewise of happy success, were by a short delay spoiled,
and corrupted; for if the Commonwealth had turned her Forces sooner upon the
Vic^gerents of the Empire; who taking occasion by reason of the Emperors
troubles in the tedious wars of Germany, usurped the free Dominion of many of
the noblest Cities of Italy, She might easily have regained them from their
unlawful possessors, who were yet weak and of no repute. And then Italy being
subdued, how easy it was for them to subdue all other Nations, and to spread
their Empire from the East unto the West, is easily demonstrable, by the very
proceedings of the Romans: But howsoever the Forces, Customs, and Laws, of this
rich and flourishing Commonwealth, continue in greater vigor, and the Fates
will one day open them the way to great Achievements.

I have proposed unto my self to spend the time which shall be permited me, in
writing the Actions of this so famous City, as well in times of war, as of
peace; the memory whereof, I will endeavor to leave to posterity, with as great
sincerity, and uncorrupted Faith, as I possibly can. I thought it became me
cheerfully, and readily, to undertake this, being laid upon me by public
Commission, that I might employ my time in the service of this my Noble, and
dear Country, in that point wherein (as I have said) the care of our
Predecessors may seem sometimes to have been wanting; in which duty assuredly I
will do my best. Therefore, laying aside all partiality and passions, I have,
with a peaceable and free mind, undertaken this business; and if any one shall
peradventure think, that I do sometimes praise the Affairs of the Venetians too
highly; let them excuse me, and think, that it is not the love of my Country
that moves me thereunto, but only the desire of speaking truth; the memory of
these times, and men, not being to be sufficiently celebrated, whose excellent
worth was able to govern so many affairs, and to sustain the violence of
adverse fortune.

I am by the commands of the Counsel of Ten; the supreme Magistracy of this our
Country, to take the rise of this my Narration, from the time wherein the
History of Cardinal Bembo, a Famous Personage ended, and therewith the League
made by the Venetians, with Pope Julius the second, and with Ferdinand, King of
Spain, against the French; which League ended almost together with the life of
this Pope. It will be good and useful, that in the continuation of this
History, the perfect form of our Republic be represented; wherein may be seen
the true Image of perfect Government, for those things to which the wit of man
has not been able to attain, in their fancying the Government of an excellent
Commonwealth, are all seen to be confirmed by time and experience, in the City
of Venice. The memory of these times will afford various Examples of both
Fortunes, which may help very much to the acquiring of State wisdom; and
moreover, many Testimonies of worth, whereby great moderation and constancy, in
prosperous and adverse Fortune; at home, and in the wars, true Justice and
Fortitude, may be found in our Citizens. But before I begin what I intend to
say, I must expound some things, taking them a little higher, to the end that
the truth of what is to be said, may appear the more clearly.

It was already long since Italy was fallen into great calamity, and being
become the Seat and Receptacle of Foreign Nations, she advanced a pace toward
a long and hard slavery; being by them robbed of her Empire, and of her Military
glory: For the French having a little before the time from which I am to take
the rise of this my History, assaulted the Kingdom of Naples, by the means and
advice of Lodowick Sforza, Duke of Millan, (who did not therein foresee his own
ruin) the way was ever afterward laid open for all the Italians greatest
enemies to enter Italy, to her prejudice and ruin: For all our Princes being
desirous of Noveltie, and confiding in Foreigners, they waged war against
themselves, renting this their unfortunate common Country in pieces by the
Sword, and by all injurious proceedings, for they believed they might easily
come by those Dignities and States, by disturbing her peace, which they
dispaired of obtaining whilst Italy was in a quiet condition; wherein how they
were cheated, the event did prove: For they soon saw those evils turned upon
themselves, which they had prepared for others; In so much as there was not any
one part of this Noble Country, which tasted not deeply of the miseries of war;
and which being long tormented with slaughters, rapine, and all sort of
cruelty, has not lost almost all their ancient Privileges and Dignities, and
changed their whole Aspect. The unlooked-for coming of the French into Italy,
whether they brought a dreadful and unusual way of warring, did so terrify the
Kings of Aragon, as having more respect to their safety, then to their Honor,
they forsook a Noble Kingdom, and left all things as a prey to the avarice of
the Conquerors. But the French, who had got the Victory, more by an opinion
which was had of their Forces, then out of mere worth, did through their
negligence, lose the fruit thereof, and were soon driven home out of Italy:
which was chiefly done by the advice and Forces of the Venetians; And had our
Princes been able then to have bounded their Appetites, the power of the French
had not peradventure, extended it self beyond the confines of their own
Kingdom. But hardly was this first Combustion over, when suddenly another war
was kindled in Italy; the same way of civil discord being opened unto the
French, by which they had at first entered our Countries: Their King Lodowick,
the twelvth, having made a League with the Venetians, did again assault Italy,
with yet a greater preparation for war, and won one of her most fruitful
Provinces, and which did most abound in Inhabitants, and goodly Cities, having
driven the Family of the Sforza's out of it: And soon after, having a mind to
be Master of all Italy, calling in the Spaniards to assist him, he, together
with them, possessed himself of the Kingdom of Naples. Great contention arose
between these two Potent Kings of France and Spain, about the division thereof;
and Italy being made the Seat of war, they often fought with various success,
and keeping themselves out of danger, ruined the Countries of other men with
sword and fire. In these troublesome times, whilst Italy, was full, almost in
all her ports of Foreign Armies, and troubled with various successes of war,
the Affairs of the Venetians went peacefully, and prosperously on; for Fortune
not having as yet begun to frown upon them; and they having accomodated the
differences between them, and Bajazet the Emperor of the Turks, with whom
before they had made war, and put all their Maritime parts into a peaceful
condition, they turned their thoughts upon their Land Militia, and to their
Dominion on Terra firma; and did with all diligence study how to increase their
Forces, and their Empire; that their Commonwealth might be able, when occasion
should require, to resist foreign Forces. The Dignity and Fame of the City of
Venice was hereupon so much increased, as it now held the first place for
Authority and Power, in all Italy; and by common consent all differences were
referred to her: there was not any one who intended to attempt any thing upon
Italy, who did not chiefly endeavor to have the Venetians for their Friends,
and Confederates.

Thus Maximillian of Austrea, King of the Romans, Elect Emperor of the West,
desirous to come into Italy to receive the Ensigns of Empire, according to the
customs of his Predecessors, and to restore Italy to her Liberty, by freeing
her from the severe slavery of the French; and to reduce her under the civil
Germane Empire, endeavored very much to win the Venetians to join their Forces
with his, or at least not to have them his Advers^ries. But the Senate of
Venice, not willing to make more way for the barbarous Nations to ruin Italy,
whereby she might draw upon her the hatred of all her Neighbor Princes,
resolved not to forego the friendship which she had contracted with the French,
but to oppose the Emperor Maximillian, if he should come into Italy in a
warlike posture. Hereupon arose war between them, which happened succesfully;
for the Venetians entering with greater Forces into the Emperors Confines, took
from him some Castles, which belonged to the Patremony of the House of Austrea,
and joined them to their Empire. The other Princes did very much envy the
prosperity of the Venetians, where power being become so formidable, they
thought fit to suppress: wherefore almost all the Kings and Princes of Europe,
conspired against her, and proclaimed war against Venice, Lodowick, King of
France, being the chief Author thereof, who was obliged to the Commonwealth by
many ancient and modern good Offices, wherefore she thought she might very much
confide in his Friendship. As soon as this unexpected news came to Venice, the
Senators not showing any sign of fear of this so great and dreadful War; but
being resolved to meet the Enemies Forces, left nothing undone which might make
for their defense, and which might be done by Advice, Gallantry, and Force of
Arms. But now they must give way to adverse Times: the Commonwealths Army did
unfortunately fight the Enemy, upon the Banks of the River Ada; and after the
bad success of this Battle, as if the Commonwealth had received a fatal blow,
out of a sudden despair, she freed the Noblest Cities of her Dominions, from
their former Oaths; and gave them leave to submit unto the Enemy: So as falling
on a sudden from the hight of Happiness into great misery, she was a great
Example of the variety of humane Affairs. Yet soon after, the Senators resuming
courage, began to Rally their dispersed Forces, to raise more Forces; wherewith
in a short time, the Enemies Forces being separated, and they having gotten
some of the Enemies to join with them against their own confederates, they
revenged themselves of the French, who were the first occasioners of their
Calamity, and drove them out of Italy; and did likewise recover, and defend
many of their Noblest Cities and Castles: by which success, growing higher in
their hopes, they often times refused peace when it was offered them; being
resolved either to obtain such conditions, as whereby they might recover their
ancient State, or else put themselves again upon the utmost dangers of war.
Wherefore all men said, that even in the obscurity of so much adverse fortune,
some light did yet remain of the ancient Glory of Italy, and of the Venetian
virtue, in the perpetual constancy of that Senate, and in their generous
invincible fortitude of Spirit. The Venetians often times when they were worsted,
treated with their Enemies which had overcome them, as if they were to give,
not to receive Laws; demanding restitution of whatsoever was theirs before the
war began, before they would lay down Arms. They had by this time recovered the
Cities of Padua, Trevigi, Vicenza, Crema; and besides these, the Towns in
Freuli, and the Cities of Feltre, and Belluno, submitted to the Venetian
Empire; but Verona was still in Maximillians hands: the (...) of Naples held
Brescia, whereinto he powered a great many Spaniards; and the Switzers having
won Cremona, held it in the name of Maximillian Sforza: Ferdinand, King of
Spain, possesed the Towns and Havens of Puglia, which formerly belonged to the
Commonwealth; having restored them to the Kingdom of Naples, as Members
thereof. And the Castles of Romagnia, which were won by Pope Julius, were by
him annexed to the Ecclesiastical State. The Commonwealth was not then upon any
good terms with the Pope, nor with the King of Spain, though not long before
she had entered into League and Friendship with them* Not with the one, because
he did favor Caesar too much, and not with the other, because contrary to
Articles, he detained the City of Brescia, which appertained to her. The
Switzers friendship was greatly suspected, though they professed adherence to
the Commonwealth; as well by reason of their ancient repute of not being over
faithful, as also for the new success of Cremona. But she professed open enmity
to Lodowick, King of France; and the time of League made for some Months with
the Emperor Maximillian, was expired, all Treaties of peace between him and
the Venetians having always proved vain; out of their constant resolution to
recover, and the like in him not to quit Verona.

This was the Condition of the Times, and of the State of Venice; When in the
beginning of the year 1513. counting from the Birth of Christ, and 1092. from
the building of Venice, Leonardo Loredano, being then Duke, which is the
highest degree of the Commonwealth; there began some appearance of peace and
quiet, after so many troubles; for the French, who had been the beginners of
the late Calamities, were already driven out of Italy, and had the Mountains
given them for the bounders of their Empire, and together with them it was
thought that the sink of all other mischiefs was thrown out. It was to be
conceived by no improbable Arguments, that Peace would be acceptable to all
those who had any Dominion in Italy; Caesar was not thought to be able of
himself to make good the War, having no hope of assistance from the French, and
environed with many necessities; wherefore it was likely that he would give way
to some agreement; nor were the Venetians averse unto it, being now by the
continual troubles of so many sore wars, invited to rest. The Pope, who had
wont to boast that he by Counsels, had freed Italy from the slavery of the
French, it might with reason be thought, that nothing could be more desired by
him then this; That, since he had much enlarged the Churches Dominions, and
re-invested the Duke of Millan in his State, the Affairs of Italy might begin
to be in a better condition by enjoying peace. And it was very manifest, that
Ferdinand King of Spain was to desire peace more then the rest: This wise
Prince knew that it was by Peace that he was to confirm himself in his new
possession of Naples, and by his own industry, or other men's negligence,
increase his Force and Reputation; therefore under appearance of the Common
good, but indeed minding more his own advantage, he had oftentimes sent
Ambassadors to Caesar, and to the Venetians, laboring to compound their
differences. But hardly did this light begin to appear out of cloudy
by-gone-times, when suddenly it vanished.

Some seeds of the former mischiefs remained yet in Italy; for the strong
astles of Genua, Millan, and Cremona, held still for the King of France, and
many factious men began to desire Novelties; and to the terror of all men, news
was spread abroad of new stirrings in France, which as it was believed would
suddenly break forth into open war. Lodowick did greatly desire to recover the
State of Millan, and his ancient Reputation; and he was much the more incited
by the discord of the Colleague Princes, hoping that he might easily divide
them, and get some of them to join with him, when he should send his Army into
Italy. He therefore sometimes egged on Caesar to war against the Venetians, and
sometimes the Venetians against Caesar. He offered all his Forces to each of
them, he propounded great rewards of Victory; he made himself appear to them to
be in a condition of joining with any one of them, when the other should
undervalue his Friendship. Moreover, to the end that a more firm and inviolable
agreement might be made between them, he promised Caesar to give him his
Daughter Renea for wife, to his Nephew Charles, or else to his Nephew Ferdinand,
and to give with her for Portion, the State of Millan, when it should be
regaind by their joint Forces. The Pope was hereat greatly troubled; for he saw
that great dangers were threatened to Italy, by the power of the French, which
he did no less hate then fear: but he was much in doubt which side he should
favor: If he should lean to Caesar, he feared least the Venetians having no
hopes of peace, should have recourse to the friendship of the French, and
should endeavor to secure themselves by their Forces; so as he should lose all
that Glory, which during all the time of his being Pope, he had so much
labored after. And on the contrary, if he should lose Caesar by assisting the
Venetians, he thought he had not sufficiently provided for all dangers; and
being very jealous, he persuaded himself it might easily happen that Caesar
siding with the Council at Pisa, which the King of France had long before set
up against him, and which was at this time removed to Lions, his Glory, and
Dignity might be exposed to great danger. But a fervent desire to get the City
of Ferrara did most of all prevail with the Pope in making him alter his first
resolution of assisting the Venetians. Rejecting therefore at the last all
things which might persuade him to the contrary, he resolved to be governed by
Caesar's Interest; and whereas formerly he had wont with great dexterity and
humanity to exhort the Venetians to Peace, he began now to threaten them
severely, if they did not accept thereof upon whatsoever severe condions, as
soon as it should be propounded: Whereby he hoped to induce Caesar to give over
the defense of Ferrara, which losing his assistance* must needs fall into his
hands. But the Venetians being certainly advertised by their Ambassador
Francisco Foscari of these the Popes new inventions, began to listen to the
reasons which had been many times before urged by Andrea Gritti, of joining in
League with the French.

This Andrea being taken Prisoner in Brescia, and afterward carried into
France, was for his wisdom, good behavior, and affability, very well esteemed
of by all men, and especially by the King, and kept with great respect and
honor, so as he now conversed and treated in the Court, much liker an
Ambassador of his Country, than a Prisoner; the Venetians thought it an
unworthy thing, and not to be endured, that their prosperous Success in War
against the French had brought them no advantage, by reason of the great Injury
that was done them by their Friends and Confederates; who notwithstanding would
have it believed that they had undertaken that War chiefly for the Venetians
good, and that their Commonwealth might flourish again. By which appearances
the Venetians being nourisht in hopes, they were the cause why they willingly
continued the War, underwent much labor, and danger, not sparing for expenses;
but as soon as the French had a way made them for the League, Constanso
Ferrario was suddenly sent to Venice to negotiate it, not without the Kings
consent and knowledge. This man brought Letters with him to the Senate, from
Giovanni Giacopo Trinusio, one who was then in great Authority with the King,
wherein he appeared to be very well inclined to the Commonwealth, and then
showing the reason which had moved him to send this his Servant of purpose to
them, left the whole Authority of negotiating, and concluding the business to
him; that it might be the more closely carried, this business of Treaty
touching the League with Ferrario, was committed to Antonio Iustiniano, one of
the prime Senators, and who was then in great esteem for his Wisdom. These
after diverse meetings agreed, that some things being altered which the
condition of the times did require, those capitulations should continue which
were made some years before, when the Venetians joined in League with the
French against the Sforza's. Gritti was made acquainted with all this, and was
desired that he should by all means endeavor, that this Friendship and Peace
might be confirmed by the King as soon as might be. Lewis seemed to be content
with what was done, and promised to make good all that had been agreed upon by
Ferrario, except that Article of ye^lding up Cremona, and Giaradada to the
Venetians; which places he absolutely denied to surrender up to any. The
Venetians would very gladly have had Cremona restored: for when they called to
memory what expense and labor they had been at in the getting of it, the more
desirous they were to re-possess it. To which purpose they used these reasons
to the King, that either of their States ought to be bounded by remarkable
Confines, to take away all future occasions which might arise of breaking their
Amity, which could be none else but the two Rivers of Poe and Ada; that the
Cities of Brescia and Cremona were so situated, as unless they were Masters of
Cremona, their Dominion must be continually divided and weak, and subject to
many Inconveniences. That the better to strengthen the new League, it was best
to renew it upon the same conditions which were formerly accepted of by the
King, that the King could not retract (without injury to them) from any thing
which was treated upon and concluded by Fe^rerio, not without his knowledge.
Thus whilst both the parties were firm to their opinions, Affairs grew every
day more difficult, and there appeared less hope of bringing them to their
desired end. The Pope was very much moved, when he heard of this Treaty, though
it came to him but by an uncertain Rumor, and was occasioned rather by
Jealousy than by apparent Evidence, he therefore being desirous to keep the
French and the Venetians divided, began to lay aside much of that severity
wherewith he had wont to treat with them, and endeavored to sweeten them with
many Courtesies and Humanities. He excused himself for having entered into a new
League with Caesar, whereunto he was enforced, for the avoiding of many
mischiefs: He promised that when he should have secured his own Affairs, he
would declare himself a Friend to the Commonwealth; that the mean while he
would not take up any Temporal Army against them, but would annull the
Ecclesiastical Censures which he had laid upon them. Moreover the Switzers
exhorted thereunto by Cardinal Sedunensa, a great Friend to the French, and
being also stirred up by the Pope, sent their Ambassadors to Venice, to use
their Authority in this business, which at this time was very great with all
Princes, out of the high esteem which was had of their Military Valor. These
exhorted the Senate to Peace, and making great boasts of themselves, and of
their Power, strove to make all other Friendships less safe, and less desirable
than theirs. Likewise by Advice of the same Pope the Viceroy of Naples sent
Pietro di Castro to Venice, to let the Senate understand that the Viceroy had
Power to prolong as long as they should please, the Peace which but a little
before they had concluded with Caesar, by Ferdinand's procurement, and to use
all means to confirm such as were jealous in their ancient Friendship and
Affection with his King. The Senators being assaulted by these several
Adresses, as if it had been by so many Engines; whereas they were jointly
minded before, to make Peace with France and renew the War, some of them began
now to think upon Peace; which they did the sooner, because News came every day
from several parts, of great Preparations for War, which Henry King of England
was making to assault France. Whence it was to be feared that King Lewis being
busied in defending his own Kingdoms, could not that year bethink himself of
the Affairs of Italy, nor employ his Forces therein: Therefore as soon as any
Proposition was made tending to the new League, the others by spinning out time
endeavored to abstruct the business.

They put them in mind of the great miseries of those times, affirming that
after so much labor and danger it was now time to endeavor Peace to
themselves, and their Subjects. That all humane things were governed with a
certain variety and change, and by a perpetual turning about, were seen
sometimes to increase, sometimes to diminish; that their Commonwealth had
enjoyed Prosperity for a long time; it now became them to bear with some
Adversity, that when the times should alter, she might recover her ancient
Reputation, Empire, and Glory. That therefore they were to use such Wisdom and
Temper, as not to bring their Commonwealth to ultimate ruin, by pressing upon
time, and by too hastily accelerating the n^w growth of their Commonwealth;
that all Italy might bear witness of the French men's cruel dispositions, which
being imperiously used by them as well in Peace as in War, might prove how this
Nation was equally ^roublesome and insupportable both to their Friends and
Enemies. That to open the way again to this barbarous Nation, was to return
Italy into much misery and calamity. That Maximillian 's nature was such, as
through his Inconstancy and immense Prodigality, which had often time brought him
to greatest Extremities, they might assuredly hope shortly, and at no great
expense, to recover all that he possessed of theirs.

But others labored to persuade the contrary, who were of opinion, that a
high, though no assured hope, ought to be preferred before safer, but more
humble thoughts. They said the Venetians were never so overcome by fear, as by
so great a desire of quiet, to forego all occasions of just and glorious War.
That it was therefore, that the fame of their Commonwealth was so highly
extolled, and lowdly cried up even in the farthest distant Nations. And that
she had then purchased most praise, when she appeared to be almost extinct,
triumphing over victorious Fortune. That they should still keep the same noble
resolutions; for all things do at last bow to Worth. That their greatest
dangers were already over, that they did not fight now for safety, but now for
Glory and Empire. That since they had so freely undergone the weight of so
great War, there was no necessity of oppressing the little remainders by Peace
and Agreement, but to secure their Affairs for a longer time by a famous
Victory: That they should remember what the common Proverb says, That every
one builds up his own Fortune. That the loss at Geradada was accompanied by
many other unfortunate successes, because dispairing so soon, they neither
hoped for, nor put for any thing. But as as soon as they began to rouse up their
minds, their Fortune began likewise to rouse up, and their good hopes were
accompanied by good success. That if the Affairs of Italy should be established
in a settled Peace, and that Venice now accustomed to the Inconveniences of War,
should be abased with idleness and wantonness, it would be too late to hope for
the recovery hereafter of her former State and Dignity: That the condition of
Italy was now such as she needed not to fear any prejudice by the coming in of
the French, but that she might the rather recover her liberty by means of their
Forces, so much the more easily, for that being now Lorded over by several
powerful Princes, every one of their Authorities would become weaker, and less
formidable; and one not bearing with an others greatness, it might so fall out
as she might shake off the yoke of all foreign Nations. That if she should now
sit down by so great injuries done her by her Colleagues, she would assuredly be
hereafter scorned by all people, and injured without any manner of respect;
that this might be argued, by the French men's so much desiring amity with the
Commonwealth for no other reason, save only that they knew how generous and
powerful she was by the revenge which she had taken of them.

From this diversity of opinions and contention, the advice for War or Peace
was carried on uncertainly: The doubtfulness of the thing it self was rendered
yet more doubtful by the nature and condition of those with whom they treated.
For the Emperor Maximillian was of a lively Spirit, able Body, patient in
undergoing Labor, and with all was well acquainted with Military Affairs. But
his dri^ts and affections were contrary to one another: He was hasty in
Council, his Speech and Actions differed, he willingly embraced all that was
presented unto him, but did not much mind the effecting of them. The Name of
the Empire was large and magnifick; but this Dignity was rather sustained by an
appearing greatness, then by any real strength. It was otherwise with King
Lewis, the power of whose Kingdom was very great, and his desire of War no
less. But his desire of Dominion was such, as he made it lawful to break his
word, and to violate all Justice, which the Venetians were sufficiently taught
by the remembrance of their late received Injuries: Therefore as his Friendship
seemed in some respects greatly desirable; so in some other it was as
dangerous and suspicious. No certain hope was to be built upon the Popes, nor
the King of Spains promises; their assistance being weak and uncertain, and
their Counsels not very sincere, which was sufficiently witnessed by their past
Actions: So as it might easily be known, that their thoughts were set only upon
their own particular designs, not upon the preservation of the Commonwealth.
Hence it was that the hopes and hazards of War were equally poysed. The
Senators opinions being thus divided, the good Fortune of the Commonwealth did
at last decide the business, which had destinied her to a larger and more
lasting Empire. For this business being long discust by the College of the
Savii (who are sixteen picked out by the Senate, distinguished amongst themselves
by several degrees of Dignities, and by distinct Offices, to whom it belongs to
advise of all public Affairs, and report them to the Senate) it was by a
joint Vote propounded, that by all means the League was to be made with the
French; whereby the Commonwealth might be freed from the Treachery of the
Confederates. The Senate was well pleased with the agreement, and with almost
an universal consent, the renewing of the War was agreed upon: and that the
business might be the more easily proceeded in, (they not having of many days
received any Letters from Gritti) the Senate sent one speedily away to treat
the business with the King, and Luigi di Pietro, Secretary to the Council of
Ten, was chosen out to this purpose. He was enjoined first to endeavor
Gritti's liberty, if it were not already granted him: For the Senate had at the
same time chosen him for their Ambassador, authorizing him to confirm the
agreement, and to bind the Commonwealth by oath, to the observancy thereof*
but that if Gritti's setting at liberty should be too long delayed, that he
himself should act that part with the King: that he should leave nothing undone
to get Cremona and Giaradada to be restored to the Commonwealth: but that if he
should find no hope thereof, he should not notwithstanding delay settling the
agreement; provided that things agreed upon should imediately be put in effect,
and that the Kings men should forthwith come into Italy. For all the hopes of
Victory seemed to consist in making haste, and in the terror of a sudden War,
whilst the Enemies being but yet weak, might be easily suppressed. But before the
Secretary could get to the Court of France the Pope unexpectedly dyed,
notwithstanding which News, he was not sent for back, it being uncertain who
should be chosen next Pope, and no less uncertain how he would stand affected
to Venice; and howsoever the Senate thought the Friendship of so great a King
must be a great Establishment and Reputation to their Affairs. It was said that
a great affliction of mind was the chief cause of Pope Iulio's death; for being
very much subject to passion, and immoderately desirous of Glory, he could not
long lie under the grief, hearing his advice mightily blamed by all men: That
by his too much severity he had forced the Venetians to make Friendship with
the French, and was cause of re-kindling the War in Italy, which not long
before he had much to his Praise, extinguished. It was evidently seen by many
signs that Iulio was of a very eager Spirit, which neither his Age nor Dignity
was able to correct or temper. As soon as the Secretary was come to France the
King granted Gritti his full Liberty, and the League was suddenly concluded
upon these conditions.

That Cremona and Giaradada should be understood to be annexed to the State of
Millan, and to belong unto the King; but that Brescia, Burgamo, and Crema
should remain free to the Venetians, and that the King should quit all his
Claim or Right therein to them. That the Colleagues should be bound to assist
each other, and to run the same fortune in War, till such time as the King
should be Master of the whole State of Millan, and that likewise the
Commonwealth should be re-invested in all that she was possessed of in Terra
Firma before the War. That all Prisoners on either side should be set at
liberty and restored to their Goods and Country; and that free commerce might
be granted both in the State of Venice and in France. It was afterward added
that by joint consent they should use all diligence to draw any Prince of Italy
into the League, and particularly the Pope, who if he would enter thereinto
should be allotted the first place.

The League being thus concluded, and established by Oath on all sides, free
power to depart the Kingdom was permitted to Gritti, to Bartholomeo a' Alviano,
and to all the other Prisoners. Things being thus disposed of and confirmed,
the Senate thought it was fit to give an account thereof to the other
Kingdoms, and chiefly to the King of England, which by public order was done
by the Commonwealths Ambassador, then resident in that Court. Who said,

That the Venetians moved by the Counsels and friendly Advertisements of that
King, had the more readily accepted of Peace; that they had with patience
suffered many unjust offenses done by the Colleagues, to the end that by their
Friendship, some occasion migh be offered of co^ing to a fair agreement with
Caesar. But that now it was too apparently seen that his Affairs grew daily
w^rse and worse; and that the League being broken, not under the appearing name
of Peace, but with apparent Injury, he plotted against their Liberty. So as
being violenced by necessity, and not to abandon the welfare of the
Commonwealth, they had contracted Friendship with the French. That they called
God and man to witness the sincerity of their Souls and Counsels, and of the
present necessity. But they excused themselves handsomely to the King of Spain,
laying all the fault upon the late Pope; for that being long troubled, and
confused by his dubious and importune Counsels, and also often provokea by
Injuries, they were enforced to betake themselves to new Friendships, and to
better helps to preserve their Affairs, which were in danger of precipitation.
But howsoever they said they did not contemn the League which they had made
with that King, but that they desired to continue his Friendship.

This mean while John, Cardinal of Sancta Maria in Dominica, one of the House
of Medeci was chosen Pope by the universal consent of the Cardinals. All men
were overjoyed with this Election, but chiefly the Venetians, as those, who
had always been very kind and civil to the House of Medeci, which was at that
time received into the City, and put into the number of the noble Families, in
whom the power of choosing the Magistrates, and the Majesty of the Empire in the
Commonwealth of Venice lay. Wherefore the Senate hoped they might easily draw
the new Pope to join with them in League and Friendship. But Leo, as soon as he
was made Pope, had many high thoughts, revolved many things in his mind,
fitting his Counsels sometimes for War, sometimes for Peace. He was moved by
his ancient Customs, and by the Life which he had formerly led to embrace
quiet, chiefly now, when he found he was in such supreme Authority: He thought
it became him, who had always professed an Inclination to Learning, and to the
Love of the Liberal Sciences, to foment Peace and Concord, by which those
Studies are nourished, and do marvelously increase. Moreover he was to have
respect to his high Dignity, wherein he knew he had taken upon him a great
Charge, especially since he had raised so great an expectation of himself
amongst all men, as he was very vigilantly to think upon the common welfare and
safety; to the end that Italy and all other Nations who hoped to find some ease
to their long sufferings, by his Popedom, might enjoy peace and safety. To
these Considerations it was also added, that having often times tried
adversity, he ought to shun all occasions of putting himself into the hands of
Fortune. By experience of the late evils he did hate the name of War. But yet
he thought not peace safe, amidst such rumor of Wars and general Confusion. He
knew that men were naturally apt to grow insolent by successful victory, which
bore them headlong to satiate all their appetites. That therefore whosoever
should prove Conqueror was to be feared; that all Foreign Princes had so
great a desire to be Masters of Italy, as whosoever of them should be very
powerful, would endeavor to bereave all the weaker Princes of their States.
Nor was the memory of the last Pope a small means to incite Leo to War, finding
that by his Actions and diligence, the Church Territories were very much
increased both for Dominion and Reputation. But if he should resolve upon
taking up of Arms, he was in great dispute, with which party he should side. He
was much troubled to think of the returning of the French into Italy,
remembering the late private Injuries; and calling to mind the dangers of his
Predecessor Julius the second, and those wherewith he himself was likewise
threatened by the Pysan Council, which was removed to Lions, but not extinct;
he held the Power of the French to be very formidable. But on the other side,
the French being joined with the Venetians, did daily increase so much in Force
and Reputation, as no apparent means was seen how to make head against so great
a Power. He knew that the Cities in the State of Millan, being plundered
sometimes by their Enemies, sometimes by their Friends, were so exhausted, as
it was impossible to get any considerable sum of money from them to maintain
the War. And the Switzers, in whom all the hopes of safety seemed to remain,
were known not to be willing to undertake any thing which they might not
greatly gain by. And an opinion was had of them, that they had so given
themselves over unto Avarice, as not being withheld by any shame, they grew
often times so very greedy and so immoderate in their demands, as the Treasure of
a King was not able to satisfy them Nor saw he how he could lay any good
Foundation for his designs, upon help from the Spaniards, though their Actions
should be answerable to their words. Leo being thus full of various thoughts,
did often alter his opinion, and was not steadfast to any one resolution. In the
beginning of his Popedom he by his Briefs had exhortted all Christian Princes
to peace and union, and to bring them the more easily thereunto, he resolved so
to carry himself, as not to seem to incline to either party. Yet at the same
time, as if he had laid aside all hopes of agreement, he incited the Venetians
against the French, endeavoring to persuade them, that not only the
Commonwealth of Florence, would side with his Authority, but that the Switzers
would take up Arms, for the Liberty of Italy, and join in League with him and
the Duke of Millan. But the Venetians would not harken to this Advice, as well
for that they thought they ought not to forsake the certain League which they
had already made with the French out of any vain hopes; as also that looking
more inwardly into the truth of the business, they knew that those things which
at first sight did promise apparent liberty, did much increase the dangers, and
hasten the Slavery of Italy. For it is most certain, that the French had not so
regulated their designs by the Forces and favor of the Venetians, but that
they treated the same time concerning diverse things with Caesar, by whom they
were sure they might always be easily received, for he very much desired their
Friendship; neither did they think it was harder to agree with the King of
Spain for what concerned Italy, since they had already accomodated their most
important businesses with him, beyond the Mountains. Ferdinand who was a very
wily Prince, was already accustomed to abuse the French by his wary Courses,
and to reap the fruit of their Labors. Therefore the Venetians minded the Pope
that there was nothing more dangerous, then by too much trusting the Spaniards,
to put the whole Affairs of Italy into their hands; that they had condescended
that an Italian Duke should be Master of Millan, because they knew he was
rather to be a Prince in appearance than in effect, whereby they hoped they
might reduce that State upon the first occasion that should be offered, under
their Dominion. That therefore moved by the same Interests, they professed now
to defend Maximillian Sforza, that they might make use of the Millaneses and of
the Switzers, to drive the French out of Italy, whom they thought they ought
only to fear. That it might clearly be seen the Spaniards did no less aspire to
the Empire of Italy, then did the French; but whereas these made their way by
open Force, the others finding themselves to be too weak, sought to work their
ends by cunning and by cozenage, and did under a color of Friendship with the
Italians, undermine their Liberties. That therefore it was very advantageous to
suffer the Forces and Reputation of an other Foreign Prince to increase in
Italy, to obviate their Power, since that the Italians, who had been so long
afflicted with War, were not able of themselves to defend themselves against
Foreign Nations.

The Venetians did by these reasons make good their Counsels and Actions, but
whilst these things were in Treaty with the Pope, all sides made diligent
preparations for War. Nay Princes seemed to be the more set thereupon, for that
Leo by his various thoughts and promises, made many of them hope to be able to
maintain the War by his Help and Authority. But the Venetians were more
sollicitous in this business then the rest, as those who found themselves most
necessitated to continue the War; therefore they raised men diligently in all
parts to make up an Army. They solicited the King of France continually to
come speedily into Italy, showing him that the Victory consisted chiefly in
celerity. That if such Cities as were not yet provided of Garrisons should be
on the sudden assaulted, they might be easily reduced into their Power. But
that if the business were spun out in length, greater difficulties would daily
arise. King Lewis being moved by these Exhortations, bent himself wholly upon
this War: and being desirous to employ his whole Forces therein, he agreed with
Ferdinando to lay down Arms on the other side of the Mountains for a certain
time. This King was so carried away with a vain glorious desire of recovering
the State of Millan, as he valued neither fear nor infamy. So as not caring
what blame he might incur thereby, he by this suspension of Arms gave over
his Friends and Kinsmans Cause, the King of Navarr, who for having taken part
with the French, was a little before driven out of his Kingdom by the
Spaniards, and reduced to a miserable condition. And being likewise advertised
of great preparation for War made by Henry King of England, a powerful Prince,
to assault France, he contemned the Forces of that Kingdom, though they had often
times made the French feel them to their Cost. For having already in his mind
taken in the whole state of Millan, and taken the Victory for granted, he
thought he might bring back his victorious Army time enough to defend his own
Kingdom, before the English, divested of all Military Preparations by reason of
their long Peace, could provide all things necessary for so great an
Enterprise. All the Kings men me^ then according to Orders, in the City of
Susa, that they might the more easily pass from thence into Italy. Lewis Lord
of Tremuglia, a Personage very famous both for his Birth, and for many places
which he had discharged, was made chief Commander of the Army. Yet the War was
for the most part governed according to the pleasure of Giovanni Giacomo
Trivulcio, who was at that time in great estimation for his great experience in
Military Affairs. 'Twas said that the French Army consisted of about 20000
fighting men; (...) mustered 8000 choice Italian Foot, to which were added 200
C^rassiers, and 500 light Horse, and a great Train of Artillery, which did much
strengthen the Army. Two noble Venetians, Domenico Contareno, and Andrea
Loredano were the Commissaries general, whose particular care it is to provide
Victuals, Moneys, and all things requisite for the Army, and then to be
assistant in their Advice to the Captain General in all difficult businesses;
for the Venetians do themselves execute all the places of the Militia by Sea,
but in Terra firma, by their ancient wont, and the Custom of their
Forefathers, they manage their War by Foreigners. At this time Bartholomeo
Alviano was Captain General of the Venetian Army, who being lately returned
from France, and Count Pitigliano being dead, was chosen by the Senate to
succeed in his place, with the same Conditions, which were granted formerly to
Pitigliano. His yearly pay was 50000 Ducats, and he was bound to keep still on
foot 300 Curassiers, and 500 Cross-bow men on Horseback, to be ready upon any
occasion to serve the Commonwealth. This man when his place was conferred upon
him, went to the Army, which was then upon the Banks of Adice, and thinking it
fit to be speedy in the business, began forthwith to exhort the Senate that he
might anticipate the time, and that they would suffer him to march with his
Army into the state of Millan, whilst the Enemy were unprovided of aid, and the
Cities ungarrison'd. That all other attempts would be in vain, or to very
little purpose: that it was requisite that the Venetians should run the same
fortune as did the French in (...) War. That if Affairs should go well with
them, it was no question but they were to share in the good Fortune; but if
otherwise, they had no hope, neither of getting any thing, nor yet of keeping
any thing that they had lately re-gained. But the Senate after they had well
and narrowly examined the business, resolved that the Army should not pass the
Rivers of Po and Ada; for what remained they left the whole managing of the War
free to Alviano, with leave to direct his Forces and Designs, whither he should
be invited by the negligence of the Enemy, or advised by his own Industry and
Reason. There was not as yet any certain News come that the French were past
the Alps; therefore the Senate thought it a rash Counsel to leave their
Country exposed to the Injuries of the Enemy, and to send their Army to a
place, from whence, in any case of adverse fortune, they could not return. But
Alviano, being very fervent in all he took in hand, and very quick and bold,
thinking that the occasion and the present condition of Affairs invited him so
to do, resolved to advance immediately with his Army, and took his way first
toward Verona, hoping to get that City. Pandolfo Malatesta was taken into pay
by Caesar at this time, and made Governor of one of the Towers, who allured by
greater rewards, had sided with the Enemy when Affairs went ill with the
Commonwealth. This man had agreed with some Citizens who stood well affected
to the Venetians, to let in Alviano by St. George his Gate, as soon as he
should be come unto the walls of the City. But the Conspiracy being discovered,
and Alviano knowing that the Town could not be easily stormed, as also that
though he should take the Town, he must spend much time in taking in the
Towers, he thought it better to hasten toward Cremona, and in his March
thither took the Town of Vallegio, and the Castle of Peschiera; places for
their situation very fit and convenient for the State of Venice. He gave the
change of Vallegio to Zacharia Ghisi, and that of Peschiera to Luigi Bembo, and
gave 200 Soldiers a piece to each of them. The News of the Venetian Armies
approach being come to Cremona, those of the Town who were of the contrary
Faction, soon left the City, and the rest who were of the Province of Marcha,
received Alviano and all his men readily into the City, who were allowed to
plunder a thousand Spanish Foot, and 200 Curassiers, who had the custody or the
City; the Commanders not suffering any prejudice to be done to the Citizens,
and keeping the Soldiers from plunder. As soon as Alviano was entered within
the Walls, he soon made himself Master of the whole City; for the Castle
whereinto the Venetians had formerly put a Garrison, who had sent a supply by
Renzo de Ceri, held still for the French.

Alviano displaying the French Colors upon the Walls, let the City know that
he received it in the Name of Lewis King of France, for whom Theador de
Triulcio, who was then his Legate in the Venetian Army, did take it. He
afterward endeavored to free the Commonwealth from any b^ame, if having
tried all things in vain she were forced to accommodate ^er self to the Times,
and yield up so rich a City, and one which she did so dearly love, to another.
He moreover exhorted the City to keep their Loyalty to so puissant and
bountiful a King* under whose Government, if they would be honest and faithful
men, they might promise themselves to live for ever after safe, and free from
many grievances: for which they were obliged to the Venetians, who had procured
them that good which they could never have hoped for from the afflicted Fortune
of a petty Duke.

These things being so happily and so speedily done, won great Reputation to
the Venetian Army; in so much as Soncino, Lodi, and other Towns of Giaradada,
following the Example of Cremona, surrendered themselves to Alviano. But the
Venetians fared otherwise in the Territories of Verona and Vicenza: For after
Alviano was gone with his Army, and had left small Garrisons in the Cities and
Towns which held for them, and that Sigismonde di Cavalli Commissary General of
the Venetian Militia stayed behind with some few men at St. Bonefaccio; the
Germans, who kept Verona being advertised thereof, sallied out of the City with
2000 Foot and 500 Horse, and unexpectedly assault the Commissary. Our men, who
for the most part were rude and unexperienced, troubled at the sudden assault,
betook themselves to their heels, and those few which stayed and would stand the
Enemy, being forsaken by their Companions, fell into their power, and amongst
those Costanzo Pio, a man famous for Birth and Worth. The Commissary Cavalli
seeing all his men routed, and chiefly the Alban Horse, wherein he had placed
his chiefest hope, began likewise to run, and with him Giovanni Forte, a
Captain of Curassiers, and a Tro^p of Horse which had tarryed with him;
wherewith they got to Cologna; but were so hotly purs^^d by the Enemy, as being
hardly entered the Town, and not having any the least time to take a better
Garrison into the Town, or to put the men who were there in a posture of
defense, they understood that the Enemy were come, and were about the Walls:
The Town being therefore strongly assaulted, and but slenderly defended, was
stormed and sacked. Cavalli, and Vector Malipiero, Mayor of the Town, together
with some others of quality, knowing that they were not safe in the Castle
whereinto they were retired, yielded themselves up to the Enemy, and were by
them taken Prisoners. The Dutch men loaded with prey, and not having received
any harm returned back to Verona, the Enemies grown insolent by their
successes, began to promise themselves greater prosperity; and thus going forth
of the City with 4000 Foot and 500 Horse, they marched toward Vicenza; which
coming to the knowledge of Giovan Paolo Manfrone, who had the keeping of that
City, he took in many Country men to a Band of Soldiers which he had with
him, and provided for any accident that might happen.

But the Dutchmen overrunning the Territories of Vicenza, ruined all things
with sword, fire, and rapine; and being come to the Town of Arzignano, after
having taken it, they committed great slaughter amongst the Townsmen, set fire
on the Castle, and on other Buildings, and dispairing of ever getting the Town
of Vicenza, they returned safe to Verona. Whilst Affairs went on thus in these
parts, tumults did daily increase, and disorders grow greater in the state of
Millan; nothing there was safe or quiet. There was neither City nor Castle,
which either could, or endeavored to resist the Enemy: for the people of
Millan, and the other Towns thereabout, being moved again by the approaching of
the Venetian Army, and by the French men's passing over the Alps, began to
waver in their Loyalty. The people wearied but a little before with the
Government of the French, did very much desire the return of the Sforzas, their
ancient Lords and Masters: But finding afterward that they had not got that
Liberty nor Immunity which they expected (for Maximillian their new Duke, being
but a weak Prince, was forced to burden the State with many impositions, and
being jealous of many, was necessitated to injure many for the better securing
of his Dominion) changing their minds, as is common with the vulgar people to
do, were desirous of Novelties: thinking that for the future they should be in
better condition, and under more just Laws, if the State should return again to
be governed by the French. Many also who hated idleness and quiet; some who
were poor and banished, and other moved by the diversity of Factions, favored
the French. Therefore Count Mausocco, son to Giovan Giacopo Trivulsio being
gone with a Troop into sundry places to make the people rise, finding them
ready thereunto, did easily work his ends. Moreover Sacramoro Viscount, who had
the Charge of besieging the Castle of Millan, forsaking the Sforzas as soon as
he saw them forsaken by Fortune, wheeled about with her, and suffering the
besieged to be relieved both with men and victuals, discovered himself so far
an Enemy to Duke Maximillian, as it was now said abroad that he did not only
plot against his State, but against his life. Maximillian being therefore
greatly troubled, seeing his Affairs in so bad a posture, and seeking to
provide for his own safety, retired with some few Horse into Navar, to try the
utmost of his Fortune. For he understood that some Troops of the Switzers were
already got thither, expecting to be followed by many others of their Nation,
who came in much greater numbers to defend that State. Wherefore the
Millaneses, seeing their City bereft both of Commander and Soldiers, that
their Castle which was well garrisoned, was in the hands of the French, and
that the Enemies Army drew near, some allured by hopes of better Fortune,
others moved by fear, thought it best to put themselves willingly into the
power of the French, and to this purpose to send Ambassadors to the General of
the Venetians Army, who having already made a Bridge over the Ada, threatened to
bring his Army before the Town. This mean while the French, with whom was
Andrea Gritti, as Ambassador from Venice, assaulted Italy, took many Cities
and Castles, some by slight skirmishes, some without any withstanding. Thus the
state of Millan, straightened at one and the same time by the French and the
Venetian Armies, fell in a short time into the French men's hands. Two only
Cities, Navar and Como held still for Maximillian. The Venetians heightning
their hopes by these prosperous successes, promised unto themselves a happy end
of all the War. Their Army was grown into such Reputation, after the getting of
Cremona, as Renzo da Ceri being ordered by Alviano to go with a Band of
Soldiers to recover Brescia, the City yielded as soon as he came before it.
For the Spaniards who had the Guard thereof, when they heard of his approach,
withdrew themselves into the Castle. There was but one thing which appeared
might hinder the conceived hopes of Victory, which was, that it was said, the
Switzers had so zealously undertaken to protect Duke Maximillian, as it was
thought they would prefer his honor, before whatsoever other thing. Their
Nation was then in very great esteem, out of the opinion which was had of their
excellent Discipline in War. Wherefore they were much celebrated and feared by
all people. So as blown up with Pride for having once had good success in their
attempts, chiefly because the French Forces were once worsted by their means,
and Duke Maximillian restored to his state, aspiring yet to greater Glory, they
did totally despise the French Nation, which they had once overcome. Their
haughty minds could not endure to be despised and under-valued by King Lewis,
who when there was a treaty of renewing the League with them, seemed more
desirous of some little advancement of Moneys, than of their Friendship;
whereupon the business remained undecided. These men said that they had always
highly esteemed the King of F^ance his Friendship, that they had toyled very
much in several Wars to the end that he might by them receive Glory, that
having by their egregious actions deserved much better salary then they
demanded, they could not receive such reasonable reward from that ungrateful
King, as they by their service and hazard had won. King Lewis repenting this
his advice, sent his Ambassadors to their Dyets to accord those differences,
who though they had endeavored to please some of the best amongst them with
presents and promises, yet could they not get them to receive the King into
their Friendship. It Is thought that the hopes of great Reward, and an Opinion
of vain Glory did incite the multitude to fight against the King of France
since they saw their Friends and Companions rich, and returned with Conquest
from the late Wars of Italy. The Popes authority and exhortations were added to
these things; for Iulio was wont mightily to magnify the Helvetians, whom he
had honored with the glorious title of DEFENDERS of the ECCLESIASTICAL
LIBERTY: and Leo did continually, though underhand, solicit them to take upon
them the defense of the state of Millan. Besides he had sent them a certain
sum of Money, by Morone, Maximillian's Ambassador, under pretense that it
was due unto them for service done in the other Popes time.

And since the recent Memory of the glorious Actions done by that Nation
invites me thereunto, I have thought it greatly suiting with the business which
I am now in hand with, to say something of their Customs and Discipline.

The Switzers are a Nation of Rusticks, far from any neatness or civil
breeding, but very desirous of War, and for strength of body, beyond all the
Nations of Europe. They inhabit those high Hills which bound France on the West
side, and on the East and North Confine upon Germany. Therefore as formerly
this Country was held a part of Gallia Belgica, so now it is placed as a
member thereof, within the Confines of Germany. The Inhabitants suffer much in
the scarcity of all things, by reason of the Countries barrenness; the which
they use to remedy, not by cultevating the ground, or by marchandizing, as
other people for the most part do, but by the pay which they get in the Wars:
They think that curious and delicate living makes men effeminate, therefore
despising Learning and all civil Adornments, they spend their lives in
continual sweat and labor. So as being naturally strong of body, and
accustoming themselves to hunger, watching, cold, and thirst, they do so
strengthen themselves, as they can easily undergo the hardest things. As soon
as their years will suffer them to bear Arms, they leave their own homes, put
themselves into other Princes pay, and learn all Military Affairs in Armies.
Hence is it, that strength of body, and experience in War, makes these fiercely
minded men, so daring, as they dread not any Enemy; nor is there any
Enterprise so hard or difficult, which they do not willingly undertake; whereby
they have won singular praise for matter of War, amongst all Nations: and their
Discipline is chiefly esteemed in pitched fields, when people fight with Banners
flying. For they so order their Squadrons, as they stand fast and firm, and
bear any shock of the Enemy without any disorder. But this their great Industry
is marred and corrupted by many bad Customs, so as they deserve not that
praise which is due to true Worth. For they esteem nothing a fault in War, but
to fear the Enemy, and think it not a fault for able valiant men, to take
Liberty in committing other faults, so as the Soul being sick and weak in what
concerns true Honor, suffers her self the more easily to be contaminated. They
have often therefore been observed to despise Loyalty, to refuse obedience even
to modest Commands, and to measure all things according to their own Interests,
more then according to Honesty. They have Liberty in great esteem, and
veneration, and profess the maintaining thereof more than any other Nation
does. Wherewith being contented, and secured by their cragged situation, they
go out of their Confines, not with any intention of enlarging them, but to
fight for other men's Power and Glory. So they exercise the Militia rather for
profit and private praise, then to acquire Empire and public Dignity. They are
divided into many Communalties, which they call Cantons; and order their
Affairs after a form of civil Government, according to the Rules of a popular
State. Every Canton has its particular Laws, and have peculiar Magistrates to
do them Justice. But when they treat of most important business, which
appertain either to War, or Peace, they all convene in a common Council, which
according to occasion is appointed in several places The way to public
Employments is open to all, for valiant Actions are those which are only
esteemed as ornament and greatness in this Nation, which knows no other Riches
or Nobility then what is placed in Military Valor. Finally their whole Life is
nothing but Warfare, whereby they have won such Reputation with all other
Nations, as great provisions are paid in unto them, both in public and in
private, by the most potent Kings of Europe. And Ambassadors are sent to them
from all parts, to seek League and Friendship with them. But the Switzers
seemed to love the Venetians above all others, only for the name of Liberty
which is so acceptable to them. Therefore our Commonwealth, to honor them the
more, was wont to call them not only Friends, but Cousins, and has often made
use of their Friendship, particularly at that time when by their assistance
they drove the French out of Italy.

Therefore the Venetian Senate relying much upon the Switzers, chose Pietro
Stella, Secretary of the Consiglio di Pregadi, and sent him to them in the
Commonwealths name, to endeavor the taking of them off from the League which
they had made with their Enemies, and to reduce them to Friendship with the
French. But when the Secretary was come to Zurick, and began to acquaint them
with his Embassy, the fierce multitude, highly incensed against the King of
France, could not only not be persuaded so to do, but scandalized with the
motion, suffered themselves to be so carried away with an uncurb'd fury, as
violating the Laws of Nations, they used violence upon the Venetian Secretary,
who with much ado and by means of some of the chiefest, and wisest amongst
them, escaped the danger, and by order from the Magistrates was secured in his
own house. The Council being then called hereupon, war against the French, was
with such joint consent and such fervor resolved upon, as most upon receiving
very little pay, and many without any pay at all, made themselves be listed in
the Militia, and having in a short time made up a numerous Army, they began to
fall down by Squadrons into the Dukedom of Millan. When the French Commanders
heard that they were come, they were much troubled, remembering their gallant
late actions; but considering that they had neither Horse, Victuals, Artillery,
nor any other thing fit for an Enterprise, they thought they were not to fear
such Enemies as came without any warlike Preparations, rather to pillage than
to fight. So as they thought that being dissipated by their own necessities,
they would return home without doing any thing, as they had sometime formerly
done. Therefore the French not valuing this the Enemies succor, left the City
of Alexandria well garrisoned, where they had made their first stay, and
marched with their Army toward Novara, they intended first to try the Switzers
with gifts and promises, and see whether they could sooner overcome them with
Gold, then with the Sword; hoping that they might easily bribe them to deliver
up Duke Maximillian into their hands, following therein the example of their
own Contrymen, who had violated their Faith some few years before to his
Father Lodowick, in the same place: Which though it should not succeed, thought
the taking of that Town would prove no hard business, wherewith they hoped the
War would be ended. But this advice was even then blamed by men of great
Experience and Fame in Military Affairs, who said the French did not manage the
War well, who having already reduced almost all the Cities and Castles in the
Sforza's possession, had bent all their Forces upon the taking of Novara, where
they would find employment for a good while; when to have done well they should
have marched forward with their whole Army to encounter the Spaniards, whom
when they should have overcome, and driven out of the State of Millan, it might
be hoped that the Switzers seeing themselves deceived in their hopes from the
Spaniards, would take some other course, now that they were not far from their
own homes. Therefore Gritti had often times exhorted the French Commanders to
mind chiefly the beating of the Spanish Army, whereon the Enemies chief refuge
did seem then to depend, and the maintaining of the War. And the Venetian
Senate, thinking that the Enterprise should be handled thus, had given order to
their General, and to their Commissaries, to make a Bridge over the Ada, giving
out that they would suddenly pass their men over to meet with the French, to
the end that the Spaniards frightened thereat, should not only forbear sending
succor to the Switzers, but might be enforced to think of their own safety,
and retire into the Kingdom of Naples. The Viceroys mind was various and
uncertain, and his way uncertain; for being gotten but a little from the River
Tre^bia, he returned the next day to the same place, and quartered his Camp
there, which made all men grow jealous of him, it not being evidently seen
whether he meant to retreat, and abandon the Switzers, or by seeming to do so,
to assault the Venetian Army at unawars: But seeing that he kept the same
Quarters a good while, every one believed that he stayed expecting the event of
things, and accordingly to govern himself, either in continuing Peace with the
Venetians, or in making open War against them. Therefore the Venetian Senate
carrying themselves in all their resolves, according to the variousness of his
Designs, ordered Alviano, that if the Spanish Army should pass over the River
Poe, to join with the Switzers, who marched toward Novara, that he should
advance with all his Forces to free that City from being besieged, and to give
credit and assistance to the French Affairs. But that if they should pass the
Poe on the lower side, and that he did conceive they meant to come upon the
Territories of Verona, to join with the other Enemies of the Commonwealth;
that then he should keep his men in such a place as he might be ready to assist
wheresoever need should require. Alviano therefore halted with his Army in the
Territories of Cremona, that he might turn any whither according to the
Proceedings of the Enemy. This mean while the French had in vain made many
assaults upon Novara, which was stoutly defended by the Switzers, and now
dispairing to take it by force, they were in a great strait; for they had
certain Intelligence that the Defendants did daily expect great succors:
Wherefore the undertaking grew more difficult; they thought that if they should
give it over and retreat, the honor of their Army would be much lessened, and
the Enemy would be thereby much inheartned; and if they should tarry longer in
the same Quarters, they saw it would be to no purpose, and not without danger.
Some of the Commanders were of opinion that the Army should remove from those
Marish Grounds, and march into open Campagnia, where the Chivalry, wherein
their chiefest hopes lay, might show their Worth. That therefore they should go
to encounter the Enemy, and set upon them on their way, whom they might easily
overcome, since they were unfurnished of all warlike Preparation. But
Trivulsio's opinion prevailed, whose experience Fortune began already to mock.
He said they were not to hazard themselves upon the uncertain Event of a
Battle, wherefore they withdrew two miles further from the City, and encamped
themselves near the River Mora, to the end that lying in a safer place they
might keep the Enemy from Victuals, and by this means enforce them to
surrender. When the French had altered their Quarters, the Switzers not seeing
the Enemy appear any where, entered safely into the City of Novara, and were
exceeding joyfully received by the besieged; and without taking any manner of
repose, they called a Council of War, and began to consult how they were to
carry on the War, and suddenly it was resolved with a general consent, that
they would assault the Enemies Camp the next night.

They were so inflamed with a desire of Glory, as they despised the worth of
all other Nations, which heat of theirs was made the greater by the
exhortations of some of the Commanders, who labored to persuade the multitude,

That Affairs would grow worse by delay, that dangers did daily increase, and
that therewithal Glory would decrease. For they knew that some other of their
own Companies would shortly come in to their succor; which, in case that they
should get the Victory, would usurp the greatest part thereof: And that
notwithstanding, after such an assistance, their condition would be impared, if
they knew not how to make use of the present occasion of fighting, which was
offered them. For that there was certain News come that both many Foot and
Horse were come into the City of Alexandria, sent by the King of France to join
with his Army; which if they should be s^ffer'd to join with the rest of the
Enemies Forces, Maximillian's Affairs, and the defense of that City would be
reduced to great difficulties. That therefore a short delay might produce great
difficulties, and spoil a fair advantage. That they were to make use of the
opportunity of place, and time which was offered them, whilst they had means so
to do. That they had then great commodiousness to order their Army in the open
Campagnia, and to assault the Enemy, who were not encamped in any strong
situation, nor had yet time to fortify themselves by Art, or by their
Soldiers labors; so as those little works wherein the Enemy were, would
rather prove a hinderance, then an advantage to them. But that above all things
nothing made so well for them, and so ill for the Enemy, as the obscurity of
the night, for then they could make no use of their Guns, wherein they placed
their hopes of Victory, more th^n in their own courage: Moreover they came with
resolution and minds prepared to fight, whereas they should find the Enemy half
asleep, astonished at the Novelty and unexpected Assault, expecting nothing
less at such a season, then battle. That they should not fear the smallness of
their numbers, nor for that lose any of their ancient Courage, since the Enemy,
though they exceeded them in the multitude of men, were not to be compared to
them for Valor. That if they should put this off till another time, there was
no hopes hereafter of Battle, whereof the Enemy would be very far from giving
any occasion, at they who having opportunity by time to fortify their Camp,
and being sure to keep the City from Victuals, hoped to get the Victory with
less hazard. That gallant men might be thus endangered by base people, when
they should suffer themselves to be reduced to such necessity, as they must
either fight upon much disadvantage, or else being tired out with want and
molestation, fall at last into the Enemies hands. That it better became their
Generosity to run the same hazard of life by making Trial of their Valor, then
by suffering the Inconveniences of a Siege. That it was greatness of Spirit,
not wariness which was the true Ornament of Soldiers.

These warlike men being wholly set on fire by these speeches, they all with
loud voice desired to be led on to the Enemy. And feeding themselves with the
desire of Glory, and hopes of Victory, were not overcome by the weariness of
the way. The Commanders praising their Courage and Resolution, dismissed them,
ordering them to be in readiness with their Arms, against the sign should be
given. The French having been in Arms all that day, and part of the night, and
being told by their Scouts, that all was quiet in Novara, had betaken
themselves to their rest; and this being the first night after the raising of
their Army, they lay scattered and confutedly amongst their Baggage. The better
half of the night being past over in silence, 10000 Switzers sallied ou^ of the
Town, and having divided themselves into three bodies, marched speedily strait
toward the Enemy, and proceeded in such order, as the farther they advanced,
the farther did the Army spread abroad. The greatest Squadron was ordered to
assault the Enemies Camp on the Front, and to begin the Battle: The other two,
when they should be come to the Flanks of the Camp, were to tarry there, and
keep the French Horse from succouring the Foot. The Switzers began now to march
with displayed Banners against the Enemy, who being advertised of their coming
by their Scouts, had but very little time allowed them to stand to their Arms,
and put themselves in order; for being startled out of their sleep, and the
Commanders being no less abashed at the first with the Novelty, then the rest,
they were much terrified, not knowing well what to do; yet soon after,
gathering such Troops together as the suddenness of the accident would permit,
they began to give order for such things as were most necessary; and the
Soldiers following their Commanders Orders stood to their Arms, and got to
their Colors as well as they could. Trivulcio kept in the midst of the Battle,
Monsieur de Tremuglia took care of the right Flank, and Ruberto Sedanio
commanded the left: They all of them exhorted their men the best they could
valiantly to withstand the Enemy, affirming they had no reason to fear them,
who were weary and tired with their Journey, whilst they themselves were fresh
and lusty. They showed them how much superior they were to the Enemy both for
advantage of Place and numbers of men; that they wanted nothing to obtain the
Victory, if they were not wanting unto themselves in boldness and Courage.

The first thing the French did, was forthwith to order their Artillery against
the Enemy, whereby to retard the Violence of the Assaulters. But the Switzers,
though many of them were slain by the Cannon, keeping their Orders, advanced,
and bending toward the right hand, they won the Ditch, which did inviron the
French Camp, and addressed themselves against the Enemies middle Squadron, which
consisted of Dutch Foot, and wherein their chiefest strength lay. Thus a cruel
Battle was begun, all sides fighting with no less hatred then Courage: For
these two Nations, as they use almost one and the same Discipline in War, so
being Rivals in Glory, they strive for Precedence in Military Valor. The Dutch
were not to be made forsake their Station, and the Switzers were very loath to
depart without Victory. The Issue of the Battle was therefore a long while
doubtful; but the other two Squadrons of the Switzers, which were sent on the
Flanks of the French Camp, being safely got near the Enemy by by-ways, whereby
they escaped the danger of the Cannon; and seeing that the Horse did not move
to succor their Foot, they put on another Resolution; the one of them
assaulted the Camp in the Rear, where the Soldiers that were on that Guard
being slain, and run away, it turned suddenly to pillage the baggage; the other
moving with great violence against the French and Navarese Foot, who guarded
the Artillery, and making them run, advanced to succor their own men, who were
fighting with the Dutch; and coming very opportunely, fresh and entire upon the
Enemy who were wearied, and weakened with fighting, put them into great
disorder. This mean while it was noised, that the Switzers were entered the
Camp, and were pillaging the Baggage; which as soon as the French Horse heard,
who till then had stood still, neither spur of Honor, nor fear of Infamy,
being of Power enough to make them enter the Battle, they suddenly ran behind
the Camp, to recover the prey from the Enemy. Therefore the Dutch being
assaulted on all sides, and forsaken by their Friends, were at last forced to
yield. The Commanders and all the rest seeing all hopes of Victory lost, fled,
and provided as well as they could, for their own safeties. The French Horse,
as if they had quite laid aside their ancient Discipline, did nothing that day
worthy praise. There are some notwithstanding that say, that being placed in an
ill Quarter, because there was a great Fen between them and the Enemy, they
were so hindered as they could not get out of the Camp, nor put themselves into
the Battle. This was the Battle of Novara, which I thought I could not pass
over with silence, as well for the weight of the business it self, as likewise
for the great Calamities which by reason thereof befell the Venetians. Great
alteration of Affairs arose suddenly in Italy from this adverse Fortune of the
French; and especially of those wherein the Venetians were concerned; For
though the greatest part of the French Army, and chiefly the Chivalry, was got
safe into the City of Alexandria, the Enemy wanting Horse to pursue the
Victory, yet the French, parting soon from thence, retreated to Piemonte, using
no less diligence to return into France, then they had done to come for Italy.
But Gritti, who being then in the French Camp, accompanied them in this their
fight, was not wanting in exhorting them not to be dis-heartned so soon at
Fortunes first blow. He put them in mind, that by this their immoderate fear
they would beget an opinion in men, that what had befallen them by chance, and
through the obscurity of the night, proceeded from the Enemies Gallantry, or
else from their Cowardice, and that so they would make that their own fault
which was the fault of Fortune. That by this base flight the King of France
would suffer in his Honor, and the Fame of that Nation, glorious for so many
Victories would be obscured. Trivulcio and the other Commanders used the like
Persuasions; and it fell out very opportunely, that in their retreat they met
with some Foot Companies, and some Troops of Horse which the King had formerly
sent to recrute his Army into Italy. But nothing was sufficient to make them
stop; they despised their Commanders exhortations and commands, all Military
Honor, and whatsoever else, suffering themselves only to be guided by their
own Wills. Therefore Gritti seeing the French Army wholly defeated, and knowing
he could be no longer serviceable there for his Commonwealth, returned by
Savona to Gen^a, and from thence took his way toward Luca, and at last after
much ado, and having ran many hazards, got safe to Venice, from whence he had
been four years absent. After this Victory, Maximillian Sforza, who being but a
little before neglected by all his own men, was not in any good condition, did
hereby get such Reputation, as the peoples minds altering together with
Fortune, Ambassadors flock apace to him from all his Cities to return under
his Obedience; and the Millaneses by a solemn Embassy of the chiefest of their
City, did strive most of all to obtain his favor and pardon, excusing their
Rebellion, and showing themselves willing to do whatsoever he should command
them. The Cities were received into favor, upon condition that they should pay
a certain sum of money to the Switzers, that so they might reap the fruit of
the Victory which was got by their labor and hazard.

The Viceroy this mean while, who keeping his Spaniards within their Quarters
upon the River Trebia even till this day, which was the thirteenth of June, had
not discovered himself to be Enemy neither to the French nor Venetians;
following the Fortune of the Conquerors, past over the Poe, and marched toward
the Territories of Cremona to assault the Venetian Camp, which he knew was
there: Which when Alviano understood, and finding that the people began to
tumultuate in all parts, and that being already begun to be Enemies as well to
the Venetians as to the French, they prepared to take up Arms in Maximillians
behalf, he thought it became him to hasten out of those Confines, and to draw
his Army safe out of so many difficulties. The Senate hearing the bad News of
the rout of the French, had ordered their General, and Commissaries to retreat
with their Camp to Valeggio, to defend their Confines; but that they should
proceed in such manner, as their Retreat might not seem a running away, whereby
their Friends might grow fearful, and their Enemies be imboldned. Yet Alviano
putting on such resolves as became him to do upon such an accident; seeing his
Affairs grew daily worse and worse, withdrew hastily with his Army to the
Territories of Verona. But Cremona having none to defend her, when he was gone,
fell quickly into the Spaniards hands, which was sacked for having received the
Venetian Army within her Walls. Thus the Viceroy, seeing that other men's
dangers had opened a safe way unto his Counsels, resolved to make use of the
Occasion, and to fall at the same time upon diverse Enterprises. He sent
Prospero Colonna with 3000 Foot, and 300 Horse toward Novara to recrute
Maximillian with fresh men, if he needed them. He ordered Francisco Hernando
Marquess of Pescara to march with a good Band of men toward Genoa, willing him
to make what haste he could, to the end that he might assault the City at
unawares, and drive Adorno out of it, who was newly made Duke, and who was of
the French Faction, and to put Ottaviano Fregoso into his former place, and use
all means possible to reduce that City to Ferdinan^s devotion; which things
were performed very boldly and luckily by the Marquess. The Viceroy passing
with the rest of his Army first over the Poe, and then over the Ada, entered the
Venetians Confines, and took Brescia and Bergamo almost without any
gainsaying, together with many Castles in those Territories wherein were left
either no Garrisons at all, or but very weak ones. These towns were received in
Caesar's Name, and according to the abilities of each of them, had great Fines
set upon them, which being severely raised, were distributed amongst the
Spanish Army. Alviano being very much grieved to see himself bereft of that
Glory, whereunto he had with great hopes aspired, but not any whit lessening
his desires, and resolving howsoever to make some gallant Attempt, did without
difficulty take the town of Liguago as soon as he came into the Territories of
Verona, and leaving Giovan Paolo Baglione with 2000 Foot and a good Troop of
Horse to take in the Castle, he marched apace with the rest of his Army to
Verona, to endeavor the taking of that City by an unexpected Assault. Baglione
applied himself diligently to the taking in of the Castle, and having beaten
down part of the Wall near the Gate with his Artillery, took it after it had
been long and valiantly defended by the Spaniards. Whereby he according to his
deserts received thanks by public Order from the Senate. But soon after
finding that the town could not be made safe in any convenient time, and that
when it should be so, it would require a strong Garrison to keep it, they
advised the General and Commissaries, that taking out the Artillery and
Victuals, and burning, or throwing the other things into the River, which they
could not easily carry away, whereby the Enemy might be deprived thereof, they
should quit it, slighting the Castle and the Walls; which was immediately done.
This mean while, Alviano, being of a ready and sharp wit, coming with
miraculous speed so before the City of Verona, placed his whole Army on that
side which appeared to be weakest, and having by frequent shot of cannon thrown
down a good part of the Walls, and thereby made way for an Assault, he made all
his light Horse advance, and followed in very good order with the rest of his
men, that his Army might seem the greater, and more terrible. Then choosing out
3000 of the most valiant, he divided them into three Squadrons, so as they
might undergo the labor and peril by turns, and might according to occasion
assist one another. With these he gave the first Assault so fiercely, as those
who were within upon the Guard of the Wall being frighted, our Soldiers scaled
the ruined Walls; but the Wall was so high, though in part battered, as kept
them from descending into the City. So as being forced to stay there, many were
slain by Musket Shot, and the rest endeavoring often to advance, met with
greater difficulties. For the Dutch Foot running from all parts to the place of
greatest danger, threatened to receive such as should dare to descend, upon
their Pikes point. Wherefore Alviano seeing the difficulty of entering the city
hourly to increase, and that those who sided with the Commonwealth, did not
rise within the Town in his behalf, as he hoped they would have done;
dispairing to do any good in this Enterprise, he thought it best to give it
over, fearing lest his Army might receive more prejudice, having lost 50 men in
this Assault, amongst which Tomaso Fabrone a very valiant Gentleman, and a
Captain of a Foot Company. Thus with incredible speed he took away his
Artillery the same day that he had begun the Battery, and given the Assault;
and came with his whole camp to the Tomba; where thinking himself more safe, he
put on new Resolutions, hoping to effect his design by another way of Warfare.
He blocked up all passages by which any Victuals might be brought to the City,
and then began to waste and consume the Territories round about just when the
corn was ripe in the fields, hoping that by this means the Citizens and
Soldiers might be brought to yield, the one to preserve their Incomes, and the
others to shun the Inconveniences of a Seidg. The Senate had published an Edict
a little before, that if the City of Verona would willingly of her self return
under the Dominion of the Commonwealth, all those who had been of the contrary
Faction, should be pardoned; and those who were well affectioned to the
Venetians should be largely rewarded. Yet were it either that the Citizens
minds were alienated from the Commonwealth, or rather that keeping the same
affection still toward her, they were forced by fear to conceal it, no
commotion at all was seen in the City, nor was there any sign of surrender
shown. Whilst these things were done by way of War, endeavors of Peace were
not wholly laid aside. Leo, as he had formerly often times exhorted the
Venetians to Peace, so did he now the more solicit them thereunto, hoping the
better to compass his desire, for that he thought the Venetians being
prosecuted by so many ill Fortunes, might be now somewhat more humbled, and
better disposed to listen after Peace: And that on the other side Caesar being
wearied with the length of War, might be no less desirous to have things
accommodated in Italy; chiefly at this time, when he had undertaken other Wars,
to make use of the occasion which was offered of recovering Bretagny to his
Nephew Charles by Arms, and by the asistance of the Switzers; who to revenge
their own particular Injuries, prepared to assault that State, at such time as
France being molested with sore Wars by the English was less able to defend it.
Yet there were some that imagined these the Colleagues endeavors for Peace with
the Venetians, proceeded only out of a desire to make our State less careful in
providing for War; which suspicion appeared the more rational, for that their
Actions did not correspond with their words. The Pope sent Gentile Santesio to
Venice, to treat of Peace, which the King of Spain sought also to procure, and
yet inclining sometimes to favor Caesar, sometimes the Venetians, his
Proceedings were so various, as it was not easy to discern whether it were
Peace or War that he desired. Ferdinando was so ambitious of Glory, as he would
not have any thing thought to be agitated by any Prince which was not done by
his Council and Authority. Wherefore it was that at the same time, and by the
same means he endeavored contrary things. The Count di Caretto who was gone a
little before this time from Venice, to the Viceroys Camp, his Secretary who
stayed at Venice to dispatch such things as should occur, was present at the
treaty of Peace which was negotiated by Santesio, and did by Order from him
interpose the Kings Authority therein. But this business which had been so
often in treaty, had no better success now then it had at other times. For the
Venetian Senate being disposed alike in all Fortunes, and not yielding any
thing to the present calamities, resolved not to accommodate their counsels to
their Enemies desires, but to do in what concerned either Peace or War, what
they thought stood most with the Dignity of the Commonwealth. There was one
thing only which might seem to detract from their hopes, and from their
constancy of mind; which was, that certain News was given out, that the King of
France, with whom (as it has been said) Ferdinando had made Truce for what
concerned Affairs on the other side the Mountains; did also treat with him upon
conditions of Peace, which if it should succeed, there was reason to doubt that
Caesar would likewise join with them, and that being all joined together, they
might once more endeavor the prejudice of the Commonwealth. And this was the
more likely to be believed, for that the King of France stood in need of such
Friendships, now that a heavy War was threatened him by the English. The English
Army which was very numerous, was already past over the Sea to Callis in
France; and King Henry was ready to pass over himself, to be present at this
Enterprise. Therefore upon this so weighty occasion, the Senate thought fit to
confirm King Lewis by all means possible in his former taken resolution, and to
exhort him by the mouth of their Ambassador Dandalo, who was then Resident at
that Court, not to give the Affairs of Italy quite over.

That he would endeavor as soon as might be, to renew the War before the
Reputation which he had won was lessened, and before his Claim to the Dukedom
of Millan, which did now begin to be of Force and Vigor, should grow stale.
That the Forces of so great a King were not so much lessened for one Rout
received at Novara, as that he should suffer the Switzers, a Mountainous
Nation, and which wanted all things, to say they had driven a powerful Prince
out of his Dominions, and robbed him of all the Praise and Profit of the Victory
which he had almost already got. That his Majesty of France would put on such
Resolutions as became his greatness, and assure himself that the Venetians
would never be wanting in any thing to him. That he might command their Forces,
Men, and Money, for whilst they had any Power, nay whilst they should have
Breath and Life they were ready to expose themselves to all hardship and
danger, for the Greatness of the Kingdom of France, and in defense of the
common cause.

To these things King Lewis answered, That he very much thanked the Venetians
for this their Civility, he gave them very good words and hopes, showing a
great desire to revenge himself of his Enemies, for the Injuries which he had
received; that it was true his Forces were somewhat diminished, but that his
mind continued still the same; and chiefly in prosecuting the War, and
continuing League and Friendship with them. That it was the ancient Custom of
the Kings of France not to be grievous, but helpful to their Friends: That
therefore though he should little mind the Affairs of Italy for any Interest of
his own, he would not be unmindful of his Obligations to the Venetians;
wherefore he would be ready with all his might to help them to recover their
ancient Dominions, and to increase their Honor and Dignity.

But it was certainly held that the King of France could not mind the Affairs
of Italy that year, his Kingdom being infested in several parts; for not only
the King of England, but Caesar, and the Switzers had declared themselves his
enemies. Yet the Venetians thought it must needs make for their Affairs to keep
the Kings mind by these means still set on Glory, and confirmed with hopes of
better success, and to keep him their Friend as much as they could. And that
they might begin to receive that advantage by this Negotiation at least which
they could not as then expect from his Forces; they exhorted the King, that
since he could not at present employ his Forces, nor his thoughts upon the
Affairs of Italy, he would the mean while endeavor to remove all those
Impediments which might afterward, when he should have leisure to think
thereon, make his acquisition of the Dukedom of Millan more difficult. That
therefore he should endeavor to get help from all parts, and that he should
chiefly get the Pope to join with him in League and Friendship. Which thing
being desired very much by his Nobility, and generally by all the people of
France, Lewis was persuaded to send the Bishop of Marcelles Ambassador to
Rome, to let the Pope know, That he had annulled the Counsel which he had
formerly removed to Lions, and was ready to join with that of Latheran, which
was then celebrated in Rome, and that following the Custom of his Ancestors, he
would always highly honor the holy Name of Pope, and would be ready to defend
the Church of Rome to the utmost of his Power.

At the same time the Venetians sent ten Ambassadors to the Pope, all of them
both for Age and Dignity the chief of the City, that they might witness the
singular Affection and Reverence which they bore unto him, which having
formerly endeavored to do, they had appointed their Ambassador at Rome,
Francisco Foscari, that as soon as the Counsel should be begun which the Pope
had intimated to be held at St. John of Latherans, he should be present there
in the name of the Commonwealth.

But afterward they found the Popes mind to be otherwise disposed than they
had thought; for fearing now no more the French Forces after the Rout at
Novara, which was the reason why till then he had handled his business
variously, desembling his secret Intentions, expecting the Issue of that War,
he began to discover himself, and the Practices which he had held secretly
before with the Commonwealths Enemies.

He reprehended the Venetians, and blamed them for having called back the
French into Italy, to their own prejudice, and the like of others; and that
they, who ought mo^e then all the rest to have labored the quiet and liberty
of Italy, were the cause of raising new Commotions, and of bringing her again
under the Slavery of Barbarians. Which that they might appear the more heinous
faults, he accused them of being minded if their Affairs had succeeded
prosperously, to turn their Forces against the Church; which he said might be
easily seen by their League made with the French, wherein having obliged King
Lewis to a^st them in recovering whatsoever they were possessed of before that
War, there was no doubt but that they aspired at the Recovery of the Lands of
Romagnia.

Leo did often times expostulate these things; for not being able long to conceal
his Counsels, he endeavored to excuse himself by laying the fault on others,
and by supposing a necessity for what he had done, and by alleging false
reasons for it, to deserve Praise instead of Blame. He was continually
solicited by Caesar to send him those Aides which were promised him by
agreement by his Predecessor, and which were renewed by him. Therefore Leo
being no longer able to make either excuse or delay, he ordered Toroilo
Savello, and Mutio Colonno, who commanded his Gens d' Arms, that they should
depart from Bolognia, where they then were, and go with their Troops, which
consisted of one hundred Horses apiece, to join with the Dutch and Spanish
Army. The Venetians were troubled at nothing more then to see that the Pope had
declared himself their Enemy; for they having never been faulty in their Love
and Observance to him, in any whatsoever condition of his Fortune, as he
himself had confessed, and seemed desirous of an occasion to deserve it of the
Commonwealth, they presumed they might safely build upon his favor: And
though he had not as yet joined with them in any League against their Enemies,
yet they thought him no whit less well minded toward them, but rather that he
desired to have no hand in the War, to the end that he might be the freer from
all suspicion, and be the better able to use his Authority in serving them upon
managing any Agreement. The Venetians seeing no hopes of Peace, and that their
Enemies did increase in numbers and Forces, placed all their hopes in
themselves, and betook themselves to provide more diligently for all things,
which they thought might secure them from so many dangers, and revenge their
Injuries. They took many Foot Soldiers into pay out of Romagnia, and listed a
great many light Horse: Moreover they ordered Vicenso Capello, who was
Commissary for the Fleet, that he should recrute the Galleys with Mariners,
and furnish the Fleet with all things necessary, that he should recall the
Candie Galleys, and having gotten what numbers of Vessels he possibly could
from all places, he should with all speed bring the whole Fleet to Sara. With
the like diligence they provided Victuals, Ammunition, and Moneys, and all
things else, as it were, for the beginning of a new War. Some Senators were of
opinion, that the Fleet should put into the Rivers of Puglia, and infest the
Maritime Places, and that they should by all possible means seem at lest to
revenge themselves of King Ferdinando, who being provoked by no Injury, had
declared himself an Enemy to the Commonwealth. Yet having thought better
hereupon, they thought it was not fit, in so calamitous times as these were, to
incense a great King so far as to block up all ways of ever returning into his
favor. The Venetian General was this mean while with his Army upon the Banks
of Adice, and being advertised by the Spies, that the Spaniards were gone
toward Vicensa, intending to go to Padua; and that Cordona, with whom those
men were already joined, which, as we told you before, were sent by him upon
other Enterprises, was marching with his whole Army toward him, he thought it
fit to get beyond the Adice, so to free his own men from danger, and by them to
secure the Cities of Padua and Treviso. Therefore the Senate, though it had
been of an other Opinion but a little before, fearing least their Affairs might
run into some greater disorder, commended Alviano's Advice, and forthwith sent
Luigi Barbaro to re-build the Bridge over the Adice at Albaredo, which as soon
as it was finished, the Army past immediately over, and stayed at Montagnana,
where it quartered. But after the departure of their Army, the Venetian
Affairs, which by reason of their first good successes, began a little to hold
up their head, fell to precipitate again. Polesine d^ Rovigo yielded presently
to the Enemy, and great Risings were in all parts; for the people in the
Venetians Dominion, seeing their Enemies to grow strong, and their Friends
weak, and that they were grievously molested by the one, and but slowly
defended by the others; even such Towns as had been most faithful to the
Commonwealth, did on all sides, for their own safety surrender to the Enemy.
Only Renzo da Ceri, who stayed with part of the people to defend Crema, won
some Praise in War at this time, and did somewhat maintain the ancient Venetian
Reputation; for sallying frequently out of the City, he much incommodiated the
Enemy, he pillaged and overran their Confines, fired their Towns, took many
Prisoners, took away their Moneys, which he brought to the Camp, and maintained
the Soldiers therewith. The Spanish Army being this mean while advanced to
countenance and assist Cesars Affairs, the Town of Peschiera, having made some
little resistance, fell into the Power of the Enemy, and the Castle likewise,
though it were strongly walled, and well garrisoned, was the easilier lost by
the disagreement of the Captains. Lodovico Contarini, who was Purvoyer for the
City, was taken Prisoner together with the Captains, and most of the Soldiers,
the rest escaped the Enemy by flight. From hence, the Spaniards losing no time,
went presently toward Verona, and joining with the Dutch, at the Town San
Martin^, they began to consult, how they were to manage the War, whereupon
there being several Votes given, the Opinion of the Bishop Gurghense was at
last followed, which was to march with the whole Army to the taking in of
Padua. Gurghense was the Emperors Lieutenant in Italy, and was particularly at
this time as Head of all the rest in Verona, from whence going to the Army, he
held therein likewise the supreme Authority. It was not well known whether this
Enterprise were propounded by Gurghense, as by command from Caesar, or of his
own mear Advice, that so if it should succeed, he might win the greater Praise,
the Enterprise being very difficult. But howsoever, Gurghense despising the
Opinion of the Military men, who were all against him, did obstinately persist
in his Opinion; and yet in his Speeches he stood rather upon amplifying the
Greatness of the Rewards which they were to expect from the Victory, than upon
giving any reason why they should hope to be victorious. But Alviano, who had
already conveyed all the Artillery and Baggage into Padua, that he might be the
freer and readier to march accordingly as he should see the Enemy move; when he
heard their Resolution, arose presently with his whole Army, and was very
sollicitous in putting good Garrisons into Padua and Trevigi; for it was
generally thought that the whole success of the War did depend upon the
Preservation of these two Cities. Baglione went with 2500 Foot and 400 Horse to
the custody of Trevigpe; and Andrea Malipiero was sent thither likewise from
the Senate, that he might take particular care for Ammunition, and all other
things which might be requisite for the Soldiers. And Alviano went himself
with the rest of the Army into Padua; and though the City might seem to be
sufficiently therewith garrisoned, yet the Senate would have some companies
chosen out of Venice and Istria which should be put into Arms, and sent to
guard that City: Moreover many of the Country people who were run into Venice
to save themselves from the Enemy, were sent thither, to be made use of as
Pyoners upon any occasion. To infuse the greater courage and confidence into
all which, many of the young Nobility of Venice, and many other well born
Citizens, went with their Servants and Friends to the defense of Padua, and
readily exposed themselves in common with the other Soldiers to all labor and
danger of the War. Gritti also, who had hardly been eight days in his Country,
was sent by order of the Senate to that City to discharge the same place which
was formerly done by Malipiero. Padua, a great and noble City, was kept by the
Venetians with great care and vigilance; for the Commonwealth having placed
the surest Foundations of her Empire by Land in that City, both for the
opportunity of its situation, fertility of ground, and certain other fortunate
Auspices, they had not been wanting in these hardest times, to attend the
Preservation of that City with all sort of care; so as it was made very strong,
and those parts of the Suburbs were thrown down, which extending themselves
into a great length, could not be walled in; the Trees were cut down for a good
space round about the City; and all the neighboring Villages pulled down to
the ground, so as being environed on all sides by open fields, no Enemy could
approach the City, but must be discovered from a far off, and exposed to the
shot of Cannon. The Emperor Maximillian had formerly endeavored the taking of
this City with great warlike Preparation; but finding all to be in vain, was
forced to quit the Enterprise. But the Venetians hereby instructed, had with
all care and diligence caused works to be made about the Fort, and had brought
it to great security and perfection. The City was likewise excellently well
provided with Victuals, and much corn was every day voluntarily brought in by
the Neighboring Inhabitants. There was great store of Artillery of all sorts,
which being very well ordered and disposed of, did sufficiently guard the Walls
on all sides, though they were of a very larg circute. Thus had the Venetians
carefully provided for all things requisite to the Preservation of this City,
moved thereunto rather out of the considerableness of the cause, then fear of
danger. All these things being thus ordered, those who were to defend the City
did courageously expect the Enemies Approach: who being gone to the Castle of
Este, and from thence falling down along the River banks till they were come
within two miles of the City, encamped themselves on the right hand of the
river Bachiglione. There was nothing in the enemies Army except the train of
Artillery which could give such Reputation as was requisite for the winning of
so renowned a City. The men were but few for such an Enterprise; the Foot did
not exceed 8000, nor the Horse above 1000 in all: And their provision for
Victuals was but by hazard, from day to day; so as it was conceived the Army
would in a short time be reduced to great straits. There were several
Commanders in the Army of very great Renown in War, but their experience was of
no avail here, by reason of the Bishop Gurghense his great Authority, and his
greater Obstinacy. But that which did most of all trouble, and confound the
Commanders, was the difficulty of bringing the Artillery to the Wails, and of
leading on their Soldiers safe to the Assault. Which could not be done without
a long and laborious work of Trenches, under the shelter whereof they might
escape the Cannon-shot which played from all parts. But such work required so
many men to make them, as though all the Country round about was fetched in
with great severity, yet could they not find men enough for the business.
Insomuch as the Enemy having begun to make a broad and deep Ditch, which was
led on by crooked lines from the Camp to the City, to make a Fence against the
cannon-shot which was made from off the City Walls, with the earth which they
threw out; they were forced quickly to forsake that work, as well for want of
Pioners, as for the continual disturbance which they met with from the City,
and chiefly by the light Horse, which sallying out often at unawares, fell upon
the Pyoners, disturb the work, and did continually infest the Enemy sundry
ways. So as nothing passing on either side but slight Skirmishes, the time
past on and but little was done; and the Inconveniences of the Enemies Army
increasing every day more and more, their hopes of getting the City grew lesser
and lesser; for the Camp being pitched in a low situation, and subject to the
often Inundation of water, and consequently less healthful, the Soldiers began
to fall sick apace, so as they could not tarry there; moreover the Camp being
kept from being victuall'd, by Light Horse which sallied often out of the City,
and not being furnished with any great store out of the Country, the Army was
greatly inconvenienced. The Soldiers not being content with their abode there,
complained grievously, and with injurious words told their Commanders,

That that Enterprise was idly undertaken, that the business was too
difficult, and which by other Trials was almost impossible to effect; that they
would not refuse any duties how sore soever, nor shun any danger if there were
any hope of good success, but that a business which was not accompanied with
any hope of good, was certainly not only vain, but very dishonorable, and
mis-becoming Military men. What hopes had they to win a strong City now, when
numerous Armies of several joint Princes being brought before it to the same
purpose four years ago, were forced with shame to forego it? What reason had
Caesar to persuade himself, that his very name, though at a far distans* should
make so much for the Victory now, when his presence could not effect it before?
That a War of such importance ought not to be governed by the Authority and
Counsel of Bishop Gurghense, a man wholly unexperienced in what belonged to
War. That he minded only Caesar's Affairs, and cared not for the Soldier; that
they had not received their due pay, nor had not had such Aids sent them as was
promised. What remained there now to be done but immediately to raise the Camp.

These Speeches being noised throughout the whole Camp, came to Gurghense's
car, who being moved thereat, and dispairing now to perfect his work, it being
taken into consideration to raise the Camp, he who had formerly tenaciously
defended the contrary opinion, gave suddenly his consent thereunto: So as on
the 16th of August by consent of all, the Camp was raised, and Padua was freed
from the Siege, which had laid before it 20 days, occasioning more fear then
danger.

The Enemy marched toward Vicenza, and finding it without any Garrison, and
forsaken by the Venetian Magistrates, and chiefest part of the Citizens, who
hearing of the Enemies approach, had withdrawn themselves into stronger Holds,
they soon took it: and the Soldiers began to commit many enormious cruelties;
they plundered private men's Houses, not forbearing Churches, nor sacred things,
but tore and rent the miserable City; not for that they had therein received
any injury, but because the Army was for the most part maintained by Rapine,
which did never receive pay in due time. When the Camp had stayed there a
while, it began to find want of many things; for the City being wasted by War
could not supply the Army with sufficient Victuals, the Inhabitants having
transported their corn and cattle to other parts; and it was hard to get any
from other parts by reason of the free-booting Carobines, which by perpetual
In-roads kept the Enemies Army from Victuals; being then forced out of these
respects to quit those Quarters, the Bishop Gurghenses went with the Dutch to
Verona, and the Viceroy went to encamp at Alberedo upon the River Adice. Over
which he began to cause a Bridge be made, intending as he affirmed to lead his
Soldiers into the Territories of Bergamo and Brescia. But seeing that the
Viceroy tarried long in those Quarters, Alviano was of opinion, to draw the
men out of Padua and Trevigi, and to assault the Enemy, who free from all
suspicion, and scattering themselves about the Country for Pillage disorderly,
might soon be routed. He said that the whole Remainder of the War lay in this
Army, which if it should be beaten, the War was ended; and that as long as it
should be kept together, the Enemy would always be able to molest the
Commonwealth.

But the Senate thought otherwise, being constant in the opinion not to hazard
that Army to the uncertain event of Battle, in which the chiefest hopes of
their Preservation lay. Neither thought they it safe in such hazardous times,
to draw the Garrisons out of Padua and Trevigi. But howsoever keeping this
their Intention secret to themselves, they endeavored to beget an other
opinion amongst men, to the end that such News being spread abroad, and that the
Enemy hearing that their Army was to take the field, they might forbear
free-booting, and might hasten out of their confines. But Cordona, little
valuing such Rumors, which he saw not in many days seconded by any effects, but
rather taking courage hereby, and hoping for better things, he began to promise
himself good success in whatsoever he should take in hand. Wherefore changing
his former opinion, and calling back the Dutch Soldiers to him, he marched
once more toward the Territories of Padua, with intention (as it was seen
since the season would suffer him to do nothing else) to overrun and pillage
all that Country. Some say that Cordona was moved to this by the many
complaints which Gurghense made against him, calling him a Liconian, of an
unsettled mind, that he did too much affect the continuing in that Dignity, and
that he used deceit, because he proceeded slowly in the Seige of Padua, and in
all his other works. Others believe that Cordona was enforced to take this
course; for that the Army being much in arrear for pay, which they demanded
with great fervency, and not without insolency and tumult, it became him since
he wanted moneys to satisfy the Soldier, to stop their mouths by suffering
them to prey upon the Enemy, so to supply their want of pay. Prospero Colonna
was of a contrary opinion, who held the next place in the Army, after Cordona.
This man having often overcome the Enemy both by Counsel, and by the Sword, had
wo^ne great Renown both for his Valor and Wisdom in Military Affairs.

He after his accustomed manner, affirmed the other to be a rash and unbecoming
Counsel; for that good part of the Autumn being now over, and the time drawing
near wherein Armies began to draw out of the field, this would be to engage the
Army in action out of Season; that they could not go into the Enemies Country
without much danger, they being to pass between two strong Cittes, full of
Soldiers, as if they went through the jaws of the Enemy; but that the chiefest
difficulty would lie in getting out of the Country, which was so environed
with Rivers, and in a season when great rains were likely to fall, and where
snares were to be laid for them by their Enemies on all sides; that therefore
that Counsel was to be held the best, whereby the Army was to be preserved from
great danger, which when it should be closed in by great Rivers and in the
midst of the Enemy, and should also want Victuals, might instead of spoiling
the Enemy, be made a prey of by them. That therefore some better Proposals
ought to be made for the preservation of the Army, and not seek to prevent
uncertain dangers by certain ruin. But Colonna's advice would not be listened
to; for Piscara, who confided much upon the Spanish Foot, and totally slighted
the Italian Soldiers, joined in Opinion with Cordona, and got it to be put in
effect. Wherefore the Camp suddenly moved, and that they might march with more
speed, they left the baggage behind them, neither did they take all their
Artillery with them. They took up their first Quarters at the Castle of
Montagnana; and went from thence to that part of the Paduan Territories, which
extends it self toward Chioggia, and toward the Sea; which was the richest
part of all the rest, both for fruitful fields, and store of Inhabitants: And
was at this time particularly full both of people, and of cattle, because many
of the Country people had withdrawn themselves thither, as into a place of
safety. There is one Town in these parts observable, called Bovolenta, seated
in a place free from the sudden In-roads of the Enemy; for the River Bachelone
which takes its course from the Territories of Vicenza, as soon as it comes to
the Town of Bassanello, two miles distant from Padua, runs a various and
crooked course through the Paduan Territories, having received into her bosom
some parts of the waters of Brenta, which invironing a great space of ground,
meet and join together in this place. There was a Castle here of old, which
being taken by Alphonso Duke of Ferara, when things went worst with the
Commonwealth, was afterward recovered by the Venetians, and fortified as much
as the situation could bear. The Enemies came first hither, and passing over
the River with some Boats, they took, and burnt the Castle, and sacked the
Town; hav^ng opportunity to make the greater Booty, for that the Inhabitants of
that Country, thinking that the Enemies Army was so far advanced, as not to
return, fearing no farther danger, were returned to their own houses; so as the
Enemy coming upon them at unawares, they had very little time left them to
escape their hands. The Viceroy then led on his Army farther to that part of
the River which comes from Padua, overrunning and plundering all that whole
Country even to the Gates of Chioggia. Nothing was seen through all places
that they went, but death and rapine. From thence he went toward the Castle di
Pioue di Sacco, a rich place, and well inhabited, which they ransacked, with
all manner o^ injurious dealing, pardoning nothing neither sacred nor profane.
And whilst the rest are busied in these Rapines, Tro^lo Savello one of the
Popes Captains, understanding by some that fled away, that many Country people
were withdrawn with their Wives, Children, and Goods to those Marshes, made
by the waters of Brenta, five miles distant from the City of Venice, where the
Terra firma parts from the Wash, past over the Brenta with 150 Horse, and some
Foot Companies, and marched speedily thither, which when the many that were
there without either Arms or Garrison, understood, they began suddenly to fly,
and being scattered here and there as they ran, they were taken Prisoners; yet
many out of the knowledge of the passages, escaped. The prey which they got here
was forthwith carried away by the Enemy, whereby they got but little good,
though much Infamy.

Savello past on then toward Mestre, whither Mutio Colonna was gone a little
before with some of the Popes men, and chasing away some Horse, nor meeting
with any to with-stand him, had taken that Town: Wherefore Savello's Soldiers,
which came thither after, minded nothing but Booty, and not leaving any thing
behind them, burned the Castle. These were followed more slowly by Cor^ona, who
being come to the Wash at the utmost point of the Terra Firma, which is
commonly called Marghera, he gave order for the planting of his cannon there,
and made many shot toward the city of Venice, which was just over against him.
This City which is round about environed with salt water, has no way which
leads unto it by Land, and the ways by Sea which are known to those who are
acquainted with the sundry and uncertain channels, are blocked up to others and
concealed. Therefore safe by her situation, and needing no Garrison to defend
her, she is preserved from any calamity of War, and dispatch the power of her
Enemies. But this proud Spaniard, to whom this was well known, would be able to
boast as of a very glorious thing, that he had got so near so famous a City
with so small an Army, whereby he might, as it were, bereave her of that Renown
which she had won amongst other Nations. It Is very true that Fortune had shown
her self at this time very bitter and cruel toward the Venetians, who were not
able now to stop the force of so weak an Army, having formerly with much
boldness and success, opposed the greatest Forces which threatened the liberty
of Italy. The Citizens were therefore sorely grieved, seeing the Honor of
Venice with such insolency offended, and that they must be enforced to suffer
those who were so well affectionated to the Commonwealth, and who had lived so
long safe and quiet under her Empire, to be now thus lacerated by all sorts of
cruelty: And that whereas formerly they were wont to assist distressed
Foreigners, they could not now defend their own. The Venetians were formerly
formidable to others, but now so cowed, as they were forced to fear their own
Affairs. Which variety of Fortune was the harder to be tolerated, out of the
memory of their former Felicity. But the Enemy foregoing those parts the next
day that they were come thither, went still wandering up and down the Paduan
confines, and wheresoever they came, laid the Country waste, all things were
stolen and consumed by the Soldiers, who where they found no Inhabitants, and
consequently nothing to bear away, that they might even there leave some signs
of their rage and wickedness, they showed their madness against the Walls and
Houses, firing all as well public as private Buildings, as were any thing
beautiful. But Cordona, growing now aware of his rash counsel, was desirous to
hasten his departure, but could not keep the Soldiers from pillage and
plunder, who had so long a time lived licentiously, neither by laying before
them the necessity of departing suddenly, nor by his Power or Authority.

At this time Alviano kept with his Army in Padua, and much troubled to see
these Proceedings of the Enemy, could not well suffer, that so much to his
disparagement, and to the dishonor of the whole Italian Militia, they should
be permitted to pass by, leaving so strong, and so well garrisoned a City
behind them, without paying for this their rashness, and for having ruined and
wasted so larg a space of ground. He therefore advertised the Senate, that he
would march out of the City with his men, and meet the Enemy to block up his
way in his return.

He alleged, That being laden with prey, and marching in disorder, they might
easily be beaten; that their Commonwealth was fallen into a most miserable
condition, very much unworthy of her former Glory, nor was she to be put into a
better, but by a noble daring, and by a gallant, and generous Assault. But the
Senators were of another mind; thinking that to have respect to all things, was
not the part of abject and cowardly, but of solid and resolute persons, and
that it did not suite with the Gravity of the Venetian Senate, nor with the
praised Wisdom, which they had in the perpetual course of so many years won, to
place their resolutions, and the total of their Affairs in the power of
chance; the success of Battle being always doubtful, and uncertain: That
therefore their Judgment was, that the Enemy should only be molested by the
Chivalry, leaving the rest of the Army to guard the City.

But Alviano was too head long born to the desire of Victory, so as his mind
being blinded with a desire of Glory, he often times knew no danger, and did
despise the safest and wisest counsels. Therefore pressing daily more and more
that the Army might remove from Padua, and the Venetian Commissaries being of
the same opinion, being induced, as they said, to hope well, out of a singular
good affection which they found in the Commanders and Soldiers toward the
Commonwealth, and as great a readiness in them to defend her honor, the
Senate departing a little from their first resolution, left the business to
Alviano; that if he thought it might make well for their Affairs, he might
march with his Army out of the City: always provided that he would be sure to
quarter his Army in so secure a place, as he might not be compelled to run the
hazard of a Battle. And that he would so follow the Enemy, as without
indangering himself, their Army might be enforced to dis-band, being consumed
through their own Inconveniences. And that he should remember that it was the
duty of a Commander to overcome the Enemy no less by counsel than by the sword.
The Senate also charged the Commissaries, that they should use all means
possible to confirm the Soldiers minds; and that in the name of the public,
they should thank the Captains, and every man of any account in the Army for
their good will to the Commonwealth. The Soldiers were then quickly drawn out
of Padua; they took up their first Quarters at Limina, where the Brent dividing
her self into two branches, takes her course by several ways into the Sea: This
place was made choice of, because 'twas thought the Enemy could not pass the
River lower, it being deeper there. Our Army being fixed here, Andrea Loredano,
one of the Commissaries, having assembled all the Horse Commanders, and
Captains of Foot, and some other of the chiefest Soldiers together, spoke thus
unto them, according to the Order he had received from the Senate.

The Senate having understood by Letters from us, and by the relation of many
others, with what Courage, and hopes, You my Fellow Soldiers have taken the
Field, as if you were assured of Victory, but yet with a mind prepared and
disposed for all events, were all of them so overjoyed with the News, as even
with tears in eyes, they humbly thanked God, that amidst so many blows of
adverse Fortune, he had afforded them this of comfort, that in so calamitous
times he had given them proof of your Loyalties, and of your singular affection
to the Commonwealth. Therefore they have commanded us in their Names ^o let
you know that our City bears the like good will to you; and to witness unto you
how great an obligation the whole Commonwealth acknowledges to owe unto you
for it; and that her Citizens will always thankfully remember it, which they
desire you to take in good part till such time as when Fortune shall better
upon us, they may witness it better by effects. The Commonwealth does now by
me give you many thanks. Let nothing then be of force enough to remove you from
the affection which you seem to bear her, or to make you repent this your
purpose. You have taken upon you to defend* a noble City and her just Empire,
which is the Seat of the Liberty, and the Glory of Italy; which City whilst she
shall have either Seat or Power, you may be sure will not be wanting in
rewarding your great deserts; for we have ever greatly esteemed, and honored
all valiant and honest m^n. It is too apparent that the Transalpine Nations
envy our re-rising greatness, out of the memory of the ancient Worth and Empire
of the Italians; and that therefore they do use all the means they can to ruin
our Commonwealth* which is the true Glory of Italy. But we having formerly
made much greater Forces of our Enemies prove vain, our City hopes we shall now
^e easily able to beat the remainders thereof, which are all now in this Army.
The Aids which we have had from the Friendship of Foreign Princes, and from
Trans-Alpine Forces, have been of no advantage to us, but have often done us
more harm than good; but our Commonwealth will find all things in your love
and affection, a ready Will, perspicuous Worth, and as I hope, successful
Fortune. We are not now to fight with Soldiers, but rather Thieves; for they
do not wage War according to the Custom of Military men, nor do they thereby
endeavor Empire and Glory, but guided by fury, are contaminated with all sort
of Rascallity: God will not suffer their wickedness to remain long unpunished;
so as our Militia will be crowned, as I trust, with Victory and Triumph. We
have a faithful, and loyal Army, and in it many gallant Soldiers chosen out of
the Flower of all the Italian Militia; the Enemy are oppressed with much want of
Victuals, and their men, now many months accustomed to pillage, not to
fighting, being beyond measure imbased, slothful, and wanton, have made their
bodies weak, and their minds effeminate* Yet must not we for all this be the
less diligent, we must observe all the removes of the Enemy, block up their
way, and finally we must leave nothing undone, whereby either by mature advice,
or forward d^^ing, according as time and place shall require, we may be able to
stay these insolent Enemies; ^o take them, scatter them, and recover what they
have got of ours. If those things which we have resolved upon, be duly put in
execution, doubtlessly the Enemies Army, which is now become so insolent
through the prey which they have gotten, will become our prey. Things are now
grown so hopeful, as the ^enators, and the whole City, believing the Victory to
be certain, begin to think how they shall reward you, and pay you the merits of
so gallant an action. The eyes of all Italy are bent upon this, and are big
with expectation what the success will be, hoping to be one day revenged for
all the Injuries which she has rec^ived from the Barbarians. You must
therefore endeavor by all means not to defraud the Senate of the fruit of
their hoped for Victory; nor ^he rest, of the opinion they have conceived of
your Gallantry, nor yet your selves of Praise and Glory.

Loredano having said this, the whole Army answered with one joint voice, That
they were rea^y for all things* nor would they refuse cheerfully to undergo any
whatsoever danger, for the welfare of the Commonwealth, and for their own
honor; that they wished the Commonwealth might for the future be more
prosperous and successful, which for their parts they would by all industry
endeavor, and whatsoever her fortune should be, they would think it to be
their own: That the Commonwealth might many times before have known their
Fidelity, but that they were glad she should now have trial both of their
Fidelity and Valor.

Thus with universal consent, and great alacrity, the Camp removed, and the
Army was brought to Fontanina, two miles distant from Cittadella, where our men
resolved to wait for the Enemy, because the River could not be well waded over
any where else. They planted their Artillery upon the Banks thereof, and placed
sufficient Garrisons in every fitting place, and not far from hence was the
Army encamped, betwixt which and the Artillery, a large Ditch was drawn, that
the Soldiers might upon any whatsoever occasion be fenced within a strong
Trench. The Enemy hearing this, began to hasten their March, to the end that
they might pass the River before those men which they knew were led on by
Baglione, might join with Alviano's Army. But as soon as they were come to the
Banks of Brent, and that they found them to be guarded by many Garrisons, and
that their passage was stopped there, they resolved without delay to march
farther on; Cardona gave order, that whilst the rest of the Army marched, the
Light Horse should stay behind, and that keeping about the River Banks, they
should let themselves be seen by our men who were on the other side, whereby
their departure might not be suspected; and the Enemy having marched three
miles toward the upper part of the River, where they found no Guard, they past
their men safely over, using such diligence therein, as our men hearing
afterward that Cardona was gone to pass over the River; before our men could
be drawn forth to hinder their passage, the Enemies whole Army were past over,
and had put themselves in order to stand our Assault. Alviano finding that the
business had suceeded much otherwise then he had thought, was much afflicted,
that he had missed the opportunity of assaulting the Enemy, whilst they were
divided, and busied in passing over the River; for by the opinion of the other
Commanders, and his own also, it was resolved, that they would not come to a
day of Battle with the Enemy, but upon some noteable advantage, and that they
would expect the succor which Baglione brought them from Treviso. But Cardona,
as soon as he ha^ past the Brent, turned toward Vicenza, and because he was to
take his way about, Alviano, that he might prevent the Enemy, and possess
himself of the passes by a nearer way, took his way suddenly thitherward: The
mean while he sent Nicolo Vendramino before with all the light Horse, to the
end that he might vex the latter Squadrons of the Enemy, and retard their March
as much as he might. He then gave order that all the Bridges which he thought
the Enemy might make use of, should be broken down, that the tops of the
Mountains should be possessed by Country people, and that many Trees should be
cut down, and laid cross the Highways, and that all Avenues might be with all
diligence blocked up, Manfrone, having assembled a great many Mountainers of
all the Country thereabout, to near about the number of 5000, with these, and
with some small pieces of Artillery, possessed himself of the pass of
Montecchio. At the same time whilst these things were a doing, Alviano having
left Gritti, and Baglione with a third part of the Army in Vicenza, to defend
that City, he past on three miles farther, and finding a Plain fit to receive
the Camp, ^e took up his Quarters there, and began forthwith to fortify it.
This place was thus situated. In the Highway which leads from Vicenza to
Verona, when you come to the Village Olmo, there is a little Plain out of the
way, somewhat on the right hand, which being guarded on the right hand by Monti
di Creazzo, and environed almost every where on the other side by a Valley, is
naturally very strong, and there is but one way that leads unto it. In the
midst thereof the ground is somewhat raised up, and makes the place fitter to
encamp in. Alviano chose this as a fit and safe place to tarry in. He together
with the rest of the Commanders, resolved to expect the coming of the Enemies
Army there, according to the Senates Order, and blocking up his Passes to
reduce him to a scarcity of Victuals; not affording the Enemy any opportunity
of coming to a day of Battle, for it was clearly conceived, that without
running any hazard, the Victory was to be ours. The Venetian Camp was pitched
(as has been said) in a very strong place, and very fit to draw the business
out in length, and where they had plenty of all things necessary; on the
contrary the Enemy suffered many Inconveniences, and their difficulties did
daily increase.

Cardona this mean while, following the journey he had begun, was come to
within about four miles of the Venetian Army, and making his Camp tarry in a
place which is called by the Country people La Motta, being much confused and
troubled, he consulted with the rest of the Commanders, what course they had
best to take in the very great straits which they were in. They differed in
their Opinions, but they all agreed in their very small hopes of safety, or
remedy for so many dangers and difficulties. They could not keep longer in
those parts for want of Victuals, and it was almost impossible for them to get
away, the Passages being strait, difficult, and guarded by strong Garrisons.
They must either go toward Trent, or toward Verona, to either of which they
might go by two ways; for they might go from where they were into Germany
either by a shorter cut over the Mountains of Schio, or by a longer way about,
through the confines of Basenese; and likewise they might get into the way
which leads to Verona by the way of the Plain wherein they were, or by climbing
up the Mountains on the right hand. But whichsoever of these ways they should
take, they were to meet with almost the same difficulties, some of these
passages being very rough and craggy, and the rest fortified and guarded by the
Venetians; so as the Commanders knew not which way to choose, nor how to make
their passage. Thus after long and various disputes, they at last resolved to
make their way by the Sword, since in great difficulties, great and unwonted
Valor is to be shown. Wherefore Cardona, seeing that the present wants, and
the greater ruin which over-hung the Army, could be no longer concealed,
without farther delay, thought it was best to acquaint the Soldiers how
Affairs stood with them, and to encourage them as much as he might; wherefore
calling them all together, he spoke thus unto them.

Were not your Worths, my Fellow Soldiers, well known to me by many gallant
Trials, I should not dare to lead on this Army, recommended to my trust by two
great Princes, Caesar and Ferdinando, where I know you are to make your way by
your Swords. But if I should take any other course, your Glory would be the
less, and your c^ndition the less fortunate, by losing the Honor which this
noble Attempt, and the rich Booty which you have taken from the Enemy, does put
into your hands. As the memory of your former actions has put me upon this
bold and generous undertaking, so trusting to your Worth and upon the Fortune
which attends this Army, I assure my self I shall conduct you all safe out of
danger. And certainly if you will be men, and mindful of your own actions,
these difficulties which seem now to threaten ruin to you, will turn to your
greater Glory. Necessity sometimes makes even abject and cowardly men, daring
and generous; but to tarry till you be thereby constrained to show your Va^our,
suites not with the opinion which is held of you, and of your Worth. You ought
to know into what condition we are brought: All ways whereby to march away, are
stopped, either by the Mountains, or by our Enemies Forces. On the one side we
have craggy and Mountainous places, strong by nature, and possest^y the Enemies
Garrisons; on the other side our return is impeded by the Venetian Camp: Want
of Victuals, against which there is no fence, will not suffer us to tarry any
longer here, though otherwise it might be good for us so to do: We cannot march
any whither, be it either by way of the Plains which lead to Verona, or back by
the Mountains, without meeting with many Inconveniences, which will be still
occasioned by our Enemies. So as whats^ever resolution we shall put on, the
Danger will be the same, but not the Glory. But I have always been of opinion,
that it became a good Commander to have a care of the preservation of his Army
so far, as he be not unmindful of their Honor: And yet not to value that so
much, as that he have not a like care of their safety. If we turning our back
upon our Enemies, shall take our way by the Mountains, we shall not be able to
shun many dangers before we can come thither, being that the Enemy will always
pursue us, and when we shall have most need of rest in respect of the journey
which we shall have made, and of perpetual Skirmishes, we shall then (being
come to the narrowest places) be to fight both with the difficulties of the
ways, and with th^se that do guard them. Therefore I think it better by much,
that you, who profess Soldiery* may fight with those of the like profession,
in an open and equal place, and by your Worth, experience the event of Battle,
then suffer that this Army being molested, and outraged by Mountainers, be at
last consumed. But let us suppose, that by excessive good Fortune, (after
having left our Artillery, Baggage and Booty in the Power of the Enemy) we
escape safe through the jaws of these Mountains, and get into Germany, (which
truly I cannot expect we shall do) we may perhaps free our selves from danger;
but how can we cancel such shame and ignomy? or how can that life be dear unto
us, which we shall have valued more than our Honor? And what greater Infamy
can we undergo, then through base fear, to have shamefully abandoned an Enemies
Country, which we have but just now victoriously overrun) without being
overcome in Battle? I think it therefore our best course, to fight the Enemy as
soon as may be, and to make our way with our Swords through the midst of their
Camp. As this resolution suites best with the Honor of this Army, so does it
carry along with it more hopes of safety. Whereas if we tarry longer disputing,
and shall suffer our selves to be overborn by immodederate fear, our Enemies
will have so much more reason to grow resolute and insolent: But if they see us
ready to defend our selves, I am confident they will soon reassume the same
Cowardliness which they have hitherto shown. If they did confide in their
Forces, who sees not that being so often provoked and invited by us, they would
not have staid so long locked up within their Cities Walls; and now they are
come into the field, only to make a vain show of Valor, not with any intention
of hazarding themselves in Battle. They very well know that the Italian
Soldiers can no ways stand in comparison with the stout and valiant Spaniards,
and Dutch, who are much better then they at the Militia; I have often tried
their Valor in War, and their desire of Glory: Therefore if you will imitate
your domestic Gallantry, nay if you will be what you always have been, we may
assuredly account the Victory already our own. These clownish people, and
unexperienced in War, who have neither learnt to observe Order nor to follow
their Colors, and who practice the Militia for a little gain, not out of any
desire of Praise, cannot long sustain nor retard our Assault: Therefore for
what I can at the present foresee, we may promise our selves assured Victory,
and by that Victory, great and certain rewards. But say that we should meet
with some ill success, and that I should be deceived in my expectation, we may
miss the fruit of Victory, but certainly this our gallant action cannot miss of
Praise; since having done what was possible for us to do both by Counsel, and
by Force of Arms, all men must confess, that neither daring, nor Valor was
wanting in us, but only Fortune.

The Soldiers being greatly moved by this discourse, casting away all doubts
and fears, began to desire what they had formerly avoided, promising the
General to do their parts: And Cardona finding the Soldiers willing, led the
Army, though the day were far spent, out toward Alviano's Camp, and being come
within two miles of him, he made almost all his Chivalry, together with some
companies of Spanish Foot advance, who gave furiously upon those who were upon
our Guard. But being terrified by our Artillery, (for the Trees were cut down
every where round about, so as they had no place to shelter themselves from
shot) they faced about, and having past over the Valley, went against those,
who as it was said, were left by Alviano at the Gate of Vicenza: Our men made
presently toward the Enemy who came to assault them, and having stoutly stood
their first Onset, quickly repulsed them, the Horse staying to skirmish, a
little while after the Foot were retreated. But the night drawing on, and being
much galled by our Artillery, they were likewise soon glad to quit the field,
and retreat to their own men.

Whilst these things were a doing, Cardona was drawn with the rest of his Army,
very near the Venetian Camp, and had kept his Army in posture to fight
Alviano's Camp, even till Sun set. Wherefore the night being already come on,
and our Quarters being so near, Cardona would not suffer the Tents to be set
up, nor fall to fortifying, fearing left his men might be unexpectedly set upon
by our men, whilst they should be busied about the works. The Soldiers did not
quit their Arms all that night, lying down upon the ground, without any light,
and in great silence, to keep from being hurt by the Artillery of the
neighboring Camp. This mean while the Commanders, possessed with great fears,
bethought themselves of many things, but could not well say which was the least
dangerous course to take amidst so many hazards; they stayed expecting day,
hoping that it might chalk them out what to do amidst these difficulties.
Alviano's Soldiers kept in Arms all that night likewise, diligently observing
every motion of the Enemy, as well in their own respects, as also for the
safety of those other people, with whom Baglione (having taken them away
together with the Artillery to whither we told you he was gone) had possessed
himself of the other part of the Valley which stood over against Alviano's
Camp. Which as soon as the Enemies knew, utterly despairing to make their way
on that side, and being by necessity dictated so to do, they altered their way,
and turned backwards toward the Mountains of Schio, the which they might the
more easily do, for that they found themselves less encumbered, and not bounded
within any Quarters. They divided their whole Army into three Squadrons,
wherewith they marched in close order; and that they might march the faster,
and be the readier to fight, if they should be thereunto enforced, they left
such part of their Booty behind them, as was of least value; and the greatest
part of their other Lumber, and though they made great haste, yet they marched
in good order, and with much safety. That day being the 9th of December,
chanced to be so dark and cloudy, as the Enemy had thereby opportunity of
getting out of the ken of our Army, unseen by us; so as the day was well
advanced before our men were aware of their departure, which when it was known,
Alviano being very glad, said,

What have we now to do but to make use of time? If we lose this opportunity
which is now offered us of utterly overthrowing the Enemy, when shall we ever
meet with the like? The Victory is undoubtedly ours, the Enemies confess
themselves overcome, they have already turned their backs, having no hopes of
safety but in running away; this is the time for us to recover the Honor and
Dignity of our Commonwealth, and of all Italy.

Alviano said this with the greater assurance; for that Loredano, who had
scowr'd up and down the fields all that night, had much encouraged the
Soldiers to fight, and had had such discourse with the Commanders, as he
appeared to be clearly of Alviano's opinion, saying,

That they were not to refuse the first occasion of Battle which was offered;
for if they should suffer these Rascals, their bitter Enemies, to depart safely
and quietly away now that they were almost routed of themselves, it was to be
feared that they might incur very much blame; for that it being in their Power
to free the Commonwealth from a bitter War, and the Italian name from great
Infamy, they had either through negligence or cowardliness let stip so fair an
occasion.

Besides Alviano, and the Commissaries, had sundry times given such an account
of the State of Affairs to the Senate, speaking very lowdly of themselves, and
lewdly of the Enemy, as all men had conceived an assured Victory, and they
began already to feel the fruit of Praise for these their Services. Alviano
being hereby inflamed, and being of himself very hasty and confident, thought
the Victory so clear and certain, as he counted his Glory so much the longer
retarded, as the Battle was deferred. So speedily quitting his Quarters, he
made Nicolo Vandramino; and Barnardino Antignivola advance with the Stradiotti
a Cavallo, or Dragouns, to the end that following the Enemy, and skirmishing
with them, they might the more molest and hinder their March, to boot with what
impediment they were to meet withal by the Mountainers, who waited for them on
all sides. The Venetian Army consisted of about 10000 Italian Foot, and 1500
Curassiers, and 1000 Light Horse. Half the Foot were new men, drawn to that
purpose out of the Towns and Villages by the Venetians, some of them coming by
command, some of them of their own free will: The rest were veterane Soldiers,
who had been a good while under the Commonwealths pay. Of all these Alviano
framed three bodies, mingling the old and new Soldiers together in some of
them, but he placed all the stoutest men in the middle Squadron, which was the
greatest. There was therein, besides Alviano's own person; Guido Rangone,
Giulio Manfrone, Giovan Ba^tisto da Fano, Giovan Paolo da Sant' Angelo, and
diverse others. These did enclose, with their several Companies disposed of in
two wings, 500 Curassiers. Antonio di Pio commanded the left wing, who had with
him the rest of the Foot, and on the right wing was Baglione, with 1000 Gens d'
Arms. Things being thus ordered* Alviano commanded Pio that he should keep
where he was, diligently observing what way he should take, and expect Orders
from him. He charged Baglione (who had with him the Gens d' Arms, as has been
said) that fetching a compass, he should go beyond the last Squadron of the
Enemy, and that as soon as he should see the Battle joined, he should at
unawares assault the Enemy on the Flank. He moreover made 20 pieces of
Artillery be drawn on before the Army in very good order, he himself riding
sometime on one hand, sometimes on another, encouraged the Soldiers to Battle,

Praying them not to suffer so great a shame, as to let the Enemy go away
without being revenged of them, who were a people contaminated with all sorts
of wickedness, hateful to God and man, that therefore they should hasten to an
assured prey and victory which was prepared for them. That they should not any
wh^t fear that Enemy whom they saw grown so weak, and already reduced to the
utmost extremity: That they should remember what they had by Oath promised to
the Commissary Loredano but a little before touching their Loyalty and Courage;
and then that they fought for a Commonwealth, where, as in a safe place of
refuge; valiant and honest men had always been largely rewarded; nay that they
were to fight for the Liberty, and Glory of all Italy; that therefore it was
expected from that Army, wherein were none but Italians, that they should show
how excellent that Nation was for Military Knowledge, and true Valor.

This mean while the Enemies Army having marched two miles, was come to the
same place della Motta, from whence we told you it was gone but a little
before, having our Horse still in their Rear, who continually held them play,
and did much molest them. Then Cardona, finding that he was followed by our
whole Army, seeing no other way of safety, encouraged by despair, resolved to
hazard all upon the event of Battle: Whereof the sign being given to the
Soldiers, he made them all halt, and turning his last Squadron upon our men,
made thereof the Front of his Army; wherein were the Dutch Foot, who were
commanded by Prospero Colonna. These men couching their Pikes, did stoutly
stand the Assault made by our Horse, who had first begun the Skirmish, whom a
great Band of the Enemies Horse coming from two parts did furiously charge,
seeking to cut off our men in the midst, and though they were repulsed at the
first Encounter, yet the Enemy continuing to press violently upon us, and being
much the stronger, they forced us to retreat: Which when Alviano saw, he
hastened his March, to bring timely succor to his men; wherein he was the more
diligent, because he feared lest that part of the Horse being made to run, all
the rest of the Army might thereby be put in disorder. Thus the two Armies
joining suddenly together, a terrible Battle began. Alviano being formest in
all dangers, endeavored both by words and actions to infuse Courage into his
men, nor was Colonna wanting this mean while in exhorting the Dutch Foot not to
forego their ancient Worth, telling them often that therein only did all their
hopes of safety lie: and truly they fought courageously; but notwithstanding
Alviano had given them so fierce an assault at first, as they could not
possibly long sustain it; so as in this first Encounter the Battle began
already to favor the Venetians; which being seen from above by those Country
people who were placed upon the Mountains, they in hopes of Prey, ran down into
the Plain, and mixed with the Soldiers: But Cardona coming in presently after
to the aid of his men, who was somewhat advanced with the main body, wherein
the Spanish Foot led the Van, those Country people who were come to pillage,
not to fight, being affrighted to see so many Enemies, began to cry out they
were overcome, and at the same time turned their backs; at which noise, and by
their sudden running away, the Venetian Soldiers began to slacken their former
violence, and to give over the Battle. Wherefore the Enemy still advancing, our
men's Outcries, Tumult, and Fear began to increase throughout the whole Army.
At first Alviano, nothing at all astonished at so strange an accident, provided
for all things; he stayed his affrighted men, re-order'd them, called every one
of them by their names, encouraged them, excited them to show their worth, in
(...), left nothing unattempted: But the Soldiers were so possessed with sudden
fear, as all that their Commanders could say or pray, was in vain; they could
not be made to stay neither by shame nor by command. There was not any one of
them that remembered their former worths, nor hopes. Thus in a moment the
fortune of War did so alter, as nothing was to be seen in our City (which but a
little before was as good as Conquerours) but fear, flight, and death. The
Soldiers being routed, and made to run, fled toward Vicenza, believing that
they might there save themselves. But those who were upon the Guard, fearing
lest in such a confusion, the Enemy might together with our men enter the City,
clapped to the Gates, and kept both Friends and Foes out. So as the Venetian
Soldiers, not being in a condition of re-ordering themselves, nor expecting
any succor from elsewhere, were almost all of them shamefully cut in pieces
before the City Walls, suffering themselves to be slain, without any revenge.
Many of them also who fled another way toward the River Rorone, finding the
Bridges broken, and not able to overcome the violence of the River, were
therein drowned. But Baglione, who as we told you, was past forwards by another
lower way, whilst he hasted to assault the Enemy, being intricated, and
hindered by the Bogs of the neighboring Valley, could neither then, according
to Alviano's directions, assault the main body of the Enemies, nor after our
men's Rout, get himself into any place of safety: Wherefore being environed on
all sides by the Enemy, he together with many of his Horse, fell into their
Power. But those who escaped so many dangers, by taking another way, got into
Padua, and Trevigi, amongst which were Alviano, and Gritti, who being gone to
Vicenza a little before, to raise men, was not present at the Battle. Of
Commanders there dyed, Sacramor^ Visco^te, Hermes Bentivoglio, Costanz^ Pio,
Francisco Sassarello, Alfonso da Parma, and Meleagro da Forli; who amongst
others had won very great Praise; for thrusting himself into the thickest ranks
of the Enemies, and killing many of them, he himself was at last slain. Many
also were taken Prisoners, either in the Battle, or as they ran away, among
which, of the better sort and who had any command in the Army, were Giovan
Paolo Baglione, Malatesta Malatesta, O^tone Visconte, Battista Savella, Pamfilo
Bentivoglio, and Allessandro Fregoso. But Commissary Loredano who whilst he
endeavored to stop the Fugitives, had forslowed his departure, was wounded,
and fell into the Power of the Enemy, and met with an end far unworthy such a
man; for two Dutch Soldiers striving which of their Prisoner he should be, the
one of them by slaying him, ended the contention. By this days Battle it may be
known what various and unexpected chances are occasioned by Fortune in War, and
what strange turns arise our of slight accidents. Those whose hopes lay first
more in their flight, then in their fighting, being of conquered become
Conquerours, pursued their routed Enemies with great cheerfulness, and courage;
and those who before the Conflict built upon assured Victory, being beaten,
overcome, put to flight, and having lost all hope, found no relief to their
miserable condition. The nearness of Vicenza was thought to be the chief
occasion of this our Armies so great calamity, and of so strange a variation;
for our Soldiers believing that they should there receive sure refuge, as soon
as disorder arose in our first ranks, the rest giving over the Battle, placed
all their hopes in their (...) On the contrary part, the Enemies being
environed on every side in an Enemies Country, were forced to defend
themselves, and boldly to encounter all danger. The place was likewise thought
to be very much prejudicial to our men; for the Plain being on that part very
narrow by the Neighborhood of the Valley, our men could not be all of them put
in good Order, nor could they make use of all their Forces; for that part of
the Army which was, as has been said, divided together with Baglione from the
rest, was not of any help, when the Battle began to retreat. Alviano was
greatly blamed by all men for these things; for that un-inforced by any
necessity, he would forsake the very strong situation which he had first chosen
to quarter in, and put himself upon the hazard of a Battle, when he might more
safely have overcome the Enemy by Counsel then by the Sword. It is most certain
that the importunate sollicitousness of the Venetian Commissary, and the
immature Counsel of the Commander in chief, made amends for the Enemies
unadvisedness, insomuch as Cardona who was the Author of their inconsiderate
departure, won Honor, and advantage, instead of the shame and prejudice which
he was threatened with. As soon as this unfortunate News came to Venice, the
Senators were greatly afflicted, seeing the condition of their Affairs so
strangely altered in a moment: The blow was the greater, for that by reason of
the Generals and of the Commissaries Letters, they had all of them conceived
hopes of an undoubted Victory; for they had informed the Senate but a little
before, that the Enemies Army was by them besieged, and already reduced to such
a necessity, as they had no means left, neither of running away, nor of trying
their Fortune by Battle; so as the Victory was in a short time to be assuredly
theirs, without loss of blood. Yet the Senators were not hereat so much
troubled, as to make them do any thing mis-becoming the Magnanimity, and
Dignity of that Order, which may be witnessed by this, that the very same day
wherein they received this unfortunate News, the Senate with a joint consent
resolved to write thus to Alviano.

That they could not deny but that they were somewhat troubled at this so
strange an accident, yet were they not thereat affrighted nor cast down; for
this adversity should rather awaken them to more diligence, then any whit
detract from the constancy of their minds; therefore they desired him to be of
good Courage, and not to yield to Fortune; for the News of his safety in whose
Valor they had always very much confided, was of great comfort unto them all,
amidst this their sore Loss; and that if he would still continue his ancient
stoutness of mind, they hoped they might yet be able to stop the Course of
their adverse Fortune, to assuage the severity thereof, and perhaps at last to
get the better of their Enemies, who were now Conquerours. That therefore he
should attend the defense of Padua and Trevigi, that he should employ all his
diligence, thoughts, and pains therein; that the Senate would be ready to
furnish him with Soldiers, Arms, Victuals, Moneys, and of all things that was
else needful.


After having written this Letter, the Senators betook themselves carefully to
advise of, and provide for all things that were requisite. Prince Loredano, who
was their Duke, speaking gravely in the Senate, exhorted them all to lend what
help they could with all possible spend to the afflicted Commonwealth, that
they were not at this time to expect help from any but themselves; that
therefore in this so great necessity the Country must have recourse to their
own Citizens; that every one should endeavor to raise her up again, and to
lend her their help and advice in what they were best able. As for himself he
would not forbear to do any things which might be servicea^le to his Country;
to which purpose he had already resolved to send his two Sons, Luigi, and
Bernardo presently away, the one to Padua, the other to Trevigi, and by readily
exposing them to all events to dedicate them to his Countr^.

These words spoken by the Duke, were of great efficacy, but the example
greater, by which many other young Gentlemen, the chiefest of the City, who
were of great worth and expectation, went to the Custody of those Cities:
Moreover many of the common sort of the City were listed, and many of the
Ar^enal, together with many Gally-slaves, and Mariners commanded (for at this
time many Galleys were luckily come to the City) to go suddenly to Trevigi; to
the taking of which City, the Enemy after their Victory, prepared to go. But
Prospero Colonna, by his Counsel and Authority put off the execution thereof
for a while.

Therefore having put off the Enterprise for many days, by propounding several
difficulties, at last he wrought it so, as before any resolution should be put
on, the whole business should be referred to that Bishop Gurghense; alleging,
that nothing could be done more to the prejudice of that Armies Reputation,
then to undertake any thing that might prove vain, as the business of Padua had
done, but a little before. Thus Cardona and Prospero agreed to go to Verona,
leaving the Army at Vicenza; where having spent some 20 days, Cardona agreed
with Maximillian Sforza to take his pay as General of all his men; and so
quitted the Service of the Spaniards. To make amends for which the Viceroy
made some Conductors of Gens d' Arms come with their Companies from Bergamo
and Brescia, saying, that as soon as they should be arrived, he would go to the
taking in of Trevigi, ^f Gritti, the Cavalliere della Volpe, Ugo de Popoli,
Giovan Paolo Manfrone, and other Commanders of great esteem, had the Custody of
this City; and at this time when the City was not molested by the Enemy, it was
sufficiently garrisoned and victuall'd: So as Cardona being advertised thereof,
and the Winter coming on, an unfit Season to fall upon such a business, he went
with all his Army into the Territories of Padua, and quartered his men in Este,
Montagnana, and Moncelese.

Thus only through the advantage of the Season, which forced the Enemy to lay
down their Arms, the Calamities of War which the State of Venice was likely to
have undergone, did for this year cease, and Affairs were brought to some short
condition of quiet.

This likewise was the only remedy for the many afflictions and adversities of
France; for the King of England who had taken Terwin and Tornai, two great
Cities, and who had slighted the Walls of the former, and put a strong Garrison
into the other, resolved to return with all his men to his own Kingdom, to the
end that his Army might be refreshed with commodious Winter Quarters. Thus the
W^r was not ended, but deferred till another Season, and so many remainders and
seeds of Discord continued still in all parts, as it was clearly seen, that
Arms must quickly be reassumed with greater Violence.

THE HISTORY OF VENICE, Written by PAULO PARUTA. BOOK II. THE CONTENTS.
SElino having possessed himself of the Ottoman Empire, during the life of his
Father Bajazet, renews the Peace with the Venetians. He suppresseth the
boldnes^ of his Brother Achamet by death. He begins to plot the destruction of
Italy, and of the Venetians. The Plots of Amurath, Son to Achomate, are
hindered. Pope Leo, having many things in consideration, cannot accord the
Christian Princes. Marano is lost by the means of Frangipane, a Rebel to the
Commonwealth; neither can it be re gotten. He sacks Strasoldo and Monfalcone.
Vicenza is sacked by Risano's means. Calepino not long after is routed, and
taken Prisoner. Udine, not making any resistance, surrenders it self to the
Dutch. The Fort Osofo cannot be taken by the Enemy.

Crema is defended by Renzo Ceri. Baglione is taken Prisoner by the Enemy. He
is changed for Caravagiale, a Spanish Prisoner. A miserable fire in the Rialto
of Venice. Alviano by order from the Senate goes to take in Friulye. He sacks
Porto Gruaro. Savorgnano's Victory. Frangipane is taken Prisoner. Gurghense
disturbs the Treaties referred by the Senate to the Pope, concerning the
differences with the Emperor. The King of England finds faults with the
Senates Counsels. They are justified by the Lieger Ambassador. Renzo frees
Crema from being besieged. Este is taken by night by Sculado, by Alviano; and
is plundered. The Spaniards cut to pieces. Alviano his Victory at Rovigo.
Bergamo returns into the Spaniards hands. The Viceroy of Naples is laughed at
for Alviano's retreat to Padua. Selino's Victories in Asia makes the Pope treat
again with the Venetians of Peace, but in vain; who whilst they make closer
Friendship with the French, King Lewis dies.

AT the same time that these things happened in Europe; in Asia Selino, during
the li^e of his Father Bajazet, possessed himself or the Ottoman Empire, hav^ng
ove^come h^s brother Achomate in several Battles, who pretended likewise to the
succession of the Empire; but though he had got the Victory by much Gallantry
in War, he was therein so very severe, as he gave clear and evident signs not
only of wonderful Magnanimity of mind, but also of great cruelty. Therefore all
Christendom was much afraid, that as soon as Selino should be rid of civil
Wars, he would turn himself against the Christ^an Kings, and be the cause of
much mischief. Which mischiefs though they were foreseen by all men, yet not
any one appeared to provide for the common safety. Wherefore the Venetians,
though the greatness of the Ottoman Emp^re did more molest them then others,
yet suffering under many adverse Fortunes, and weakened by many Wars, and
knowing that they could neither extinguish nor lessen his Power, they thought
it their best course to keep him their Friend, and to accommodate themselves to
the times. Therefore A^tonio Giustiniano was chosen to be sent Ambassador to
Selino, who w^^ in name o^ the Commonwealth to congratulate his accession to
the Empi^e, and also to ratify their ancient Friendship with the Ott^m^n
House, and to establish Peace. The Venetian Ambassador was received with great
Honor and alacrity by Selino in the City of Andrinopoli, where he and his Army
wintered. Selino knew he could no ways better secure his Dominions in Europe,
then by Peace, at this time, when he was to pass armed into Asia, to oppose his
brother Achomate, and by suppressing him to end the War. Achomate was fled to
Armenia the Le^s; where bewailing his Fortune, and desiring aid of the
Neighboring Kings, he had got together a good number of men, being assisted,
and succored by many, and especially by Hysmae Sofi, King gf Persia, who had
sent many Troops of Persian Horse into Achomates Camp; by which Forces being
enheartned, he had already taken many Towns in Capad c^a* and hastened to
assault Selino, who was not yet very well provided to resist him. Therefore
Selino finding that offered him, which he did so much desire, he willingly
embraced the Venetians Friendship, promising to keep it always inviolably.

Thus the Peace was renewed, and established, almost upon the same terms that
formerly it was made with Bajaset. Herein regard was had to contract such an
Amity, and good Intelligence on both sides, as not only the States ^f both
Princes should be free and secure from War to be made b^ e^ther of them against
the other, but that the Venetian and Turkish Subjects (who ^ad traffic much
at that time in eithers Jurisdiction) might have free and safe Commerce; and
also that safe Harbor might be permit^ed to the ships of b^th parties in all
their Countries; and that their Navigation by Sea should not be hindered.

The Venetians reap much advantage by the frequency of Merchants, who do bring
in, and export great store of Merchandise into Venice, where, for this their
Interest, they procure that people of all Nations may inhabit safely there, and
exercise Commerce. Giustiniano having agreed thus upon all things, he returned
for Venice. And Selino sent his Ambassador Alemb^i along with him, to the end
that what had been concluded by the Ambassador might be confirmed by the word
of the Prince. He also gave credential Letters to Alembei to present unto the
Senate, wherein highly magni^ying his own Power (according to the usance of
that Nation) he exhorted the Venetians to keep Friendship with him, which he
promised should on his side remain firm, and inviolabl^ for ever. The Turkish
Ambassador being come into the Senate House, Duke Loredano did before him, in
his own Name, and in the Name of the whole Commonwealth, swear to observe
whatsoever Giustiniano had concluded and agreed upon. Selino free from fear of
any War in Europe, since he had made Peace with the Venetians, and renewed
League with the Kings of Poland and Hungary, having speedily mustered as many
Horse and Foot as he could, marched toward Amasia to suppress Achomate before
he grew too strong. Fortune favored his Designs, for Achomate whilst he made
too much haste, and rashly put himself upon the event of Battle with but half
his men, was routed in fight, his Army made to run, and he himself by
Selilino's Commandment was slain. After whose death, all Asia the less fell
without any dispute into Selino's hands; who grew so proud by this good
success, as he began to promise unto himself already the Government of the
whole world. And having ended all civil Dissentions by the death of almost all
his kindred of the Ottoman Family, and being become sole lord of all the
strength, and riches of that Empire, he thought he should meet with less
difficulty in all other things. His mind was chiefly set upon Italy, thinking
he might easily subjugate it, since it was very weak and much wasted by long
Wars. He was hereunto likewise solicited by Maximillian the Emperor, who for
many years past, had left nothing untried whereby to plot the Venetians ruin.
He showed him how opportune a time it was to make this War, since Selino might
assault the Venetians in their Maritime parts, whilst he himself molested them
by Land, and kept their Forces busied elsewhere. But it does not appear with
what Preparations of War, or against what State more particularly the Turks
designed this Enterprise. It is most certain that Maximillian had sent his
Ambassadors to this purpose to Constantinople, and that his Embassage being
heard, many Mariners were listed, old Galleys were new calked, and new ones
built, and Order was taken for all things belonging to a great Maritime War.
These things were done in the Winter; but the next Spring News came to
Constantinople that Amurate, son to the late Achomate, who was not present at
the Battle unfortunately fought by his Father, and who was the only Surviver of
Bajazets Race, being fled into Persia, was unexpectedly entered Capadocia with
many Horse and Foot, laying the Country waste, and had what by Force, what by
fear reduced many Towns of that Province into his Power. At which Selino was
the more troubled, because he knew the Sophy, King of Persia, was the chief
occasion of this, and of the other troubles which he had formerly received from
his brother Achomate, whose Fame being very great both for extent of Empire,
and Glory of War, Selino though his own Dignity reproached, and lessened, if he
should any longer suffer such Injuries to go unrevenged. Wherefore quitting all
other thoughts, he resolved to go for Asia with all those men and that
Preparation for War, which he had formerly intended for Europe: Which, as is
confessed by all, fell out very happily, for the Princes of Christendom; since
just then when the War was hottest amongst them, this powerful Prince, whose
Enmity threatened great danger to their States, was enforced to forbear those
his designs, being busied in other War. By reason of these Selino's
Prosperities, and for the immoderate desire of rule which was seen to be in
him, Pope Leo began to be not a little troubled, he thought it became him and
his place, to employ all his power and diligence, to keep these potent and
formidable Barbarians from growing more powerful, who were already so much
increased both in all things belonging to the War, and in the extent of Empire,
through the discords of our Princes, having possessed themselves of many
Christian Kingdoms, almost without any gainsaying. The Cardinals upon this
occasion putting the Pope frequently in mind in the Consistory of his duty, and
of the imminent dangers, were resolved to make him reassume the Treaty of
Peace, nor to be quiet till he had effected it; to the end that Peace being had
amongst the Christian Princes, they might all of them with all their joint
Forces bend themselves against Selino the common Enemy. They showed plainly
that nothing appertained more to his charge and degree then this, or which at
least might be of greater glory to him: But the Pope, though he were of the
same mind, yet being troubled and perplexed he be-thought himself of many
things; for as this Counsel, if it should take good success, promised assured
Praise, so diverse considerations of Peace and War, and much difficulty which
appeared to be in the whole business, made him afraid and withheld him from
the Enterprise; for to put an end to so many Wars was of it self thought to be
a very difficult Affair, but more difficult to find out such a composure, as
Leo thought might prove good for him, and advantageous for the Affairs of the
Church* for he could have desired that the French might neither have been kept
so low, nor yet have been so exalted: If no remedy were to be found against
such great Preparations of War as were preparing against them, it was to be
feared that the Affairs of France might grow to so low an ebb, as they could
no longer give a just Counterpoise to the Dutch and Spanish Forces; so as they
being become Masters of all, they might at last put Fetters upon whole Italy;
but on the contrary, if the Enemies Forces being weakened, and divided by his
Counsels, France should be freed from so heavy a War, he knew he had not
sufficiently provided for his own safety, nor for the Liberty of Italy; for
nothing was more sure then that King Lewis being an Enemy to peace and quiet,
would never give over his ancient and natural desire of War: But that being
freed from the fear of the English Forces, and having put his own Affairs into
a sure condition, he would soon turn both his thoughts, and his Forces upon
Italy, for the recovery of the state of Millan: which might be evidently seen,
since that though he found himself beset by many difficulties, yet he had
always refused all conditions of Peace, which might make him quit his
pretentions to the State of Millan.

The Venetian Affairs were almost upon the same conditions the which the Pope
thought could not he reduced to such terms, but that they must bring great
difficulties along with them; for he desired that the Dignity of that
Commonwealth might not be much diminished, nor yet her Forces much increased.
He knew that it imported much for the Honor of all Italy, that the Venetian
Commonwealth should remain whole and entire; that to this end Pope Iulio had
endeavored the re-raising of her much abased condition, and that following for
the same reasons the last, and wisely taken Counsels of his Predecessor, he
had labored much to put the Venetians into a peaceable condition. But on the
other side, calling to mind their ancient greatness, he thought that if Fortune
should smile on them again, they would become no less formidable then the other
Potentates. Thus whilst he waver'd in his Resolves, sometimes hoping, sometimes
fearing, his proceedings were different and contrary; sometimes he showed
himself to be but ill satisfied with the Venetians and to be no good Friend of
theirs, other times he would appear well disposed toward them. Whilst the Pope
was thus doubtfully minded, the War continued still in the same heat, the
sharpness of the Winter not having any whit hindered it; for Prospero Colonna
being past with the Millaneses to Crema was joined with the Spaniards; so as
that City was the sorelier besieged. The Paduan Territories, wherein the
Viceroy had taken up his Quarters, were vexed with continual Inroads; and the
War grew sharper in Friuli, that Country having been some years before mightily
terrified; for not having any City or Citadel in it strong either by art or
situation, nor able to hold an Enemy play long, the Inhabitants were forced to
follow his Fortune whosoever was Master of the Field. But the Emperor, nor the
Venetians having neither of them any strong Army in that Country, the
unfortunate Inhabitants were by the various success of War, continually vexed
with Pillage, and Taxes: So as for a long time it had undergone much Calamity,
and they who were most affectionate to the Venetians, were by their Enemies
worst used. Amongst the rest Christofolo, Son to Barnardino Frangipane gave a
noteable Example of Cruelty; for after having burnt a certain Town in the
Territories of Marano, he commanded that all the Inhabitants should have both
their eyes put out, and that their right thumbs should be cut off, because they
adhered to the Venetians, and had hindered him from Victuals. Bernardino
Frangipane was a little before this turned Rebel to the Commonwealth, and had
sided with Caesar, and much vexed that whole Country. He often solicited the
Dutch Commanders, that drawing some Country people out of the next Towns of
Carnia and Carinthia, they should mischief the Territories, and Subjects of the
Commonwealth: So as these people entering into Friuli, not as Soldiers, nor
after the manner of War, but as Thieves and Murderers, they destroyed the
Country by plunder and fire, and robbed the Citizens of all that they had. By
which Injuries when the Venetians were at last constrained to send better
succors into that Country, to keep their Affairs from falling into farther
ruin, the Enemies who had no warlike Tackling, and who were come, as has been
said, rather to pillage then to fight; being loaded with Booty, when they heard
of our men's coming, hasted homewards. But hardly was this Country reduced to
quiet, when our men being to go elsewhere to oppose other designs of the
Enemies, who assaulted the State of the Commonwealth, not in one part only but
in many at one and the same time, either the same men who were but a little
before gone from thence, or others of the same sort, drawn by a desire of prey,
returned with great fury to assault the Territories of Friuli, insomuch as they
left not any thing at all to those unfortunate Inhabitants. The Enemies being
at this time grown very powerful, so as keeping in that Country, they kept some
Towns which they had gotten by fraud, longer then they had used to do, the
Senate thought it fit for their safety and reputation, to turn their Forces
into those parts, to the end that the Enemy might not grow more bold to their
prejudice, and that those people might not totally forego their love and esteem
of the Commonwealth. A little before this Frangipane had by fraud possessed
himself of the Fort Marano, having to this purpose made use of a wicked
perfidious Priest, Bartholomeo, who being familiarly acquainted with Alessandro
Marcello, Commissary of Marano, prevailed with him that one morning before day
a gate of the Town should be opened under pretense of going out early to hunt,
by which means Frangipane, (having formerly agreed thereupon with the Priest)
possessed himself of the gate, before which he was unexpectedly come with some
Dutch Foot Companies, and a Troop of Horse, wherewith he entered the Town. For
which wickedness the Traitor was justly punished; for being taken Prisoner by
Nicola Pisaro, Podesta of -- Porto Gruaro, he was sent to Venice, where he was
hung up by one foot, and stoned to death by the common people.

This Town, as it was very convenient for the Venetians, by reason of the
situation thereof, being placed in the innermost part of the Gulf, and washed
by salt water on the one side, so it being at one and the same time to be
assaulted both by Sea and Land, it promised speedy and good success to any one
that should fall upon it. Wherefore the Venetians resolved to make the taking
thereof their first business; to the end that if they should find easy success
therein, they might go to the recovery of Goritia, which being taken by the
like fraud by Frangipane, held for the Emperor. Baldissera Scipione, one of
Luca, went by order from the Senate to this Enterprise of Marano, together with
four other Conductors of Gens d' Arms, each of which commanded 50 Horse men;
besides all the light Horse, in number 500 under the Conduct of Ulatico
Cosazza, and of Nicolo da Pesaro, who were likewise to be accompanied by
Barnardino da Parma, with 400 Foot. To these Forces were added about 2000
Country people, whom Gierolamo Savorgnano (who was at this time of great
Authority with the people, and not less affectionate to his Commonwealth) had
gathered up from all the parts thereabout. Scipione commanded the whole Army,
who had the charge of all that was done by Land; but Bartholomeo da M^sto had
the charge of the Maritime Affairs, who was then Savio di Terra firma, a man
famous for his experience by Sea; he was followed by order from the Senate, by
the Podestu's of Murano, Torcello, Chioggia, and by those of Caurle and Pirano,
and of other Towns of Histria, who were all commanded to rig out as many Barks
as they could for this Enterprise; who being all met at the time appointed, the
whole Fleet past into the Washes of Marano, where when they were come, our men
sent Heralds to the Citizens, and Dutch Soldiers of the Garrison, to demand
restitution of that Town in the name of the Commonwealth; exhorting them not
to force them to use violence, but rather that they should lay aside all hopes
and thoughts of being able to defend themselves. But discovering thoughts much
of another nature in the Defendants, who returned injurious words, our men much
incensed, and being greatly desirous to re-gain the Town, they resolved not to
stay for the Arrival of some Galleys which were to come up unto them, but to
advance, and assault the Walls. But as soon as our armed Barks began to be
divided, and disordered by their Cannon shot, and many that were therein slain,
the Mariners and Gally-slaves who being unexperienced in War, and not
acquainted with danger, had earnestly desired to be led on to the Assault, were
strangely terrified, and falling to their Oars every one as fast as they
might, they endeavored to carry the Barks out of the reach of the Artillery,
being more indamaged in their flight by the fear and confusion which they were
in. Our men being thus taught their danger by experience, durst make no farther
Attempts till more aid was come up unto them; but four lesser Galleys being
afterward come up unto the Fleet, whereby they were made the stronger, and the
better encouraged, they resolved to assault the Town again. The Walls were
lower, and the Towers much battered by the Artillery on the side which was
toward the Haven, wherefore our men thought they might land the easilier on
that side; and to the end that the Enemy being kept busied in diverse parts,
might be the less able to resist, they thought their Enterprise might prove the
more successful, since the Town was set upon at the same time by the Fleet by
Sea, and by Scipione and Savoragnano by Land. The business began now to have
good success, when those Land-men that were with Scipione, and some others that
were got out of the Galleys, and had landed some Artillery, were kept from
coming nearer the Walls, by a great deluge of water which fell from the Skies,
which filled all the Plain and Marrish Grounds which were round about the Town.
The Defendants being therefore safe on that side, ran all to the other side
where they were assaulted by the Fleet, and repulsed our men, who began already
to scale the Walls. At the same time that these things were a doing, the
Soldiers which were sent by Scipione to possess themselves of the Passes, and
to keep the besieged from being relieved by any succors which might come from
Gorilia, which is not above 20 miles from thence, sent Savoragnano word, that
Frangipane was drawing near with a great many men; so as if they had not more
help sent speedily to them, they should be forced to quit those places, not
being able with a few men long to resist a far greater number. Savoragnano
hearing this, and dispairing now to take the Town by Assault, marched suddenly
with his men thitherward; and was hardly advanced one mile when he met those
very men, who had but a little before sent to him for succor; for being
terrified at the fame and great opinion which was had of the Enemies Forces,
they durst not tarry till they came: Wherefore joining them with his own men,
he went to find out the Horse, who were within their own quarters, in somewhat a
higher place, not far from the rest of the Army, that they might be ready upon
any occasion to wait upon the enemy, according as they should see them move.
Savorgnano strove by entreaties, and all other means to persuade the Horsemen
to come nearer Marano, and join with the rest of the Army, showing them what
had been done, and what was to be done; which as not concerned any ways in
point of shame, they refused to do: Some of them being frighted by what was
commonly noised in the Camp touching the great Power of the Enemy, other
mutinying for not receiving their pay in due time; so as many began to forsake
their Colors, and dissolve their Companies. Wherefore Savorgnano fearing that
the strongest part of the Army might be weakened, and that the Commonwealths
Forces might be thereby diminished, endeavored to persuade the Gens d' Arms
to retire toward Udine, into a place of safety, promising to go along with
them, and to secure the way. In this Interim, Frangipane, meeting with no
obstacle, advanced, and entered safe with all his men into the Town of Marano;
and without any delay, taking along with him the Dutch Foot that were of the
Garrison, he unexpectedly went out of the Town, and assaulted our men before
they were aware of his being come; wherefore possessed with fear, they began to
run, thinking on nothing but how they might every one of them save themselves.
The Enemy pursuing our affrighted and scattered men, some of which endeavored
to pass over the Washes, others to get unto the Fleet, cut them in pieces, and
made themselves Masters of their Quarters, and of some pieces of Artillery:
Moreover one of our Galleys, which was too late in putting forth, and could not
get free by reason of the Ebb, fell into the power of the Enemy. Scipione
being struck on the head with a stone, recovered the Fleet by swimming, though
he were almost half dead. Bobizza was this day slain, a gallant man, and who in
several Battles had given great Testimony of his Valor: Those who saved
themselves by flight, got into Udine. In this so great fear and confusion, one
of ours only, Francisco Trono, Captain of a Gally, won some praise; for being
mindful of the Venetian Dignity, he with a few of his Soldiers, did valiantly
with-stand the first Encounter of the Enemy, nor did he forsake his station,
till all his men were either slain or sorely wounded. Frangipane, making use of
his victorious Fortune, went forthwith to Strasoldo, and to Monfalcone, two
Towns in Friuli, and finding little or no Garrisons in them, took them at his
very first appearance, and pitifully plundered them. At the same time, some
other Dutch Foot Companies, fell unexpectedly upon the Territories of Vicenza,
these being got together from the neighboring parts of Carnia by the two
Captains, Rifano, and Calepino, sacked many Towns of that Country, and even
Vicenza it self. Then dividing their Army, they went to plunder the
neighboring places; Calepino went toward Feltre, and on the sudden possessed
himself thereof; but hardly was he three days Master of it, when he was driven
out by Giovan Bradolino, who being sent by Commissary Girolino Pesaro to
relieve that City, did behave himself very valiantly; for having assembled a
great number of Country people in the Valley of Marino, he past speedily with
them and with his light Horse into those parts, and forced the Enemy, who were
affrighted at his unexpected coming, to abandon the City, and save themselves
by flight. But Calepino being driven out of Feltre, retired into the confines
of Bassano, intending to sack that Town: whereof Francisco Duedo, Major of that
Town being advertised, he assembled together many of the Inhabitants of the
neighboring Towns, and calling Bernardino Antignola with his Troop of light
Horse into his aid, he went to meet the Enemy, who being by him assaulted at
the Town of Carpenedo, amidst the strait passages of the Mountains, were
routed, and dispersed. It made much for our men, that they were acquainted with
the places, which made the Victory the greater and the more easy. Many of the
Enemies were slain, and many taken Prisoners, amongst which their chief
Commander Calepino, very few came off safe. But Risano who had taken his way
toward Goritia with 800 Foot and 300 Horse, meeting with Frangipane by the
way, who was come from thence, he joined his Forces to his, which amounting in
all to about 5000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, they jointly resolved to go to the
taking in of Udine. When this News came to Venice, Malatesta and Giovan Gitturi
were speedily sent toward Udine; the one as Commissary General of the Militia
of Friuli, the other Commissary of the Camp; these when they came to Udine;
where they found Girolamo Sourgano, began to consult with him, and with the
Governors of the City, how they were to govern the War. Many things were
variously propounded: Some were of opinion that they should chiefly endeavor
the safety and defense of Udine, others were of another opinion, that they
should quit the City, and remove with their Army into some safer place: Those
that were thus minded, pleaded that they understood by the Spies, that
Frangipane was marching thitherward with his men, and that he would suddenly
sit down before the City, the defense whereof would be very doubtful and
difficult for many reasons: Their small number of Soldiers, no train of
Artillery at all, and generally a want of all things necessary for War; and
notwithstanding the City was very large, begirt but with a very weak Wall,
which would require many valiant men to defend it. But many good reasons being
alleged to the contrary, they were doubtful what to resolve upon: Their hopes
were somewhat bettered, when they considered that the Enemies Army consisted
altogether of Country people, unexperienced in War, that their Commanders had
neither experience nor reputation, that they had but few Guns, and that they
had not men enough to besiege the City. At last, after mature advice, they all
agreed, that they would defend the City, provided that the Citizens should
promise they would take up Arms, as well as the Soldiers, and do all the
duties of the Militia; for besides the Horse and some few Country people there
was but 400 Foot in the City, which were no ways sufficient to guard the Walls,
and sustain the Assault of the Enemy. Savoragnano was therefore enjoined to try
how the Citizens stood affected, and what might be expected from them. He
therefore calling before him many of the best and valiantest men of the City;

He exhorted them to take up Arms for the safety of their Country, and Honor
of the Commonwealth, and that being moved by the desire of praise, and by
their own danger, they would strive to keep the cruel Enemy far from their own
homes. He showed them what they were to do for their own defense, and how an
idle fear of the Enemy might turn to their real ruin; that if things were
rightly cast up, they needed nothing but Courage, and a stout resolution to
defend themselves; that if they would show themselves willing to do this,
though but for a short while, making at least but an appearance to fight, and
to stand the Assault, the Enemy who had undertaken this business, not out of
any desire of Glory, but out of Booty, confiding more in the small numbers of
our Soldiers then in their own Worth, would doubtlesly soon quit the
Enterprise: So as within a few days they might free their City from the great
danger it was in: what could they hope for of any truth from the Enemy? And how
bitter use were they accustomed to make of their Victories, was known
sufficiently by woeful experience to that whole Country; that if they should
resolve to submit themselves to the will of the Enemy without making any
resistance, they could not notwithstanding have any hopes of saving the City,
for it was almost impossible to keep the Dutch Soldiers from committing
Insolences, who were usually greedy of Booty, but now almost necessitated
thereunto for want of pay: So as they were to expect nothing but plunder.

Thus did Savoragnano endeavor to encourage the Citizens, partly out of a
desire of praise, partly out of fear of having their City sacked. But they
differed in their opinions: Some of them moved by Savorgnano's Authority,
promised willingness to be assistant in all things, and to obey the Commanders
will; others though they seemed to be of the same mind, yet laying the fault
upon others, said that all they could do would be to no purpose; for that they
were more then jealous that the Soldiers of the Garrison would betray them,
since some of them had said publicly, that if the Enemy should draw any
nearer, they would quit the City: Moreover they excused themselves as being
unacquainted with what belonged to War, so as let them do what they could they
should do no good, nor could they long undergo Military Duties. Those who at
the beginning seemed to be somewhat moved by Savorgnano's Speeches beginning
now to be irresolute and fearful, the Commanders upon fresh debate resolved not
rashly to expose all the Chivalry that was in the City to danger: Thus both
Horse and Foot went out of the City, and marched toward the Liuenza that they
might pass over it, and get into some safe place; fearing lest the Enemy might
prevent them, and hinder their passage: and Savorgnano went to Osofo, a Castle
in his Jurisdiction, to put a Garrison into it, to defend it, when the Enemy
should be farther advanced. Thus Udine being quite bereft of all defense,
yielded quickly to the Dutch, upon condition that the Citizens lives and goods
should be preserved, and upon payment of a thousand Ducats to the Army, to
keep the City from being sacked. Cividale, Porto Gruaro, and other Towns,
compounded with the Enemies upon like terms; and the Enemy not finding
wherewith to feed their Army any longer in that Region, which they had wholly
overrun and pillaged, went toward Trevigi, to join with the Spanish Foot, who
wintered in the Territories of Vicenza and Padua; that so being become stronger
they might fall upon any Town or City, that should hold for the Commonwealth;
there was only one thing that did obviate this result, to wit, the leaving of
the Fort Osofo behind them, which might be a hinderance to the Victuals and men
which were to come to them out of Germany. This business and the occasion seem
to require that the nature and situation of this place be particularly shown,
and described as if it were in a Map.

The Mountain Lauro, is as it were cut off in many parts on that side which
divides Italy from the Dutch, affording sometimes by Valleys, sometimes by no
very high Mountains, an easy passage from the one Region to the other; but the
readiest and best is that which leads from Vilacco to Venzone, which is
commonly called the Imperial Way. When coming from Germany into Italy by this
way, you arrive at a certain place called L' Ospitale, the Mountains extending
themselves into two several arms, do divide; the one of which turns Westward
toward Trent, the other to the contrary side toward Goritia, the former are
called Carnician Alps, the other the Giulian. All that Country which lies in
the midst between these two Mountains, and turns toward the Eastern Sea, is
now called Friuli; as soon as you come out of this row of Mountains, you see
the Castle Osofo, which is not above two miles from the bottom of these
Mountains; the Castle is placed upon a little rock of stone, which rises up in
that Plain, as if it were placed there by Nature it self to preserve Italy from
the Forces of such Foreign Nations as have the easier passage on that side to
us. And consequently it is fortified and secured by Nature, just as such strong
Holds are used to be by humane Art. The Mountain has three sides; that which
looks toward the East is watered by the River Tagliamento, and on each of the
sides some little heaps of Stones are raised up, like so many little Towers, so
as they afford commodity for the defense of themselves, and of the space that
lies between them. Upon one corner of the Mountain there stands a little Rock,
which is severed from the Mountain by a little Valley, the Rock being about 20
paces long, and but 8 over; a high and strong Wall is raised hereupon,
whereupon stands a work, whereby all that space being a little more heightened,
is made a safe Fort. The Mountain is naturally sterile, unmanured, and very
steep on all sides, save only upon one, on which side the rise is less
difficult.

Frangipane having brought almost all his Army to this place, resolved to
attempt the taking of Osofo, being thereunto the more enheartned, for that
having at the same time that he drew near to it, sent some of his men to take
in the Castle Chiusa, he suddenly effected it, and put a good Garrison
thereinto; for our men did shamefully surrender it to the Enemy at their very
first appearance, not so much as waiting for the approach of cannon. This place
is by its natural situation very strong, being placed in the very jaws of the
Mountains, so as it became as it were a Gate which shut up the way to those who
would on that side enter into the state of the Commonwealth, from whence it
was called Chiusa. When therefore the castle Osofo should be taken, the Enemy
had nothing else to hinder them; for being abundantly furnished with men and
provisions from Germany, they might easily make themselves Masters of all
Friuli, and make a longer abode there then they had yet done. But Savoragnano
trusting upon the strength of the situation, and upon the valor of his men,
though he had not above one hundred Foot, and fourscore cross-bow men on
Horseback, to boot with some Country people, hoped to be able to defend the
Castle against all that the Enemy could do; and to this purpose had chosen
Theodoro Burgio Captain of his Horse, whose Loyalty and Valor was very well
known to him, and who did very good service in this Siege. The Enemy pitched
their Camp on that side which looks toward the South, and began to play upon
the Castle with ten piece of Cannon, wherewith having thrown down part of the
Wall, they had made some other works, like unto a Pent-house, whereby being
sheltered, the Soldiers prepared for another Assault. But Savoragnano to
provide against this imminent danger, went from the Castle into another work,
where sparing for no labor, he diligently provided for all things, and did
much encourage the Soldiers by his example. The Enemy strove to open their way
by a continual Battery, that they might bring on their Soldiers to an Assault;
but all in vain, for the lower part of the work, being made of soft stone,
received all the shot without any prejudice, and the upper part of the Wall
being built of Brick, though it were beaten down by the Cannon, yet falling
inwards, it served the Defendants for a Rampiere. Wherefore the Enemy
dispairing to get the Victory that way, resolved to try another, and to open
their way into that work by new Engines. They put some rafters together at the
foot of the Mountain, in somewhat an eminent place made like Towers about some
ten foot high of earth, by standing wherein they hoped they should be the
better able, and with less disadvantage to fight those that did defend the
work. But Savorgnano planting his Artillery on the opposite part of the
Mountain before these raftters were raised any higher, began to trouble them,
and finally by many shot beat it down to the ground. All the hopes the Enemy
had lay now in their Soldiers Valor. Wherefore Frangipane having chosen out
the valiantest of all his Army, prepared for the Assault, drawing near the
Walls by those very steps which were formerly made by Savorgnano and cut out of
the hard Rock, that they might be of use for the Castle. But herein their many
Attempts did likewise prove vain, for they were always stoutly repulsed by
Savoragnano's Soldiers, who did not only make use of their Weapons against
them, but tumbled down great stones upon them, which precipitating from those
steep crags, and falling upon them that were underneath, proved very mortal to
them: So the Enemy were forced to fall from assaulting the Castle to besieging
it. Those within had Victuals and Wine enough to serve them for a long time,
but so great scarcity of water, as the greatest part of their Horses being
already dead for want thereof, there was hardly enough left to make bread with.
The Senate did this mean while encourage Savoragnano with many Letters, and did
invite him to a greater desire of praise; they said they did all of them very
much confide upon his Worth and Loyalty, for which he might promise himself an
answereable reward from the Commonwealth, which was always very grateful to
her well deserving Subjects; that when his Glory and the like of his Soldiers
should be considered by all men, it would be immortal; but that the Senate in
particular would be always mindful of his deserts. It is hard to be said how
much joy and good hopes these praises and encouragements did infuse into the
Besieged: And it so fell out as they were also befriended by divine Providence;
for there fell such store of rain as did suffice a long while for all their
occasions: Wherefore it was thought that the supply which was long before
treated of in the Senate, might safely be deferred unto another time.

Whilst these things past thus in Friuli, the Venetians Affairs went
prosperously on in Lombardy, though all things were not quiet there; for the
Spaniards and Sforzeses being encamped (as has been said) before Crema, Renzo
da Ceri had very valiantly defended that City, rendering all the Enemies
endeavors vain, who had gone about the taking of it both by Assault and Siege:
Nay the Soldiers of the Garrison had much indamaged the Enemy by many bold
Sallies, and returned safe into the City. Renzo being advertised by his Spies
that Cesare Feramosca, one of the Spanish Commanders was come with 50 Gens d'
Arms, and 50 light Horse, to take ^p his Winter Quarters at Calcinato, a Town
in the Bergamasco Territories, about 20 miles from Crema, thought he had a fair
occasion offered him, of doing a noteable Act, if he should assault at unawares
the Enemy, whilst they lay lazying, not apprehending any danger, but thinking
themselves safe by reason of the season of the year. He chose out three valiant
men, in whose Worth he thought he might very much confide, to wit, Silvestro
Nerni, Baldisera da Rastano, and Marcello Astoldo, the first two being Foot
Captains, the last a Commander of Curassiers; he acquainted them with what they
had to do, and told them that the chief hope of dispatching the Enterprise lay
in expedition; they with all diligence and courage strove to do what was
committed to their trust. They went in the dark of night out of the City, and
got to Calcinato before day, where they entered the Town by Scalado, not meeting
with any resistance, and possessing themselves suddenly of the Gates, they let
in the Horse, and the remainder of the Foot, and having guarded the Gates, they
fell to pillage the Country (the Enemy being astonished at the unexpected
chance) and made themselves Masters both of the Goods, and persons of the
Inhabitants, not receiving any the least harm themselves. Which being done, our
men returned to Crema loaded with prey, and much commended for so noble an
Action, Renzo's diligence and vigilance was highly commended; for that with a
constant and undaunted courage, being long opposed by the Enemy both with Sword
and Famine, he had not only with-stood them, but had much indamaged them. But
the more he was cried up, the more desirous was he of Glory. He was very
careful in observing the Enemies removals and abodes; he considered both place
and time, when any occasion might be offered of doing some other handsome
Action: and being advertised that Count Santa Severina was in the Territories
of Brescia with 50 Gens d' Arms at Quinzano, he suddenly bethought himself how
to be Master of them; the which that he might the more safely do, he intended
to deceive the Enemy with a piece of Military cunning. Hearing that many of the
Enemy were got to the Town of Triogol^, and fearing lest his men might receive
some prejudice by these either as they went to Quinzano or in their return from
thence, he sent 20 Horse with ten Drums into the Territories of Cremona, who
were to pass by all the Towns beating an Alarm, and making a great noise, to
affright the Inhabitants, and make them believe that the Enemy was at hand, so
as they should (as they did) retreat speedily into Trigoli, where shutting to
the Gates, they endeavored to secure the Town, expecting every moment to be
assaulted. In the interim those that were sent by Renzo about this business,
came speedily to Quinzano, and falling at unawares upon the Gens d' Arms that
were in the Town, took them all, and their Commanders Prisoners, and took much
corn, cattle, and other things from those Territories which were of great use
to the Besieged in Crema. The readiness of the Citizens and Country people to
serve the Commonwealth to the utmost of their Power was a great furtherance to
Renzo in doing these things; for they did not only show themselves willing to
do what was commanded them, but when money was wanting to pay the Soldiers,
(for all the Avenues were shut up, so as moneys could not be safely sent from
Venice) the Citizens maintained the Army at their own charge: No News was ever
heard of yielding, no complaining upon the times, no weariness of being
besieged, nor of so many burdens and toil; all things were governed with great
concord and good order, as if the City had been in great quiet, and far from
any danger or trouble of War; and yet another great mischief was added to all
their sufferings, for the Plague began to grow hot amongst them.

For which the Senate charged the Magistrates to thank the Citizens in the Name
of the Commonwealth, promising them that these their good Services should be
kept in perpetual Memory, and that their Deserts should be acknowledged, and
rewarded even to posterity: That they knew their singular Worth and Loyalty:
That therefore they might promise unto themselves all things which could be
expected from a grateful Commonwealth, which did always willingly embrace and
very much cherish all such as were faithful and valiant.

The Senate did likewise commend Renzo da Ceri, as they had done many times
before, striving to confirm him in the loyalty and worth which he had hitherto
shown; and herein they used many gracious expressions, exalting his deserts, so
to honor that man with praise, (which is the reward of Virtue) who was so
desirous of Glory, and to invite him to the undertaking of other worthy
Enterprises.

They said, That the Venetian Soldiers had learnt to overcome under the
Conduct of such a Commander, who by the greatness of his Courage had overcome
even the greatest difficulties, and made them appear easy; that they expected
yet greater things from his Gallantry.

And having occasion soon after to show themselves thankful to so well
deserving a man, he was by general consent chosen to succeed Giovan Paolo
Baglione in his Office, who having ended his Conduct, had taken his leave of
the Venetian Army. Baglione being taken Prisoner, as you have heard, in the
unfortunate Battle at Vicenza, had got leave of the Spanish Commanders to go to
Venice, upon exchange for Caravagiale, a Spanish Commander, which if he could
effect he was to have his liberty, but if otherwise he was to return Prisoner
to the Enemy. Baglione got leave of the Senate for the exchange, and Captain
Caravagiale was carried from Venice to Padua; but Gurghense, without whose
knowledge this exchange was made, opposed it, saying it was not to be observed,
the quality of the persons not being alike, nor the good which might redound to
the several Princes by the Exchange. Wherefore Baglione thinking he was free
from his Parole, since the fault proceeded not from him, refused to return any
more Prisoner to the Enemy, and having obtained leave of the Venetians, went to
Rome, whither he was sent for by the Pope. Baglione held the next place in
Dignity after Alviano, who was the Venetians General; his pay was 30000 Ducats
a year, and he was bound to have in his Troop 200 Gens d' Arms, and 100 light
Horse. His place was granted to Renzo upon the same conditions, but he refused
it;

Rendering notwithstanding many acknowledgments to the Senate, who of their own
free wills had conferred that Honor upon him who was absent, and had no ways
sought it, though it was wont to be much put for by others; he told them that
his abode in Crema at this time of many eminent dangers, was of much
concernment to his own Honor, and to the service of the Commonwealth; that he
desired nothing more then to preserve that City to the Commonwealth; that he
knew very well the Senate had offered him that preferment, not to invite him to
serve them well and faithfully, but to witness the love they bore him; for
nothing could now add to his ancient affection, which he knew he could not
more apparently manifest, then in defending that City.

There were some who thought Renzo the more to be commended for having
preferred Worth it self before the badg of Worth; but many suspected what did
afterward appear by many signs more clearly: to wit, that Renzo would not be
obliged to go unto the Army, because he bore a secret enmity to Alviano, and
shunned to be under the command of another, especially of one who was of so
severe a nature, and who was no very good friend of his.

Whilst these things went thus, the year of our Lord 1514 began, and began
unfortunately; for on the 10th of January, the first hour after midnight* some
shops fell on fire in the Rialto (which is seated in the midst of the City, a
place much frequented, and held in great esteem for the happy Auspice of the
Cities first rise, which began first to be built there, and wherein all things
are usually sold) which fire taking hold of the neighboring houses, did soon
mightily increase, and in a moment burnt many public Buildings, and great
store of Merchandise of all sorts; and for the greater misforfortune, the wind
blew very furiously then from the North, which carried the fire into the most
remote parts of the City; and the houses that were nearer hand were soon
irreparably consumed; there was not any one who either by Council or Action
could suppress the violence of the fire, in this sad and sudden chance, and in
this confusion, which filled the whole City with fear, though the Nobles and
common people flocked presently thither from all places. The fire dilating it
self on all sides got to the Pescaria on the one side, and on the other side to
the Temple of Santo Apollinare, (places which stood far asunder) miserably
consuming, and throwing all things down to the ground. Many gallant Ornaments
of the City, and much wealth of private people, which was long in gathering,
perished almost in a moment, which caused great lamentation, and outcries
throughout the whole City: The Citizens and Merchants bemoaned themselves that
their so long labors should be so soon lost; others were more troubled at this
misfortune, as if it fore-boded greater mischiefs; they began now to fear the
greatest: Some in these common afflictions showed some more moderation; for
being inured to so many afflictions, they were not easily sensible of new
sorrows. It was never clearly known whether this happened by chance, or by the
Enemies abominable wickedness; yet by many tokens it was thought that the fire
was fraudulently and by cunning conveyed into those shops where it first brake
forth. Thus at this time nothing was free from the treachery of the Enemy. The
Senate though perplexed with so many adversities, managed the War with their
wonted constancy, and did not slacken in providing for all things which might
either maintain their Honor, or obviate the Enemy. But the Affairs of Friuli
did chiefly trouble them; for Frangipane, having (as you have heard) possessed
himself of many places of the Country, did still besiege Osofo. Many of the
Senate were of opinion, that they should gather all the Forces they could
together, and endeavor to relieve Savorgnano: Others were of a contrary
opinion, affirming,

That they had already sufficiently tried the fortune of War, and that the many
damages which they had suffered, might teach them and others, to how many
various and uncertain chances Battles are subject, and how often it falls out
that men come to a day of Battle even against the determinate will of the
Commanders. That after so many losses the best course would be to endeavor the
keeping of Trevigi and Padua, and to reduce all their Garrisons thither,
knowing that upon the event of these two Towns the end of the whole War would
finally depend. Wherefore they were not now without necessity to alter their
managing of the War, nor suffer those Cities for want of better Garrisons to be
exposed to the will of the Enemy: That they should consider their men were much
diminished, become less loyal, and less ready for Military Actions, by reason
of their slow pay: But that they were chiefly cast down by reason of the last
rout; so as it was hardly to be known whether their worth or fidelity were less
to be trusted to; that therefore they should not proceed contrary to their
ancient custom, and contrary to their last resolution: who could be sure that a
powerful Army of the Enemy being so near, and succor so far off, some tumult
might not be raised in those very Cities, either out of fear or desire of
Novelty, especially when the whole War, nay the total of all things, was
committed to a few, and those not over valiant?

Others on the contrary, amongst which were Antonio Grimani, who then held the
place of Savio del Consiglio, and Luca Trono, one of the Council of six, who
endeavored by all the means they could that succor should be sent to
Savorgnano; and that the recovery of the Towns in Friuli should be put for.

These showed how that the Commonwealth was much concerned in the preservation
of Osofo not only out of hopes that by the means thereof, other places in
Friuli might be preserved or recovered, but for the preservation even of those
very Cities which by common consent were to have a high esteem put upon them.
Assuredly ( said Trono) nothing has retarded Frangipane from not arriving safe
at the Spanish Army, but his fear of leaving this strong Hold behind him; which
if it should fall into the hands of the Enemy, there was no other thing which
could hinder them from coming with all their Forces quickly into the
Territories of Padua, by whose assistance the Spaniards being become the
stronger, they would suddenly attempt the taking of Padua or Trevigi, which we
know is the thing they chiefly desire, and that their not having done it
hitherto, has only been, because they dare not venture upon it with so few
men, as do not exceed 4000 Foot, and 600 Horse; therefore when mention is made
of sending relief to Osofo, it must be granted that the preservation of those
Cities is treated of; so as though we cannot promise our selves easily to rout
Frangipanes Forces, yet the advantage is not small which we shall receive by
sending our Army into that Country, since the Enemy will be thereby
necessitated not to make any longer abode in those parts, and to forbear
plotting our farther ruin. Our late experience may teach us how dangerous a
thing in War it is to suffer the Enemies to join together, meet, and s^
increase their Forces, when they must fight though they be but weak and
divided; for if the French Commanders had been better advised at Novara, and
had endeavored either to fight the Spaniard, who expected the coming of the
Switzers, or had else encountered the Switzers who came to relieve the Besieged,
all things would have succeeded more prosperously with them, since one only
Enemy would have been the more easily overcome, and the others would have been
made afraid: If we shall abandon the Towns, Lands, Men, and the Goods of our
Subjects of Friuli, leaving all things in the power of bitter, but weak
Enemies, without endeavoring any revenge, I am shrewdly afraid we may fall
into such contempt both of our Enemies, and of our own men, as that the Honor
of our Commonwealth will fall too low to be ever raised up again, all men
being already of opinion, that the Commonwealth of Venice is reduced to so low
a condition, as she is either not able, or else not willing to secure them from
injuries, who live under her Jurisdiction, and who have always been faithful to
her. But if by showing courage we shall strive to repair the losses we have
received, our men will be inheartned again, and the Enemy will be more humble:
and we may hope to enjoy the Country more qui^tly hereafter: No man is ignorant
of what importance and convenience the Castle of Osofo is; and the stronger it
is by natural situation, the more carefully it ought to be kept; for if it
should fall once into the hands of the Enemy, we cannot hope easily to recover
it, as we have done other Towns; for the Enemy having taken, as we are informed
they have, the Castle Chiusa, they will always have the way open whereby to be
abundantly furnished with Artillery, Victuals, and all things necessary for War.

The Senate being persuaded by these reasons, resolved to draw out as many men
as they could out of Padua and Trevigi, and send them to Friuli, leaving
Theodoro Triulcio the mean while in Padua, with charge of all the Militia, and
with him Dominico Contarini, who being Captain of Padua, was made Commissary.
The business of Friuli was committed to Alviano, the Senate having formerly
given him charge to proceed with much safety, and not to pass with his Army
over the Livenza, unless he had certain knowledge which way the Enemy went, and
were sure to return quickly; for it was thought very dangerous, lest the Dutch,
when our men should be gone far off, might pitch in some strong seat to hinder
their passage, till such time as the Spaniards hearing of Alviano's departure
might come in unto their aid, and so our Camp might be at the same time beset
with two Enemies Armies. Alviano took 700 commanded men with him out of Padua
and 400 Horse, the one half whereof were Albaneses, and came in two days march
to Sacile, whither it was said that the Horse and Foot which were come out of
Udine, were retired to save themselves. Alviano understanding here that 500 of
the Enemies Horse were in Porto Gruaro, from whence they were often wont to go
out and skirmish with our Horse in the Plain which lies between Sacile and
Porto Gruaro, he suddenly drew forth into the field, and sent the light Horse
before, with commission that when they should come within sight of the Enemy,
they should provoke them to fight. The Enemy according to their custom, were
easily persuaded to come out of the Town, and began to skirmish with our men,
who according to their directions retreated; the Enemy pursued them, and not
knowing that the rest of our men were come, drew at unawares near our Army;
then Malatesta Baglione, who was sent with a hundred Curassiers to succor the
former who had begun to give way, seeing that the Enemy could not well retreat,
fell furiously upon them, and amongst the rest, charged Captain Risano, who was
easily known by his Arms and by his corpulency of body; whom he hurt
dangerously, unhors'd him, and took him Prisoner; the rest having lost their
Captain, after a whiles fight, began to run, and got into Porto Gruaro; but
Alviano, though night drew on, pursuing the flying Enemy immediately clapped
ladders to the Town Walls, and his Soldiers being gotten upon the Walls,
fought with those that were upon the Guard, and after long dispute, drove the
Guard from the Walls and entered the Town, and sacked the whole Town, as well
what belonged to the Townsmen, as to the Soldiers, and took a hundred
Curassiers that were in the Town, Prisoners.

After this fortunate success, Alviano resolved to march toward the relief of
Savoragnano, who having valiantly repulsed the Enemy, did still maintain the
Castle of Osofo: Frangipane hearing of the coming of our men, set fire
presently upon all the works which he had made about the Castle, and raised his
Camp, marching with his Army toward Germany; but being come into the Town of
Venzone, and fearing that he was pursued by Alviano's Forces, as indeed he was,
he resolved to make all his Chivalry stay there, to retard the Enemy, that
thereby the Foot might have the more time to get into some place of safety. But
Alviano, hearing that the Enemy were gone, sent Nicolo Vendramino soon after
them, with the Albanese Horse, and Barnardino Antignolo with the remainder of
the light Horse, hoping that if they made haste they might reach Frangipane.
But he was past a little forward, and having gotten over the Tagliamiento, had
taken up his Quarters in the Castle of St. Daniele. Vendramino and Antignola,
were so diligent in their March, as finding the Enemies Horse at Venzone, they
fell upon them, cut most of them in pieces, and took the rest Prisoners; but
the Foot which were marched forwards with the carriages, escaped; our Horse not
being able to follow them by those steep and craggy Rocks. Yet could they not
well save themselves; for the Siege being raised, Savoragnano issued out of the
Castle, and having assembled together 200 Horse, and a good company of Country
people, pursued the Enemy by way of the Carnisen Alps, and his Forces
increasing where so ere he went, (for the Country people were very much
affectionate to the Venetians, who led him by secret and shorter ways) he was
got before Alviano's Horse, and assaulting the Dutch Foot had so routed them,
as they were forced to leave their Baggage behind them, and seven pieces of
great Artillery, which rendered the Victory more clear and remarkable. They say
that Frangipane pleaded for excuse, that he was at this time much indisposed by
reason of a blow which he had received on the head by a stone, whilst he lay
before Osofo, which disabled him for providing for such things as were fitting
for the safety of his Army. Yet he could provide for his own safety; for as
soon as the Enemy fell upon his men, he, with 30 of his Horse fled, and got
into a safe place; but this was but for a short time; for being soon after
cured of his hurt, as he was riding amongst the neighboring Mountains, to
raise new tumults, and gather more men to renew the War, he fell into an ambush
which was laid for him by Giovan Vitturi, and was by him taken Prisoner, and
sent to Venice. He was certainly a fierce and haughty man, but grievously
faulty, and a mighty Enemy to the Venetians, whom he had long troubled by his
incursions, and rapines committed in Friuli. Savoragnano grew now very famous
for these prosperous successes, for which he was by the Senate created Count of
Belgrado and Osofo; and to leave a testimony of his Worth to his posterity, he
had 400 Ducats a year assigned unto him out of the public Exchequer, to
descend to him and his Heirs for ever. The Enemies Army being routed, as you
have heard, Udine, Belgrado, Monfalcone, and all the other Castles which were
formerly taken by the Enemy, returned into the power of the Venetians, and were
by them received into favor; for it was evident that the people had done their
duties, and had not quitted their Loyalty to the Venetians, otherwise then
necessitated by Fortune, and by the power of the prevailing Enemy. Alviano
hoped by means of this Victory to re-gain Goritia and Gradisca, if the Army
should march thitherward; and he did this the rather, for that he understood
there were but small Garrisons in these Towns, and that they were in great want
of all things, especially of Gunpowder, which was all spent in the Siege of
Osofo; yet being unwilling to fall rashly upon this Enterprise, he sent a Band
of men to discover the condition of the places, who having diligently observed
all things, brought word, that the taking of those places would require much
time and pains; wherefore Alviano having ended what he went for into Friuli,
and knowing that by tarrying longer in those parts, his return into the
Territories of Padua might be hindered by the Spaniards, whose numbers
increased, he resolved to return with his Army into the City of Padua.

At the same time that these things were done in Friuli, many Treaties had been
in Rome concerning Peace with the Emperor; for the Pope having at last
overcome all doubts and difficulties, had taken this business in hand, and was
very diligent in the negotiation ther^of, to the end that peace might be
effected, he used all possible means by his Nuntios both with the Emperor and
the Venetians, exhorting them to concord.

He showed them that both of them had made sufficient trial of their fortune,
and that things were already reduced to such a pass through the length of War,
as though they should refuse to come to any accommodation, they would both of
them be forced shortly to lay down Arms out of very weariness; but that then
the Issue would be this, that Forces being broken on both sides, yet Enmity
would still remain to the common ruin; for it was to be feared that by means
of these discords, and the weakness occasioned by so long Wars, both the
Conquerours, and conquered would fall into the power of Selinus Ottaman (a
bitter and powerful Enemy) if the Fortune of War favoring his designs, now
that he was upon difficult, but glorious Attempts, he should turn his
victorious Forces into Europe. He moreover told the Venetians, that France was
so weakened, both by the last received rout, and by the greater dangers which
did yet over-hang them, as it was in vain for them to think to be able to
maintain the War by assistance from France. But that whilst peace was on treaty
between England and France, the event whereof was yet uncertain, and whilst the
Commonwealth was yet in good esteem, both by reason of her own strength, and
the like of her Confederates, they might accommodate their Affairs upon
honorable conditions; which being afterward reduced to disadvantage, they
would not be able to do. He laid before the Emperor, the length of the War,
the various and doubtful successes of Enterprises, the faithfulness of
Confederates, the certain advantages of peace, together with the enlarging of
his Empires Confines. But because the Pope had many times endeavored this in
vain, from which he might ground what now he was to trust unto. Caesar and the
Venetians having never been able to be made friends, he knew it was necessary a
third person should take upon him the conditions of Peace. Wherefore he made
known to them both, that if it might stand with their consent, he had resolved
to take upon himself this whole Treaty of Peace, and to judge and determine
what was fitting to be done therein, and what each of them should be content
with; that though he was not ignorant of what a burden he was herein to take
upon him, yet laying aside all other respects he would mind only the peace of
Christendom, and the duty of his charge and office. And that the mean while,
whilst Affairs might be brought to some composition, and friendship might be
renewed, they would lay down Arms, to the end that when his determination
should be heard, War might the more be easily appeased, and all things might
remain quiet.

The Venetian Senate, moved thereunto out of the hopes of peace, and by the
Popes Authority, resolved to refer to him whatsoever had been long in dispute
between them and the Emperor, thinking they should do well and worthily to
acquaint the Pope and all Christendom with their pretenses and injuries; that
all men might know how great reverence and respect the Venetians bore to the
Pope, and that all their designs aimed at agreement. The chiefest difficulty
lay in whether the City of Verona did belong to the Emperor, or to the
Venetians, and in what moneys the Venetians should pay unto the Emperor, and
what time they should have for the payment thereof. The reason of paying these
Moneys was, as well for the expenses of the War, as also that Caesar should
cancel all his pretentions, if he had any, either by claim of the Empire, or
of the House of Austria, to those Cities and Towns which were by agreement to
remain unto the Commonwealth. The Venetians made Leo the Arbitrator of these
things, leaving the Arbitrament thereof in him by public Authority. Leo not
content herewith, desired that this might be drawn up in another manner; to
wit, so as without mentioning any particular Controversy, the Senate should
refer the whole business to him, as the Compounder of all differences: saying
that he desired this for the taking away of all occasions of difference, and
that he might bring all things the sooner to the desired end; wherefore he
pawned his faith, not to use any farther freedom, nor to pronounce any
sentence, then what he should have first communicated to the Ambassador of the
Commonwealth, and by the will and consent of the Senate; adding that for the
future he would use no less diligence, to have Verona, and all the other Towns
which were possessed by the Commonwealth before the War, restored unto her,
then he now used to make peace. Thus he obtained free leave and power from the
Senate to put an end unto the War upon what conditions pleased him: He having
promised that when this should be done by the Ambassador of the Commonwealth
then resident with him, that he, the Pope, would be sure not to propound any
thing for reconciling the differences, which might prove the beginning of new
difficulties, or which might disturb the whole business, for it was much to be
feared, that the Commonwealths Enemies (whose request whether they did agree
with what was just and honest he himself might very well know) knowing that all
things were now left to his free disposal, would egg him on, as it were
against his will, to propound such conditions as might be too prejudicial to
the Commonwealth, and which he himself should not be very well pleased withal.
When the Pope began to negotiate this Affair, he met with many things which
gave him reason to be doubtful and jealous; the rather because he desired both
Caesar and the Venetians satisfaction. The Emperor demanded that Verona, which
was then in his possession, should still continue in his power; to which though
it had been always heretofore denied, the Venetians did at this time condescend
upon condition that Gange and Valegio, two Towns of the Territories of Verona,
should be yielded up to them; alleging that without these their State being as
it were cut off by another Jurisdiction, it was evident that all that part of
their Dominion which lay beyond the River Adige, would be of no use at all to
the Commonwealth. On the contrary, the Emperor, who seemed at the first to be
contented with Verona, demanded Crema likewise; and somewhat to honest this his
desire, he said that this City ought to be put into the Popes hands, since he
was content to put Vicenza thereinto. But it was apparent to every one how
unequal this proposition was; for Crema was a very strong and safe City, long
in the Venetians possession, and lately defended with much cost and labor
against the Enemy; whereas Vicenza being neither strongly walled, nor well
garrisoned, had often changed Fortune and Masters, and was now in these latter
times possessed by Cesars men, only because it was never strove for: So as it
could hardly be said that he possessed the City; for if the Venetians would
send their Forces thither, they might easily drive the Emperors weak Garrison
out, and recover it.

Whilst these things were in treaty Cardinal Gurghense, who had ever been an
utter Enemy to peace, came in an unhappy hour to Rome. He began (as he had done
formerly) to trouble the business, finding many occasions to draw it out in
length, and bending all his Might against what was just and honest. The Pope
had obtained that the Spanish Foot should abstain from doing any new prejudice,
since the business of right was to be treated of: yet the Viceroy ^aining
sometimes not to understand this Treaty, sometimes blaming such advice,
proceeded in hostile manner against the State of Venice, and the Affairs
thereof; nay taking occasion by reason of the truce to pillage more securely,
he entered the Territories of Padua, and plundered the whole Country, nourishing
his needy Soldiers with what they got from miserable Inhabitants, in a time
when they thought themselves free from such Injuries. By which proceedings it
might be conceived that the Pope and the Venetians were much deluded; that the
Commonwealths Enemies had no mind to peace, but that they played the
Counterfeits, as well not utterly to lose the Pope, as also to make the
Venetians through their hopes of peace less careful in providing for things
appertaining to War; and they the mean while might have opportunity to recrute
their Army, which was much diminished.

Wherefore the Venetians discovering their Enemies cheats and deceitful
Proceedings, entreated Leo, That he would penetrate into the secret Counsels of
the Emperor, and of King Ferdinando; for then he would clearly find that
Ferdinando did not only aspire to the States Dominions, but to the Government
of all Italy. So as if he would keep up his Dignity, and Authority amongst
Princes, which he might perceive began now to grow less, he should not suffer
them so to abuse the reverend name of Pope. That therefore quitting his first
Counsels, he should betake himself to new and safer cogitations, and should
resolve upon things becoming the safety of Italy, and his own Dignity, and that
he should forthwith recall his Troops of Horse from the Spanish Army; for that
the Enemies having placed much hopes in his friendship and assistance, they
would proceed with more sincerity when they should see themselves deprived
thereof, that they would abstain from injurious proceedings, and treat less
arrogantly hereafter. That he on his part had abundantly satisfied the tie of
confederacy which he had with them; that it became an Italian, especially him
who was pla^ed in so high a degree of Dignity, and who was endowed with so much
wisdom, by the present troublesome state of things, to foresee the beginnings
of greater evils, and to provide such remedies for them, as became their
importancy, and which might as yet be used; that if these Princes, whilst their
Affairs were in so bad a case, by reason of the few Spanish and Dutch Foot
which were then in Italy, had notwithstanding arrogated so much Authority, and
would make such use of bare reputation, without Forces, it was much to be
feared, that when their power should be increased, they would endeavor to
d^mineer over all Italy.

The Venetians used reasons to exhort the Pope to keep up his greatness and
authority: They told him he could by no other way better effect it then by
entering into League with the King of France, and their Commonwealth. But
finding that these endeavors did no good, they went to work with him the same
way that they knew their Enemies had done. It was generally thought that Leo
favored the Emperors Affairs; for he thought that thereby he promoted his own
designs: He had set his whole mind upon the aggrandizing of his own House,
hoping that he might be much farthered therein by Cesars favor, whereby he
might be enabled to alienate the Cities of Parma, Piacenza, Modena, and Reggio,
from the Church, and pass them over in fee by the Emperors help and consent to
his Brother Iuliano.

Wherefore the Venetians labored to persuade him, that he might better advance
his Family by this new confederacy; the Venetians being very willing to grant
the Kingdom of Naples in fee to his Brother Juliano, when it should be won by
their common Forces, upon the same conditions that he had desired those other
Cities; and to defend, and maintain him in the possession thereof by all their
forces and endeavors: And that he should not need to doubt their promise, nor
suspect the Commonwealths faith, as well in commemoration of the benefit,
which would be esteemed the greater in these unfortunate times, as also for the
States peculiar Interest, for whose advantage and safety it would make very
much that an Italian Prince, a Friend of hers, and obliged unto her for so
great a favor, should be Master of so noble and rich a part of Italy. That
doubtlesly he might promise himself the like from the King of France, who
setting his heart upon the reputation and keeping of Millan, it did much import
him that more potent Lords should be kept far from the Confines of Italy, the
parts whereof which should belong to the French, would be the better confirmed
unto them by the Popes Friendship. That this was the only way to make the House
of Medici truly glorious and splendid, which was famous enough already of her
self: And the best way likewise for the quiet and security of the Church and of
all Italy. That the Senate did recommend these things to his consideration in
pursuance of their ancient custom, and out of their particular observance of
his own Person, and their affection to his Family. That he should not argue out
of these their persuasions that they were so weakened by adverse Fortune, or
that they were so cast down, but that they were able to renew and maintain the
War of themselves, though he should not be advised by them.

The Commonwealth had above 6000 Foot and 1500 Horse in pay at this time,
divided between Padua and Trevigi; and Soldiers were continually raised for
the service of the Commonwealth in several parts; so as she hoped to have
10000 Soldiers on Foot within a short time. Moreover new ships were a building
to increase the Fleet, and to furnish it with all things fitting, that she
might be ready and able for any Enterprise. That on the contrary, though the
Enemies men were very few, and impotent, i^ great want and scarcity of all
things, and that it was rather reputation, then true strength that made them
subject, yet were they so encouraged by their past prosperous successes, as
they thought all things easy, and promised themselves success in all their
undertakings. Wherefore Leo fearing more the audacity of the Spaniards and
Dutch, then he trusted or hoped in the French and Venetians, could not resolve
to accept of these new conditions, but falling into his ancient irresoluteness,
was the occasion why both War and Peace grew daily more difficult. But it was
certainly known that Leo was more addicted to Caesar, and did too much covet his
favor; for though he was not ignorant that the Emperors whole drift was to
oppress all Italy, and that he himself did confess as much, yet he still spun
out time, as if he durst not pronounce; nor did he limit any means, or time
wherein to do it. Henry King of England had formerly undertaken to reconcile
the Venetians with the Emperor, behaving himself so therein, as it appeared
evidently to all men that he was well inclined to wish well to the Affairs of
Venice; but his affection seemed now to be quite altered, out of jealousy that
the Venetians had aided the French in the War which he made with their King the
year before.

He complained particularly that the Commonwealth had sent her Albanese Horse
into France. Which suspicions were conceived to be purposely taken to the end
that he might afterward have the better color to favor the Emperor in his
proceedings, whose good will he endeavored by all means to win, out of a
desire to draw him from the Truce which he had began to treat of with the
French. Therefore whereas Henry was formerly wont to exhort the Venetians to
peace, and to comfort them, and assist them in their greatest nacessities; he
now proceeded clean otherwise, accusing them by his Letters to the Senate for
having persevered too much in breaking of the hopes of peace when things went
well with them, and deprived Christendom of much good; saying that they ought
to behave themselves according as the times went, and not carry themselves
higher then their present Fortune required; wherefore he was very earnest with
them to lay down their Arms, and not to trouble Maximillian any longer with
that unreasonable War.

These Letters being read in the Senate, they resolved to justify the
Commonwealth by their Ambassador, who was then resident in the Court of
England; and to free the King from such false suspicions.

The Senate seemed to wonder very much why Henry, toward whom the
Commonwealth had showed such affection as became them well to do to a great
Prince who was their Friend and Confederate, a well Wisher and Amplifier of
their Dignity, should believe that the Venetians would injure him, or should
have endeavored to disturb his Victory whereat they had much rejoiced; to
witness which, they had at this time sent Francisco Capello, Ambassador into
England, who dyed in his journey thitherward. But that as for those things
whereof he particularly complained, he was to know that all the Albanesi were
not Subjects to the Commonwealth, nor were the Venetians able to inhibite them
the Service of other Princes: That their Fleet was prepared not to assist
others, but only to withstand the so great Forces which the Enemy had prepared
against their State; that they had long before been Confederates with the
French, as the condition of those times required, which was the reason why they
had not satisfied Maximillian in his first requests: Which had made him wage
War with that Commonwealth, not having been any ways injured by them; nor had
the Venetians taken up Arms against him otherwise then in their own defense;
that after these first successes, and Truce being made, it was violated by
Caesar, who entered in an hostile manner into their Dominion; wherefore they were
forced to take up Arms again to drive him out of their Confines: whereby Henry
might conceive, that they had not been the first Authors of War against the
Emperor, having only endeavored to keep themselves from being injured,
according to the wont of their Ancestors; who were always accustomed neither to
do nor suffer wrong. And that notwithstanding they forbear not all this while
endeavors by Letters, by Ambassadors, and by all other means which they
thought might do any good, that the occasion of controversies being removed,
they might come to some Agreement with Caesar; that many might witness this, but
especially the Archbishop of York, an honorable and worthy Gentleman, who had
often interceded in this Treaty of Peace, and who knew very well what their
intentions were, and what the Enemies were minded to do; that men would think
that Caesar, who was a great Prince, should offer at nothing which was not
honorable and becoming him; yet it could not be denied, but that many of his
Advisers did corrupt this his good Will, endeavoring their own advantage by
drawing out the War at length, though they seemed to be concerned in Cesars
Interests only. That therefore it became Henry, who was a great and excellent
King, to be so just and moderate, as not to suffer himself to be diverted by
any conjunction which he had with the Emperor, from what was fair and right;
but as a just and upright Arbitrator to interpose his Authority for the laying
down of Arms on all sides, upon such reasonable conditions, as might not be
injurious to any one: So as the people of Christendom long molested with so
many Wars, might n^w enjoy some rest and safety: and as for them they would the
more willingly make peace with Maximillian in respect of Henry's being the
Author of it.

But all these endeavors were of little avail with a Prince who minded more
the composing of his own Wars then those of others; wherefore the Venetians
finding no hopes of Agreement, began to bethink themselves of War. All people
whom it became to speak their minds were enjoined by the Senate, to propound
such things as they thought fittest for the raising of Moneys upon such
occasions. Many things were proposed and argued in the Senate with diversity of
Opinions: New Taxes were laid upon the City, and several ways were found
whereby to bring in Moneys into the public Treasury. There was a new
Magistracy instituted consisting but of three; who had Authority given them to
impose what sum they should please upon every Citizen or Inhabitant of Venice,
according to every man's condition and ability, provided that it should not
exceed 300 Ducats for any one Family or Person. Moreover power was given to
Alviano and two Savij of the Council, who upon occasion of some other
employment were then in Padua, to free such from exile as had been banished for
no very grievous offenses, enjoining them to pay such sums of Money as they
should think fit for payment of the Army; whereunto if any one should be
backward, their Goods were to be distrain'd. So as in a short time the scarcity
of the Exchequer was provided for, and some hopes were had of being able to
maintain War for a while.

Alviano being this mean while gone out of Friuli, as has been said, the
Senate, being thereunto chiefly moved by the persuasions of Ierolimo
Savor^gnano, resolved to reassume the Enterprise of Marano, the chief care
whereof was given to him; who cheerfully taking the employment upon him, and
having got together about 2000 Country men, and drawn 400 of the best Foot out
of Udine, went about this. And that he might do it with the more safety and
Honor, Iovan Vitturi who commanded all the light Horse, and Iovan Paolo
Manfrone Captain of the Curassiers, were ordered to pass with all their Horse
over the Tagliamento, and to be aiding to Savoragnano in his Enterprise, by
overrunning the Country, and by securing it from any new commotions of the
Enemy; moreover the Fleet was sent to the Marshes of Marano that it might be
bese^ both by Sea and Land.

As soon as Savoragnano came to Marano, he possessed himself of a strong
situation not far from the Walls, where he took up his Quarters: He then began
to make Ditches, by which the Soldiers being sheltered, might get to the
Walls. The Town was situated much to our men's disadvantage; for it was
environed all about with low Moorish Grounds, wherefore Savoragnano to overcome
the badness of the Seat by Industy, made certain rises of several materials,
like so many little Towers, and did munite them excellently well; whereby he
got two great advantages; the one that they might be a greater safety for his
men, if the Enemy should sally out of the Town at unawares; the other, that for
matter of fight, his men and the Enemy might be upon equal terms, the one
standing upon the Walls, the other upon the made Rises. Thus all things being
prepared for an Assault, toward which the Soldiers had already made some
advancement, some Captains who did differ in opinion from Savoragnano before,
meeting with some let, by reason of deeper waters, were occasion why what was
before resolved upon, was not put in execution. And in the Interim Letters came
to Savoragnano, and the chiefest of the Army from the Senate, wherein they
signified their opinion, that it was better to take the Town by Siege, then by
Assault; moreover Manfrone had still been of that opinion, and had given
particular account thereof to the Senate, being moved thereunto either out of
Envy that he bore to Savoragnano, or by Alviano's Authority, who also advised
to the not taking of Marano by Force. All things were then handled in order to
a Siege: But there were many things also which made against this opinion; for
the people that were assembled together being nigh at hand, the Country people
(of which the Army did for the most part consist) could not be kept together
any longer in those parts, for they were come thither out of hopes of a sudden
Victory and of some booty without any pay: Moreover it was to be feared that
these men being wearied by long labor, and a tedious Siege, were likely to
abandon the Camp; but say they would have tarried, they could not have done so
by reason of the condition of the place, and unwholesomeness of the Air,
whereof many fell grievously sick daily. The Commanders adhering to the safest
counsel, and to that which pleased the Senate best, altering their way of
warfaring, fell from Assault to Siege, and placed their Camp in many several
Quarters, that they might the more streighten the Besieged, and keep them from
Victuals. Thus whilst time was spent in vain, the Enemy had means afforded them
of increasing their numbers, and of advancing to relieve those that were
within. But our men understanding that the Dutch had mustered many Foot and
Horse about Villacco, and that many Country Mountainers were come from the
Neighboring Villages to Gradisca, and that great preparation was made both of
men and Arms wherewith to assault our Camp, the Captains fearing lest they
might be taken in the midst by two adverse Armies, resolved hastily to raise
the Siege, and to march with all their men toward Udine and Cividale: and at
the same time the Fleet parting from the Washes of Marano, went to Is^ria, to
secure the Towns of that Country which were much molested by Barnardino
Frangipane. As soon as the Siege was raised from before Marano, the Enemy
hasted to victual the Town, and to recrute the Garrison; so as growing more
powerful, and more bold, they sallied out often, fell upon the Neighboring
Villages, wasting the Country, and laying heavy Taxes upon the miserable
Inhabitants, from whom they injuriously, and oftentimes by torments did exact
Moneys. The Senate being much troubled hereat, and fearing lest greater dangers
might issue unless some speedy remedy were taken, they ordered il Cavalliere
dalla Volpe, who commanded all the light Horse, to march speedily into Friuli
with 200 Horse, and Pietro Marcello was commanded to do so likewise, who was at
this time sent Commissary into the Field, to succeed Ierolemo Pesaro in that
place, who was chosen one of the six Counselors which sit next unto the
Prince, a chief Dignity of the Commonwealth. But before these could come, our
men being sorely weakened, were much indamaged. Commissary Vitturi, who wanted
more assistance, was retreated into a place of greater strength with only one
hundred Albanese Horse; where being unexpectedly set upon by a great many Dutch
Foot, after having resisted long and valiantly, his Horse being wounded under
him, and all his men forsaking him, he was taken by the Enemy, and led Prisoner
into Gradisca, and afterward farther into Germany. Of those Horse which were
with him, some were cut in pieces, some taken Prisoners, and but few of them
got safe into Udine.

At the same time Renzo da Ceri, who had stayed long idle within the Walls of
the City, whilst agreement was in Treaty; all hopes of peace being vanished,
and a way being opened unto him to indamage the Enemy, he diligently observed
their ways and their counsels that he might find some fit occasion of happy
success. Having received advertisement that Silvio Savello was lately come out
of Millan, with light Horse and 50 Curassiers, and 400 Foot, and that being
sent toward Crema, they marched in some disorder, he resolved to send Mariano
Ascoli and Alessandro Donato with two Troops of Horse, and Andrea, and
Silvestro da Perugia with 400 Foot, to assault him at unawares upon his March,
as they did Silvio running away at the unexpected coming of our men, was
enforced to give over his first design, and to retreat into the Town of
Pandino, where fighting our men who pursued him, to keep them from approaching
the Walls, he was at the first Onset put to the retreat, his men being so
routed, as many of them were slain, others taken Prisoners, and he betaking
himself betimes to Flight, with much ado escaped. But Renzo not content with
these prosperous successes, was resolved utterly to defeat the Enemy, who were
routed, and dissipated in many places; and to do his utmost to free the City
from Siege; things being therein reduced to such straits, all the Citizens
wealth being consumed by the length of War, and the City full of many great
wants, chiefly of corn, as mere necessity forced them often to hazard
themselves, and make trial of their Arms and Fortune. Savelli retreated with
those that had escaped out of the Fight at Ombriano into those parts where
Prospero Colonna was (as has been said) with the Duke of Millans men, and had
made two camps, about a mile and a half one from the other: which Renzo hearing
of, he thought he had an occasion given him of deluding the Enemy, by
assaulting them with all his Forces, whilst they were divided. Therefore the
day preceding the night wherein he was to assault the Enemy, he began with them
on that part where Savello commanded, thinking that the Soldiers, wearied with
their days March, might sleep the longer: But as soon as night came on, he sent
his light Horse to the other Camp where Colonna was, to make him keep within
his Quarters. He with a thousand Foot, and all the Gens d' Arms that were in
the City, marching through Marish places, and by obscure ways, when the night
was well nigh past, assaulted the Soldiers who were upon the Guard of the
Quarters, and before the Enemy were well aware, he fired the Ammunition. The
Italian Foot were the first that resisted him; and having endured the brunt for
a short while, the business being more tumultuous, and more dreadful as coming
at unawares, they ran away: The Switzers made somewhat longer resistance,
making good their station for a good while, and endeavoring to repulse our
men, but Renzo's Soldiers throwing many artificial Fireworks amongst them,
whereby their Ranks were disordered, they gave way likewise: The Curassiers,
who not apprehending any such thing had put off their Armor, and were laid to
sleep, and not having leisure to put them on again, strove to save themselves
by flight: Many whereof whilst they endeavored to get over the River Ada, were
therein drowned: But Savello according to his custom, saved himself by flight.
This was a great blow to the Enemy, for of 500 Horse, which were in the Camp,
scarce 50 escaped free away; and but few of 1800 Foot. Renzo won much Honor by
this Action; for though he had tarried long in those parts to ruin the Town of
Ombriano, sacking the Neighboring Territories, to bring all the Booty that he
could get into the City, yet Prospero Colonna suffered these things to be done
before his eyes, and his Army looking on, not daring so much as once to get out
of his Quarters* nay hearing some days after that Renzo was coming with 300
Horse to relieve the Town, fearing lest he might fall into some greater mishap,
he raised the Camp, and freed Crema from Siege, quartering his Soldiers in
several Towns of Ceradada. The Spaniards, though they treated of Peace yet had
they not all this while forborne injurious Proceedings; wherefore the Senate,
though they had resolved not to suffer their men to go out of Padua, after what
you have heard was done in Friuli, yet not willing that the Enemy should daily
grow more insolent, gave way that Alviano (who had often desired permission so
to do) should take men out of the City, putting them in mind that they were not
now to revenge themselves upon the Enemy, but should think they had done
enough, if they could keep them from committing rapine and plunder: But
desirous notwithstanding that the Army might be stronger, so as it might be
ready upon all occasions, they commanded Iovan Paolo Ma^frone, who remained in
Friuli with a hundred Curassiers, that he should forthwith go with his Horse to
Alviano's Camp: Who before he took the field, sent Bernardino Antignola and
Hanibale Lencio with 300 light Horse toward Cittadella to keep Bassano and
Marostica in Loyalty, and to preserve them from being injured; having
understood that the Enemy were dr^wing near those Castles. He went the next day
out of Padua with the rest of the Army, consisting of 600 Curassiers, 600
cross-bow men, 400 Albanese Horse, and about 8000 Foot, and marching toward
the Eugenean-Mou^^^ins, when he wa^ got four miles off to Brassegana, he there
divided all his men into two bodies, and resolved to tarry there till he might
better understand what the Enemy did. But the Senate, when they heard of this,
writ him word that he should join all his men together presently, to the end
that if peradventure the Enemy should come to assault him, he might not be
necessitated shamefully to abandon one part, or by asisting it, to engage
himself again in a Battle, which they wished him by all means possible to
avoid. These proceedings, and resolutions of our men were very well known to
the Viceroy; wherefore tarrying at the Torre in the Territories of Vicenza, he
commanded the Marquess of Pescara to march speedily to Cittadella with 300
light Horse, 500 Foot, and some pieces of Artillery, wherein Antignola was with
the Chivalry: So as the Enemy being got thither before our men thought they
would have done, they furiously assaulted the Castle, which Antignola did
valiantly defend. But Pescara understanding that that part of the Town which
was opposite to where they fought, was left without any men to defend it, he
sent a Band of his men thither, without the knowledge of them that were within;
to the end that scaling the Walls whilst the Defendants were fighting on the
other side, they might the more easily overcome them, and fall on upon the
backs of our men; which falling out just as it was designed, Antignola's
Soldiers being busied in several fights, and astonished at so unexpected an
accident, some of them were slain, some taken Prisoners; amongst which
Antignola's self was one, and Francisco Coco the chief Magistrate of the Town
another, and the Castle was sacked by the Soldiers. As soon as this was known
at Venice, the Senators being greatly moved, both for the present loss, and
much more for the scorn thereof, and the remembrance of their late calamities,
they commanded Alviano that he should suddenly pass his Army back again over
the River Bachillione; but he thinking that this might be a dishonor to him,
and to his Army, before this order was obeyed, let the Senate know, that he was
in a very safe place, where he could not fear to be indamaged by the Enemy,
that he was absolutely resolved to abstain from battle, whereunto he could not
be by the Enemy enforced. But some of the Senate continuing in their opinion
that he was to remove his quarters, it was resolved that Dominico Trevisano,
and Lunardo Mocenico, who were then Savij of the Council, should be sent to
view his Quarters, that they might the better know the Captains Opinion and the
reason of this advice. These brought word back that the situation was indeed
such as Alviano had represented it to be, for the Quarters were in the midst
between two Rivers, Brenta and Bachilone, and the Fortifications such, as there
was no fear to be had of the Enemy; for Alviano had been very careful in
drawing a Trench and a Ditch, and had very well fortified all befitting places;
so as there was no more speech had of changing Quarters. Yet the Spaniards,
though the Army which was in Padua was drawn out into the field, did by
continual Inrodes daily vex the Inhabitants of those parts. Having heard that a
great many Country people had withdrawn themselves and their cattle to
Cavarzere, that they might be there the freer from Injuries, that place being
every where environed with Fens, they betook themselves in great numbers
toward that part in many Barks which were got together upon the Banks of
Adice; whereof when Andrea Bondelmiero, the Podesta, or chief Governor of
Pioggia, heard, he caused many Barks to be armed, and sent them toward
Cavarzere, whether also Iovan di Naldo went with the light Horse out of Padua.
Wherefore the Enemy altering their resolution, went to Carigiola and Candiana,
two very rich Towns by reason of the fruitfulness of the ground; from whence
they carried away much Booty. And as they had sacked all the Banks of
Bachillione on the left hand, the year before, so doing now the like on the
other side, they left nothing but bare ground in that Country. All this while
Alviano kept within his Quarters, observing the Enemies Actions, and hearing
that they had carried great store of corn to the Town of Est^, and that there
was 300 of their Foot, and 100 light Horse there, he sent Antonio da Castello
thither with a good number of Foot, and a Troop of light Horse, who clapping
their Ladders to the Walls by night, and entering the Town, took all the Enemies
that were there Prisoners, carrying away as much corn as they could, and
burning the rest. This was of more praise to our Soldiers; for that it was
done almost in sight of the enemy. And soon after Mercurio Bua and Malatesta
Baglione, as they were marching through the Territories of Padua and Vicenza,
to secure those parts from being ransacked by the enemy, they met with two
companies of Spanish Foot at Camisano, whom they cut all in pieces, and put
some others to flight who came to relieve them. This mean while Nicolo
Vendramino came to the same place with 500 valiant Albanese Horse, who joining
with those of Bua and Malatesta, and growing thereby more powerful and more
strong, they began to enlarge themselves, and to pursue the Enemy, destroying
the country with fire and sword even to Trent. And having sufficiently
vindicated their Injuries, they returned safe to Alviano's camp, without the
loss of any one Soldier. The Commonwealths Soldiers were much inheartned by
these happy successes; and so much was the reputation of Alviano's Army already
increased, as a Troop of our men being com very near the Viceroys camp, not
any one durst come forth to skirmish with them; nay, not thinking themselves
safe in those Quarters, they soon after quitted their Quarters at Montagnana,
and went to Polesin^: By which departure of the Viceroys, Alviano thinking
that he had now opportunity to oppress those of the Enemies party, who tarried
in the Territories of Vero^a, commanded Malatesta Baglione and Mercurio Bua, to
march presently with the Chivalry toward Verona, saying that he himself would
follow them the same way with the rest of his Army. Baglione and Bua found the
Enemy at the Town of Zevio, where they lay secure, not apprehending any thing
from our Army: So as being set upon at unawares by night, they were very much
damnified by our men, wherefore the Viceroy learing some worser business,
removed his camp presently into the Territories of Verona, leaving part thereof
at Rovigo and Lendenara, that they might live the more commodiously in that
fruitful Country: As he past forward, chiefly to secure Verona, he began to be
more apprehensive, because he heard Alviano came on with his whole Army,
wherefore he sent 800 Foot and 500 Horse to succor the Town. The Veroneses
began already to mutiny in that Town; for growing very weary of the Dutch
Government, they desired to return under the Dominion of the Commonwealth: and
being at this time chiefly given to rebel, they expected Alviano's coming; and
the rather, for that they hoped when his Army should approach near the Walls,
the Soldiers who were distressed for want of many things, might out of danger,
be the more easily be brought to yield: The Enemy therefore were timorous in
all their Proceedings, and our men the more hardy; which made our men the more
successful, and theirs the contrary. Alviano knowing that by the Viceroys
departure the Soldiers that were at Polisine were much decreased, bethought
himself suddenly of that place; thinking that he had now a secure occasion of
Boory offered him. He at the present discovered his mind only to Baldesara
Scipione, because the greatest hopes of success lay in assaulting the Enemy
before they could be aware of it, or provide for defense. He sent Scipione to
those Confines, to discover the condition of the Seat, the number of the Enemy,
and their works; but he himself, to free the Enemy from suspicion, marched
another way, toward the Territories of Vicenza, and hearing by Scipione that
the business might easily be effected, if all the Army were suddenly brought to
Rovegio, he departed from the Town of Malo, whither he was first bent, and
marched thitherward; and came with such speed to within a mile of Rovegio, as
the Enemy were not as yet aware of his coming, nor had they discovered any
thing. Wherefore Alviano sent Scipione with some few before, that he might
enter the Town at unawares to the Inhabitants, and possess himself of the
Gates, to make them sure for him who followed after with the rest of the Army.
The Gates being seized on, all Alviano's Soldiers got into the Town, and
quickly advanced even to the Piazza; for as good luck would have it, the
Country people according to their custom, were come in great numbers to
Rovigio, where there was a solemn market held, and the Spanish Soldiers mixing
with the Country people and Tradesmen, went promiscuously through the
Marketplace, some to buy things, some for pastime; so as being unexpectedly
set upon by our men, they being dispersed here and there could neither sustain
the violence of the Assalliants, nor assemble themselves together for their
better defense: Some drew their swords to defend themselves, but were either
soon cut in pieces or taken Prisoners. This Victory was the more remarkable, as
being gotten without so much as any of our men's being wounded; for the Enemy
without any fighting, lost almost all their Horse, and many of them of all
sorts wree led away Prisoners; whereof 200 of the chiefest of them, and
Mauricco's self, a Spanish Captain, who had the command of all those men, were
sent by Alviano to Venice, where they were put into safe custody. The other
Spanish Soldiers who were in the neighboring parts, hearing of Alviano's
being come, and what had befallen their Fellows, leaving their Baggage, and
throwing their Victuals into the River, saved themselves by flight, wherein
many of them were notwithstanding taken Prisoners, and Piscara retreated with
the rest of his Army to Verona.

The News of this happy success did very much rejoice all the Venetians, not so
much for the thing it self, as that the Fortune of the Commonwealth being
altered, they thought they might hope for better things for the future.

The Senate sent Letters of great acknowledgments to Alviano; Saying he had
truly showed how great his worth and experience was in Military Affairs,
wherein he had manifested his love to the Commonwealth, and a great desire to
recover what she had lost, and had much increased his own Glory, and his merits
toward the Commonwealth.

But Alviano, though he had chased the Enemy, resolved still to proceed with
the same diligence and circum^pection: So without delay he marched with his
Army toward the Territories of Verona; where possessing himself of all the
Avenues, and placing men of War in all fitting places upon the Shore side of
the River Adice, he endeavored to keep Victuals from being brought into
Verona. But being advertised that Pescara was come with his men out of Verona
to encounter him, and fearing lest his Army might run the danger of being
caught in the midst between the City, and the Enemies camp, he resolved to go
farther from the City; and finding safer Quarters, to keep there, and to inform
himself diligently of the Enemies intentions, and of whatsoever they should do,
as well in the camp as in the City; that so he might resolve upon better
grounds what he had to do. Renzo da Ceri hoping for better things by these the
Venetians happy successes, began to think upon matters of greater moment.
Wherefore hearing that the City of Bergamo was but weakly garrisoned, and
imagining it might easily be taken, he committed the business to Mafsio
Cagnuolo Bergamasco, one who was thought very expert at Military Affairs, and
very well affectioned to the Venetians. This man, taking along with him 500
light Horse, with each of them a Foot man behind them, made what haste he could
to Bergamo, and assaulting the Soldiers that were upon the Guard unexpectedly,
he put them to flight, and took the City at the first Assault. Which when Renzo
heard of, he took with him 1200 Foot and went presently himself in person to
Bergamo, to munite the City, and make good the acquisition. Whilst he was in
Bergamo he sent some of his men toward Brescia, under the conduct of
Bartholomeo Martiningo to confirm the minds of those Citizens in their good
affection toward the Commonwealth, and to encourage them to make some Attempt
against Cesars Soldiers; intending that if any tumult should upon this
occasion arise in the City, to lead the whole Army thither with hopes to gain
it. Whereat Cardona being much troubled, he caused Colonna's men to come unto
him, resolving to go into those parts, to secure the City of Brescia, and to
endeavor the recovery of Bergamo. And having brought all the Spanish Foot, as
also those that appertained to Sforza, he went to sit down before Bergamo, and
began to play furiously upon the Walls; which being very weak on the side
toward the Suburbs of Santo Antonio, were thrown down by the Artillery, and
there being no earth within to make Rampires, Renzo could not hope to defend
the City against so great a force; he bethought himself of providing by times
for the safety of the Citizens and Soldiers. He therefore articled with
Cardona, that in case no succor came in 8 days space from Alviano's camp, he
would yield the City up to him; upon condition that all the Citizens Goods
should remain safe and untouched, and that the Soldiers might have leave to
return to Crema: But no succor coming within the prefixed time, the City
according to agreement fell into the Spaniards hands, and Renzo returned to
Crema; where finding great want of all things, he made Truce for six Months
(but he did this of himself, without the authority of the Commonwealth)
betwixt the state of Millan, and City of Crema.

The Truce being made, Renzo leaving Giovan Antonio Ursino commander of the
Militia in Crema with 500 Foot and as many Horse, he went with the rest of his
men to Padua, and from thence to Venice, to give an account unto the Senate of
what had past at Bergamo, and in Crema, as also to advise upon what was farther
to be done. He was very welcome to Venice, and very honorably received; he had
refused, as you have heard, the place of Governor General of the Militia, and
there being no other place now vacant for him, whereby to exalt him to higher
Dignity, the Senate did much increase his pay, and gave him the Castle of
Martinengo, with all the Revenues and Rights belonging thereunto. Cardona
having gotten Bergamo, turned toward Alviano, who (as you have heard) was
quartered in the confines of Verona: And at the same time Pescara, whose Forces
were much increased by the Foot that were come from Germany, prepared to
assault our camp: Wherefore Alviano resolved to retreat with his Army into
Padua, which he did so readily and so well advisedly, as couzening the Enemy,
he got safe thither with all his men and carriages. He sent first the light
Horse toward Montagnana to entertain Pescara, till such time as the Curassiers
might, together with the Commissary Dominico Contarini, get into some place of
safety. But he himself having at the same time got together many Boats,
whereinto he put his Foot and Artillery, falling down the River Adice till he
came to Cavarzere, he landed his men there, and marching in by washy ways, he
brought his Army at last safe into Padua. The Viceroy finding that he had come
too late to where our men were formerly quartered, and that he had failed in
his designs by Alviano's diligence, he quartered his Soldiers some in the
Territories of Verona, and some in Polesine, and went himself into Germany to
negotiate the renewing of the War the next Spring.

Whilst these things passed thus and that Fortune appeared various and
inconstant to the Venetians, the City of Vicenza, which was come under their
Dominions, kept always true and faithful to the Commonwealth, though it had
but a small Garrison within, and so many Enemies Armies about it, which was
chiefly attributed to the diligence of some Citizens, the chiefest of which
were, Giorali^^ dalla Volpe, Dominico Almenico, Leonardo da Porto, Bartolemeo
da Nievo, and many others, who having gotten great store of men out of the
Territories thereabouts, kept the City excellently well munited. Insomuch as
Nicolo Pasqualigo who was the Podesta thereof, and was resolved to abandon the
City by reason of the few Defendants that were in it, conceiving better hopes,
exhorted the Citizens to defend themselves, and ordered all things so as the
Enemies minds misgave them, and they made no Attempts upon the City. The Summer
was spent in these slight skirmishes, and with uncertain hopes of peace for
what belonged to the Affairs of Italy. But much greater things were done in
Asia; for Selino having led (as you have heard) many men into Persia, met with
Ismaels Army, and got a glorious Victory of him in Battle, which was chiefly
occasioned by his Artillery; the use whereof was unknown to the Persians. It
was hereby evidently seen that great mischiefs were threatened to other
Kingdoms and Provinces by Selino, who through these prosperous successes grew
every day more haughty and insolent: His thoughts in this point was easily
discerned, for that at the same time when he made so great Preparations for War
with the Persians, his Son Soliman by his Fathers directions, entered the
confines of Hungary in hostile manner with great store of Horse, kept the
Inhabitants of those parts continually molested, and took some Towns, which he
annexed to his Empire. Pope Leo, to put bounds to this audacious power, wrought
it so, as that a certain order of Militia should be raised in Hungary,
consisting of a multitude of men, who being thereunto bound by Oath, should
promise to defend the cause of Christian Religion against the Infidels, who had
for their Badg a red cross, and were called Cruciferi. But it so fell out that
what was intended for the good of that King, proved almost his utter ruin; for
Arms being rashly put into the hands of the Country people, who did greatly
hate the Nobility, they had means afforded them of committing much wickedness,
and of putting that Kingdom into farther dangers. At which Leo being very much
troubled (as he himself affirmed) he turned his thoughts and endeavors to
peace; to which end, he resolved to send Pietro Bembo, a noble Venetian, and
who was then one of his Secretaries, to Venice. But many did suspect, that Leo,
who was used to put on resolutions relating more to the present Affairs, then
to the future, and to value only such as might make for his particular
Interest, and increase the greatness of his Family, not caring for any thing
else, as but little relating to him, had an eye likewise in this business, to
the honor and advantage of his House, though he sought to cloak these drifts
over with the appearing zeal of the common good; for when he should have
reduced Italy to peace, and that by his means the Emperor should have gotten
any state therein, he hoped to obtain from him in lieu of such a benefit,
things which might mightily increase the Dignity, and Revenue of the House of
Medici. There were great signs shown of this his intention; for that having
dispaired a little before of making an accommodation between the Venetians and
Caesar, he had turned to the French party, promising to assist King Lewis, and
exhorting him to come into Italy* yet now being of another mind, and returning
to wish well again to Caesar, he endeavored to dissuade the King of France from
that, to the which he had advised him but a little before, objecting many
difficulties, and sometime plainly denying to help and assist him, as he had
promised, since he had so long deferred to wage War; alleging that many new
accidents had happened, which required that the War which was then made by the
French in Italy, should be now drawn out into a much greater length; and
moreover that the present dangers did require, that all Christian Princes
laying aside all their home Hatreds and Wars, should direct their Forces and
Power against the powerful and formidable Enemy Selino, before that having
ended the Wars in Persia, he might bend his Forces against Europe. Bembo having
this mean while taking upon him his place of Legate, and being come to Venice,
spoke thus unto the Senate.

That Pope Leo had been always very well affected toward the Venetian
Commonwealth, and had much desired the greatness thereof; that he had been
much afflicted at what had befallen her of ill, and had taken her very much
into his care, as his Actions had clearly manifested: That it did likewise
clearly appear, that all his endeavors tended to peace, and that he had not
taken up Arms but enforced by necessity; that he had always embraced the
Commonwealth with a fatherly Charity; that he had continually exhorted,
admonished, and entreated her to accommodate her self to the present condition
of times, and to her present Fortune. By which endeavors he thought he had
abundantly done what belonged to him; that seeing he could do no good neither
by his Authority, nor by his Favor, he had resolved with himself to be quiet
for the time to come, without meddling any more in the Treaty of pea^e, which he
had so often endeavored in vain: Yet he had since altered this his resolution,
by reason of the present condition of times, and of his ancient affection to
the Commonwealth: That he had sent him therefore as his Legate to exhort the
Senate in his name, that they would have (...) sitting respect both to their
particular Liberty, and to the safety of all Italy, and finally to desire them
that they would be better advised: That the Venetians might serve to instruct
others, what the Proceedings of the French were, and how great a desire of rule
they had, what (...) they used toward the Conquered, how soon they forgot
benefits received, and that King Lewis his so eager desire to recover the State
of Millan, tended to nothing else but to make himself Master of all Italy; for
when he should have overcome Maximillian Storza, and driven him out of his
paternal State, he thought he should be easily able to get the Empire of all
Italy, and to bereave the Venetian Commonwealth, together with all the other
Italians, of their Liberty. That whereas formerly the Venetian Senate had in
the height of all their misfortunes, and compelled by necessity, applied
themselves to the Friendship of the French, it might per adventure be thought
to be so far well done, as it related to the condition of Times and Affairs:
But that if they would continue to do so any longer, let them take heed left
whilst they went about to work more safety to themselves, they did not
accelerate their ruin; for such was the nature and custom of the French, as
their Friendship could not be long useful, which ought rather to be kept at a
distance then near at hand. That many late examples might show, what constancy
and faith was to be expected from those people, who had abandoned the King of
Navar, being driven out of his State for their Service, and for not having
refused their Friendship; and that they had used the like ingratitude and
inconstancy toward them, who had deserved so well of the Kingdom of France:
That therefore they were not to hope that those who had abandoned their nearest
Allies, would be more loving or faithful to the Venetians, who were Strangers;
and that this was the more unlikely, for that the French had plotted the final
ruin of the Commonwealth, at the very time when they had been much beholden
to her, and had not been by her injured in the last War, wherein there had been
many bitter proceedings which might upon better grounds have alienated their
minds. That therefore it became the Venetian Senate to gather that good from
the friendship of the French, which occasion offered them, to wit, to treat
upon agreement with Caesar more honorably, and to conclude it upon more
ra^ional conditions: But that they should endeavor above all things to keep
the French Forces far from Italy, there being nothing less credible then that
when the French should have got^en the Dukedom of Millan, they would limite
themselves, and not strive to make themselves Masters of the other Dominions.
That the Venetians being wearied with the length of War, ought now greedily to
embrace peace and quiet, to the which nothing could be more averse then the
coming of the French into Italy, from whence a cruel War might easily be
foreseen, wherewith whole Italy might be long molested. But on the contrary if
the Commonwealth would join with the Dutch, Spaniards, and Potentates of Italy
to drive out the French, when they should but hear of this confederacy, it
would be enough to make them lay aside the thought of renewing the War, which
they were now preparing to do; and so the Affairs of Italy might be reduced to
a peaceable condition. That if this his counsel should be contemned, the Pope
took God and man to witness that he had never been wanting to the common good
of Christendom, nor to the particular welfare of the Commonwealth of Venice.
That it was to be imagined he had hitherto done as he was perswad^d by reason
and experience: That he might peradventure give way hereafter to his own
affections, siding with Caesar and the Spaniards, and join with them to the
prejudice of those, of whose safety he had so long been in vain careful; nor
ought they to be the more confident of him, for that the Interests of the
Apostolic See and of the Commonwealth were the same, so as they were both to
run the same Fortune, being both of almost alike subject to the same chances:
That they should remember that they also being governed once, more by their own
peculiar affections then by reason, and to revenge the injuries done by
Lodowick Sforza, had not such consideration as they ought to have had, to the
danger whereinto they put the Commonwealth, by calling in for their Companion
of War a powerful foreign King, who was to neighbor upon their Dominions, in
stead of a weak Italian Prince. That therefore they should be well advised and
learn how to reap some advantage by the Popes favor, which they had ever till
now endeavored to preserve.

Thus did Bembo deliver his Embassy in such manner as he was commanded; but
the Senate were much otherwise minded, esteeming it neither a safe nor easy
thing to have recourse to Cesar's favor and the Spaniards. So as these the
Popes request being reported to the Senate by the Savij of the council,
according to custom, they were not accepted of, but by frequent Votes they
resolved to continue in the favor of the French, and to give this Answer to
the Popes Legate.

That his Embassy was very w^ll received by the Senate, as well in respect of
his own person, whose worth and singular love to his Country was very well
known to them all, as also in regard of that Prince who had sent him; for great
had the observancy always been which the Commonwealth had born to the Popes of
Rome, but that their inclination bore them more particularly to reverence, and
observe Leo; wherefore the Senate had always highly esteemed his wise Couns^ls
and friendly Admonishments. But that it had fallen out by a certain Fatality,
that the more they had desired his Friendship and Association above that of all
others in so great variety of Affairs, the less could they get to join in
confederacy with him; so as though their good wills were never severed from
him, yet it behooved that their Forces should be always divided. That therefore
as they returned many thanks unto his Holiness, and did confess the great
obligations which the Commonwealth had to him, for his having by many
endeavors readily embraced and favored their cause; so were they very much
troubled that they could not follow his advice, since the ancient custom of the
Commonwealth would not permit, that leaving ancient Confederacies, they should
make new ones, or unprovoked by any injury, forbear to do that which was
convenient f^r them, and which by Articles and Conventions they were bound to
do. That they had always been taught by their Forefathers that what was honest
was useful; that therefore they could not without great Infamy to the
Commonwealth, break that League which they had a little before made with the
French. Moreover that if the Pope would call to mind the ancient merits of the
Kings of France as well toward the Church, as toward the State of Venice, as
also the Wealth and Power of so great a King, he would commend this their
advice, and think that he himself ought to follow their example, for the safety
of the Ecclesiastical State, and the greatness of his Family would be better
founded, by his adhering to the Forces of the French, and to the Venetians
Friendship.

Moreover they acquainted Bembo with their Jealousies, which made them believe
that such a Treaty of Peace would not be very safe: Since the Pope was
persuaded thereunto by the Emperor, and by Ferdinand, who, as it did plainly
appear, did under a pretense of agreement, plot as they formerly had done, a
pernicious War against the Commonwealth; for at the same time when the
Embassabour of Spain treated with the King of France touching the Affairs of
Italy, Ferdinando had begun to renew these Treaties of Peace, out of no other
end certainly but to make the King of France jealous of the Venetians, whereby
he might make more advantageous conditions with him. Which when he should have
done, and that the Venetians were dis-associated from the French, what could
keep him from making himself Master of whole Italy, which he had long
endeavored? Bembo returned to the Pope with this answer to his Embassy. The
Venetians calling to mind what Leo had often affirmed, that he would never give
way, no not though the Senate had assented thereunto, that any part of the
Commonwealth should remain in the power of any other, knowing that by her the
Liberty of Italy was chiefly maintained, and that it behooved the Greatness of
the House of Medici to have her for their leaning stock, they certainly thought
they ought not to believe much in his exhortations; for at the same time that
he divulged these things under pretense of Friendship, he treated with them of
peace after such a manner as that if it had been granted, the Commonwealth
would be berest of the richest and noblest part of her Dominions; by consenting
that Caesar should keep Verona, a gallant City, and the Gate of Italy, whereby
he might always enter at his pleasure to ruin her. But the Venetians did build
their chiefest hopes upon the coming of the French into Italy, which made them
care so little for Peace; for Lewis not being able to fall upon the Enterprise
of Millan the year before, by reason of the War with England, and yet longing
very much to put an end to the War in Itataly, the differences being now
accorded between him and Henry King of England; he had promised to send over a
great and powerful Army very speedily to Italy; to which when the Venetian
Forces should be added, they thought they might be able to drive their Enemies
from the confines of the Commonwealth. Who as they were more insolent by
reason of the late troubles of the French, so the force of the League being
strengthened by their return into Italy, and they themselves wanting many
things, especially Moneys, they would lay aside their audaciousness, and for
their own safeties sake put on new resolutions. To increase these their hopes,
and to confirm such Princes as were their Friends, still in Friendship with
them, they chose two Ambassadors, to send to the two Kings, the one of France,
the other of England, to wit, Francisco Donato, and Pietro Pasquillio; but
Donato falling soon after desperately sick, they chose Sebastiano Giustiniano
in his place.

They were first to congratulate with both these Kings for the Peace, and
Marriage which had ensued between them, (for Lewis had married Mary, Sister to
Henry) and that they should render them many thanks, for that the one and the
other of these Princes, had in the Articles of Peace made between them, named
the Venetians as their Friends and Confederates. That they should also assure
the King of France, that the Senate had the same intentions as he had, and the
like desire of renewing the War, and to increase the strength of the League;
that therefore he should not doubt of the Venetians good will toward him,
since they were not only most ready to continue the Friendship of the French,
and to prefer it at all times, and upon whatsoever events before any other
Friendship which might be propounded to them, but also, if occasion should
require, be as ready for their service to undertake new enmities; that the
condition of times had often caused an interruption of their offices of good
will, which was not notwithstanding irradicated out of their minds. And that
though the Ambassadors should find a ready willingness in the King, concerning
the Affairs of Italy, and of the Commonwealths Interests, they would not
notwithstanding forbear to make use of public authority to exhort him to come
as soon as might be into Italy, promising him that the Venetian assistance
should be such and so ready, as it was not to be doubted but that being joynd
with his Forces, they might break the Forces of the common Enemies, and taking
from them that which they had injuriously possessed, reduce such things under
the Dominion of the King of France, and of the Venetian Commonwealth, as did
belong to each of them. The Ambassadors were enjoined to perform the like
offices with the King of England; that there had always many good offices been
mutually observed between the Kings of England and the Commonwealth; that they
were confident that Henry would carry himself so as they showed not need to
desire any farther demonstration of Love from him; but that he would of himself
do whatsoever he knew might make for the good of the Commonwealth. But that
they should chiefly entreat him, to endeavor the increase of the King of
France his affection toward the Commonwealth, and by his exhortations incite
him to send his Forces away immediately into Italy to their succor; whereby
great glory would redound unto his name.

This was that which was given in charge to the Ambassadors. But whilst they
were upon their way, King Lewis fell sick and dyed. It was thought that his
death would have caused great alteration of Affairs. The Ambassadors were not
recalled, but commanded to go on; and for what concerned their Embassy, they
were to expect new commissions from the Senate. King Lewis afforded the
Commonwealth of Venice occasion of proving various successes of Fortune. His
Friendship was useful to them at the beginning; for they made good advantage of
his asistance to revenge the Injuries done them by Lodowick Sforza; so as she
got Cremona, a great and rich City, and for a while the favor and friendship
of so great a King, seemed to win the Commonwealth no small credit with other
Princes; but afterward, when not to part from the Friendship of the French,
the Venetians took up Arms against the Emperor Maximillian, they fell into
great troubles and dangers. Moreover Lewis was the first Author and Driver on
of the League of Cambray, which was cause of great ruin to the Commonwealth;
as may be partly known by what you have already heard. Lastly he who had
plotted so great mischiefs against the Commonwealth, re-assuming his first
affection toward her, began to desire and to endeavor her exaltation, and did
at this time use all the means he could to make her return to her former Power
and Honor. And certainly the Commonwealths recovery of her State in Terra
firma afterward by the asistance of the French, must be chiefly attributed to
Lewis, who did use the same various and uncertain Proceedings all his life
time; so as he made others, by reason of his inconstancy, make trial of Fortune
several times, so did not he neither continue steadfast either in prosperous or
adverse fortune, nor did he long make trial of the same luck. All humane
Affairs are for the most governed by such mutual alterations.

The End of the Second Book.
THE HISTORY OF VENICE, Written by PAULO PARUTA. BOOK III. THE CONTENTS.
FRancis Duke of Angolema is declared King of France. He is well minded toward

betakes himself slowly to the Enterprise of Verona. He retreats at last, and is
distasted by the Senate, who are jealous of his Actions. The King of France and
Duke of Burgony meet at Brussels. Diverse difficulties which arise there; an
agreement is made at last; by which Verona returns to be under the Venetians.

THeir time of rejoicing for the death of King Lewis, who were troubled at the
power of the French in Italy, lasted but a little; but the Venetians hopes
began quickly to revive, who desired the return of that Nation into Italy to
reduce their Affairs to a better condition, who were likely to have suffered
longer by the late Kings death; for Prince Francis, Duke of Angulesne, to whom
by their ancient rights of that Kingdom, he being descended of the House of the
Capets, and the nearest a Kin to the late King, the succession did belong, was
declared King of France. He being young, and of an eager Spirit, of a lively
and ready wit, greatly desirous of War, and all things fitting for War being
ready and prepared by King Lewis, every one thought that the new King, who
suddenly had his eye upon Millan, and wanted not Forces to assault it, would
forthwith send a powerful army to that purpose beyond the Mountains; and he was
the more fervent herein, for that he thought he had just cause to undertake
this War, since new reasons were added to the ancient pretenses which the
Kingdom of France had to that State; for he had married Claudia, eldest
daughter to King Lewis, to whom the state of Millan might seem to belong; her
Father being ^on to a daughter of Iovan Galleazo Visconte. But the desire of
redeeming the ancient reputation of the French Militia, which he knew was much
lessened by the unfortunate success of the battle before Novara, by the
dishonorable conventions made with the Switzers at Dijune, and by the loss of
two noble cities, Terroana and Tornai, which were taken by the English,
prevailed most with this young King, who was desirous of Military Glory. Which
mischiefs King Lewis could not remedy; for just when Fortune began to smile
upon him, and that the honor of France began to revive, he dyed. Francis
therefore thought he had a fair occasion offered him of doing what he so much
desired, if by his Forces he should win a noble Dukedom, which did of right
belong unto him, by which Enterprise the Glory of his name would be much
increased, and the Power of France, and whereby way would be made for greater
achievements. He therefore together with the Government of the Kingdom, took
upon him the same thoughts of renewing the War in Italy, wherein his Father in
Law, Lewis, had been much versed. And knowing that Friendship with the State of
Venice, might make much toward his getting the Victory, as soon as he had
taken the Crown upon him, he writ kind and affectionate Letters to the Senate,
wherein he acquainted them with his being King, and showing a ready and good
affection toward the Commonwealth, he seemed to desire to know their opinion
touching their renewing of their League with the Kingdom of France; and that if
he should find them disposed like himself, the League and ancient Friendship
might easily be renewed to the common good. He made the Bishop of Aste signify
as much unto them, who was then in Venice, having been sent Ambassador thither
by King Lewis. Wherefore the Venetians who at the same time coveted friendship
with the French, and desired that they would come into Italy; and who as soon
as they had heard of Lewis his death, had charged their Ambassador Marco
Dandalo that he should endeavor to pry into the secret counsels and intentions
of the new King, and should begin to treat of renewing the confederacy; when
they had received these Letters, and Embassies from the King, seeming to put an
high esteem upon his Friendship, they humbly thanked him for his affection to
the Commonwealth, and for his desire to assist them. They promised to
correspond with him in love and affection; saying they knew very well how much
it imported both of them to keep the Forces of France and theirs joined
together by reciprocal obligations of League: That they were therefore ready to
renew the present League, and would always be ready to assist him in getting
some Footing in Italy, and in aggrandizing his Power, so as he might be a
terror to his Enemies, and a friend and sure help to the Commonwealth.
Moreover the Ambassadors who were sent, as you have heard, to the Kings of
France and England, and who being upon their journey, had tarried at Lions
after Lewis his death, were ordered to go on, and had commissions sent them to
renew the League with the King of France. These when they were come to Court,
did easily renew the League upon the former Articles: To which the King was
already so much inclined, and treated with such fervency of the Affairs of
Italy, as he labored in all his discourses with the Venetian Ambassadors, to
show them what reasons had moved him to undertake this War; affirming that he
would never lay down Arms, till he had gotten the state of Millan, and till the
Commonwealth had recovered all the Cities which she had lost, and were
returned to her former Dignity. The Venetians were very glad of this the Kings
resolutions: and fearing lest this so great fervency, might (as it often falls
out) be by some new accident abated, they showed him how that the chiefest
hopes of Victory lay in expedition, to the end that the Enemy whose Forces were
now much diminished, and their resolutions doubtful and uncertain, might not
have time to recrute and reassume courage: and that the City of Crema this
mean while, which was known by experience, might be a great help toward the
recovery of Millan, might not run any farther hazard, which having for so many
years undergone the inconveniences of War, was now brought to great extremity;
and that the Truce made with their Enemies being now near an end, stood them in
no stead; for they had heard it credibly reported, that Prospero Colonna had
assembled his Forces together from all parts, and prepared to besiege that
City. That the Senate would not be wanting in any thing that was in them to do,
who had already begun to raise new Soldiers, and to provide Arms, Money, and
Ammunition. Moreover, that though the War were chiefly to be made by Land-men,
yet thinking it not fit to lay aside the thought of ordering their Fleet, that
they might upon occasion therewith molest the Enemy, they had resolved to rig
out many Galleys, entreating his Majesty that he would do the like. The
Ambassadors having thus done all they had in command with the King at Paris,
they went into England to fulfill the other part of their Embassy; where being
graciously received, they showed in their first Audience.

The Venetians great sorrow for the death of King Lewis, husband to King
Henry's Sister, a great Friend to the Commonwealth. They then told the King
how highly the Commonwealth was bound unto him, for that in the Agreement made
formerly with King Lewis, and lately with King Francis, he desired that she, as
a Friend, and sharer with him in all his Fortunes might be particularly named
and included in the League. But afterward at a more private Audience, they
earnestly desires him, that he would by his Authority, and by his exhortations,
confirm the King of France in the mind he seemed to be in, of intending the
Affairs of Italy, and of sending assistance speedily to the Venetians; and that
in the mean time peace and friendship should be held inviolably between them,
from which great safety was to arise to both their States, and much advantage
to all Christendom; that the Senate of Venice for their parts would never be
wanting in any thing which might make for the g^od of the Crown of France, or
that of England; and did very much desire that these present Kings, as their
Predecessors had done, might know that the Commonwealth was much bound and
tied unto them.

This Embassy being done, Giustiniano stayed behind with Henry to treat of the
Commonwealths affairs, but Pasquillio returned to France, and being come to
Paris, he met with Letters and Commissions from the Senate, commanding him to
go immediately to Charles Duke of Burgony, and to congratulate the Marriage, and
Peace with him. From which as the Commonwealth knew that great honor and
safety was to redound to her, so was she very much pleased with her love and
observance toward them both. And that to make known this her good will, they
had sent this Embassy to make faith thereof unto him. By these complemental
ceremonies the Venetians strove to preserve themselves in the favor and good
will of other Princes, as the condition of times did require; but they were
desirous above all things to draw over the Pope unto them, and to make him join
with the French in Friendship: whereof they had the greater hopes, for that
Iuliano, the Popes Brother, who was of great power with the Pope, having
married Filiberta Daughter to the Duke of Savoy, who was allied to King
Francis, it was believed that he would favor the Affairs of France. Moreover,
that the Pope would hereafter be better inclined to friendship with the French,
for that they having by the last confederacy and alliance secured the King of
France from the King of England, and Duke of Burgony's Forces, it was known
their power in Italy would be much increased, and might become so formidable,
as that the proudest of Potentates might be injured by them. Yet the Pope,
continuing still doubtful, and never fixing upon any one resolution, was
sometimes one ways minded, sometimes another: Sometimes his hatred being
overcome by fear, he thought upon friendship with the French; but he held
discourse oftener, and more willingly, with Cesars and Ferdinando's
Ambassadors, touching agreeing with them. And he answered the Venetians, who
desired to learn somewhat of his Intentions, that for the present he would be a
Spectator of the Wars; and that when either side should have the Victory, he
would then declare himself and side with them that should have the better of
the business. Yet men thought otherwise, and that the Pope had many thoughts in
his head, but that he would keep them secret, to spin out the business in
length, hoping that in the interim, the King of France wanting his assistance,
and by his authority the like of the Venetians, would fore go all thoughts of
Italy.

But it was hardly credited that the Pope would have no hand in the War, but
that he would adhere with his Forces to some one side, when King Francis should
have past over the Mountains with a powerful Army; for he might clearly see
then, that things were brought to such a pass, as there was little security to
be hoped for from standing idle, and but little praise; and that he must either
fear others, or make others fear. So as when he should see the War resolutely
made by the French, and knowing the uncertainty of relying upon the Switzers,
how weak the Emperor was, and how cunning Ferdinand, so as he could not hope
for good by making League with them, he would be enforced to provide better for
his Affairs, by Friendship with the Venetians. Wherefore the Venetians thinking
it better to send Marino Georgio Ambassador to Rome, then Pietro Lando, they
wished him to treat otherwise with the Pope, then had hitherto been done, to
try whether he could make him alter his resolution; by acquainting him with
what danger he was in.

That therefore he should heighten the Forces of the King of France, which
since France was now free from War, might soon be sent into Italy; that then he
should let him know the king of France was so bent upon the getting of Millan,
as there was nothing how hard or difficult soever which could divert him from
this his constant resolution. That the Venetians had the same desire of
renewing the War, and of adhering to the French: That they had always greatly
desired to join with the Commonwealth of Rome both in time of Peace and War,
running the same Fortune, which they had always very much endeavored to do,
But that not being able to persuade Leo thereunto, and finding that the hopes
of Victory did not only not go less, but was not in any part diminished, the
Venetians saw no reason why they should forego the friendship of the French,
knowing that they had thereby very well provided for themselves; that therefore
his Holiness might put on such results as best became his Wisdom and the weight
of the Affair; that he might do well to think what hopes or what helps he could
have recourse unto, to hinder or to retard the King of France his resolutions;
and that if he could find none, that he should keep from resolving upon any
thing which did no ways stand with his Dignity, and which he himself knew, and
thought to be such. And that if the French should succeed well in their
Attempts, who would be able to defend the State of the Church, or the Pope from
their victorious Forces? That he might learn by what had already past, what the
strength of his Confederates would be, what their intentions, and what reason
they would have to wage War. That there was but one way to prevent all these
eminent dangers, by which the discords of so many years might receive a period,
and Italy be freed from fear; to wit, the Popes joining in League with the
French and Venetians; for it was certainly believed that the Switzers being
abandoned by his authority, and deprived by his assistance, would no longer
defend Maximillian Sforza, but would lay down their arms which they had taken
up against the French: So as the Confederates being bereft of their aid, would
be enforced to change their counsels: and Caesar quitting any farther thoughts
of Italy, and Ferdinando resting satisfied with his Kingdom of Naples, others
might recover what was theirs; the French the Duchy of Millan, and the
Venetians such Cities as were injuriously detained from them: and all things
might be reduced to perfect Peace and Tranquillity; but that if this business
should be otherwise handled, the War would without all doubt be prolonged, and
the Miseries of Italy would be renewed. Which things as they made much for the
universal good, and for the quiet of Christendom, so would they bring glory to
Leo, and to the House of Medici; for what could there be more glorious to him,
then by his Wisdom to have put an end to so long a War, which had been so
unfortunate f^r Italy; Or what could occasion greater safety to his Brother,
and to his Nephew, then this universal quiet, wherein their greatness might be
confirmed, and their riches and dignity increased; that no account was to be
had of Maximillian Sforza, a new and weak Prince, where the Interests of so
great Princes were in question, who had always deserved so well of the
Apostolic See. That the Kings of France, and Commonwealth of Venice, had so
often undertaken sore Wars, not without great danger to defend the Pontifical
Dignity, as if Leo would have respect either to ancient or more modern Affairs,
he might easily know that these Princes ought to be upheld by Pontifical
Authority, and to be thereby assisted.

For all these well grounded reasons, Leo could not be persuaded to agree with
the French and Venetians, but being constant to his first resolution, thought
he might more easily draw the Venetians to condescend to his will; and finding
he could not compass his mind by fair means, he resolved to proceed more
rigorously with them. He published an Edict, whereby he prohibited all the
Subjects of the Church upon grievous penalties, to take any pay of the
Venetians, though at this time many Captains of that State had taken moneys of
them; moreover he commanded all his Captains of Horse, who were gone a little
before to Verona, under pretense of guarding that City, to go with all their
Horse into the Spanish camp; and in fine left nothing undone which he thought
might lessen the Venetians strength or reputation; to the end that being
environed with so many evils, they might be at last enforced to accommodate
themselves to his pleasure and to the times. But on the contrary, the Venetians
keeping firm to the French, hoped by that means to be able to sustain
themselves, and to defend their State, affirming that they thought themselves
safe enough in their Friendship. And thinking that this might be much witnessed
by keeping a French Ambassador in their camp, they prevailed with the King
Francis that Theadoro Trivulcio, (who having been sent by the King to Venice,
as you have heard, had kept still in the Army) should be still kept
Ambassador, and not have leave, according to his desire, to return into
France. Francis this mean while provided with all possible diligence for all
things necessary for War: He knew that great endeavors were made by the Enemy,
especially by the Switzers, and that he must have powerful Forces to suppress
them. He therefore resolved to go himself in person to Lions, to the end that
greater conceits being had of the preparations for War, and more haste being
had, the Enemy might be terrified, and their inconveniences might be augmented,
by a sudden and continued War. The French resolved to send part of their men
before into Piemont, to force the Switzers, when they should hear of their
approach, to quit their own homes the sooner, and block up their way: From
whence they thought they might get this good, that falling sooner into want of
Victuals and Money, and consequently beginning to dislike that Militia, which
they had adhered to only out of a desire of Novelty, and great hopes of prey
conceived by reason of their last Victory; and that being troubled likewise, as
they often times were, by domestic discords, they would give over the business
at the first, and return home leaving the passage open for the French Army. And
the fear of the Switzers being taken away, they needed not fear any of the
other confederates; for if they would keep sufficient Garrisons in the Cities
which they had taken from the Venetians, their numbers would be so lessened, as
they would not have Forces sufficient to make up the body of an Army, able to
oppose the French, when they should be entered Italy.

The King gave the charge of this whole business to Charles Burbone Grand
Esquier de France, to whom he gave the chief authority of ordering the War, in
case he himself should not go along with his Army out of the Kingdom, whereof
he was not yet positively resolved. Burbone was at this time in great esteem
and authority at Court; for his Mother, who was daughter to Frederick Marquess
of Mantua, a woman of a man-like Spirit, and endowed with many noble qualities,
had purchased much favor and authority both to her self and son from all the
chief Personages about the Court. Whilst these things were doing in France, the
Viceroy to debar the Venetians from any quiet, when the Popes Chivalry was
come, as has been said, to the Spanish Forces, and many Troops of Horse being
according to order come to the Cities of Brescia and Bergamo, he marched with
his Army toward the Banks of Adice, with a resolution of coming to Vicenza,
hoping to win that City easily and in a fitting time, to sieze upon the revenue
of silk, wherein that Country did much abound, and to turn it into pay for the
Soldiery. But Alviano having notice thereof, resolved to march out of Padua,
where he then was, and to go with all possible speed to the Territories of
Vicenza, taking along with him so many of his men, as were sufficient to munite
the City of Vicenza, to disturb their intentions, and to break their designs;
and many being of a contrary opinion, Alviano gave them reasons for this his
resolution, showing chiefly of what importance it was to him and to his Army
which was beaten in the last rout, to get some reputation for the inheartning
of the people, who seemed to be very affectionate to the Venetians, and to keep
them in their Loyalty and Duties, he therefore kept upon those confines till
such time as the Inhabitants had time to gather in their silk, and to carry it
into more safe places; the Enemy having this mean while endeavored in vain by
often change of Quarters, to force our men to forego those Territories, and to
retreat to where the other Army remained. But the cause of his coming thither
being ceased, and knowing that he could not tarry longer there without some
danger; for the Enemy being gotten very near, were encamped at Barbarano, where
people flocking to their camp from elsewhere their Forces did daily increase,
Alviano retreated with all his men toward Padua, where Renzo Ceri was with the
rest of the Army, and resolved to take up his Quarters at the Town Brentelle,
two miles distant from Padua, where he tarried a long time; for the Senate
tak^ng the safest way, ordered Alviano not to stir with the Army from thence,
unless he were so sure of the Enemies ways, as that he might not be compelled
to fight; from which the Senate being always averse, it was now thought he
ought chiefly to abstain; for if he should receive any the least prejudice,
whereby he might suffer either in his Forces or reputation, the King of France
would cool very much in his thoughts concerning Italy; since he himself had
often affirmed that he relied very much upon the Venetians asistance; to which
purpose he had often let them know by his Ambassador that he wished them not
to hazard a Battle, nor put themselves upon any the least danger, before he
should be come into Italy; for it would not be wisely done, to hazard the whole
success of that War, upon a part of their Forces. The Venetian Army being
therefore come to the castle of Este, after the Spaniards were removed from the
parts about Vicenza to those of Verona; the Senate out of the same
consideration would not listen to Alviano touching the leading of his men into
the confines of Rovigo; for the French drawing near to Italy, by whose coming
the Spaniards would be soon forced to keep aloof from their confines, they
thought it became them to wait for such an opportunity, to the end that they
might both keep their forces farther from their own State, and assault the
others with better hopes: Yet at this time the Soldiers of the Commonwealth
made many incursions, whereby the light Horse did chiefly disturb and trouble
the Enemy. This business was committed to Mercurio Bu^, and to Giovan di Naldo,
who behaved themselves very gallantly. Naldo, passing into the Territories of
Rovigo, took many Curassiers Prisoners; and Bua entering into the confines of
Verona, brought away good store of prey, and came so near the Walls of Verona,
as meeting by chance with the Count di Caretto, who was a little before come
out of one of the Gates of the City, he had taken him Prisoner, had he not
saved himself from the Enemy who pursued him, by throwing himself into the
Ditch without the Wall. Thus did both the Venetian and Spanish Army pass away
many days without making any Attempts, each of them governing themselves
according to the approach of the French. Yet the Senate resolved at the same
time to send Renzo da Ceri with most of the Infantry, to Crema, to witness unto
the King how much they desired to infuse terror into the Enemy. This mean
while the French were very busy in preparing Arms, Horse, warlike Instruments,
in raising Soldiers in all parts of their own Country, in taking in
Foreigners upon great stipend, and Commanders of best esteem, and in making
haste to put all things in order for a great and powerful Army, wherewith it
was generally said that the King would go himself in person to recover the
State of Millan. The King would often say in his discourse with the Venetian
Ambassador, that he had a great desire to see the City of Venice, and that
now, that he was to be so near, he would not sl^p the occasion, which he
desired several times to acquaint the Senate with, The like was confirmed by
all the chief of the Court, who spoke very honorably of the Venetians. There
was so great a desire seen in them all of coming for Italy, and so general a
consent to undertake this War, as that there was not any considerable man in
France, who did not mind this business with all his might; every one strove to
wait upon the King in this journey, and all places sounded of Preparations for
War. The Pope being much troubled hereat, seeing himself to be endangered by
this War, began to lean a little to friendship with the French: Yet he was on
the other side incited to keep his confederacy with Caesar out of hope of very
great matters which were offered him, in reward for his pains, and danger by
the Emperor, and the other Confederates; for at this time the League which had
been treated of with the Switzers was finally concluded, in which Maximillian
Sforza, Caesar, the King of Spain, and the Switzers did join for the defense of
the State of Millan, with a resolution not only to oppose the French with all
their might, if they should make War in Italy, but to assault the confines of
France in several places; in which confederacy the Pope being named, they used
all the means they could to have his company in this War. Insomuch as certain
difficulties arising upon the confirming of the agreement, by reason of the
Cities of Parma and Piacenza, which the Pope would keep to himself, and the
Switzers professing on the contrary, to defend Maximillian Sforza and his
Dignity, they could not be brought to consent that he should be deprived of
these two noble Cities; to accommodate which difference, the Confederates
promised, that instead of Parma and Piacenza, the Cities of Brescia, Crema and
Bergamo, should be joined to the Dukedom of Millan, when they should be taken
by the common Forces: In which case not only Modena and Reggio, but Parma and
Piacenza, which were then in the possession of Iuliano, the Popes brother,
Feudatory of the Church, should be left to the Apostolic See. Caesar and
Ferdinand were persuaded to yield to these agreements, for fear lest the
Switzers, when they should see the Pope depart with his authority and Forces
from the League, they might also forego the agreement made with them, and join
with the French, to which they were by many Embassies continually sollicitated.
Then which nothing could be more pernicious to the Confederates, nor was more
to be feared. The Pope being long assailed by two powerful affections, Fear and
Ambition, at last thinking that he had certain hopes offered him of his
brothers greatness, coveteousness overcame, and forced him to yield to what she
propounded; and trusting that those things might easily fall out which he so
much desired, he changed his former fear into confidence, thinking that
assuredly when the French should understand this conclusion of a League made
against them by so many Potentates, they would give over the design they had
for Italy. The agreement being thus made, the Pope forthwith sent the
Florentine Forces, under the Government of his Brother Iuliano into Lombardy.
Caesar at the same time being according to his custom, greedy of Money, but very
poor, did continually solicit the Towns and Princes of Germany to assist him
both with men and moneys: Nor did he leave any thing undone which might make
for the muniting of Verona, and the increasing of his Army in Friuli, to the
end that growing stronger, it might advance and fall upon other of the Venetian
Territories. From whence he expected this advantage for the Confederates, that
the Venetians being busied in defending themselves, should not be able to
assist the French at their first coming into Italy. He assembled many Dyets in
diverse parts of Germany, he desired, entreated, commanded them, not to abandon
him now, when he was endeavoring things which would be so advantageous for
himself and for the German Nation. He moreover chose several principal men to
send them with the Army into Italy; to wit, Casimere, the Marquess of
Brandebourg, and Bartholomeo a Commander of Slesia; Casimere had the charge of
keeping Verona given him, and the Marquess was to enter Friuli with a new Army
to ransack the Country; but Bartholomeo as he was going into Bohemia to raise
men was drowned in the Danube; notwithstanding all these Preparations,
Maximillian did not trust so much in his own Forces, nor in those of his
Confederates, as to hope to overcome the French and the Venetians, wherefore he
began to incite other Princes against the Commonwealth. To this purpose he
called an assembly in Hungary, in the City of Possonia, where he endeavored to
have Sigismond King of Polonia, and Udislaus King of Hungary present, with whom
giving out that he had to treat of many important things, his chief drift was
to move those Princes to take up Arms against the Venetians; but he, handling
all things with a certain natural negligence, when the rest were met at the
Assemby, he came not thither himself; but being busied about slighter Affairs,
sent the Cardinal Gurghense thither in his name, giving him in charge to
propound such things as were to be treated of in that Diet. But nothing was
concluded in what Caesar chiefly desired; and particularly touching the proposal
made, against the Venetians; answer was made by both the Kings.

That they had no reason to take up Arms against the Venetians, with whom they
had had long friendship, and which had been confirmed by many good Offices:
Moreover that the present condition of times were such as the weakening of that
Commonwealth could not but turn to the great prejudice of all Christian
Princes; and that the power and reputation thereof, ought rather to be
maintained, that they might be the better able to resist the Turks, who were
grown so insolent and bold by the late Victory which they had gotten in Persia;
and had at the same time so enlarged their Confines by their having overcome
John King of Da^ia, as all Christendom had reason to dread their Forces: That
therefore it would be much better done to endeavor the reconciling of such
Christian Princes as were at odds and enmity by reason of so long and heavy
Wars, that so they might with joint consent oppose the so formidable power of
the Ottoman Lords; lest whilst Christian Princes out of greediness strove to
make themselves Masters of one another States, they might not all of them be
inslaved by barbarous people.

Both these Kings did therefore promise to use their best means and authority
with the other Princes, and chiefly with the Commonwealth of Venice, to
persuade them to lay down Arms; which Udislaus did immediately endeavor by his
Ambassador, who lay Leiger at Venice. And Sigismond chose Matthew Bishop of
Udislavia, and Rafaelle di Licusco, Commander of Scodovia for his Ambassadors,
whom he sent to Venice, to acquaint the Senate in his name,

That it was the King of Polands desire, that the Commonwealth after so long
and tedious Wars, would at last be reconciled with Maximillian, with whom as he
had often formerly treated of Peace, so he did now the like with the Venetian
Senate, in desiring them to lay aside the memory of past Injuries, and embrace
peace and concord; and if any thing of hatred or prejudice remained in them by
the late Wars, that they should pass it over for his sake, and for the like of
all Christendom. The Senate thought fit to give the same Answer to these
Ambassadors, as they had formerly done to the like propositions.

That the Venetians did not first make War with Caesar, but had taken up Arms in
their own defense; that they did not desire to possess themselves of any thing
that belonged to another, but to recover, what of right belonged to themselves,
and that they would willingly lay down Arms, when they might do it upon
honorable terms.

Thus, and by these means did Caesar endeavor to renew the War, but Ferdinando,
though he were bound by Articles of agreement to wage War from the Perenean
Mountains, yet not thinking that to do so would make any thing for their
advantage, he neither prepared any men for that Enterprise, nor did he hasten
to send Foot into Italy to increase his Army, being resolved, as it appeared,
not to keep any Soldiers as then in pay, save such as were under Cardona's
command, which he kept upon very small expense, upon design, that keeping his
Forces entire, he might take the Empire of the States of Italy from out of the
hands of others, when they should be weary and wasted. But the Switzers made
open profession of maintaining that War, saying that they preferred the Honor
of Maximillian Sforza, and the liberty of entire Italy, before their own
particular good; for they were so inheartned by the good success which they had
had in many Battles, as they believed they were able of themselves alone to
free all Italy from the fear of the French. Wherefore as soon as the League was
made, they began to choose out their best Soldiers, and to order many
Companies, and having received two months pay, they came in great numbers into
Piemont, and quartering themselves in three places, Susa, Pignarv^lo, and
Saluzzo, they blocked up all the ways o^ that side. The French prepared this
mean while to make War more settedly, and upon better advice, then did the
Confederates; for that their affairs were governed with a joint consent, and
for that they did cheerfully hasten to pass into Italy; their Army being the
greater by reason that the Kingdom of France was on all sides free from
Enemies; for though Ferdinand was tied by the articles of the League to enter
with an Army into the confines of Guirome, and the Switzers into the Dukedom of
Burgony, to perplex the French, yet neither of them had made any Preparations
to do so. Wherefore the French having prepared all things ready for their
departure, began on the 15th of July to march toward the Alps; and being come
to Grenoble they quartered their Army in the neighboring parts; for they were
necessitated to stay there awhile to resolve upon what way they would go. There
were great difficulties on all sides; for all the passages were so blocked up
either by the nature of the places, or by the Enemies, as they could not make
their way without much labor and danger. If they would go by the right and
ordinary way, and enter Italy by the Confines of Piemont, the Switzers had
possessed the narrowest passes, so as they must cut their way through with
their Swords, and fight the Enemy upon great disadvantage: and if leaving the
Cotian Alps on the left hand, they would pass lower with their Army, they were
to overcome the tops of steep craggy Mountains, and to pass through large
Valleys, with great inconvenience and difficulty, which would be the greater by
reason of the numbers of men, and cattle, and the train of Artillery which they
brought with them. Yet the King could not be pacified with these
considerations, who resolved to pass upon whatsoever conditions, and not to
leave any thing unattempted which might be done either by labor or industry;
hoping by power and constancy to overcome the natural asperity of the places.
So taking their way by the right side of the Alps, which looks toward the
South, and terminates upon the Tuscan Sea, the French came in three days to the
Mountain Argenta; and going from thence on the left hand by diverse unaccustomed
paths, they overcame all difficulties on the fourth day, and to the great joy
of the Soldier, brought their whole Army into the Confines of the Marquisate
of Saluzzo; they past from thence unto Vercelles, where they tarried to advise
how they were to manage their War. About 2000 Switzers kept all the ways at the
Foot of the Pennimen, and Cotien Alps, called Montcinese, guarded and blocked
up, that they might oppose the French on that side, by which they thought they
were to come and hinder their passage: and when they heard that the powerful
Enemy had deluded their Forces, by taking another way, and that they were
already got out of the hardest and most difficult passages, they admired the
worth, and Fortune of the French; and chiefly the constancy of the Kings
resolution, to which it seemed even nature her self had yielded obedience; and
then they began to abate much of their former forwardness, and to despair of
Victory. So laying aside all thoughts of joining Battle without the advantage
of place, they retreated to Novara; which made the French hope they might soon
end the War, and get the State of Millan without the loss of blood. They were
well acquainted with the nature and customs of the Switzers; how that they
were fickle, seditious, easy to fall at odds, desirous of Novelties, but
chiefly greedy of money; they therefore began quickly to bethink themselves to
overcome them with this engine of gifts, and fair promises. Many of them being
hereby tempted, laid aside their first desire of glory in War; and preferring
the certain reward which by agreement was promised them, before the uncertain
hopes of Arms; minded presently to return home; they with much arrogance
demanded pay, left their Colors, refused to obey Sedunense, and the rest of
their Commanders; and all things went tumultuously on. They gave these reasons
chiefly for this their so great change, that things had succeeded prosperously,
nay with great glory to the French at their first entrance into Italy, and on
the contrary, whatsoever the Switzers had attempted, had proved vain and
ignominious; that therefore having lost all hopes of Victory, and more certain
gain being offered them, it was in vain to spin out the War any longer. The
Duke of Burbone, who commanded the first Squadrons of the French Army, past
first on the left hand not far from Ville Francha, where Prospero Colonna by
chance was, who hearing of the arrival of the French, came thither to muster
the Switzers Army, which till then was divided in several parts; to the end
that being all in one body, they might oppose the Enemy in their passage into
Lombardy, and fight them whilst they were tired and weary with their journey.
But the French prevented Prospero in his designs; for Palissa and Obegny went
with a good number of Foot toward the Town, where Colonna with his men thought
himself to be safe; and having sent some few Soldiers before clad like
Pedlers, who made as if they would lodge in the Town, the Guards at the Gates,
who suspected no such thing, were by them slain, and the Gates being possessed,
the French Commanders and those that followed them entered, and took Colonna
Prisoner together with all his Horse. At which all the rest being discouraged,
as well for the loss of so gallant a Commander, as for shame of the thing, fell
into such disorder, as the Colleagues Forces were of several opinions, and
divided in all things. The Viceroy, who had stayed long in the Territories of
Verona, and taken up his Quarters about the Banks of Poe, durst not advance any
farther; and Lorenzo di Medici stayed to little purpose, with the Popes men at
Parma, not undertaking any thing. So as no succor coming to the Switzers,
Maximillian Sforza's difficulties grew daily greater, and his hopes of
defending his State, which was set upon at one and the same time in several
parts, grew less, for King Francis, thinking it made much for the Victory to
keep the Enemies Forces divided in several parts, whilst the affairs of Italy
were in great commotion, by reason of the unexpected arrival of his Army, had
sent Emat de Pria, with a good Band of choice Foo^, and with 400 Horse to
Genua, to find out Ottaviano Fregoso. This man had then the Principality of
that City, and had begun long before to adhere unto the French Party; and
having gathered together 4000 Foot, and received the French Forces, he joined
with them, and at unawares fell upon Lombardy beyond the Poe, and laid all that
Country waste. Moreover the King did much solicit the Venetians (who were
ready enough of themselves) to move speedily with their Forces: So as Renzo da
Ceri being returned, as has been said, to Crema, the Senate commanded him to
enter in hostile manner into the State of Millan, and to endeavor the recovery
of some of those Towns, as occasion should serve, in the name of the King of
France. And though the Truce was not yet ended which was formerly made between
the Cities of Crema and Millan, it was thought that no private agreement could
hinder this order, because the men that were drawn out then against the Enemy,
were not taken out of the Garrison of Crema; but were newly come to the Army
from Padua; and moreover they fought not at the entreaties of the Venetians,
but for the King of France his service. The Venetians had likewise ordered
their Captain General, that as soon as he should know the Spanish Army was gone
from the Territories of Verona, he should go with all his men into Lombardy,
and take with him those others that were sent to Crema, that so he might fall
upon greater undertakings. He therefore understanding that the Enemy were gone,
went from Polisine di Rovegio, where he had staid awhile, and past over the
River Adice, with his Camp, at Abbadia, and came near Cremona, exciting all the
people as he past by, to Rebellion. The French Army was in another part, which
proceeded forcibly, and made great progress against the State; so as Sforza's
Dominion, being set upon on so many sides was shortly to fall; the King of
France being already with all his men within his Confines, and finding that the
Treaty handled by the Duke of Savoy, was spun out at length, and proved vain,
he prepared to lay Siege to Millan. The disagreement was occasioned by the
coming of many new companies of Switzers to the Camp, who unacquainted with the
troubles of War, were more hot in the prosecution thereof; said that Sforza's
reputation, which they had undertaken to defend, was to be maintained by the
Sword, not by Treaty; so as the face of War was various and doubtful, both
Peace and War being at the same time in discourse with the Switzers, and there
being many Armies in the same State; some to oppugn it, some to defend it, but
all of them so divided, as the Forces of neither party could be increased by
the assistance of their companions; none of them having the means allowed them
of meeting together, but were by the nearness of the Enemy, forced to take
uncertain and dubious counsels; wherefore the King did desire the more to have
Alviano's Forces join with his: To which purpose he was gone to the Town of
Marignano, where he took up his Quarters. From hence he write to the Venetian
Senate, acquainting them with his safe arrival in Italy, and with his
prosperous successes, and moreover made his hopes and his counsels known to
them. Thus the affairs of the French and Venetians went on with great union
both of mind and Forces. The others being this mean while doubtful what to do,
Renzo da Ceri being entered the confines of Millan with 2000 Foot, 500 light
Horse, and 200 Curassiers, had taken the Castle of Leone by force, and had
received many other Towns into the Kings Loyalty, carrying away such Soldiers
Prisoners as did guard them: Wherefore he was more honored and respected then
the rest; and had won so great a conceit of Worth, as mighty things were
expected from him; but certain secret enmity, increasing daily between him and
Alviano, Renzo could not suffer that the supreme degree of the Militia should
rest in Alviano. Wherefore foreseeing that when the Armies should be joined
together he should be compelled to obey him; at a time of great importance, he
asked leave, to give over serving the Venetians. They were both of them
certainly very gallant men, but very proud and haughty minded. Alviano would
not see any equal to him in Dignity, and Renzo could not be commanded by
another: and both of them were highly esteemed by the Venetians, who had been
very diligent in composing the differences between them: To which purpose the
Senate had sent Dominico Trevisano and G^orgio Cornaro, two Senators of great
authority, to Padua; but finding them both to be strangely high minded, and
full of envy and hatred, they could not appea^e them, nor make them friends;
wherefore they returned to Ven^ce without having done any thing. Renzo's
transcendent Worth, accompanied with like Fortune, had raised his name to that
height, as by consent of all men, he was equalled for fame and glory to the
most cried up Commanders of Italy: But either his Worth or his Fortune
beginn^ng to decline, he did not any thing from that time forwards worthy of
his former fame. Having obtained leave of the Senate, he went to Rome, under
pretense of negotiating his private affairs, but in effect, to be entertained
in the Popes service, wherein he had but ill success, so as the things which he
had attempted, but failed in, did in a great part obscure his formerly won
fame. Renzo being gone from Lodi, the Switzers finding the City without a
Garrison, possessed themselves of it; but hearing soon after that the French
Army drew near, and thinking that they were not able to defend it, they quickly
quit the City; which was soon possessed by Alviano's people who were formerly
gone into those parts. From thence Alviano went with some few of his men to
Marignano, to advise with the French how they were to manage the War.

Whilst these things were done, Alphonso Duke of Ferrara was only a quiet
Spectator of the success of War; and though he had often promised to adhere
unto the French, yet he had not as yet sent in any assistance; but minding his
own interest, solicited and entreated the Venetians to assault Modena and
Reggio, whilst their Army was in the Territories of Rovigo; affirming that
those Cities were so weakly garrisoned, as if their Army would but draw near
them, they might easily be taken; which when they should be, the Pope would be
so much troubled thereat, as apprehending his own affairs, he would easily be
persuaded to alter his resolution. But the Venetians, though the Pope adhered
to their Enemies, did notwithstanding abhor making War upon the
Ecclesiastical State; and this the more, because they did not as yet well know
the Kings mind herein; for Leo using his accustomed cunning, had not as yet
discovered his alienation from the King. Wherefore the Venetians not listening
to Alphonso's advice, pressed him to send his men unto the Camp, where the
Commonwealths Forces were, and to lend his assistance to the War, affirming
that nothing was to be done, but to lay a good foundation for the French; for
if they should prove prosperous, those Cities would certainly be restored to
him, as a reward of his pains and fidelity; it not being to be doubted but that
the Pope would follow the Victors fortune, and accept of such conditions of
agreement as they should impose upon him, who being victorious, were become
arbitrators of the affairs of Italy: That therefore, since the condition of
affairs were such now, as there was no peace to be hoped for, it behooved him
by all means to add unto the forces of the League, against the common Enemies;
for it was clear that those who had most men, would at last be Masters of the
Field and Towns. These reasons did not notwithstanding prevail with Alphonso to
make him quit his Neutrality, till he saw what would become of the War. Hardly
was Alviano gone from the confines of Rovigo, when Mark Antonio Colonna, who
had the keeping of Verona, issuing unexpectedly out of the City with 3000 Foot,
and about 700 Horse, entered the Confines of Vicenza, plundering and ruinating
the Country. At which though the Venetians were very much troubled, yet could
not the grief thereof make them forget their promises made to the King of
France, nor change their resolution, of pursuing the War in the places, and
manner already begun. Alviano gave order therefore that not any whatsoever
accident should make his men alter the way they had taken, but that they should
march on, and chiefly mind the good and greatness of the King of France; it
being their chief design to oblige him; for they knew if the King should
prosper in his attempts, the state of the affairs of Italy must change, and the
fortune of the Commonwealth must chiefly be raised up. Out of these reasons,
all other respects being laid aside, the Venetian Army past into Lombardy; but
the nearness of the Enemy kept them from joining with the French, so as all
things concerning the War proceeded yet but uncertainly; for there were four
Armies in the same Country, encamped not far from one another. There were in
the French Camp above 40000 men, of which 1500 Curassiers, the choice Noble men
of France. who being excellently well armed and horsed, were of great beauty
and strength unto the Army. The French men hoping that by these men chiefly
they might be able to keep the Country open every where, past on, and having
got the Cities of Pavia and Novara, they stayed, as has been said, in the Town
of Marignano. The Venetians were not far from this place, who having taken the
Town of Lodi, kept still in those parts, and this Army consisted of 12000 Foot
and 3000 Horse; and both these Armies had great store of Artillery, and of all
warlike Preparations. To oppose these there were two other Armies ready of the
Enemies, which were likewise forced for the same reasons to keep asunder. In
one of these Armies were the Popes Militia, the Florentines and the Spanish
Foot, of more esteem for the worth of their veterane Soldiers, then for their
numbers: and these lay near Piacenza upon the Banks of Poe. The other Army was
the Switzers, wherein 'twas said there was 40000 men, who being entered at this
time into Millan, at Sedunense's entreaties, kept the City excellently well
munited: and though they had neither Horse nor Artillery, yet were they full of
courage and confidence, as well in respect of their valor and military
discipline, as for the many Victories which they had won; so as the business
seemed to be so evenly balanced, as it was not easily to be discerned which
party was likeliest to be worsted, nor what the event of the War would be. But
whilst all labor alike, though upon several hopes and reasons, to weary the
Enemy, and to reduce them into straits, and that therefore it was thought by
all men, that the War would be spun out into the length, the Cardinal Sedunense
put an end to these doubts and delays. He being returned to the Camp, from
whence he was gone for fear of the rising of the multitude, re-assuming
courage, because many Bands of Soldiers, who adhered to his party, were come
unto the Army, breaking all Treaties of agreement, which till then had been
negotiated by the Duke of Savoy, he returned all things to the first covered
War: Unto which it was not hard to persuade the Switzers, who were fierce, and
desirous of money; for Sedunense magnifying the Triumphs, Rapines, and other
things which wait upon Victory, as great and assured rewards of their labors,
showed them how that by getting the State of Millan, they might with much glory
to their Nation, get much wealth, far beyond whatsoever was promised them by
the King of France in guiderdon of an ignonimious Peace. The Soldiers believed
this the rather, remembering the great Booty which they bore away in the last
Wars; wherefore not valuing any faith plighted, a choice Band of Switzers were
immediately sent to Castle Bufeloro to detain the Moneys which were brought
thither by the Kings agents to confirm peace with them. Thus all former
conventions being broken, Sedunense, to keep the King from any opportunity of
making those people who are subject to change, give over the thought of War,
knew he must come to blows with the Enemy as soon as he could, and try the
event of Battle; saying it stood not with the Switzers fame and reputation to
shun conflict. The French men in this interim, drawing near Millan, had taken
up their Quarters at San Donato, which Town they fortified without much labor,
because it was already environed by many Ditches, made by the Inhabitants; by
reason whereof the Commanders, thinking that they had found a very opportune
place, had in encamping themselves taken up such a space of ground, as that all
their Troops were so ordered and disposed of, as though the whole Army was
divided into three parts, the first Squadrons might easily succor the last;
and likewise that in the midst, those of either side. Which things being known
in the City, where they were advising touching the going forth of the Army,
some of the Switzer Commanders thought it a rash and dangerous advice to
assault the Enemy, who were ready and prepared for Battle; especially since it
was likely that within a short time they might find a fitter occasion to fight
them: It being said that the French Camp would rise, and go meet the Venetians
who came to join with them. But Sedunense, thinking that any delay, how short
soever, would thwart his counsel, (for as the desire of Battle was easily
kindled in them, so might it be easily extinguished) and fearing likewise lest
the Soldiers incited by their factious Commanders, might either listen again
to an accommodation, and refuse to go out of the City, or else might manage the
War otherwise; made it be falsely reported by frequent Messengers, that the
French had gathered up their Baggage, and made ready their Arms and Horses, and
that the first Files were already on their march to go meet the Venetians; and
that they intended when they should be met, to return, and fight the City
jointly. From hence he took occasion to excite them to make haste, and shun all
delay that they might fall upon the Enemy whilst they were raising their Camp,
and were in some disorder, not suspecting to be set upon: That they might make
use of that opportunity which they had so much desired, and which now did offer
it self: Which if they should let slip, or be slow therein, they would
hereafter seek for help from Fortune in vain, when they should through
sluggishness have basely showed that they valued not her favors, nor the hopes
that she had laid before them of Victory. Upon this the Soldiers ran to take
up Arms almost in a tumultuous manner, and many companies went one after
another out of the City; and at last the whole Army moved thereunto out of
shame, and by their Commanders exhortations went out: So as orders being
suddenly given for all things, they prepared for Battle. Then Sedunense, lest
they should be discouraged when they should find the error, riding up and down
amongst them every where, spoke thus unto them.

That News was lately brought that the French did keep still within their
Quarters; that it was to be believed that this was out of fear, they having
heard of the Switzers being marched out, strong and able men, whose violence
they knew they were not able to resist; and therefore desired to defend
themselves by their works: But that if ^he bare News of their coming, and the
formidable name of the Helvetian Nation, had caused such fear in the Enemy, as
it had made them alter their intended March, and forced them to change the
whole course of their War, how would they suffer the presence, or withstand the
violence of so great an array? And certainly, said he, the changing of the
Enemies intentions, ought not to frighten you, nor make you give over what you
have begun to do; nay rather you ought to be the more encouraged, since you
find the contrary in your Enemies. If you marched out of the City with such joy
and such hopes of Victory, how can your generous purpose be retarded, by
knowing that the Enemy, for fear of your approach dare not look out of their
Quarters? Wherefore think you is it that they trust more in their Rampires then
in their Arms? Is it not an apparent sign that they trust little to themselves,
or to their own Valor? If they made any account of themselves, they would have
come out into the field already, to make trial both of their Worth and yours.
But certainly as there is no fence strong enough for fear, so stout and valiant
men, safe enough in their own Worth, place their hopes of welfare no where but
in their own right hands. You are not now to fight with a new, or an unknown
Enemy; who know the nature of the cowardly French, and their unexperience in
matter of Militia, better then you? You have fought so often both for them and
against them, as you may easily conceive the French are no ways to be compared
to you, neither for experience in Military Affairs, nor for fortitude of mind.
These are the very men, who having taken up Arms against Charles Duke of
Burgony, received so great a rout at Nansi, and afterward were overcome by you
in Battle near Novara, to their so great slaughter, as that action added glory
to the Illustrious name of Switzerland. What reason therefore have you to fear
an Enemy, whom you have so often beaten? Their retreat into their Quarters
shows plainly, that they yield the field unto you, and esteem themselves
already overcome; so as if you will be but minded like Conquerours; I already
see all danger secure, and foretell that you may this day get a great and
glorious Victory, with very little labor; that desire of Glory, which seems to
be naturally infused into the Souls of all men, has always so fervently, and
so particularly inflamed those of our Nation, as nothing has ever been so
difficult or dreadful, which when the hope of praise has been at stake, has
not been willingly embraced by you: and you your selves, calling to mind your
Domestique Valor, and spurred on by glory, have now left your houses, and
exposed your selves to so great labor and danger: Therefore if any of you
shall think the business may prove sharp and difficult, let him think what
noble and rich Booty this Victory will bring along with it, when so great an
Army of the French shall be overcome, wherein the Person of the King himself
is. The hope of so great Glory and Triumph, will free your hearts from fear,
and make you despise danger.

Many other Commanders who were of Sedunense's faction, seconded him, praising
his advice, and encouraging the Soldiers to Battle. Wherefore going into every
several company, they conjured them to be mindful of their ancient Worth, and
of the late Victory: They showed them what it became them to do; they amplified
the great rewards, which was to be expected from the victory; they told them
that if they would undertake this business courageously, one only battle would
put an end to their so many labors, and crown all their past victories. The
Soldiers being set on fire by these speeches, did greatly desire combat; and
the sign being given, marched speedily toward the Enemy to assault them in
their Camp. The French when they understood of the Switzers approach, were at
first greatly troubled (as usually falls out when things come unexpected) they
betook themselves hastily unto their Arms, and in some disorder made ready
their Horses and other necessaries for Battle; afterward taking courage, they
went to their colors, took their several places, and drew out into the open
fields. The whole Army was divided into three parts; the first was assigned to
the Duke of Bourbone, with whom were Monsieur di Talamone, Son to Monsieur
della Tremouglie, Giovan Giacopo Taivulcio, Pietro Navaro, Gabeano, and other
Commanders, famous either for glory of War, or for their Birth. All the Dutch,
Gasconne, and French Foot were in this first Squadron; the King himself took
care of that in the middle; about whom were placed the greatest part of the
Chivalry, and a select Band of German Soldiers; in this Squadron were many
chief Personages, the Dukes of Lorrain and Albany, Lewis Lord of Tremuglia,
Francis Bourbone Count of St. Paul, Odetto di Fois, surnamed Monsieur di
Lotrecco, and some others: These were followed by Alanson, Palissa; and Obigni,
who commanded the last Squadron, wherein were the remainder of the Foot. The
Switzers leaving some of their companies in the rear for a reserve, made but
one strong body of their whole Army, wherewith they marched apace in a close
order, toward the French Camp, to the end that by coming up close unto them,
they might keep the Enemy from making use of their Cannon, wherein they knew
they did chiefly confide. Both Armies being come so near as that they might
give Battle, the Dutch Foot, who were placed in the Front of the French Army,
growing jealous, by reason of some News that was given out, that the French and
Switzers were agreed, and that the Switzers out of a certain hatred and
emulation in War, which is between those two Nations, meant to fight only with
them, began at the first Onset to give way, and permitted the Enemy to
advance, and to come to where the Artillery was placed; which Navar being aware
of, he called some of his companies of Foot, and made them immediately advance,
and possess the Station which was appointed for the Dutch, so as the Enemy, who
came in good order upon them, were made stay. In the Interim Monsieur di
Bourbone comes in with his Gasconne and French Soldiers, and renews the fight;
the combat was very hot on all sides; but the French had much ado to withstand
the Switzers violence, who minding only to repulse the Enemy, had not yet
possessed themselves of any one piece of Artillery; the King going then from
the middle Squadron into the formest ranks, brought the Chivalry along with
him, which enlarging themselves, assaulted the Enemies Squadrons on several
sides, they might the better do, for that (as has been said) their Quarters
were very large. Wherefore the Switzers, after having in very close Files, kept
off the Enemies Horse a good while with their Pikes, at last their Ranks being
a little opened, began to separate, yet still fought though upon great
disadvantage, being scattered here and there: Many of them were slain every
where; others being forced from their places, and disordered, directly yielded;
others charging fiercely in among the Enemies, were more sollicitous to kill
others, then to save themselves, every one being his own commander and
encourager. The King not being at all afraid in this so sharp and dangerous
Battle, that he might the more encourage his Soldiers, by sharing in their
danger, made himself be seen amongst the formest, and most forward of them, and
did at the same time both encourage the Soldiers, and fight the Enemy, playing
the part both of a good Commander, and of a good Soldier. And having wearied
several Horses, he himself to all men's wonder, remaining still unwearied, he
showed himself every where, and both by his presence, words, and actions, egged
on the Soldiers against the Enemy, and incited them to fight: The night came
on already (for a good part of the day was over, before the battle began) and
yet the conflict continued. Soldiers fell down dead on all sides, as well
French as Switzers; for they were mingled together in every place in great
confusion: They fought, not distinguishing their Colors, nor hearing their
Captains commands: So as the heat of the Battle was comprehended more by the
clashing of Arms, by dreadful voices, and by the miserable Outcries of dying
men, then by the eye, which was hindered by the obscurity of night. All places
were full of tumult, death, and flight. One of the stoutest Bands of the
Switzers being mixed amongst the French, cried out France, France, to the end
that couzening the Enemy, they might have way made them to get into their
thickest Ranks, and make the greater slaughter. But the French soon after
perceiving their deceit, environed the Switzers round, who being got so far
from their Fellows, as that they could not be relieved, were all put to the
sword: No end was put to the slaughter till the Soldiers of both Armies were
so very weary as they could wield their Weapons no longer. The French and
Switzers rested that night in the same place, so as two Enemy Camps appeared to
be but one Quarter: They kept on their Arms all night: The King showing always
an invincible spirit amidst such confusion and danger, called a Council of War,
to resolve upon what was to be done the next day, and with great generosity
comforted his Commanders, and bad them hope well. The whole Army was divided,
as the day before, into three great Squadrons, but otherwise ordered; for all
the most valiantest Soldiers were picked out, and placed in the Front, to the
end that keeping close together they might stand the first assault of the
Enemy, who being picked just over against them, were ready to give an assault;
they disposed of all the Artillery in the most convenient places, the chief
care whereof was given to the Dutch Foot, who promised to witness their Valor
and Loyalty that day. And these men were ordered, that keeping quiet at first,
they should assist those who were first to enter Battle, if they should see
them give back. The Switzers at the first appearing of the sun, having allowed
almost no time for dressing their wounds, reassumed their Arms, and, as they
had done the day before, marched toward the French Artillery; for they knew
that the greatest hope of Victory on the Switzers side, lay in possessing
themselves thereon, and on the French behalf in defending them; the business
was therefore long and stoutly disputed about them, the Soldiers on both sides
showing great courage. The Dutch, to cancel the fault they had committed the
day before, and to remove the jealousy which was had of their truth, fought so
stoutly, as the Switzers dispairing to win the Artillery, were forced to alter
their way of fight; they divided all their men into two Squadrons, whereof one
stayed over against the first Squadron of the Enemy, the other passing over a
Fen, near which the French Camp lay, assaulted the Rear at unawares. Monsieur
d'Alanson, who had the charge thereof, was gone from thence a little before, to
assist the Dutch Foot, who were sorely put to it by the Enemy; whereby the
French did with greater disadvantage sustain the assault, and being set upon on
the Flank, they were compelled to disorder their Ranks very much by facing
about; and the condition of the place was such, as they could receive no help
from the Horse. The French being by these reasons in great danger and disorder,
Alviano came in in a lucky time, to succor the hindmost Ranks, who had much
ado to withstand the Enemy. The Venetian Army had stayed at Lodi; for first
they could not march safely, the Enemy being so very near, and next the King,
thinking that he had accommodated affairs with the Switzers, and that therefore
he should not need their assistance, had agreed with the Venetian Commanders,
that they should keep their Army at Lodi, and expect the final end of the
business; for the Armies had this advantage by their being severed, that they
might be the easilier victuall'd, and might pass to wheresoever it was most
behoveful for the War. But the King, upon occasion of this Battle, had
dispatched Messengers speedily away to Alviano, to acquaint him with the
condition of affairs, and that they required speedy help, wherefore he desired
him to make all the haste he could to the French Camp. Which when Alviano
understood, he immediately sent for 200 of his best Curassiers, such as were
known to be of great birth, and worth, and went his way with these immediately:
Leaving order for the rest of the Army to follow after, and made what haste he
could to the French Camp. Alviano knew he could do nothing which would be more
acceptable to the Venetians, nor whereby he himself might purchase more honor,
then by helping a puissant King, and Friend to the Commonwealth in time of so
great need. Therefore finding at his first coming that the Battle was already
begun; ^aving briefly said such things to his men as the time would allow of,
persuading them to show their courage and generosity, and to hasten the getting
assured glory; he at his very first arrival assaulted the Switzers on the back,
and falling furiously upon the Enemy where they were thickest, he broke, and
dissipated their orders; then they who were first intent only upon one Battle,
must now turn both their thoughts, and hand against the Venetians, and leave
the French; and not knowing what to do either by way of offense, or defense, by
reason of this unexpected accident, they began to slacken that courage
wherewith they fought at first. On the contrary, the French encouraged with
greater hopes of Victory, gave more furiously upon the Enemy, the effects
whereof were the greater, for that both sides believed the whole Venetian Army
was come. The Switzers, finding themselves fought withal on all sides, began by
little and little to draw out the Battle, and to wheel about, endeavoring to
join with all those who fought the Enemy on the Front. And thus having made one
strong body of all their Forces, they all of them retreated in miraculous good
order, and safety into Millan: and the French, being wearied with long
fighting, (for they had fought from the Sunrising till after twelve a clock)
suffered the Switzers to retreat safely, without pursuing them. But Alviano's
Curassiers following some of the Enemy who retreated later then the rest, drove
them into a Village not far off, where by Alviano's command they were all
destroyed by fire and sword. This Battle which happened on the 17th of September,
was very great and bloody, and for a while uncertain; for it was valiantly
fought on all sides, and lasted so long, as many were slain on both sides, and
the field was every way covered with dead bodies. There is not any one who
mentions the number of the dead positively, yet all agree in this, that the
loss was much greater on the Switzers side: But many illustrious men were
missing of the French, as Francis Lord of Tremuglia, Imbercatio, Sanserio,
Monsieur Ambaysa, the Count de Guise; and to boot with these, a son of Count
Pisiglian, a youth of excellent Parts, who fought under the Venetians.
Therefore though the French got the Victory, yet was it very sad and bloody to
them, and a long time uncertain. The French accounted themselves victorious,
because they were not driven from their Quarters, which was the Enemies design
to have done, and because they had forced the Enemy to retreat to within the
Walls of Millan. But on the other side, since the Switzers had retreated in
good order, and gotten in such numbers into the chiefest City of that State, as
that they were able to defend it, it cannot be said that this was a real
Victory, the War not being thereby ended, nor the Enemy routed. And certainly,
as by the Switzers admirable Valor the French bought all dearly which they got
by fighting, so by their natural fickleness the French got greater advantage by
this Victory; for the very next day to the day of Battle, the Switzers giving
over the thought of defending Millan, leaving only a Foot Garrison in the
Castle whither Maximillian Sforza was forced to retire, returned to their own
homes: and Cardinal Sedunense, knowing that by the bad s^ccess of his counsels
he had lost his former authority with the Soldiery, so as all that he could
say was not able to make them stay one minute longer, le^t Millan likewise, and
went by the way of Trent to find out the Emperor. This may teach Princes upon
how weak foundations the sa^ety of that State is grounded, which wanting a
Militia of its own, is forced to have recourse to mercenary Foreigners. After
this Victory the French were every where Masters of the field, and easily
reduced all the Towns in the Dukedom of Millan into their power. The Viceroy,
who had not stirred all this while from about Placenza, dispairing to defend
the State of Millan any longer, and suspecting also that the Pope had quitted
the League, went into Romagnia, and by little and little brought all his Army
from thence to the Kingdom of Naples. And at the same time the Popes men went
to Reggio in Lombardy; so as Sforza's State being bereft of all hope of help,
or of returning to its pristine condition, Millan, and all the other Cities,
yielded of themselves to the French, and sent Ambassadors to the King to beg
pardon for all that was past, and to promise obedience for the time to come;
the Ambassadors were received, and a great sum of money was imposed upon the
Millaneses, to be paid according to every man's abilities. But the King would
not as yet enter into Millan; for Sforza keeping the Castle still, he thought
it stood not with his honor to enter armed into that City, which he had not
totally reduced under his Dominion. But for the present the Duke of Burbone
entered the City, who received it in the Kings name, and committed the reducing
of the Castle to Pietro Navaro's charge, who having played upon it a good while
with his great Guns, began according to his custom to fall a mining. He was
excellent good hereat, and by applying fire to the Gunpowder, wherewith he
filled his works under ground, he was wont to blow up Walls and Towers which
were otherwise impregnable. Wherefore Sforza being much terrified, and being a
little besides himself by reason of a long sickness contracted by so many
adversities; being also advised by such as were none of his best friends, he
resolved a month after the Siege began, to receive Antonio Bratano, a Doctor
of Law, into the Castle to treat of surrender, and concluded at last that he
would put both the Castle and himself into the hands of the French, though it
were so well victuall'd and manned, as it might have held out a long while. He
was upon these conditions received by the French.

That he should be forthwith carried into France, from whence he was never to
depart; that he should for ever quit all claim and right which he had to the
State of Millan, to King Francis; being to receive such a revenue from him, as
whereby he might live commodiously and with honor.

The King having by agreement received the Castle, he entered Millan in great
Military Pomp, and almost in manner of Triumph, environed by the choicest and
richliest arrayed of all his Chivalry. He here received an honorable Embassy
sent unto him from the Venetians to congratulate his Victory. These were four
of the principal Senators of Venice, grave and reverend for their age, and
famous for the supreamest Honors of the Commonwealth. Georgio Cornar^, Andrea
Gritti, Antonio Grimani, and Dominico Trevisano, Procurators of St. Mark, the
chiefest Honor in that Commonwealth next to the Duke. It fell to Trevisano's
part, as being youngest, to make the Oration, which is said to have been thus
delivered.

As soon as the so greatly desired News (most Christian King) that your Majesty
had taken your journey toward Italy, came to Venice, all our Souls were
overwhelmed with joy, as if even then the Victory had been certain; for we very
well knew that there was no force which could withstand your singular Worth,
and your invincible Army; wherefore our Commonwealth, judging that they had
great occasion of joy offered them, at this your coming, that they might not
let slip any thing whereby they might manifest their affection and observancy,
had chosen us her Ambassadors to wait upon your Majesty, and congratulate your
having brought your Army safe into Italy, and returned your Affairs to that
ancient Honor, to which questionless prosperous success in War would soon
bring them. The Senate did afterward desire that all the Forces of their
Commonwealth might be offered you by us, as has been formerly done by other
Ambassadors; that your Majesty might please to make use of them upon
whatsoever occasion, either for your own greatness, or for the convenience of
your Army. We could not execute this our Commission which was long ago given
us, before now, because the ways were every where blocked up by the Enemy; but
it has happened by divine providence, that we, who were sent to congratulate the
hop^s of your beginning to be victorious, may now give you joy of your already
won victory; for out-doing the thoughts of all men, you have achieved those
very great things, which we, out of a singular affection and desire of your
prosperity, were in our thoughts designing: Since having by a miraculous
confidence in your self, and constancy of mind, made your way through craggy
Cliffs, and almost inaccessible Mountains, you have mastered all difficulties,
past over the Alps even there where they were thought to be impassable; and
have conducted your Army in four days space entire and safe into Italy. Having
thus overcome the asperous Mountains, you have instructed us, that nothing is
so difficult through which the valiant man cannot make his way; and that a
magnanimous Prince ought to esteem nothing too hard for him to overcome; but
you have chiefly shown your Worth to be such, and so excellent, as you can rule
even nature, which rules and governs all things. That which amongst other of
that cried up Commanders Actions, Hannibal, is numbered as a thing of singular
praise, to wit, that he durst venture to pass over the top of the Alps with
his Army, and that in 15 days space he conducted it safe over; your Majesty by
a more singular virtue, and in a more excellent manner have outdone, by having
brought over your Army* Artillery, and all your warlike Preparations in a much
shorter time into the Confines of the Enemy, by rougher, and by straiter ways.
But whilst men stand admiring this egregious action, and highly celebrate your
name, you have by a much more glorious Enterprise, and that which none other
durst to have done, outdone your self, out-shined your Glory, and have left to
posterity greater and better memory of the French Gallantry; for though your
Army was wearied with their long and toilsom march, yet you stuck not to join
Battle presently with most bitter Enemies, wherein your Valor was such, as you
have showed that those may be beaten, who were before thought unconquerable.
You have routed and put to flight the Switzers, who formerly dispising all
other Nations, did proudly usurp unto themselves chiefest praise for what
concerns the Militia; and have forced them to return home, whence they are not
likely to come so soon again to disturb your Affairs. And that nothing might
be left desirable to your praise, Fortune, which for the most part uses to
have the greatest share in Battles, dare lay claim to nothing in this your
happy success; for no cunning, no stratagem, nothing but mere Worth had any
share in this Victory. It Is merely this Worth then, which whilst all things
else were equal in Battle, has made you Victor, causing fear, flight, and
slaughter to your Enemies, and freeing your own Army from the like, which has
not only fought under your happy conduct, but whilst you your self acted both
the Captains and Soldiers part: So as it is not the splendour of your Dignity,
but your own peculiar Worth, which has preserved you amidst the fury of
Weapons, and has freed you more then once from danger. Your Majesty may
therefore promise unto your self all things prosperous, and favorable
hereafter. Those things which are propounded as a reward to Conquerours, Glory,
Wealth, and Empire are already yours; you have already recovered the State of
Millan, and your Enemies the Spaniards, who being grown more insolent through
the courage and labor of other men, attempted greater things, abandoning the
Enterprise, and retreating to within their own Confines, do hardly believe they
can defend them against your victorious Arms; but we your true friends,
well-wishers to your Honor and Greatness, being consolated and rejoiced by
this your prosperity, have raised our Souls to greater hopes: and as we were
ready to partake with you in any whatsoever fortune of War, so you having by
Gods good will, by your own Worth, and we may say partly by our assistance,
gotten so great a Victory, we also promise prosperous success to our own
Affairs: Which as we know it is much desired by you, so we hope that you will
be assistant to our fortune, with all your forces, since thereby your power and
glory will be greatly confirmed and increased; for to have aided such a
Commonwealth, after her being oppressed by many evils, so as she be returned to
her ancient state and dignity, will be numbered amongst your prime praises; and
as you have always found us to be your faithful Servants, so remaining still
such, but more powerful, your Affairs in Italy may peradventure receive greater
security. Many therefore are the reasons of our joy, that a King who is our
friend has purchased so much glory, as will be envied by memory in all ages,
but peradventure paralelled by none; that we have hopes given ^s of recovering
our own State, and that Italy is freed from the fear she was in of the Dutch
and Spaniards, who sought to inthral her Liberty. Certainly since your coming
into Italy has been long desired by us, and assisted by all our endeavors, as
you your self know, it cannot be doubted (...) our joy is great, in seeing all
your designs prosper so successively; for we do very much rejoice that we have
had fortune to be aiding to so great a King, and do think our selves already
sure of those rewards, which we assured our selves would be very great, when we
resolved to adhere unto you even in your dubious condition. Then as our
Commonwealth thinks that she has got what soever your Majesty has won by so
great a Victory, and is therefore greatly consolated thereat; so we desire and
hope that your Majesty will have the same respect to her, and her Affairs;
being confident that our State Forces, and fortune, what soever it shall at any
time happen to be, shall always be ready to wait upon, and to attend your
convenience and greatness.

To this the Lord Chancellor in the Kings name made a very civil and
honorable reply; the Ambassadors had private audience the next day of the
King, who in a long speech endeavored to show his good will toward the
Commonwealth.

Saying, That he took their Embassy in very good part, and that the affection
of the Commonwealth of Venice toward the Crown of France had been long since
witnessed by several Testimonies, but that it was more clear by their recent
deserts. That he had always much valued her Friendship, and was naturally given
to embrace it; that it was very fitting that they who had had their share of
the labor and danger of the War, should partake of the fruit of Victory; that
therefore being mindful both of their ancient amity, and of their last service
done him, he would not fail their expectation in the recovery of their State;
that he had already destiny'd that many of his men should fight under their
Banners, and that he would send them greater helps as soon as his Affairs
should be brought to a peaceable and safe condition: In fine, that he would
readily do any thing which might increase the Dignity and Power of the
Commonwealth.

The Ambassadors, though they had ended their Embassy, received orders from
the Senate to keep with the King, and in greater testimony of the honor and
observancy which they bore him, to wait upon him whithersoever he should go,
whilst he was in Italy. At this time whilst the Castles of Millan and Cremona
were besieged, Alviano marched with the Venetian Army toward Brescia, to
attempt the taking of that City. He desired very much to follow the Spanish
Army, after the success of the Battle, that he might revenge both their former
and late injuries, and utterly destroy that bitter Enemy. But the Viceroy was
so speedy in removing his Camp, as Alviano lost all hopes of encountering with
him. Moreover, this his desire of following the Enemy was sufficiently cooled
by Letters which he received from the Senate, wherein they signified their will
and pleasure to be, then setting all other things whatsoever aside, he should
endeavor the recovery of the Cities they had lost, and mind only that: That
he should make use of the Victory, and his late won reputation, in things of
greater importance; and that he should chiefly employ all his labor and study,
where greatest good, and most hopes of ending the War were promised. Wherefore
Alviano passing over the Ada, went with his whole Army to the taking in of
Brescia; Bergamo having been soon surrendered to him after the Switzers defeat.
The Commanders in the Venetian Camp differed in their opinions concerning this:
Some affirming,

That they were first to endeavor the taking of Verona, which City was, the
Seat of the War, and which had always been a safe receptacle of the Enemy; so
as there was no hopes of ending the War, till they were driven out of that
nest: That that City had still been the chiefest cause of contest, and had
often been the only cause of hindering Agreement; that others difficulties would
soon be ended, if this City were returned into the power of the Venetians:
Therefore if they could get Verona, all the Castles and Territories which were
possessed by the Enemy, might easily be reduced under the power* of the
Venetians, either by force, or by agreement that the like advantage could not
be had by the taking of Brescia, the possession whereof would always be
uncertain and unsafe, whilst the Enemy was powerful in Veron^. They added that
by the business of Brescia little more of consideration then the Town it self
would be gotten, of much consideration either for War or Peace; that also great
respect was to be had for the accommodation of the Army; that questionless if
they should sit down before the Walls of Verona, they might be better furnished
both with Victuals and with all things else by the convenience of the River
Adice, whereby they might tarry longer, and more commodiously in that Country,
and make use either of Siege, or assault as time and occasion should require.

The Senate being moved by these reasons were at first of this opinion, but not
being so long, and taking the business again into consideration* to the end
that they might not spend time to no purpose in the diversity of opinions, and
that if the condition of Affairs should alter upon any accident, (as it often
happens) they should not be forced to do what were not fitting, they resolved
to leave the resolution to Alviano, after they had acquainted him with their
opinion therein. Thus the Venetian Camp, not staying for any help from the
French, came before the Walls of Brescia, and Siege was laid to the City, and
great diligence was made to storm it; Alviano thought he might easilier and
more honorably do this, then take Verona, because the one City being near
friends, and the other near the Enemy, if he should carry his Army before
Brescia.

He thought the business might prove the easier by reason of the vicinity of
the French, and that it might be done with more reputation, and readier help;
whereas on the contrary, if the Army should be employed in battering Verona, he
feared le^t the Spaniards and the Popes men, not being far off, might, though
they were gone out of the Country, return thither, and hope to set upon our men
whilst they were in disorder; and making of Trenches, or other works. Whereby
he knew he could not tarry in those parts without much danger; nor depart from
thence, and give over the Enterprise without as much shame, and loss of honor.
Moreover Verona was better walled and was excellently well provided of
Victuals, and men, by the Garrison of Dutch Foot which was lately come thither.
Whereas there were but few Soldiers in Brescia, and little provision of things
necessary for defense* the Citizens very well affectioned toward the
Commonwealth, and the Enemy driven out.

But Icardo a Spanish Captain, a shrewd, and nimbly witted man, who had then
the command of of Brescia, having heard, and suspected this resolution of the
Venetians, had with great speed caused 1000 Foot to come from Verona to that
City, had brought in much corn, and all things requisite for defense, so as it
was sufficiently munited against an Assault. And he had used such speed, and
industry in all this, as that the Soldiers of the Garrison of Verona might
safely enter into Brescia, and not only not be hindered by Alviano, but do it
before he should know of it till after it was done. Alviano's advice was to
assault the City on several parts, at one and the same time, and to storm it;
but whilst he was contriving these things, and that his thoughts were much
troubled, fearing le^t the number of the Defendants being increased by the new
Garrison, the business might prove more difficult then he had thought at first,
and having at the same time undergone much bodily labor, he fell sick, and his
sickness increasing daily upon him, he was carried from the Camp to a Town
called Ghedi, where being seized on by a violent burning Fever, he dyed on the
seventh of O^tober in the threescore year of his age. He dyed just when Fortune
began to smile upon him, he having in his former days endured many adversities;
for he had won great reputation by his prosperous successes the year before in
Friuli, and Polisine di Rovigo, and likewise by the confession of all men, he
showed singular Valor in the last Battle of the French near Millan.

Alviano was acknowledged generally by all men for an excellent Commander, of
great courage and experience in Military Affairs; and he proved the more
famous, because he flourished in a time, wherein he had field room enough to
show his Worth and Military Skill in managing important Wars. But he suffered a
little, by being thought more bold in fighting, then good at the counselling;
for he was so desirous of Military Glory, as he was often too hasty in coveting
Victory. Yet it may be numbered up amongst his praises, that in point of
execution he used miraculous, and at that time unusual speed: He was very much
beloved and yet very much feared by the Soldiery. His great Liberality
purchased their love, and his severity in making Military Discipline be
observed their fear. He was more patient in taking pains then is to be
believed, wherein he would equal any whatsoever private Soldier; wherefore he
was wont to say, that the Commander was not so sensible of labor as was the
Soldier, the hopes of Glory, which sweetens labor not being equal in them. He
served under the Venetian pay almost 20 years, always with great fidelity, but
most commonly with ill luck; for having fought successively in the German Wars,
near Cadore, he was soon after abandoned by Fortune, and these good beginnings
were not followed by like success. It Is true that he himself by the fierceness
of his nature did often times increase dangers and difficulties; for even then
Alviano was thought to be born for greatest Attempts, though through greatest
dangers, and to be one who might with praise serve any Prince in War, who was
desirous of Glory, and willing to hazard himself upon Fortune, upon easy
terms. But this his forwardness did not suit well with the Commonwealth, which
being always the same, keeping still the same orders, though she change
Officers, cares not for undertaking things though never so glorious, if
dangerous: But that she may deal in them with more security, waits for time and
occasion, and walks on to her greatness with more mature advice.

Alviano's body was carried to Venice, where his Obsequies were very solemnly
celebrated, his Funeral Oration being made by Andrea Navagiero, a man of
excellent wit, famous for learning and eloquence; and for the greater honor of
his memory he was buried in San Stefano's Church at the public charge. And
because he left his wife and children very poor, he having continually loved
Glory and the good will of his Soldiers more then riches, the Senate, the more
to gratify his Worth and Loyalty, rewarded him in his posterity, they gave his
wife and his only Son, to be paid them during their lives out of the public
Exchequer, 60 Ducats a month, and gave them a commodious house in the City,
exempting them from all taxes belonging to their livelihood; they gave also
3000 Ducats a piece to his three daughters, to be paid them out of the
public Treasury at their day of Marriage.

After Alviano's death, Commissary Emo took the care of the War, and for some
days commanded the Army as Captain General. The mean while the Venetians
thought upon Giovan Giacopo Trivulcio, to confer the Generals place upon him,
for his singular vivacity of wit, for his exquisite knowledge in all Military
Affairs, and especially for his ready, and well disposed inclination toward
the Commonwealth. Wherefore the Venetians very much desired King Francis that
he would permit them to make Trivulcio, who (as has been said) was at this
time in pay under the French, to be their General; which having obtained, they
forthwith conferred Alviano's place upon him, and the Senate writ Letters unto
him.

Wherein they signified the great love which the whole Commonwealth bore him,
and the assured hopes they had in his singular Worth, and that confiding
therein, and hoping to meet with the like willingness and desire in him to
serve the Commonwealth, they had freely of themselves offered him that degree
of Dignity, which they had not wont to grant others, but upon much entreaty and
intercession; wherefore they desired him that he would behave himself so in
that Service, as became him, who was an able and famous Commander, greatly
desirous of the Liberty of Italy, and affectionate to the Venetian Honor; that
he would show himself to be still the same man in this great and honorable
employment, as he always had been.

Trivulcio having received these Letters, willingly accepted of the employment
offered him, and went suddenly to the Venetian Camp, where being received by
Commissary Emo, he began to govern discreetly and diligently.

The first thing he did, was to call the Council together, and to be truly
informed of the Enemies strength, as also of ours, what had been done, and what
was to be done, and finally to inform himself of the whole State of Affairs. He
afterward began to consult with the rest of the Commanders how the War was to
be carried on, wherein there were diverse opinions according to every man's
judgment.

Some dispairing to get Brescia, were for raising the Siege, and carrying the
Army into the Territories of Verona, that they might be ready upon any occasion
that should be offered to take Verona: Others affirmed that the begun
Enterprise was not to be given over, that the business would not prove so
difficult if it were governed by the ordinary ways of War; that they themselves
being wearied with the trouble of a longer Siege, would not quit the hopes of
Victory.

But there were many things which made against these advices. Those that
persuaded to be gone, might receive for answer, that by raising the Siege from
before Brescia, the opinion which was had of their Forces would be lessned, and
it would seem a vain and foolish thing to undertake greater and more difficult
matters: And those that were for keeping the same Quarters, that Winter being
near, the very season would not permit them to be long about the business, they
therefore all agreed in this, which was first Alviano's opinion, to wit, that
environing the Town on that part where the Walls were weakest, and setting
their Artillery in order, they should play uncessantly with their Cannon upon
one and the same place, till so much of the Wall might be thrown down, as might
make way for an assault. Bringing then their Artillery into a certain place,
where a little Rivolet called la Garzetae enters into the City, they began to
play violently upon the Walls; so as having thrown down the uppermost part, the
rest might be easily mastered by the Soldiers. And now this first action
taking effect, the Venetians began to hope well in the victory, but the City
was stoutly defended by the Spanish, and Dutch Soldiers, who were very ready
upon any action; they kept diligent Guard every where, they raised their
Rampires, and did munite the Walls with their own bodies; nor did they leave
any thing undone which appertained to defense. Therefore our men growing daily
cooler in point of assault, and all resolution being drawn out at length, the
Enemy growing bolder by our delay, accused our men of cowardliness, and not
content to keep them aloof from the Wall, did often times in damage them by
Sallies. And growing more confident by some small successes, about 2000 of them
sallied one day out of the City, intending to drive away some of the Venetians
that were gotten nearest the Walls; and bending their chiefest force against
those that guarded the Artillery, they slew many of them, and chasing away the
rest, forced them to retreat and to forsake that Station, pursuing them even
unto their Quarters. So as our men would have been notably prejudiced that day,
had not Trivulcio speedily sent them a recrute both of Horse and Foot, by which
relief they being stayed, who ran away, they began to fight in their own
defense, and being encouraged did not only sustain the Enemy, but after many
Skirmishes, drove them to within their Walls, and recovering many pieces of
Artillery brought them to the Camp; the rest were either broken by the Enemy,
or carried into the City. Amongst the rest Iovan Paolo Manfrone wan great
praise in this action, but Trivulcio did not only despair by this to take the
City by force, but growing somewhat afraid, by seeing the Enemy encouraged, and
his own men abased, that somewhat of worse might befall him, thought it his
best course to remove the Camp to a place two miles from the City, called La
seconda Pietro: To the end that the Army might have means to refresh
themselves, and to expect aid from the French, whereby he might afterward with
greater force, and better advice return, and reassume the business. In the
interim, that the Soldiers might not grow lazy through idleness, and to keep
up the Venetian honor, which being begun to get head again, might seem by so
small an adversity to decline; the Commanders resolved to send some of their
men to Peschiera, and re-gain that Town to the Commonwealth, which was very
useful to the War. Wherein they had such happy success, as they took it the
very first day by assault; and soon after, encountering with a Squadron of
Curassiers, and some Foot Colors, who were sent to relieve Peschiera, they put
them to flight, slew many of them, and took many Prisoners. Hereupon Asoli,
Lonato, Sermione, and some other Towns thereabouts soon surrendered; so as the
affection to the name of Venice which seemed to be fallen asleep, began to be
awakened in the peoples minds. It was now November, wherefore the Venetians,
partly by reason of the time of the year, partly by reason of the difficulty of
the business, resolved for that time to give over the Siege of Brescia; when
News came to the Camp, that many Horse and Foot would soon come in to their
succor. The King of France had thought to have sent these recrutes much sooner
to the Venetians, but they being to have been commanded by the Gran Bastardo di
Savoia, a Kinsman of the Kings, and a man of great Worth and Authority, who had
likewise given him in charge, first to take in the Castle of Cremona; he spent
more time therein then he thought to have done* which had caused him to defer
his coming thus long. He brought along with him 5000 Foot, 800 Horse, many
pieces of Artillery, and great store of victuals; wherefore as soon as he was
come to the Venetian Camp, they altered their opinion, and were all of one
mind, to re-attempt the taking of Brescia immediately with the whole Army;
thinking that the bitterness of the season might be overcome by the number, and
assiduity of the Soldiers. But the business, though first attempted with great
hopes of victory, rather by the falseness and foolish obstinacy of friends,
then by any Worth in the Enemy; for the Dutch Foot commanded by the Gran
Bastardo -- soon began rather to be a trouble, then a help* They often times
raised tumults in the Camp, they refused sometimes to fight against Caesar,
sometime cried insolently for pay, before they had deserved it, and despising
their Captains commands, ran into the neighboring parts, ransacking all
things, and plundering as well their Friends as Foes. Another great
inconvenience was added unto this, able to disturb any design how good soever;
for the Gran Bastardo -- falling very sick, was forced to depart the Camp. The
Venetian Ambassadors who were with the King of France being advertised of
this, did by commission from the Senate, again very much desire the King to
send more aid; they desired other Soldiers, other Commanders, but chiefly
Pietro Navaro, who was at this time in great repute; for being very expert at
the taking in of places, and wont to get the victory by a new way of Militia:
He used such art and industry in working Mines, and in using several unusual
Engines, as made all men wonder. This man being sent by the King with succor
to the Venetian Army, the Siege was again begun to be laid to Brescia;
Trivulcio was encamped on one side with about 900 Venetian Foot, and 2000
Horse; on the other side, which lies over against the Gate usually called delle
Pille, and of which ill Bastardo -- had had formerly the care, Navaro placed
himself, with 5000 Gasconne and French Foot which he had brought with him; so
they began to play upon the Town in several parts at once, and the City being
besieged on all sides by continual Guards, nothing was free nor safe to them
that were within; they were forced to keep Sentinels in all places, to be in
perpetual work every where; and herein lay the Venetians chiefest hopes, that
the Defendants tired out with continual action, and consequently growing weak,
would be forced to give over much of their defense; for the Spanish Soldiers,
having had leisure time enough to fortify the City, had been so diligent in
raising Cavaliers, in making Trenches, places of Retreat, and in well defending
the Walls, as not any one part lay open, or naked to the assaliants; and if any
part of the Wall chanced to be thrown down by the Cannon, a new Rampire was
raised for defense in the place thereof. So as the Soldiers might use their
Artillery under shelter, and all other sort of Arms. But the business drawing
on in length, and the Venetians knowing that their labor was but in vain, and
that the City could not be taken by assault, Navar betakes himself to his other
accustomed Stratagems, which he had not yet made use of here, because it
required much labor and pain* and because he feared lest all his labor and
design might meet with disturbance, by the condition of the season, and by the
great store of rain that was fallen. He began to make a passage under the
earth, which led from the Camp to the City, through which the Soldiers were to
march, and on the sudden fall upon the City within. This work being diligently,
and with much labor wrought upon by the Soldiers both day and night, so as it
was now brought almost to an end; the Spaniards, moved thereunto by some sign,
or were it only out of suspicion, because they saw our men had given over their
Battery, and that Proceedings went slower on in the Camp, betook themselves to
observe diligently in every part of the City, whether or no they could find or
hear any motion of the earth, they dug Ditches in many places, and searched
diligently into Navar's hidden ways, of which as soon as they discovered any
the lest show, to the end that they might be the more certain of it, and apply
remedy, they began to make countermines all in contra, and throwing great store
of Gun powder thereinto, they gave fire unto it, and overthrew our work,
slaying all the Soldiers that wrought upon it: Thus many days labor was lost
in a moment; yet the Venetians had one hope left whereby to get the City; the
rest proving vain through various accidents; to wit, to straiten it by Siege;
for they knew it wanted many things, which would force it to surrender. Corn
was grown to such a scarcity, as the Dutch Soldiers not able to endure it, not
having received neither any pay of along time from the Emperor, refused to do
duties, grew insolent with their Commanders, put all things into confusion, and
began to rebel. Which when the Venetian Camp knew, Trivulcio thought he had a
fair occasion offered him of taking the City, without the loss his of men;
wherefore neither the inconvenience of Winter, nor the Snow, nor the trouble of
a long Siege, were able to make him alter his resolution. He knew it made much
for his Renown, and for the proving of his affection to the Commonwealth, that
he should prosper in his first attempts. He therefore kept the City environed
on all sides with his Army, to keep any victuals from being brought into it,
and to keep the Soldiers that were within from coming out, intending likewise
to seize on such moneys as might perchance be sent them; and in the interim
there past light Skirmishes between them and the Enemy; for many Foot came from
the Garrison of Verona, striving to get into the Brescian Territories, and to
prejudice our Army. But to hinder these the Soldiers of the Commonwealth came
from out Pesc^iera and Valeggio, and meeting with some of them, they often fell
to blows with various success of both sides; nothing happening notwithstanding
worthy of memory, nor which did much concern the main business.

Whilst Brescia was thus besieged, many things had past concerning peace: The
Pope, seeing that his attempts by Force and Arms succeeded not according to his
thoughts, betook himself to his wonted artifices the better to secure himself
thereby. He therefore resolved to be a Mediator of peace between the Emperor
and the Venetians: Which if it should succeed, he thought he might treat of
peace with the French upon better terms. But the Venetians weary of such
Proceedings, and being often deluded by vain hopes, could not believe much in
the Popes words. Wherefore thinking that the safety of their State and of their
Affairs could be grounded no where better then on the friendship of the French,
which they desired might be made as much known to them as might be, they
refused all offers of agreement, and thought it better to acquaint the French
Ambassador with all things that were propounded to them by the Pope concerning
peace: And to do the like with the King by their Ambassadors that were with
him; who told him in the name of the Commonwealth, that the Senate in their
present troubles of War, placed their hopes in nothing but on their own Forces,
and on the King of France his help and favor. The King was of the same mind,
to keep friendship with the Venetians, and to pursue the War. Wherefore Caesar
who was much troubled at these prosperous successes, having by his Ambassadors
endeavored to come to some agreement, the King utterly despising the
Friendship and League which was offered him, dismissed the Ambassadors, and
acquainted the Venetians particularly with the whole Treaty. The French knew
very well by many examples, that Cesars mind was so mutable, and so desirous of
Novelties, as their affairs could never be reputed safe nor quiet, whilst he
had any Footing, or his men any receipt in Italy: So as they must be forced to
be at great cost, and not out of danger in maintaining the State of Millan,
till Caesar and his Armies were driven from thence; but the King thought
otherwise of the Pope; for though he had alienated himself from him, when he
thought him to be most his friend, yet he greatly desired the Popes Friendship;
nor was he parted from him, but upon great necessity. Wherefore the Pope,
having sent his Nuntio into the French Camp, without knowledge of other
confederates, to treat of agreement, the King received him graciously, seeming
very well pleased that there was means left him whereby to be easily received
again into favor, and friendship with the Pope; yet being resolved not to buy
it at any dear rate, since it was voluntarily offered him, the Nuncio could get
no positive answer, unless the Cities of Parma and Piacenza, which were then
detained by the Pope, should be restored to the power and possession of the
French. The Pope though he thought it very severe for him to be bere^t of those
two Cities, and to lose that reward which he had purchased by so many dangers
and labors, yet after having spent many days and nights in great agitation of
mind, he at last resolved to satisfy the King, and to resign up those Cities.
Finding that all his labor was lost in going about to bring the Venetians to
agreement with him and Caesar. Nor could he defer it any longer without hazard,
not thinking either his own Forces, or those of his colleagues sufficient to
secure him and his affairs from the power of the Conquerours. These chief
points being therefore accommodated, to the end that they might treat the
better of the rest, and that the League might be the more firmly made, it was
resolved that the Pope and King should have an Interview, for which a certain
time being appointed, the one parted from Rome, and the other from Millan, and
met both at Bolognia, as the most convenient place for them both. The Venetian
Ambassadors accompanied the King* the more to honor the Royal Court in a time
of such solemnity; the Court being then full of many French Lords, and very
glorious in all manner of Preparations; as also for that it was reported, that
many things belonging to the Commonwealth were to be treated of at that
convention, and touching universal agreement; which caused much rejoicing in
all Italy, which had been so long molested, but especially amongst the
Venetians, all of them hoping well in a future peace, Yet for what concerned
the Commonwealth, because diverse difficulties lay in it, it was only resolved,
that Cardinal Egidio Eremitano, a Personage of singular Integrity and Learning,
should be sent Legate to the Emperor from the Pope, to treat of this business,
and to endeavor to make him comply, and agree with the Venetians. Pontifical
Briefs were likewise sent to the Venetians, wherein they were exhorted to
embrace peace; but as concerning the common condition of affairs, and the
ordering of a general peace, nothing was either concluded, nor so much as
treated of, but rather many seeds were sown of other Wars; for on the one side
King Francis, not being able any longer to cloak his desire of winning the
Kingdom of Naples, which he had long thirsted after, had by his civility and
complacency with the Pope, got leave of him, that by the Popes favor and
authority, he might, when time should serve, fall upon that Enterprise; on the
other part, Leo discovered a no less ardent desire in himself of the greatness
of the House of Medici, by denying the King, who had very much desired it at
his hands, to pardon Francisco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbin, if he had
found any fault in him. Whence it might be easily comprehended how he was
minded (when there should be occasion again of taking up of Arms, and of
exposing himself again to the danger and troubles of War) to put his Nephew
Lorenzo (...) Medici into possession of the State of Urbin, wherein he had a
little before invested him. Thus the Sequel did show manifestly, that both Leo
and Francis, aimed only in this their convention, at their own advantage, and
their present accommodation; and that they did not almost at all think upon the
common agreement, and peace for the future; for having established diverse
things touching their own security, and the aggrandizing of their States, they
both departed from Bolognia, after having spent six days in this Treaty. It Is
most certain that both these Princes did very much desire this Inter-view, out
of a thought of reaping much advantage thereby; for the Pope, being strangely
ingenious, and knowing how to handle business best for his advantage, thought
he should be able by his persuasive speeches, and elegancy of words, to pacify
the King, and make him become his friend, if he should find him otherwise; and
if he should find in him a well disposed will, to be then able to increase it,
and to dispose of the Kings Forces at his pleasure. But King Francis, seeing
his ancient Enemies re-kindle their hatred, and his Friends behave themselves
as Enemies, and that they all conspired together against him (as it is always
seen that prosperity produces envy) thought nothing could make more for his
good at the present, then to take the Pope from his Enemies, and join his
Holiness to him. Caesar and the Switzers were already joined together, and it
was commonly said that the King of Spain and King of England were likewise
joined with them; the latter because he could not willingly endure to see the
King of France his power and glory increase so much; and the other, because it
was held for certain, that when the French should be at peace with the rest, he
would soon make War with him, either to put the King of Navar into his State,
or else to recover the Kingdom of Naples. Wherefore King Francis, finding such
dangers threatened him by so many Enemies, thought he had provided the better
for his affairs, by how much he should join in a straiter League and Friendship
with the Pope. Those things being then thus disposed of, which concerned the
annexing the Forces and Authority of the Church unto him, he began to think of
his return into France to comply with his wives entreaties; but much more to
secure his Kingdom from the imminent danger of War, by the men that he brought
back with him; and he stayed now only that he might first somewhat establish
the Venetians affairs, and so increase the Forces of the League, as though he
were not himself in person in Italy, he might have no reason to fear the Enemy
for what concerned the State of Millan. Therefore as soon as he was gone from
Bolognia, and arrived at Millan, he chiefly minded the sending of more Forces
time enough to the Venetian Camp before Brescia. Which was already reduced
thereby to so great straits, as it was thought it would soon fall into the
Commonwealths hands. It was known that the Soldiers who defended it, and who
had already showed great Valor, in resisting many assaults; being weary
through so many inconveniences of the Siege, and chiefly not having received
pay nor relief; nor Caesar not having taken any provision for it, were brought
almost to the very last point of despair; in so much as the Spanish Soldiers
had agreed, that if the promised relief should not come from Caesar within
twenty days, they would deliver up the City to the Venetians, upon condition
that they might be permitted to go forth with their Colors, and their other
Military Affairs. The King was particularly informed of these Proceedings by
the Venetian Ambassadors, who accompanied him all this journey; and showed him
how affairs went, and desired him not to give over the hopes of getting that
City; but to send his men forthwith to the Venetian camp to keep the Dutch Foot
from relieving the City, who were led on by Captain Roncandolfo, which if it
should succeed well, so many months time would be spent in vain, and they
should lose so fair an opportunity of putting an end unto the War. But though
the King very well knew the importancy of the business, he could not use such
diligence as that the French aid could prevent the coming of the Dutch Foot,
who being 8000 in number entered all safe into the City the 20 days not being
yet expired, not meeting with any obsticle; for the Commonwealths Soldiers,
who when News came of the Enemies approach, were sent to the strait Passes of
the Mountains, basely retreated to the Army, not staying so much as to look the
Enemy in the face. The Dutch had for their guide in this their voyage Captain
Lodovico da Ladrone, who being very well practiced in those parts, led them
over the tops of Mountains by unusual ways, so as getting at unawares out of
those strait and difficult Passes, they caused thereby more fear in our men.
When News came to the Venetian camp that the Enemy was come, they differed in
their opinions, some were for continuing the Siege, some for carrying the Army
elsewhere; but the number of the Dutch Foot being given out to be greater then
indeed it was, and the Spies having informed at the same time that Marco
Antonio Colonna was gone out of Verona, and entered into the confines of Mantua,
and hasted to assault them; the Venetian Commanders, fearing that if they
should tarry any longer they might easily be encompassed on both sides by the
Enemy, thought it best to raise the Siege. So the Artillery being brought into
the Cities of Crema and Cremona, the Army marched to Castelnedulo, six miles
from Brescia. When this News came to Venice it caused much wonder, and as much
sorrow in all the Citizens, who built confidently upon the getting of Brescia.
The Captain General and Commissaries had by letters advertised the Senate that
all the Passes were so guarded by our Soldiers, as it was impossible for the
Besieged to receive any succor. And this was the more credibly believed,
because News came at the same time, that the Forces which were sent from the
French to assist our Camp (which were 3000 Dutch Foot, and 400 Horse) were
already on their way from Millan. And assuredly the Commonwealth lost no
little reputation hereby to think that so few men gathered together out of the
Country, unexperienced in the Militia, without either Artillery or Horse,
should infuse such fear into a numerous Army, so well provided of all things as
was that of the Venetians and French, and which expected new succors suddenly,
as should make them give over their hopes of getting the City by Siege, and to
change their Quarters. Trivulcio was accused by many of too much haste and bad
advice, in losing the opportunity of putting an end unto his business, which so
much labor had been bestowed about. Whereat he being very much incensed, he
demanded leave to quit the Service of the Commonwealth; alleging that he was
sent for home about some private affairs of his own, which would not suffer him
to tarry any longer in the camp.

But the Senate, who thought this man's reputation and skill might be of great
help in that War, writ unto him, and exagerating his Worth, said,

They had always found much fidelity in his Actions, and much readiness, and
had never found fault with him, but much commended him for it; that it became
not the gravity of a Senate, when things wisely undertaken, did not succeed
well, to lay the fault upon the Authors, according to the custom of the common
people; that they therefore never blamed any thing but the bitterness of the
Season, and the Fortune of War, which had been so long averse to the
Commonwealth; so as though they might be sometimes troubled at the success of
the Commanders counsels and advices, yet knowing them to be good, they did not
blame the counsels: That for all this bad fortune the Senate would not go less
in their former intentions of providing for the War, but would take care that
the Army should be abundantly furnished with all things, which belonged to the
care of a General, as if he himself were present at their Counsels. And that
the General should want nothing whereby to show his Worth.

These, and the like means were often used not only to Trivulcio, but to the
King of France, yet were they not able to make him alter his resolution. He
therefore departed from Millan, and the care of the Venetian Army, and the
administration of the War, was committed to Theadore Trivulcio. This man was
formerly entertained by the Venetians, and had the same place and employment as
Renzo da Ceri had before; but was not able to come unto the camp till now,
whither as soon as he was come, he had the same authority given him as Giacopo
Trivulcio had before, though not the name, nor degree of Captain General. This
mean while King Francis, having provided all things for his departure, and sent
some of his men already before, he left the Duke of Burbone in charge with the
Government of the affairs of Italy, wherein he endued him with great authority,
and returned into France. But being resolved before he went to send more aid to
the Venetian Army, he recommended the men to the care of Monsieur Odetto de
Fois, named Monsieur di Lautrech, one famous in War, and desirous of Glory, who
for his worth and courage was thought fit to exercise the place of any
Commander. His commission from the King was to go with those men to the taking
in of Brescia, and to do all things for the good and service of the Venetians,
with the same care and diligence as if the City were to be recovered for him,
and to be annexed to the Crown of France. And certainly all the Kings
Proceedings were such, as plainly showed he bore a great good will to the
Commonwealth; for he had often constantly affirmed, that if the occasion of
War should require it, he would be ready to return again into Italy, with no
less Forces then he had done now, to the end that the Commonwealth might be
restored to her former Power and Dignity.

Wherefore the Venetians to purchase more grace and favor with the King,
thought fit to send an Ambassador who might continually reside with Monsieur
di Bourbone, who, as it has been said, was left in Italy in the supremest
place of Dignity; since it was likely they might have many occasions to treat
with him in: To which employment they chose Andrea Trevisano, who as soon as he
came to Millan, Andrea Gritti, who had tarried in that City after the Kings
departure to procure the coming of the French to our Army, returned to the camp
by order from the Senate, where he was made Commissary in the place of Dominico
Contarini, who falling sick, had got leave of the Senate to be gone. Almost
about the same time came Monsieur di Lautrech to the Army; and now the French
aid being come, it was thought it was no more to be doubted, but that Brescia,
not being able any longer to ressist so great Forces, would at last fall into
the power of the Commonwealth. The Pope thinking that such success would make
much against his designs, sought by all means to hinder it. He propounded a
Truce, and howsoever desired that the business might be spun out at length;
hoping that if the Siege of Brescia should prove long and difficult, some
occasion might arise, which might make the Venetians listen the sooner to
agreement, though upon bad conditions. And because he himself was able to do
but little in this business, no great belief being given to his words, nor
exhortations, he thought to interpose the King of Polonia's authority,
persuading his Ambassador, who was yet at Venice, to reassume the business of
Peace, by making new Proposals.

As, if the Venetians would forego the friendship of the French, and side with
Caesar, the noble Cities of Cremona and Lodi might be added unto their State;
for the King of France might be easily driven out by the joint Forces of the
Emperor, the Pope, and the Commonwealth; and then those Cities might be
obtained from Caesar, by the King of Polands Intercession, and Authority; so as
being for the future severed from the State of Millan, they might be added to
the Dominion of Venice, which would make way by occasion of handling other
particulars, for the re-gaining all the other things which were now held by
Caesar.

Upon the same design, the Pope, to the end that by absence of the Commander
the business of Brescia might be drawn out more at length, exhorted King
Francis to send Monsieur di Lautrech to Rome, seeming very desirous to treat
with that grave and wise man in many things concerning the business of Naples,
which he knew the King did very much desire, and therefore he thought this
proposition would be very acceptable to him. And though the Pope had contrary
thoughts in his head, yet he seemed very desirous that the beginning of that
War might not be deferred; for that Ferdinando King of Spain, after long
sickness was dead, and the power of Charles Duke of Burgony, who had taken upon
him the name of Prince of Casteile, grew daily more formidable to all those
that had any States in Italy, but chiefly to him; that therefore all force and
industry was to be used in not suffering his power to increase too
immoderately. But as Leo's cunning, already sufficiently known to all, could
not bring about his design, he having lost all credit; so did it afford great
cause of wondet by his uncertain way of proceeding; for it seemed that these
courses wherewith he thought to have jointly provided both for his own safety,
and the like of the Ecclesiastique State, did ill become his wisdom; for he
endeavored, as he had done all the time of his Popedom, that the Venetians,
who had always showed themselves obedient to the Apostolic See, whereof there
wanted not many evident examples; being suppressed by so many adversities, should
be still troubled with the labor and dangers of War; so as their Forces should
be kept low, and the dignity and power of the Commonwealth weakened; and that
on the contrary he should so study to advance the Emperors greatness, when he
knew that nothing could be so pernicious both to himself and all Italy, as to
suffer the Dutch Armies to continue long in that Country; giving occasion
thereby to revive the ancient claim and pretenses of the Emperors. And say he
should have forgot ancient passages, whereby he might be instructed how many
cruel and bitter things that Nation had plotted against the Popes of Rome; how
could he forget modern affairs and speeches told unto him, used by Maximillian?
Who was wont in all his discourses to say publicly, that the Churches State
did belong to the Western Empire; and that it would be his Fate to return the
Dignity of the Empire in Italy by his Forces, to its former greatness.
Therefore they who thought they saw more into Leo's intentions, were of
opinion, that his chief aim was to take the Venetians off from the friendship
of the French: Which if he could not do, yet that by the weakening of their
Forces, those of the King of France would likewise be weakened, he being a
friend and confederate of the Commonwealths* whose greatness (moved thereunto
either by hatred or fear) the Pope could not tolerate. Whereas he was less
jealous of Cesar's Forces as well in his own respect, as of that of the Church,
by reason of his natural light headedness; by reason of his paucity of men, and
want of moneys; for which reasons he thought his greatness could never be so
well grounded, but that it might by some chance be made to to^ter.

Thus did this year end, men's minds being variously possessed with hope and
fear; and not knowing what the end of so many evils would be; for in the
beginning of the next year, which was the year of our Lord 1516, and the 8th
year from the time that all Italy, and especially the State of Venice began to
be sorely molested with War, new Preparations for Arms, and evident signs of
future troubles began to appear. Soldiers were taken into pay every where;
more means were used for the renewing of War, then was before: and chiefly the
Venetians, refusing all Treaties of Peace, or of new Leagues, and being
returned to besiege Brescia, with great hopes of gaining it, were resolute to
continue the War till such time as they should have gotten that City either by
force, or by voluntary surrender. Caesar also (who had not been himself in
person in any of the Armies the last year past, but managing the War by his
Captains, had not managed it over well) re-assuming his former thirst after
War, sought to raise commotions in all parts, and to augment his Forces that he
might molest the affairs of Italy; he called many Dyets, craved aids, mustered
men, sent for Commanders; but he chiefly solicited the Switzers to take up
Arms, and to revenge the death of their valiant companions, promising to be
their Leader, and to be willing to share with them in all labor and danger.
The King of England did the like, out of envy to the King of France his recent
glory, and out of anger that he had taken the King of Scotland into his
protection. The Pope with the like intention, but more secretly, endeavored
the same with the Switzers. All these affirmed that the Switzers could
undertake no War which could bring them greater glory or richer booty, then
that of Italy, which being already begun, must now again be renewed with
greater Forces. They moreover promised them some pay for their Soldiers, but
much hopes of greater advantage which they might always have by their
Friendship. This mean time the Venetian Commanders, Lautrech being already come
(as has been said) with aid to their camp, held many Councils, and did differ
in their opinions touching the managing of the War.

Some were for the raising of the Siege from before Brescia, and for carrying
the whole Army to Verona; for which they alleged that that City, now that
their veterane Soldiers were gone to relieve Brescia, was but weakly
garrisoned, and that the Enemy had made no provision for necessary defense; as
not suspecting any such thing then. But the season of the year made much
against this opinion; for the Camp could not without great inconvenience be
removed in the midst of Winter, nor the Soldiers be led to a new Enterprise.
Besides it might appear a rash thing to change greater hopes of getting
Brescia, with the uncertainty of what might befall about Verona; for the
condition of Brescia being considered, it was evidently seen, that unless they
did intermit their begun works, the Town must of necessity fall into their
hands, either by force, or by surrender; it was apparent that the City was in
great want of money, Corn, and of all sort of Victuals; the Commanders were at
odds within themselves; the Soldiers weary of being long besieged, and by
reason of many sufferings, rather ready to mutiny then to fight; and the
Citizens, as well by reason of their new grievances laid upon them by their new
Masters, as out of their ancient affection to the Venetians, desirous of
Novelties, and ready upon any accident to drive the Garrison out of the City.
Moreover the Defendants were reduced to a small number; for the Foot who were
come a little before to assist the Besieged, seeing that with diversity of
opinion, but no resolution, many discourses had been had of leading the
Soldiers forth to fight, and that the scarcity of Victuals did daily increase,
were most of them gone from the City, leaving the business unperfected.

These things being found by the report of many to be true, it was by general
consent agreed, that they should keep their Quarters, and attend with all
diligence to straiten the City more. Our Army abounded in all things; for the
Senate were so careful to provide all things requisite for War, as though the
Enemy strove much to hinder it, all their endeavors proved vain. Amongst the
rest Mark Antonio Colonna endeavored often by sending his Soldiers out of
Verona, to keep the Army from victuals, and by laying ambushes to intercept the
moneys which were sent to the Venetian camp. To which purpose he kept
continually good store of Spanish Foot and Horse at the Town of Legnano, which
was now fallen into his power; to block up all the ways of that Country, and
the Enemy growing daily more bold, and offering at great matters, they made
incursion even to the Territories of Brescia, which they might safely do,
because they saw the Venetian Army was busied about the Siege. Wherefore the
Captain General and Commissaries, thought that it stood not with the honor and
reputation of that Army to suffer that so few men should come so near hand to
insult over them. Wherefore having notice that Colonna endeavored to come into
the confines of Mantua, to block up that way likewise, which as the safest, was
frequented by those that went to the camp; Paolo Manfrone and Mercurio Bua were
sent by our men to meet them, and to fight them. Who though they undertook the
business courageously, yet did they not succeed well therein; for Colonna
having notice of their coming by his Scouts, took with him some companies of
veterane Soldiers, and went speedily toward Valeggio, where he had such
advantage of place, as he might choose whether he would keep safe there, or
fight upon advantageous terms: Our men and the Enemy entered at the same time by
several ways into this Town, and both of them strove to possess themselves of
the Bridge, which joins the Town together, being otherwise divided by the waters
of Menzo; each side hoping to repulse the Enemy, and to make themselves Masters
of the Town. When they came to skirmish, our men at first did not only
valiantly withstand the Enemy, but repulsed them, and if after a long dispute
they were sometimes forced to give back, yet soon after they would return and
pursue them.

Thus this Conflict lasted a good while with dubious success: but the Enemy,
who were many more in number, having at last driven our Horse from the Bridge,
whereby they had power to settle their Ranks in a larger space, they charged so
furiously upon our men, as not being able to resist any longer, but being
dispersed, and discouraged, our men began to run, some of them getting safe
unto the Camp, othersome being taken Prisoners, amongst which Iulio, Son to
Paolo Manfrone, was one. Ianus Fregoso, and Corrado Orsino, succeeded better in
their Attempts, who being gone at the same time from the Camp, to suppress some
Dutch Foot Colors, in some narrow passages of the Mountains, they met with
them who were sent before to be a Convoy to certain Moneys which were brought
to the Besieged. They fought them so courageously, and so fortunately, as but
few of the Enemy escaped safe away: But being more encouraged afterward, they
made way for a greater Victory, being by an unexpected accident, put upon a
business of much danger, but of more hopes; For Fregoso, and Orsino, being come
to the Castle of Anfo, when they thought the Enemy were far off, they were
unexpectedly advertized of their being near at hand; And although the night
were already come on, they resolved to Assault them forthwith, without any
delay, and at unawares; They quickly put the first Squadrons to flight, whereat
those that followed being dis-heartned, they likewise began to run; which they
could not do so fast, by reason of the craggy Ways, but that they were cut in
pieces. But the mean while these were Fighting, those who had the conducting of
the Moneys, relying upon their knowledge of the ways, and the darkness of the
night, went over the sharpest tops of Mountains, and saved this prey, which the
Venetian Soldiers thought themselves almost sure of. But these things made
little for the main business, nor did they conduce any thing to putting of an
end unto the War: And much greater businesses began now to be agitated, by
reason of the news of the Emperors coming for Italy, which news increased
every day, affording both the Besieged and the Besiegers, various effects, both
of hope and fear; and many new things were broaching both in the City, and in
the Camp. The Emperor had raised many Horse and Foot in his own Dominions, and
having egged on many Switzers to take up Arms, he was already upon his way for
Italy, intending to enter by the Mountains of Trent, into the Territories of
Verona, and when he should have munited the Garrisons of Verona and Brescia, to
pass into the State of Millan, and drive the French from thence. When the Pope
heard of his coming, for his greater honor, and to witness how well he stood
affected to him, he sent his Legate Bernardo Bibiena, to meet him, a man of
great note, both for his honor of being a Cardinal, and for his favor with
the Pope; which did not a little molest Cesar's Affairs, nor confirm the
Switzers. The Venetians, believing for certain that the Emperor would come for
Italy, did several times earnestly entreat the King of France to provide
betimes for the common Affair, and not to suffer himself to be bereft of the
fruit of so much labor, neither by Caesar, nor by the Switzers, who envied his
glory; That therefore he should either return armed himself into Italy, or if
that might not be, to increase his Army lustily, and to take order for all such
provisions as the greatness of the Affayr did require; as for their part, they
promised to spare for neither cost, nor labor. The King was very much troubled
at these things, not only for the danger which he saw the Dukedom of Millan
would be in, but because it would be a great hinderance to him afterward in
the business of Naples, which he had set his heart upon. Being resolved to
defend his own Territories, and those of his confederates, he first propounded
to the Venetians that 8000 Switzers might be taken into pay at the common
charge; for having opportunely made League at this time with that Nation, in
their agreement it was particularly declared, that it might be lawful for the
King to have as many Soldiers out of their Country as he should please. To
this the Venetians assented readily, promising for their parts to pay 2000 Foot
of that Nation, and to be ready to disburse moneys for all other necessaries
for the War. And though the public Treasury was already much exhausted, and
the whole City mightily oppressed by the weight of so long a War, yet was there
no provision omitted which was thought necessary for maintaining the Army, and
continuing the War. Four thousand Italian Foot were raised, the Garrisons of
Cities increased; Paulo Gradinigo and Luigi Barbaro were made Commissaries; the
former to have particular care of all things belonging to the Militia in Padua,
the other, the like in Treviso.

There were at this time in our camp 4000 Gasconne Foot and 500 Curassiers,
commanded by French men; in the Army which was particularly under Trivulcio's
charge were 7000 Foot, and about 2500 Horse, part light Horse, part Curassiers.
The Duke of Bourbone, after the Kings departure, had with him 4000 Gasconne and
Italian Foot, and 700 Curassiers; these men being all joined together, and the
Switzers Foot being likewise to be added to them, whereof 6000 were already
said to be come to Iurea, the French and the Venetians might seem to have great
hopes of being therewithal able to defend the State of Millan, and to frustrate
all the Emperors endeavors; for though it were given out that Caesar brought
with him 25000 Soldiers to this Enterprise, yet it was confidently believed
that his Army was more numerous then valiant, and that their other Requisites
for War were not answerable; for the Dutch Foot were for the most part raised
in his own Dominions, and tumultuously of all sorts of men; that his Horse were
few, and unexperienced, the provision of victuals and moneys but small, and no
great constancy in the Commander himself to support these inconveniences, nor
much knowledge how to remedy them. There was only one thing which seemed to make
for the strength of this Army, to wit, the Switzers Forces; yet Caesar could not
much confide in them, by reason of their changeable disposition, and for a
certain ill will they bore to the House of Austria: Therefore these Forces of
the Emperors being greater in fame, then in reality, it was thought that the
Venetians would encounter with them, and fight them with all their men, as soon
as they were come near their confines; lest any longer delay might show fear in
them, and make the Enemy grow the bolder: and lest their affairs might fare the
worse as if they durst not look the Enemy in the face, but had yielded the
field unto them. They therefore considered, that though they should resolve not
to give Battle, yet they might choose some strong place opposite to the Enemies
Quarters, wherein they might keep, and observe Cesars ways, and search into his
counsels, and then change place and purpose according as time and occasion
should counsel them. Yet because the French were of a contrary opinion, the
whole Army was brought from the Territories of Brescia, and brought into those
of Cremona, whither the Duke of Burbone was come but a little before with his
Horse and Foot.

Their intention was to wait for the Switzers here, who were not yet past by,
and to keep them from passing. Maximillian being this mean while past over the
River Adice with all his men, came to the Town of Guscolenga, having met with
many Soldiers from Verona in his March, as also with Mark Antonio Colonna with
200 Horse; for the Venetian Army being drawn off, they thought they might find
all things sure in that Country. Caesar being entered into the Brescian Confines,
resolved before he would go any farther, to possess himself either by fair
means or by foul of the Town of Asola, which is the first Town on that side of
the Country, thinking it neither became his safety nor his honor, to leave any
place behind him in the power of the Enemy, whereby they might keep back
victuals from his Army. But this proving a business of great length by reason
of the Defendants valor, all other warlike Proceedings were impeded, and in
the mean time the French had better opportunity to increase their Army. Much
praise was attributed for this to Francisco Contarini, Commissary of the Town,
to Antonio Martinengo, and to all the rest as well Soldiers as Citizens that
were in the Town; for having with so few men, but much courage withstood so
great an Army, and by defending Asola frustrated the Forces of so great a
Prince, and much lessened his reputation; since with expense of much time and
labor he could not get so small a Castle. Yet the Switzers had won such
reputation and credit in their last Skirmishes, as the French resolved neither
to keep where they were, nor to hazard themselves upon the event of Battle,
unless their Army were munited and increased by the same Nation. Wherefore
Maximillian being gone from before Asola, after having spent much time there in
vain, for fear lest by keeping so great an Army so long a time, before so
little a Town, his Soldiers might be discouraged, and might miss of doing
greater matters; the French Commanders when they heard of his being gone,
called suddenly a Council of War, wherein they resolved to raise their camp,
and to carry it to the River Ada, hoping that by keeping upon the Banks
thereof, they might hold the Enemy play, and hinder them from passing over the
River. But the French and Venetians were not well gone from thence, when all
that lay between the Rivers Poe and Adice, fell into the Emperors hands,
except Cremona and Crema, which redounded so much to his honor, and to the
terror of the others, as the French neither confiding in themselves nor in
others, marched away with their Army so suddenly, and so fast toward Millan,
as it was doubted, whether they went thither to defend the City, or to be
defended themselves by the Walls thereof. Maximillian, making use of
opportunity, pursued those that fled, and began already to promise all good
success unto himself, and staying six miles from Millan, he let the City know,

That if it did not surrender all the sooner, it must look for all severity:
But if it would yield to him of its own good will, it might presume of
obtaining many immunities, and much more freedom in all things. Affirming that
he was come into Italy with intention, according to the custom of his
Ancestors, of taking up the Ensigns of the Empire in that City, and to drive
the French from thence, and out of that State, who were unjust and unlawful
Lords thereof, and to recover the right dues of the Empire. This Message was
answered, as pleased the French; that the State of Millan which was formerly a
member of the Empire, was severed from thence by authority of the Emperors,
and for a certain sum of money which was paid down for it; that therefore Caesar
had now no more pretense to that City, which both by right of inheritance, and
right of War, was lawfully possessed by Franc^s Vallois King of France; that
therefore the Millaneses would keep that City for their legitimate Lord, to
whom they had sworn Loyalty, and that they had so provided for all things, as
they doubted not but to be able to defend the City against all injurious
violence.

Yet all things were full of fear in that City, the Citizens and Soldiers
doubted much what the issue of the War would be, and not knowing well how to
provide for their own safeties, which they more minded then the preserving of
the State for the King, all their consultations were full of fear and doubts:
Amidst these doubts and difficulties, the Venetian Commissaries, especially
Andrea Gritti, who had most power with the French, being firmly resolved to
defend the City,

Exhorted all the rest to do their utmost, and to be of good courage; they put
the Citizens sometimes in mind of the Kings humanity toward them, sometime of
what punishment they were to suffer if they should often provoke his anger;
they likewise applied themselves to many of the chief of the Army, entreating
them, and conjuring them, that calling to mind their late Victory, and the
Glory which they had wone, they should resolve upon serving the King and the
Venetians: That the cause and common interest was the same therein, and that
the business it self was not desperate, if it were courageously and constantly
defended; to what purpose ( said Gritti) do the French take such pains, and put
themselves into so much danger, to what purpose do they send so many Armies
into Lombardy, if at the very first appearance of the Enemy all defense must be
given over, and those things must be yielded, which they have gotten with long
War, and with much expense, yea even of their own blood? We, as knowing the
Senates intention, and the like of our whole City of running the same fortune
with the French, will willingly expose all our men and all our Forces, not
refusing to endeavor every thing even to the utmost.

Thus by Gritti his counsel and exhortation, the Suburbs of the City were set
on fire, to the end that the Enemy might not make use of them for their
advantage; great Guns were placed upon the Walls, diverse Corpse de guarde were
ordained, and all things were prepared for defense. These provisions did
somewhat cool the Enemies courage, and afforded them occasion of many doubts
and difficulties, so as taking time to think what to do, those within began to
be of better hopes; for in this interim many Colors of the Switzers came
opportunely to Millan, commanded by Alberto Pietra, to the number of 4000, of
the Cantons of Seduno and Berne, who were very welcome to the Soldiers and
Citizens. By their coming the faces of things altered; all fear fled from the
French to the Imperialists; for the City being munited by such supplies, so as
it was not to be taken but with expense of much time and labor, they within
thought themselves safe enough, since Caesar could not tarry long before the
City for want of money, victuals, and of all things necessary. Wherefore the
French began to be of better heart, and on the contrary, Cesars hardships grew
daily greater and greater. But he was chiefly troubled with jealousy of the
Switzers, for calling to mind the past and present affairs, he found that there
were many of that Nation as well in his camp, as in the City; whom the French
might easily win over unto them by their moneys, which he could not so easily
do by reason of his want thereof. Moreover, that that Nation had always, unless
it were upon some occasions in these latter times, been great friends to the
French: And that they had always hated the greatness of the Emperors. These
considerations occasioned much fear in him, and took from him the chief ground
work of his hopes of Victory. He likewise thought with much more commotion of
mind, upon Lodovico Sforza's latter fortune near Novara, where he was delivered
up into the hands of the Enemy, by the perfidiousness of those people. He
therefore held it the better counsel to free himself from that danger by reason
of the Switzers fickleness. At last his mind being agitated by such like
thoughts as these, and fear growing more powerful in him, he resolved to quit
his Army without having attempted any thing, and to return himself into
Germany. Wherefore taking only 200 Horse along with him, he gave out that the
cause of his departure was only to provide moneys for the payment of the Army,
and that he would speedily return to the camp. But the Soldiers seeing their
chief Commander gone, began every one to do what he thought best for himself.
The Switzers went to Lodi, and ruinating the Country every where, sacked the
City: And would have continued to commit the like Outrages, had not the
Switzers which were in Millan protested, that unless they would give over those
injurious Proceedings, they should be forced to come out against them, together
with the French and Venetians; so as Switzers fighting against Switzers, they
were to imbrue their hands in one another blood. The former Switzers for this
respect forbearing doing any other damage, after having made some peaceful
abode in those parts some few days, returned all of them to their own homes,
except it were some few companies, who went with their Commander Morco Setio to
the custody of Verona, whither Colonna went also with his Horse, and with the
Spanish and Dutch Foot who were before drawn out from that Garrison. The rest
of the Spanish and Dutch Foot, returned by several ways into their own
Countries, having been much prejudiced in their journey by the Venetian Horse.

Soon after the Emperors departure came the Marquess of Brandenbourg to the
camp with a certain sum of money, who though he did his best to rally the
Soldiers that dis-banded, yet things being already grown to great confusion,
and the Moneys that were brought not being sufficient to satisfy all, he could
do no good. Thus a great Army, which was at first so formidable to the Enemy,
being in so short a time vanished to nothing; not any danger at all having
befalen it, may teach us that men are oftentimes deluded in their Councels by
various accidents, and meet with much unexpected ends: And that we are often
times deceived through hopes, and fears, arising out of mere opinion, without
discerning any thing, save the first appearances.

In this preturbation of Affairs, the no great good will which was between the
Pope and King of France, began to be more manifestly known, sprung from former
reasons, which were unknown till now; for King Francis complained that the
Pope, out of some bad intention, had forestowed the sending of such recrutes
unto his Army, as by agreement he was bound to do, that he had privately
incited the Switzers against him, and had given many other signs of his bad
inclination toward him. Certainly it is worthy note (since occasion leads me
thereunto) with how many several affections, and sometimes contrary within
themselves, the minds of Princes are agitated. Pope Leo, and King Francis,
thought when they parted at Bullen, that they had sufficiently provided for
their Affairs; and that the Friendship and League that was confirmed betwixt
them, was likely to last long, and to be cause of much safety to them both: But
soon after, construing the same Affairs otherwise, they began to doubt that the
things agreed upon between them would not be observed; so as each of them grew
jealous of the other. The Pope being conscious how bitter, and open an Enemy he
had already showed himself unto the French, how often he had abused their
hopes, under a fained pretense of Friendship; that even then when they were in
treaty of reconciliation he would not satisfy him in many things, pressed hard
upon by the King, in behalf of his Friends and Confederates; began to doubt the
King of France could never be his true Friend: Moreover, calling to mind the
many injuries done by the two preceding Kings, Charles, and Lewis, to the house
of Medici, he could not persuade himself that then when the French hoped to get
some principal places in Italy, King Francis could willingly tolerate the
greatness of Lorenzo de Medici, should still increase; whereby he had
opportunity given him to revenge the ancient injuries done to the prejudice of
his reputation, and to the States which he held in Italy. On the contrary, the
King thinking that the same reasons remained still, which had formerly
disgratiated him with the Pope; and that this the Pope's ill will toward him
was the more increased, by how much his power was increased in Italy, and was
become more formidable to him, interpreted all things to the worst, and
according to this his aprehension, that Leo had concealed his truest intentions
from him, that it was necessity which had made him accommodate himself to the
condition of the times at their meeting; and that as soon as he should meet
with any means of hurting him, this would evidently be seen. The Venetians
labored often to free these Princes of these suspicions, and sought by all means
how to reconcile them; for they knew how much it imported the strength and
reputation of the League, that the Pope, King of France, and Commonwealth,
should hold true intelligence together; and did of all things abhor to be
necessitated to take up Arms against the Church; wherefore passing by the
injuries they had received from Leo, they desired to have him less their Enemy.
The King of England did also often times out of the said reasons, endeavor to
bring these two Princes to fair terms; for that it very well became a great
and wise Prince as he was, and who had always preferred the Interest of
Christian Religion before any self-respect, to use his best endeavors to
introduce peace amongst Christian Princes, that they might be able to defend
their States against the Turks; who having overcome the King of Persia in
Battle, totally destroyed the Empire of the Mamalucky, and taken the Kingdom
from Cam^sone Gauro, King of Memphis, did very much advance by the ruin of
other men; and to the end that they might win greater Favor and Authority with
the King, the Senate, knowing that it would be acceptable and commodious to the
Kingdom of England, resolved to send their great Gallioans, toward the Rodes
of that Island, which had not for some late years been upon those Seas.

Whilst these things were treated of by Ambassadors, the War did
notwithstanding, still go on; for after the Switzers and Dutch were gone,
Lautrech, having left sufficient Garrison in Millan, drew all the Army out of
the City, and not making any delay, marched into the Territories of Brescia,
intending to renew the Siege of that Town; the Duke of Burbone, being at this
time gone from Italy, the supreme Government of the Kings affairs were
entrusted with Lautrech, a man famous for many indowments of mind, and who
would have been more Famous in War, had he not been too much opinionated. After
the departure of Cesar's Army, the City of Brescia was left almost without any
defendants; for the Soldiers of the Garrison, seeing Caesar grow less in his
reputation, and having no hopes of relief; being also weary of the toylsome
labors, and inconveniences of the late Siege, and not having received their
pay at due times, were some of them returned home, and some gone over to the
Venetian Camp: So there were but only 700 Spanish Foot left to guard the City,
under Captain Hiccardo, but these were all men of known Valor, and Integrity;
Where ore the Venetian Commanders thinking they might now hope well to get that
City, made the more haste, not tarrying for the French (who followed them a
little more slowly) to the end that finding the Enemy unprovided, they might be
the more confused at their unexpected approach. Thus though the night came on
whilst they were on their March, not allowing any the least time for the
Soldiers to rest themselves, at the very instant of their Arrival they ordered
their men before the Walls, and suddenly clapped their scaling Ladders thereunto,
by which many of them began already boldly to mount, and to put for entering the
Town. The Foot who were upon the defense, astonished at this unexpected
accident, and confounded by the darkness of the night, ran up and down every
where, striving to keep the Ladders from off the Walls; and if any of our men
were got up to the tops thereof, they threw them down; they fought in several
places, endeavoring to defend themselves, some here, some there: They at the
same time minded fighting the Enemy, and their own defense; The Combat drawing
forth thus in length, the Enemy having borne the first brunt, grew hourly more
corragious, so as the Venetians being in a disadvantageous place, where they
could neither tarry, nor fight, were forced to quit the Enterprise, and to
retreat. It was afterward known that this design miscarried by the Ladders
being too short; soon after came Lautrech, with his Army, wherefore the
Commanders thinking they were now strong enough, endeavored to do their best
to storm the City: They surrounded the Walls with 5. bodies, and placed their
Cannon in such parts as they thought most convenient, and began to play so
furiously upon the Walls, as in a short time a part thereof fell down to the
ground, which facilitated the way to make an Assault: Amidst these dangers and
difficulties, Hiccardo, not at all discouraged, provided carefully for all
things, not refusing any labor, and all the Soldiers being equally desirous
to defend the City, labored both day and night about the Walls, by day in
repairing the Rampires, by night in bringing the Rubbish into the Town,
wherewith they quickly rai^ed new Rampires where the Wall was broken down; but
the ruin which were made by so many Batteries, could not be repaired in so
short a time, nor by so few men; nor could sufficient Guards be kept in all
necessary places at once: Wherefore Hiccardo understanding that the Enemy were
ready to give an Assault, which he could not sustain without evident ruin to
himself, and his men, he resolved to surrender the Town. This was welcome News
to the Venetians, who desired the preservation of that Noble City, and to
return it unto the Commonwealth undefaced or ransackt, which would have been
hard to do, if the City had been taken by force; the Commanders not being able
often times to refrain the insolency and rapine of the Soldiers, especially
if Foreigners.

Truce was therefore made by a certain tacit consent of both sides; and by
Messages sent between the Town and the Camp, an agreement was made upon these
conditions.

That the City should be delivered up to Lautrech, unless it were releeved by
8000 men within three days, that the Soldiers of the Garrison should be
permitted to go whither they licted, provided it were not to Verona; that no
prejudice should be done to the City, neither by the Venetian Soldiers, nor by
the French; and that it should be lawful for the Count Gambara, and for some
few Citizens who had adhered to Caesar 's party, to enjoy their Country and all
their goods, and that all their faults should be forgiven them.

These conditions were the more easily given way unto, for that it was
confidently believed so great a supply could not come unto the City in so short
a time; for the Dutch Soldiers who were come to the Castle of A^fo to relieve
the Besieged; were returned back, being routed and put to flight, by a greater
number of our Soldiers.

Things being thus agreed upon, and no succor appearing within the pre-limited
time, Hiccardo and all his Soldiers marched out of the Town in good order with
their Colors flying, and Drums beating; and at the same time Lautrech and the
Venetian Commissaries entered, who were received by a great concourse of people
of all conditions, and of all ages, manifesting shows of much joy, whereby they
witnessed their good will to the Commonwealth. Lautrech took possession of the
City first, and then presently delivered it up to the Venetian Commissaries,
and the Commonwealths Standard was set up. Thus this famous City after so
great confusion of affairs, having suffered very much and run several fortunes
in War, returned under the Dominion of her ancient Masters, and was restored to
her former peaceable condition. When the News of the recovery of Brescia came
to Venice, great joy was throughout all the City, and the Citizens by this
success began to have better hopes of putting an end unto the War. The
Venetians did always make very great account of Brescia, by reason of the
number of her Inhabitants, and she was of great service to the Commonwealth by
means of her fruitful, rich, and copious fields; and moreover because the
Gentry and commonalty therein were ever held to be faithful and loving to their
Country. The Senate gave many thanks to the King of France for that by the
ready assistance of his men they had re-gained that City, wherein, as his
Commanders had shown singular Worth, as should always be by them acknowledged,
so did his Majesty share in the glory, and the Commonwealths obligations to
him was much increased thereby.

Letters were likewise written to Lautrech, wherein as his faith and diligence
were much commended, so was he desired to make use of such fitting occasions as
did offer themselves for other prosperous successes, since the fortune of the
Commonwealth began to alter. They put him in mind, that if the Army (who were
very desirous of the Enterprise) were suddenly carried to before the Walls of
Verona, they might be almost sure to get that City; and so the whole War would
be prosperously ended; that he could do nothing that would redound more to his
own glory and to the advantage of his King then this; for assuredly when the
Commonwealth of Venice should chiefly by the aid and favor of the French, be
restored to her pristine greatness, their Empire would be confirmed for many
years in Italy, to his particular and immortal glory, whereof he having showed
himself to be at all times desirous, he needed imitate no body but himself.

Lautrech being much taken, as it appeared by these Speeches, he resolved to
march with his camp in company with Trivulcio toward the Territories of
Verona; but being come to Peschiera whilst the Army was yet on this side the
River Menzo, Lautrech told the Venetian Commissaries, who expected nothing less
at this time,

That he could not tarry longer then three days in the Territories of Verona,
for that he had had intelligence, that the Switzers were resolved to take up
Arms, and that they were already prepared to assault the Dukedom of Millan, the
danger whereof being considered, he thought it would make much against the
Service of his King to keep his men any longer farther off from the Confines of
that State.

These things being propounded in the Council, they were all of a joint
opinion, not to remove the camp from the place where it was, but to tarry
there, till they might have some more certain News of the Switzers moving,
which was brought to the camp only by a flying rumor.

Lest if the Army should advance farther, and be doubtful whether it should
tarry there any longer or no, they might make men believe by their sudden
departure that they had raised the Army for want of Forces, or for fear of the
Enemies approach, and out of dispairing to do any good upon Verona, which would
make them lose the reputation they had won by their prosperous success at
Brescia, and whereas now they were a terror to their Enemies, they would
become their scorn.

But the News of the Switzers advancing increasing daily, Lautrech would needs
carry the whole Army into the State of Millan. And though this resolution was
gainsaid by all the other Commanders, who alleged,

That the place where the Army now was, was naturally very strong, and very fit
wherein to put on such Resolves as the condition of Affairs, or the Enemies
March, which was then uncertain, should require.

Yet he standing fixed to his opinion of removing the camp, moved that it
should be carried to near Asola, in the Brescian Territories, alleging,

That Verona was then gallantly garrisoned; for that after the dis-banding of
Cesars Army, many of the Switzers and Dutch were retreated thither; so as that
Attempt was likely to prove vain, and that therefore to undertake a difficult
business, without assured hopes of effecting it, was no better then to hinder
themselves in their other Proceedings, and to confound the whole Government of
the War. He added hereunto sometimes (to find other excuses for his counsel)
that the Venetians had given ear to the King of Poland, who was said to have
treated of peace by his Ambassadors, wherefore they were to expect an issue of
that Treaty, before they fell upon any other business; and finally he
complained that moneys were not sent at the time appointed to pay the 6000
Dutch Foot, as the Commonwealth had promised.

Gritti gainsaid all these assertions, saying that things were much otherwise
then Lautrech had represented them to be.

That there was a great scarcity of all things in Verona, especially of Corn;
that the Garrison which was entered thereinto, was likely to be a greater
inconvenience to the City through the dearth of Corn, then a safety by
increasing the numbers of the Defendants; that if the Army should fall off then
when the Harvest was so near at hand, and should afford the Enemy opportunity
to gather in the fruits of the Earth, and bring them into the City, they must
make account to attempt the same Enterprise upon much greater disadvantage at
another time, when they should have no other hopes then what lay in their
Forces and Weapons; and that not without much danger, and uncertainty of good
success. Moreover, that they understood by those Soldiers that were fled into
their Camp, that there was great falling out in the City between the Citizens
and the Soldiers, and great confusion in all things, whereby the Affairs of
War were treated of with much negligence and jealousy: That therefore when the
Army should draw near, 'twas likely that the people, partly to provide for
their own safeties, and others out of the^r affections to the parties they
sided withal, would make some commotion, and afford better opportunity of
gaining the City. Assuredly said Gritti, it is not to be believed that the
Senate of Venice should ^reat of any thing touching peace with the Polish
Ambassador, contrary to the will of the King of France, nor yet so much as
without his knowledge; the constancy of the Senators having been such, and so
manifest, in renewing the War for so long a time, their observancy toward the
King, and their confidence in the French Nation having been so great, as that
they had often times refused fair conditions of peace which had been offered
them, and had always studied the Kings greatness no less then the good of the
Commonwealth, which might be witnessed as well by their actions of the former
year, as now of latter days near Millan; wherein rather an express Commandment,
then tacit consent, came from the Senate. Let these suspicions and jealousies
then cease, and let them not prevail so far as to make any of us less ready to
do what the common good does counsel; the moneys which are due to the Dutch
Foot are already prepared, and as soon as the ways shall be safe and open, they
will doubtlesly be brought to the Camp; but when I think of our departure from
hence, and of our going into the Brescian Territories, I find that greater
inconveniences will ensue thereby: And the like will befall our City; for the
people of that Country who have been always faithful to the Commonwealth, and
who have suffered so much by the Wars, now when they should begin to make
themselves whole, will be oppressed almost with their late former grievances, by
the coming of so great an Army into their precincts; since it is they that must
feed it. So we shall be burthensom to our friends, and shall forbear our
Enemies; we shall lessen the affections of the former, and encourage the
others. When Gritti had spoke thus, to confirm his opinion, he added; that
though Lautrech should not follow them, his opinion was that the Venetian Army
should of, and by it self, march into the Territories of Verona.

The Captain General, and all the rest of the Venetian Commanders were of the
same opinion with Gritti, so as certainly his opinion would have been followed,
if after more mature consideration, they had not feared, that such a resolution
would in some other respects be prejudicial to the Commonwealth; for by this
division of the Army, the forces of the League would not only be diminished,
but the Enemies would believe by this disagreement of the Commanders, that the
confederate Princes might easily be divided. But Lautrech, were it either in
pursuance of his nature, which was not to part easily from his opinion, or that
he would not willingly hazard the glory of having recovered Brescia, to any new
events of War; could never be persuaded either by reason or by entreaties to
venture upon the taking of Verona* but with much ado yielded at last to tarry
awhile in those Quarters where he was. The opinion of many was afterward
confirmed by the sequel of things, that Lautrech having notice of a Treaty of
agreement which was in hand between King Francis and Charles Duke of Burgondy,
which was begun in the City of Noyon, did by thus drawing things out at length,
more mind his Kings convenience, then either his own praise, or the Venetians
service. The Senate being this mean while informed of all these passages, and
esteeming it to be very disadvantagious and contrary to their designs, to
permit the Enemies who were in Verona, to gather in their Harvest, they charged
Commissary Paulo Gradinigo to draw forth a Band of the best Soldiers that were
in Garrison at Padua, and that with them, and those that were in the
Territories of Vicenza under the Government of Frederick Gousaga, he should
overrun the confines of Verona, spoil the corn which was upon the ground, and
use all means possible to keep the corn from being brought into Verona. But the
Enemy being advertised of these men's departure, went unexpectedly out of
Verona, and going by another way then our men did, went into the Territories of
Vicenza and Padua, and did much mischief. Lautrech had stayed in the same
Quarters about some thirty days when the News of the Switzers being quite over,
and having no other reason for his so long delay, growing likewise suspicious
that it might redound somewhat to his disparagement that he had kept the Army
so long idle, and had lost so much time, he resolved at last to remove the
camp, and to go into the Territories of Verona; whereunto he was the rather
moved by a protestation made by the Venetian Commissaries that else they would
not issue forth the moneys which were then come to the camp for the Dutch
Soldiers. The camp being raised the first day of August, all the Army was led
to the Town Gotalengo, to be passed over the River Adice. The first thing the
Commanders did was to possess themselves of the straitest passages of the
Mountains, by which the Dutch were wont to come from Germany to Verona, by
placing good Guards in them; to the end that the ways being blocked up, the
City might be kept from being relieved: By which means the Spanish and Dutch
Foot, (corn growing every day dearer and dearer, and not having received their
pay from Caesar, whereby to help their many inconveniences) past over in great
numbers to the Venetian camp, where they were willingly received and mustered
amongst their Militia. And the Switzers, moved by the example of others, and
hating the great inconveniences of a Siege, returned most of them to their own
homes. There were then in Our Army 8000 Italian Foot, and 6000 Dutch, to boot
with the French aid; 1000 Curassiers, 2000 light Horse, many famous Commanders
in War, and all other things necessary for the taking in of the City. It was
resolved that the Army being divided into two camps, the City should be begirt
on two sides; to the end that the Defendants, who were already reduced to a
small number might be the sooner wearied by doing perpetual duties. These
things being begun to be put in execution, as was resolved of in counsel, the
Dutch Soldiers, though they had received three months pay, began to mutiny,
and refused to obey their Commanders; and though Trivulcio was already on his
March with his other companies, they would not stir from where they were;
saying they would not carry Arms against the Emperor, nor be led to the taking
of a City possessed by him. These men not being to be persuaded out of their
opinion, the Venetian Soldiers not being able to do of themselves what was
particularly recommended to Trivulcio, Lautrech, promised to give them other
companies out of his Soldiers; but considering afterward that by the loss of
those men his Army would be much weakened, and his camp not be over safe, he
changed his mind, and without attempting any thing, fell aloof off two miles
from the City; and the Venetians were forced to do the like, for they were not
able to do any thing of themselves. This mean while the Garrison began daily to
decrease within the City, for many Dutch Colors returned home, and others past
over to the Venetian camp; and came in such numbers, as no more fugitive
Soldiers would be received into the camp; for the Venetians remembered that
these men were rather a trouble and an expense then any aid; wherefore they
thought it not safe to rely upon their Loyalties: And they feared likewise
lest a much greater number of Mountainers, who had formerly been in Cesars
camp, seeing such hopes of gain given them, and that they might get those pays
from Cesar's Enemies which he had not paid them might descend from the
neighboring Villages, into the Territories of Verona.

Yet so many were the defendants, as though great store were gone, the City was
notwithstanding well munited: Wherefore Lautrech not thinking it fit to attempt
any thing without the hopes of effecting it, demanded more help of the
Venetians, if they would have him take Verona; which though it were hard to do,
yet that they might not leave a business of so great importance* unattempted,
they sent 4000 Foot to the Camp, and great store of Artillery, Powder, and
Victuals, that nothing might be wanting which was necessary for War: All
sufficient provisions being had, the Army drew near the Walls of Verona: This
City is divided by the River Adice, which runs through the midst of it, into
two parts; and is walled round about by Walls which look upon a large
Campagnia, and are in compass 7 miles about; near unto which are great Rampires
of earth, which take up the greatest part of the space which lies between the
Wall and the Houses of the City, whereby the Wall is so secured, as it cannot
easily be shot through, nor beaten down by the Cannon.

There are besides in the Walls themselves diverse Bastions of several forms and
greatness; which bearing out beyond the right line of the Wall in certain fit
places, are very proper to disturb the Enemies Artillery, to keep the Enemy
aloof from the Wall, and for the safety of the Soldiers who stand thereupon to
defend the Town: The City was therefore thought to be strong enough, and safe
according to the custom of those times, and the then manner of fighting; and
the rather for the Count Carreto, who had the Government of that City, had
added several new works, the year before, to the old Fortifications, which made
it more defenceable. Moreover great ^tore of Artillery were carried thither,
and many expert Cannoniers. And the Garrison was not to be esteemed small, for
besides Horse, there were about 6000 Foot, what Spanish, what Dutch, what
Switzers, in the City; who were all commanded in chief by Mark Antonio Colonna,
who was now no longer a Commander under the Pope, but under Caesar; a man very
expert in Military Discipline, which he had learnt by being under Prospero, and
Fabritio Colonna, in the Wars, very Famous Comanders in those times. He was
very ambitious of glory in War, more of which he would have won had he not been
given, according to the abuse of those times, too much to pillageing, and to
other barbarous and dishonorable deportments. He had been very diligent in
preparing all things fitting for defense, and having carefully, and with much
confidence, exhorted the Soldiers, and Citizens to stand upon their defense,
he expected an Assault.

Lautrech on the other side, divided his Army into two Camps; he pitched
himself, with his Foot and Horse, over against that part of the City, which
lies toward Mantua; and Trivulcio having past over the Adice, with his
Venetians, sat down with them opposite to that part of the Wall that looks
toward Vicenza. Both Camps began to play upon the Walls at one and the same
time, but with some difference of design; for Lautrech placed all the force of
his Artillery, against one only part, that he might make way for his men to
enter the City, and that the Enemy might not have leisure to repair the breach
made in the Walls by the violence of Cannon shot. But Trivultio having taken
more room to encamp himself, began to batter a larger place of the Wall, hoping
that when he should have thrown it all down, he might fight upon better
advantage; since the Enemy not knowing where the Assault would be given, must
consequently be employed in several places. Lautrech having observed that a
certain place, near the Gate commonly called della Calcina, was not very
strong, for there was there no other defense, but one ancient weak Tower, he
turned his Cannon upon it, and having quickly beaten it down, he commanded his
Soldiers to go presently to the wall; who being encouraged by their
Commanders, and egged on by the hopes of sacking so rich a City, went boldly
on, and making haste that they might soon get out of the danger of Cannon shot,
they came to handy blows with the Enemy, and a valiant fight was performed on
all sides. The French, to win praise and shun shame, strove to get to where the
Enemy were thickest, knowing that they fought in their Commanders fight; for
Monsieur de Lescu, Lautrech's brother looked on, and was a witness of each man's
Valor and Cowardliness. But the Spanish and Dutch Foot were full of
confidence, calling to mind their own Gallantrie, and what they had done
formerly, which made them the bolde^ against danger; for they were all Veteran
Soldiers, who had been pre^ent at all these wars of Italy. The Assault was
given, and sustained, with equal Valor. The Enemy brought many of their
Artillery into the vacant place where the Tower had stood, and where the
Combat was, and placeing them in some more eminent parts, played therewith
apace upon the French on the flank, and made much slaughter upon them. So as
having lost many of their men, they were forced to retreat unto the Camp. But
Trivultio, although he had already thrown down a good part of the Wall, and
that there was space enough for the Soldiers to have Assaulted the City,
forbore falling on; being aware that a great number of the defendants, having
well munited the place from whence they had repulst the French, were run
thither where they knew the greatest Effort was made to assist the weaker side;
wherereof Trivultio gave notice to Lautrech, and desired some men of him, that
he might the more safely attempt to take the City: But Lautrech, though he
might very well have done it, for the Venetians and French Camp were so joined
together by means of a very strong and safe Bridge which was made over the
Adice, as the one might assist the other, and though he had often promised to
send him assistance, yet he prolonged the time, and sent none; it was now 15
days since the Camp before the City, and the Enemy was reduced to great
extreamety, a great part of the Wall was thrown down, the Soldiers were weary
with fighting, great scarcity of Powder, and the Commanders, and Citizens
differed in their oppinions: All which things invited to make have, and yet the
business must be drawn out at length. This mean time news came to the Camp that
a strong band of Dutch Foot came speedily to relieve the Besieged, and that
they had already upon Articles taken the Castle della Chivsa, which they had
Assaulted at unawares, so as the way was open* for them to enter the City.
Lautrech was hereat more discouraged then he had reason to be, which made him
give over all thought of continuing the Siege; so as he seemed not to mind it
much now, and that measuring more according to opinion then reality, he was
solicitous of nothing but how to carry his Army quickly to a place of safety:
At which sudden change, and pernicious resolution, the Venetian Commissaries
being much perplexed, they went unto him, and did all they could to entreat and
to conjure him, by the loyalty he ought unto his King, and for his own honor,
that he would not too much undervalue his own Affairs, the reputation whereof
he ought to inhaunce as much as he could.

They told him that it was usual to report the Forces, of Enemies to be greater
then they were because the Authors of such News do invent ^^ny things
according as fear dictates unto them; but grant that all was to be believed,
that was reported; none affirmed that the Enemies Forces exceeded 7000 Foot,
and those with out any Millitary Discipline, and without any Warlike
preperations; that a more unworthy resolution, nor more prejudicial to their
honor, could not be taken, then to show unto the Enemy by raising of their
Camp, wherein there was above 20000 Soldiers, many renowned Commanderes,
gallant Horses both for Number and Worth, store of all things necessary, that
they did so fear so small a number of the Enemy, as at the very News of their
approach, they had retired themselves; so as they might with reason be thought
to be driven out of their Quarters, and to have given over all hopes of
Victory: And wherefore (said they) should we not think rather of sending out
our light Horse, followed by our fleetest Foot, to encounter and oppose the
Enemy? The business would not last long, nor would it be difficult; since those
men who had no experience in War, and were unprovided of all things, would
easily be put in disorder, and routed: And say they should prove so stout, as
to stand and make resistance; a little delay of succor, would make it come too
late, and do noe good, since if we do resolve to use our utmost power, the
City must needs yield, and fall into our hands, at the first or second Assault.

To these things Lautrech answered.

That he had not taken this resolution by chance, or moved thereunto by any
fear; but that he thought it fitting to do so, that he might in time provide
for the safety of those men who were opposed by two Armies of the Enemy, the
one within the City, the other upon the Mountains: That the Dutch Foot were
already gotten out of the straightest and most difficult ways, and that there
was no hopes to keep them off, since they were already Masters of the passes
that were naturaly strong: It was therefore to be considered, that if they
should send some few men against them it would be but in vain; and that the
nature of the places, the straight and Rocky ways would not permit them to
send many. That he had a care of the safety of that Army, which being divided
into two Camps, was thereby the weaker: So as if they should lessen the numbers
of their men by sending a great number to this action, they should not a little
endanger the main business; since several accidents might bereave our Camps
(which were divided by the River into two parts) of the means of
Interchangeably succouring one another, if they should be Assaulted by the
Enemy.

Lautrech standing thus firm to his first opinion, he commanded that the
Ensigns should be suddenly removed, wherein being followed by the other
Commanders, all the Army was brought to Albaredo; Commissary Paolo Gradinige,
and Giovan Paolo Manfrone being left with 800 Horse, and 2000 Foot to guard the
Bridge left if it should be broken, the Army might not know how to come by
victuals; but the Army having tarried there but a little while, went to Villa
Franca, where they took up their Quarters, and fortified themselves. They began
then to think upon the main business; but the advisers differing in their
opinions, nothing was concluded on.

This mean while Rocadolfo who commanded the Dutch Foot, our Army being gone,
and there being none to hinder him, entered into Verona; and having brought good
store of corn, wine, and cattle into the City, he tarried there some few days,
and leaving many of his sound men in the places of such as were weak and
wounded, fearing left his longer abode there might prove incommodious to the
City by reason of the scarcity of corn, he returned into Germany.

Our Soldiers, though they were removed from before the City, and though it
were in the depth of Winter, did not notwithstanding forbear to overrun all
the neighboring Country, to keep victuals from being brought to Verona.
Whereupon many slight Skirmishes were had, and chiefly by the Horse; for the
Enemy issuing out of the Town, endeavored to bring in some corn to amend the
scarcity thereof; and our men on the contrary going out of the camp, and
falling upon the Enemy as they were scattered abroad here and there, did seek
to keep them from so doing. In these Skirmishes Mercurio Bua and Babone Naldo
won great praise both for Man-like valor, and Military cunning; they left
nothing quiet nor safe for the Enemy in that Country; they were every where,
kept back victuals, and brought many of the Enemy Prisoners to the camp. The
Castle of Crouaria was at this time held by the Dutch (this is a very narrow
place, seated amidst the hardest passages of the Mountains upon a steep cliff,
from whence the River Adice is carried with a swift and violent course toward
Verona) which if our men could recover, that passage would easily be stopped, and
victuals hindered from being carried by the River into the City. Mercurio and
Babone were employed about this, who by their worth and diligence overcame the
craggedness of the ways, and the Forces of the Enemy; for setting upon the
Soldiers, who had the guard of the Castle, unexpectedly by night, they slew
them all, put all the rest to flight, forcing them to quit the Castle, and to
provide for their own safeties. This Castle being taken, a Garrison was put
thereinto, which did much incommodiate the Enemy, by keeping them from such
corn as was wont to be carried by the River. But nothing of great moment was
done in the camp, nor did they think of altering their Quarters; which made the
Venetian Commissaries complain yet more of Lautrech, for that by his means the
City of Verona was not yet taken: And that at this time when the Enemies
inconveniences persuaded them to return aga^n unto the Siege, the Army kept
loytering within the camp, as if nothing remained to be done. And truly as all
men wondered at these Proceedings, so there was not any one that commended them.
But Lautrech bade the Commissaries be of good cheer, and finding several
excuses for his delays, told them that all things sufficient should be had
whereby to put a good period to the War, and bade them believe constantly that
Verona should quickly return to the Venetians Dominion. Which words made the
Commissary suspect that he meant some other thing then what was then in hand;
for at that very time when the Army rise from before Verona, News was spread
abroad in the camp, that a Messenger was come to Lautrech from France, and that
having spoken with him in secret, Lautrech strove to keep his coming concealed
from the rest. The Commissaries did very much press him therefore, to acquaint
them with the reason of his counsel, and why so great an Army should be
maintained, without any necessity or hope; and which through excessive expense
weakened the Forces of the Commonwealth, which were always ready to serve the
French. The Senate being acquainted by their Commissaries with what had past in
the camp, were much perplexed, not knowing what course to take for the
advancement of their Affairs; they who but a little before were so rejoiced and
comforted for their good success at Brescia, began now to have new fears and
troubles since when they thought the War to be near an end, they saw reasons
arise of greater length and difficulties. And they were chiefly troubled to
think that the French, in whose assistance they had put their chiefest hopes,
should proceed with various and uncertain counsels; and perhaps, (as it was
then believed) wholly separate from the Commonwealths Interest.

Whilst these things were in agitation, Letters came from their Ambassador who
was in France, by which they were fully informed with all that had past at
Noion; for King Francis being desirous that the Venetians might have leisure to
advise well, would have them quickly acquainted with whatsoever had past till
then between him and the Archduke Charles: To the end that as soon as the
Commissioners of both parties should be come to Brussels, for the confirmation
of such things as had been treated of, they might find all doubts resolved. The
chief things treated of and resolved at this convention, were*

That the King of France and the Duke of Burgony (a name which Charles of
Austria took unto himself till this time) had by the means of their
Ambassadors contracted Friendship and Peace, and confirmed it by the tie of
Alliance; for King Charles had promised to give the Lady Renea, daughter to
King Lewis, to Charles for wife. In this Confederacy all the other Princes that
were friends to either party were included: On Charles his part Maximillian
Caesar was chiefly nominated, and the Commonwealth of Venice on the King of
France his behalf. But those that would be comprehended within this agreement,
were bound to declare their minds within two months space. The Emperor being
hereof advertised, promised to stand to what was agreed upon, provided that
peace might be established upon fair conditions; wherefore Brussels was
appointed for the place of convention, to treat more particularly of the
conditions of agreement; where Charles his Ambassadors and those of France
were to be, who should intercede as Moderators and freely Composers of the
business. One chief thing which they were to treat on, was how the Venetians
might by this agreement recover Verona; for it was evident, that as this
business had often times before disturbed the Treaty of peace, so if it should
not now be decided, all other Negotiations would be in vain; for the King of
France being mindful of the League which he had made with the Venetians, and
being desirous to keep his word, was resolved not to come to any agreement with
the Emperor, unless Verona were thereby first restored to the Venetians.
Wherefore as soon as the Assembly was met, this was the first proposition which
was taken in hand. Cesars Ambassadors demanded a great sum of money in
exchange for the restitution of Verona, and moreover the possession of some
other Towns which were formerly in that jurisdiction. It was farther added that
Caesar would not consign over that City into the hands of the Venetians; but
unto some of Charles his Ministers, in whose power after it had been six weeks,
the French might dispose of it as they should please.

Notice being given of all these things by the Ambassador of Venice, the
Senate was much perplexed and full of various thoughts. After so tedious and
troublesome a War nothing certainly could be more desirable then peace and
quiet. They knew that they had often hazarded the fortune of the Commonwealth,
that they were now to endeavor some case and amendment, to free them from the
necessity of continuing longer in War. Yet some men of more mature years, and
greater experience, thinking how great a change of things a short time was
often cause of, feared that (some time being by the agreement required for the
re-delivery of Verona) some accident might happen the mean while, whereby all
things being put in disorder, they might remain in the same troubles, and
peradventure be plunged into greater. This jealousy was much increased by the
knowledge of Maximillian his nature, and tricks which he had wont to use, which
if he should continue to do in this business, they feared left under the color
of Honor, by which he seemed desirous that Verona should be restored to the
Venetians by the hands of some others, and not by himself, he might plot a
greater mischief against them. For which doubt of theirs they seemed to have
the more reason, for that being contented to yield up another place of much
greater importance, he earnestly desired certain little Towns, from whence not
being able to reap any profit, they judged he might have a mind to keep the way
open in several parts, so as he might assault the States of the Commonwealth
when he should please. Many things were moved in the Senate, but nothing
concluded, because they generally desired to recover Verona, which they thought
they might effect better by force then by agreement. They ceased not
continually to solicit Lautrech not to wait for the receiving of that from
the Enemy, which he might take from them by force; for sure peace was not to be
hoped for but by Arms. If Caesar did really desire friendship with the French,
he would not stand so much upon the loss of Verona, but would covet their
Friendship though upon conditions more advantageous to them. The Senate would
therefore have the King of France acquainted with these doubts which made them
suspend their resolution; desiring him that he would so provide for the common
Affairs as became his wisdom and his singular love toward the Commonwealth;
and that he should take heed not to do any thing which might occasion greater
difficulties. As for them, they would willingly submit all things to his
pleasure if it should be needful so to do; assuring themselves that he would
have a great care of the Honor and safety of the Commonwealth.

The Assembly being this mean while met, there were many differences between
the French and Dutch, which grew to that height as Cesar's Ambassadors were
ready to depart from Brussels, leaving the business unperfect. These
differences were thought to be in a part occasioned by Cardinal Sedunense; for
this man who thought to acquire much glory by disturbing peace, finding a fit
occasion to provoke the Switzers, labored to undo whatsoever was formerly
agreed upon between them and the King of France. He went likewise to Henry King
of England, and sought by all means to incense that King yet more, who did
already sufficiently envy, and hate the King of France. Sedunense had
propounded unto himself to persuade both these Princes to join their Forces
with those of Caesar, or at least to promise him they would do so, to keep him
as he alleged from being necessitated to throw himself by headlong counsel
into the Friendship of the common Enemies; which could not be done without
prejudice and danger to them. The King of England and the Switzers being
wrought upon by these persuasions, they had sent their Embabassadors to the
Emperor to make him large promises, Insomuch as he, who seemed at first to be
well inclined to peace, began now to be otherwise affected, and to raise new
doubts, seeming sometimes to refuse, and sometimes again very much to desire
the same thing. But peace being finaly concluded between the French and the
Switzers (for the Inhabitants of some of those Cantons who were at first more
averse, and opposite to the King, being made more plyant by means of a great
sum of Money, which by the agreement was to be paid to each several Canton) did
afterward desire the Friendship of the French, as well as the rest, and did by
common consent confirm the League. Hence it was that Maximillian failing in
the hopes of their assistance, and knowing that he was able to do but little
of himself, did much desire friendship with the French, and Venetians; and
began to treat more calmely; yet the Venetians were so troubled at the slow
proceeedings of all things, as well concerning War as Peace (men's minds being
very changeable, and apt to believe every thing, when they are governed either
by consciousness or fear) as they suspected every thing. Sometimes they much
doubted the Catholic King (which name Charles of Austria being already gone
into Spain, begun to take unto himself) though it was likely that he being a
new Prince and environed with many difficulties, should rather desire Peace,
then War in Italy. Sometimes they would not stick to be jealous of the very
French; to whom they had wont to commit all their Affairs. firmly resolving to
keep perpetual friendship with them. Whilst the Venetians were full of these
doubts, and fears, the treaty of Peace was concluded at Brussels; for King
Francis finding the difficulties did daily increase, made friendship with Caesar
upon condition, that he should likewise make peace with the Venetians; and that
there should be a suspention of Arms between them, and him, for the space of
eight months; to the end that the mean while such particulars whereby a firm
peace might be settled between them for the future, might be more commodiously
treated of. Farncis, King of Farnce, and Charles, King of Spain, were to be
Judges, and Arbitrators, to examine, and decide all difficulties; who were to
meet together within the space of two months, to negotiate these things, and
many others, appertaining to their own particular States: Charles was to come
to Cambrai, and Francis to St. Quintans, within the time appointed, where they
were afterward to make choice of some convenient place between these two
Towns, for them both to meet in.

But before all other things, it was established that the Towns of the
Venetians which were in Caesar 's possession, should be restored unto them,
Caesar being by particular agreement bound to put the City of Verona presently
into the hands of the Catholic King, and to take away the Garrison, and after
six weeks the French were to receive the same, that they might deliver it unto
the Venetians. But as soon as Verona should be delivered up into the hands of
the Catholic King, or his Ministers, the French and Venetians were to remove
all their men both from the City and from the Territories of Verona; that the
City should not be munited the mean while, neither with new works, nor
victuals; The Soldiers were to abstain from all injuries both in the City, and
Country: The Dutch were likewise to quit the Territories of Verona and all the
Towns that were therein except Riva, and Roveredo, which though they did
formerly belong to those Confines, should notwithstanding be in the Emperors
Jurisdiction: For the present both Caesar and the Venetians were to keep
possession of such Towns as were now possessed of in Friuli. The Soldiers of
the Garrison which were in Verona, were to be permitted to return quickly to
their own homes; and to carry all their goods along with them; and moreover
200000 Ducats were to be paid to Caesar, at three payments, within the space of
one year, for the expense he had been at in the War, the one half whereof was
to be disburst by the French, the other half by the Venetians.

All things being thus agreed upon between Caesar and the King of France,
Lautrech was to see them executed, who was particularly informed of all things
that had past at Brussels. The Venetians moved thereunto by the irksomness, and
inconveniences of so long a War; as also out of a desire to please the King of
France, whom they had clearly found to be well minded toward them, did by
approbation of the Senate approve of all that he had done, and promised to
stand to the agreement that the Town of Riva and Roveredo did of right belong
to them, and had been under the power of the Commonwealth for above 100 years,
yet to satisfy the King they were content that they should remain in the hands
of Maximillian. The Bishop of Trent was then sent to Verona, to receive that
City from the Emperors Ministers, in the name of Catholic King; but at his
first meeting with Lautrech, out of a difference in opinion that arose between
them, all things went topsie turvy; the Bishop would have it, that the time of
restoreing that City should begin from the day that it was delivered up to him,
and not before.

Lautrech counting the six weeks from the time that the agreement was made at
Brussels, said that the time prefixed was already at an end, and therefore
demanded that the City should be presently delivered up to him. Thus the
business being left undecided, they departed. But when the Bishop returned to
Verona, the Soldiers seeing there was no provision made for their pay, and
that the business drew out into length, began to mutiny, and threatened the
Bishop as the Author of these difficulties.

The Imperialists were therefore content that the City should be immediately
deliv^r'd over unto the French, to the end that receiving the moneys which by
agreement was to be paid unto them by them and the Venetians, the Soldiers
might be pacified. Wherefore meeting together again at the Town called Dosso
Cuono, and Lautrech having given in security to pay the aforesaid moneys, the
Bishop promised that the Town should be delivered up unto him the next Tuesday,
which was the 23 day of January. Things being thus ordered, the Citizens of
Verona lent Nicolo di Cavalli and Leonardo Lisco, Doctors of the civil Law, to
congratulate with Lautrech, and the Venetian Commissaries: Who, accompanied
with 400 select Curassiers, and 2000 Foot entered the City the next day, and
were met with unspeakable joy by all the people, and with such a concourse of
men of all conditions, and of all ages, as they could hardly pass through the
Streets; and being come to the cathedral Church, had much ado to get in at the
Gates. Here Lautrech having received the Keys of the City from the Bishop of
Trent, did at the same instant give them into the hands of the Venetian
Commissaries, Andrea Gritti, and Giovan Paolo Gradinigo. Then some of the
chiefest of the Citizens did together with the Commissaries, and in the name of
all the rest, congratulate the return of that City to under the command of the
Commonwealth; attesting the Citizens constant good will toward her, and
promising Loyalty and Obedience thereunto at all times.

These things being ended, and the French assistance being to be dismis'd, the
Senate, that they might not omit to show their respects and love to so gallant
a man, and one who had deserved so well of the Commonwealth, as Lautrech
resolved to present him honorably in the name of the public, and charged
Commissary Gritti to wait upon him to Millan. When he came to Lodi, he found
Giovan Giacopo Trivulcio there, who was come to meet him, and to bring him the
Order of St Mihel from the King. Then after the passing of many complements on
both sides, Gritti left him; who according to orders received from the Senate
went to visit the other Cities belonging to the Commonwealth, to provide for
all things necessary for them, and to confirm the people in their love to the
Commonwealth.

And at last, after having for so many years performed his faithful service
with much applause to the Commonwealth, having won much love amongst the
Citizens, and glory amongst Foreigners, he returned to Venice. Great joy and
general Feastings was had throughout the whole City: Every thing seemed to
smile, and to echo forth joyful acclamations. But chiefly all due praises were
rendered to God, and solemn processions devoutly made by public Decree for many
days; thanks being given to God for his great goodness in having granted them a
desired peace, after so long and troublesome a War. Great alms were given to
Monastries and to Alms houses, and such Citizens, and Foreigners as had served
the Commonwealth faithfully were well rewarded.

The Commonwealth being thus restored to her pristine greatness, after having
suffered so many Calamities, and the Affairs of Italy being put (as it was
thought) into a firm and settled condition, the Venetians hoped they had been
freed from all Fears for many years.

THe ensuing years contain more prosperous successes, and will afford me more
delightful matter to write on. Wherefore I hasten thereunto, as abhorring the
memory of the past calamities; and as weary as if I had had a part in those
troubles and dangers. The Commonwealth after the past Wars, enjoyed three
years quiet, in which time being healed of her so great labor and grievous
adversity, she began to hold up her head again; and to resume her ancient power
and reputation. The Wars therefore which we now shall write of, made by the
Commonwealth on Terra firma, though they be no less remarkable for the
Grandetsa of Princes, for famous Commanders, Forces, length of time, and other
circumstances, yet were they more prosperous, and of less danger; the
Commonwealth having taken up Wars for the space of almost ten years, no less
to defend the Affairs of her friends and confederates, then her own; and more
for glory then safety.

In the beginning of the year 1517. all Truces being solemnly published, as you
have heard in the former Book, and all men hoping that secure peace would
assuredly ensue, all the Cities on Terra firma, which before the late War were
under the Dominion of the Commonwealth, were returned to her obedience, and
sent their Deputies to Venice to congratulate with the Senate, that Arms were
laid down with Honor, and the State recovered: And they did also willingly
offer all their means, forces, and fortunes, to be at the Commonwealths
service. The Senates first and chiefest care was, to ease the City of Venice,
and all the other Cit^es and Castles on Terra firma of many grievances, which
were imposed upon them in the more troublesome times of War, by reason of the
scarcity of public moneys; to the end that private men's means being restored
unto them in the time of peace, they might be the readier to assist the
Commonwealth at another time of need. It was likewise provided that the places
of Magistracy, as well of the whole State as City which were formerly granted
upon certain loans of money to the public, should be disposed of without any
such loan, consideration being had to every man's worth and merit; and likewise
that all such as did serve the Commonwealth in any place, should be paid their
full stipend; part whereof was formerly made bold with for the greater
occasions of War. Nor were such things forgot as tended to the convenience or
splendour of the Commonwealth. Study was renewed in the City of Padua, which
had been given over for the space of eight years, and many famous men in all
sorts of learning were brought thither. This University* famous throughout the
world for the excellency of all learning, for the number and quality of
Professors, and for the abundance of Scholars, was a great adornment to the
Commonwealth; and a great convenience for all other Nations; for to this place
came many from all Countries, to be instructed in the learned Arts.

But the pleasantness of peace, had not made them forget the occurences of War,
nor lessened their care in things belonging to the preservation of the State.
The wise Senate thought that whilst their thoughts were not employed elsewhere,
it became them in wisdom to provide for such things, which being ordered and
disposed of in peaceful times, do either keep the storms of War far off, or if
they shall happen, make the State the stronger, and more able to resist them.
They were chiefly careful in seeing Padua, and Verona well munited, the
soundest foundations of their Empire on Terra firma. The Senate spared
therefore neither for cost nor labor, to make these very strong Fortresses; to
the end that for the future, the Enemy despairing to win them, might not think
of assaulting them. Andrea Gritti and Georgio Cornaro were appointed to take
the care hereof; who going to those Cities, were, with the advice of Trivulcio,
and the other prime men of the Militia, to deliberate, and do whatsoever should
be requisite for the exact and secure defense thereof. Many things were there
renewed, which had been destroyed by the War; and many new works were added:
Great Bastions were built in several places of the Wall, according to the
modern ^ashion. Many noble Gates were also made, not only for safety and
convenience, but even for ornament. And certainly if we shall justly consider
with what Grandezza, what illustrious show, and what regal expense these strong
holds were in these times built by the Commonwealth, we shall find that the
Venetians ought to be as much admired for the magnificence and stateliness of
these, as were the ancient Romans for their hot Baths, and Aquiducts, and other
rare Fabrics. And because the friendship and sa^e commerce with the Ottoman
Empire was of great importance for the preservation of the peace and quiet of
that City by means of Traffic, the Senate chose two Ambassadors Luigi
Mocenice, and Bartholomeo Contarini, to send to Selino to congratulate the
victories which he had won; who inflamed with the glory of War, after his
prosperous success in Persia, had assaulted the Empire of the Mamalucchi with a
puissant Army, and overcome in Battle Campsone Gauro King of Memphis, had
chased and routed his Forces, and subjugated great and rich Provinces which had
been long under the Empire of the Soldans of the Mamalucchi; whereby he had
much enlarged his confines. Therefore his friendships was for these respects
much the more to be desired; h^s power being so much increased and become
formidable, and since the Venetian Merchants exercised great Traffic in those
Countries which he had lately won. To this was likewise added, that the
pretentions of a certain Tribute paid by the King of Cyprus to the King o^
Egypt, for which the Commonwealth paid 8000 Ducats yearly to the Soldans of
Caire, as the Lusinian Kings had wont formerly to do, were now together with
the Empire of the Mamalucky past over to the Ottoman Princes. These
Ambassadors sailed therefore first to Cyprus, and from thence went to
Damascus, where Selino wintered with all his Army. Their commission was chiefly
to endeavor,

That the Venetians, who by reason of their merchandising, had w^nt to keep in
Alexandria, Tripoli, Baruti, Damascus, and other places of Merchandise in those
Regions, might enjoy the same rights and privileges which had been long
granted them by the Lords of Egypt and Soria: And that the Commonwealth might
likewise be permitted to keep her Magistrates in those places, with the same
authority and dignity as they had done formerly, who were to have a care of the
Venetian Merchants Goods and Persons.

These things were easily granted by Selinus, who having at this time turned
his thoughts, and forces elsewhere, desired friendship with the Venetians, and
in the beginning of his new Empire to increase traffic in that Province; for
his own particular good, for the convenience of his subjects, and for the
Interest of the public Revenue. They were at the same time likewise to treat
of the like Affairs with Charles King of Spain; to wit, that the commerce and
traffic which had been long before held in his Kingdoms and States might be
confirmed; and that also the Venetians might be suffered to go into those
parts, and to contract Merchandise, as they had always been allowed to do in
King Ferdinands time: Wherein it seemed there was now some interruption; for
Charles his Officers, he being but newly come unto his Kingdoms, had persuaded
him, that he might easily, and much to the advantage of his customs, tranfer
all the merchandising which was had in diverse Maritime Cities of Africa, into
the sole City of Oran; which was in Charles his possession, if the Venetian
Vessels which were wont first to touch there, and then to pass into the Spanish
Rivers, should be forbidden to enter upon any such occasion into the Havens of
his Dominion, when they had tarried to contract any Merchandise in any of the
Moors Cities. By which prohibition it was hoped that those Inhabitants might
be necessitated to come to Oran; and to furnish themselves there with diverse
sorts of Merchandise, which cannot be brought them from elsewhere; many whereof
they keep for their own use, and make much advantage by carrying many others to
the Ethiopians. Moreover the Spaniards had laid new Imposts upon our Merchants;
for whereas formerly one only tax of ten in the hundred, and that only of such
things as were exported, was wont to be paid, now two tenths of all things, as
well imported as exported were exacted, and that according to a price limited
by them. But the business was much otherwise then the Spanish Ministers
represented them; for neither would the Moors have thought they could
traffic securely in those Towns which belonged to the Spaniards, whom they
held to be their bitter and perpetual Enemies; neither would the Venetians have
run the hazard of so long navigation, if their profit should have been so much
lessened by new impositions; and if they should not have been permitted to
merchandise with the Moors, and make their best advantage in all places.
Wherefore experience soon showed that the Spaniards were much prejudiced, and
did quite lose that Traffic, by which they thought to have increased their
public Revenues. And since so fair an occasion is now offered, I think it may
stand with my intended purpose, who have undertaken to record to memory the
Venetian Affairs, that I ^ay something of their Maritime Negotiations, to the
end that the chief reason of that Cities wealth may be the better known. The
ancient Founders of this City, and their Lawmakers, took special care that the
C^tizens should exercise themselves in Voyages, and Traffic at Sea, and that
they might by their industry endeavor to increase the riches both of the
private and of the public; and at the same time make the name of the
Venetians famously known to far distant countries. The situation of the City
did invite to this manner of life, and exercise, and did almost of it felf
adm^nister such thoughts to the Inhabitants; for the City not having any
Territories of her own by land, by the fertillity whereof, or by man's
diligence, she might enrich herself; nay, wanting such things as were necessary
to maintain life, they were first necessitated to exercise their industry, and
afterward got abundance of all things. The ancient custom was to sail with
great Galleys, built for Merchandise, into many Countries both Christian and
Pagan; and to bring many things from thence which might not only serve for the
use of their Citizens, but might be sent into foreign Nations, and great gain
might be made thereby. Many of the young Nobility had wont to go in these
Galleys, as well to practice Merchandising, as to learn the Art of Sailing, and
the knowledge of Maritime Affairs. Others of them continued many years in
Foreign Nations, and almost in all those places wherein they did traffic, to
deal for themselves, and for others: So as hereby they did not only acquire
riches, but experience in many Affairs; and that being to be employed in the
Government of the Commonwealth at their return, they might not appear rude or
unexpert in managing public employments. Hence it was likewise that
frugality, modesty, all goodness, and the like, were better observed in that
City, wherein the youth being employed in honest exercises, were not corrupted
by idleness, and all that first age was void of Law-sutes, and ambition. The
wise Authors of these good orders knew very well that the desire of honor and
power did imprint it self early in our souls; and that as our age increases,
it gets to such a growth as it finds no bounds, and does sometimes grow
immoderate, and plots things prejudicial to the State: And that in idleness
youth grows effeminate; and that those are sooner corrupted by evil customs,
who never parting from home, spend their lives in abundance of all domestical
Affairs. But that we may not digress too much from our first purpose, we will
reassume our discourse where we left. The voyages made by our aforesaid
Galleys, that were commonly called Galleys of traffic, were these. When they
put from Venice, their first voyage was to Taragosa, in the Island of Sicely;
from thence they went to Tripoli, in Africa; then touching at the Island of
Gherbe le Sirte, to Tanis: Here they turned their course toward the Kingdom of
Tremisine, making their chief abode at Tusen and Mega, which now are called
O^a, and Oran, as in the fittest and most frequented places of those Regions.
Lastly, they went to diverse Towns in the Kingdom of Morocco, called in their
language Fez, to Bedis of Gomiera; and having already touched all the Havens of
Barbary, which were anciently termed Mauritania, and Numidia, they went to
Spain, traffiquing in Almeria, anciently called Abdara; from thence to Maligo,
Vallence, and Forora. But they did not use the same traffic in all places;
for they carried many sorts of Metals, and much linen cloth from Venice to
the Moors of Africa; to buy the which the Moors came at a certain time of the
year to the aforesaid places, bringing much gold with them. Then passing with
this gold into the Rivers of Spain, they bought there diverse sorts of
Merchandise, as silk, wool, grain, and other things which that Country
produces, and all these they brought to Venice. This Navigation, which was
long used by the Venetians, and was of great advantage to them, began to be
disturbed by the reasons we have before spoken of; and diverse accidents
supervening afterward, the State of Affairs being altered, it is wholly given
over and lost. But let us now reassume our interrupted Narration.

A good part of the time of Truce was now past, and the year 1518 began,
wherefore it behoved them to come to a new agreement with Ma^imillian. The Pope
endeavored as he had often formerly done, that this business might be
transacted at Rome; but the Venetians confiding more in the King of France,
desired that it might be handled at his Court, whither Caesar was to send his
Ambassadors with authority to assent unto, and to observe what should be
agreed upon. The Treaty was begun by the procurement of the most Christian
King, but things could not be brought to a settled composure; for the Venetians
wearied with so long War, and no less cloyed with Maximillians dubious and
suspicious counsels, cared little for any other agreement save such whereby
they might be put into an assured condition of peace and quiet. But the
Emperor, according to his accustomed and natural inconstancy, that he might
always have a loop hole for new designs, as also hoping to get a greater sum of
money from the Venetians by these frequent agreements, propounded a treaty
rather of Truce then of Peace. At this very time Pope Leo was very earnest in
procuring an universal Truce, whereby all Christian Princes might lay down
their Arms, to the end that true amity and sincere peace ensuing, they might by
a general consent establish and conclude a powerful and firm League against
Selino; for the Ottoman Empire being so mightily increased both in State and
Power by the acquisition of Egypt and Soria, it was evident that great
mischiefs were threatened to all Christendom by a powerful Enemy. The same
immoderate desire of Reign which had made Selino wage War with the Soldans of
the Mamul^ccchi, would always be the like in him, toward all Christian
Princes. Therefore mature care ought to be had, that the Turk might not arrive
at such greatness, as that without any impediment or gainsaying* he might
hereafter make all other Provinces subject, and Tributaries to him.

These things being thus represented to the Venetians in the Popes name, and
many principal Prelates of the Court of Rome being sent to all the Princes of
Christendom to the same end, were a great means of moving the Senate to agree
with Caesar touching a new Truce; since greater and longer difficulties appeared
to be in the establishing of a Peace: To the end that they might not be thought
to disturb so great a good to all Christendom, out of any particular respects
unto themselves. But as for the motion which was particularly made unto them by
Leo of making War against the Turks; they answered, when things should be
hopefully begun, and that they should be prosecuted with like fervor, the
State of Venice would be readier then any others for such an Enterprise; nor
would they at any time be wanting unto themselves, to whom they knew the care
of these common dangers did more particularly belong, as being most concerned
therein: Nor would they be backward in the good of all Christendom, nor in
obeying the Popes pious and earnest entreaties. But that notwithstanding by
reason of the condition of their State by Sea, which was every where environed
by the confines of this powerful Enemy; and not being able with their much
weaker Forces to withstand the first Onset of the Turks, nor to sustain the War
in their own Territories, before the Ottoman Empire should be assaulted by the
Armies and Fleets of the Confederates; they could not be the first in declaring
themselves Enemies to the Turks. But Truce with Caesar being treated of by
Antonio Iustiniano, who was Ambassador for the Commonwealth, with the King of
France, it was at last concluded upon these conditions.

That all Arms should be suspended for five years: And that people might live
peaceably in either State, without either doing or receiving any injury. That
it might be lawful for Cesars and the Commonwealths Subjects to travel and
traffic safely in each others Country, as in time of Peace. That each of them
should keep such Towns as they were now possessed of; that all Prisoners of War
should be released, except Christopher Frangipane, who was to be sent into
France to be kept there; that during the time of the Truce the Venetians should
pay Caesar 20000 Ducats yearly: And that the Venetians should pay the fourth
part of what they had got by the Revenues of such as had followed Cesars party,
to the former Owners.

And the differences concerning the confines being many, and hard to decide,
and chiefly in Friuli, they could not as then come to any determinate end;
Cesars Commissioners saying that they had no orders nor power to treat thereof;
but the settlement in this point, as in all other difficulties, was left to the
King of France, as to the Author of this agreement: Wherein he afterward
decreed; that the Emperor and the Venetians should choose Commissioners, who
meeting in Verona (whither he would likewise send one who should represent his
name and authority) should treat upon, and resolve the business of confines.
The State of Venice chose Francisco Pesaro for them, and acquainted the King of
France therewith; saying that they would be ready to send their Commissioner to
the place appointed, as soon as they should hear that Caesar was about to send
his. Whilst these things were a doing, the Emperor Maximillian fell sick and
dyed in the beginning of the year 1519.

Whereupon the Soldiers that were in Garrison at Gradisca and Marano, entering
licentiously into the confines of the Commonwealth, plundered many of the
Venetians Subjects Houses, and committed many other Hostile Acts; wherefore the
Senate write Letters to the Viccars of the Empire, telling them, that for their
parts, they would not violate the Truce, nor innovate any thing for
Maximillians death, provided that the Commanders and Soldiers of the Empire
should abstain from doing injuries: Which being by them praised and embraced
the Truce was afterward inviolably observed on all sides. Now they began to
treat of choosing the Emperor, whereunto Francis King of France, and Charles
King of Spain, did chiefly pretend, Princes of rare endowments of mind, and
very eminent for Fortune, but very formidable by reason of their great power.
The Princes of Italy were not a little troubled at this Election, considering
that whether of these two should be exalted to the Dignity of the Empire, when
they should have the reputation of the Empire added to the already potent
Forces of their own Kingdoms, and be made much greater then the other by the
help of Germany, he would endeavor to drive the other out of whatsoever he
possessed in Italy, and so this Counterpoise being taken away, they would at
last bend their thoughts upon making themselves Masters of all Italy; for
ambition does always increase in great Princes, together with new acquisitions
and the unquenchable thirst of Government grows greater. Therefore such an
Election could not but be bad for Italy. Yet ballancing all things well, it was
thought less dangerous for Italy that the King of France should be made
Emperor, then the King of Spain; for they considered that the former, as being
a Stranger, would be of much less power in Germany; and that the French Nation,
as it is very hot and violent at the first, so not being very constant to its
purposes, often times neglects and gives over those very things which it did
before so much desire, and endeavor; wherefore the French are commonly thought
better at getting, then at keeping* The Italians hoped that the Empire of the
French in Italy, though it were great, might by some accident decline, and at
last be extinguished. Which was not to be hoped for in the Spaniards; who when
they have once much enlarged their Dominions, and laid a good groundwork for
it, all labor and endeavor to drive them out would be but in vain. These were
the reasons which did chiefly move the Pope, and the Venetians to favor the
King of France in this his standing for the Empire. His Ambassadors which he
had sent to Rome and to Venice for this purpose, were therefore willingly
listened unto. But to boot with all this, Monsieur de Taligni, who was sent by
the King for this purpose to the State of Venice, made several other
propositions.

He desired the loan of a good sum of money, that his King when he should be
declared Emperor, might have wherewith to supply many gifts, and great
expenses which he was to be at; and moreover that the Venetians would forthwith
send some Soldiers into Germany, to secure the Electors from any violence: And
that the Senate would declare what was to be done, if Charles should enter
Italy with an Army (as it was given out he would do) to go to Rome, and force
the Pope to free him from the Oath, which he took from Julius the second, when
he was invested in the Kingdom of Naples (note that it was decreed by Pope
Urban, that whosoever should possess that Kingdom, should not take upon him the
Imperial Dignity) which was the chief reason why Leo used means to the
Electors, to keep Charles from being chosen Emperor. To which demands the
Senate answered, That the Commonwealth was so highly obliged to the King, as
that they wished him all prosperity; for they had always thought, that
whatsoever addition of State or Honor should befall the Kingdom of France,
would be of no small importance for their security; wherefore they would employ
all their endeavors and power for the aggrandizing of the King thereof; and
that though the public Exchequer was very much emptied by reason of the long
Wars, yet if need should require, they would overcome all dif^iculties, to
accommodate him with the sum of 100000 Ducats. But as for sending their Forces
beyond the Mountains, nothing could be of less use to the King, nor of more
prejudice and danger to themselves; for they should show a great will to do
harm, where they could do none. That all the strait and difficult passages, by
which their Soldiers were to pass into Germany, were possessed by the Dutch,
and well guarded and garrisoned by them. That as it would be very hard for
their men to pass over the Mountains, and to get into Germany, so it would be
easy for the Dutch to fall down from several parts into the Confines of the
Commonwealth, and put their Affairs into great confusion. But if that Charles,
being unprovoked by any injury, should come armed into Italy, and should
attempt to violate the sacred Majesty of the Pope of Rome, the Senate of Venice
would not differ from what their Ancestors had ever proved themselves to be; to
wit, DEFENDERS of the ECCLESIASTICAL LIBERTY and DIGNITY, which name of Honor
and true Glory was always held by them in high esteem, and should be preferred
before the Imperial greatness.

Whilst King Francis treated thus by his Ambassadors, Charles, who partly by
favor, making large promises to the Electors, partly by fear, having already
got many men together, had got the good will of the Electors, he was declared
King of the Romans. Almost at the same time, Soliman, only Son to Selino, his
Father being dead, possessed himself quietly of the Empire, and was put into
the Seat of the Ottoman Princes, without any contention. Only one Agazzelle a
Captain in Soria, proved contumacious, and a Rebel to the new Emperor; but his
Rebellion was soon suppressed, and all the Provinces of the Empire became
obedient to Soliman, in whom there appeared evident signs of an high and great
Spirit; so as being come to the Empire, there was no doubt but that he would
fly high, and plot great mischiefs against Christendom. Yet the Christ^an
Princes not minding so great a danger, whilst the want of experience in the
young Prince, their innate Enemy, might somewhat allay his power, having other
thoughts, suffered the greatness of the Ottoman Empire to increase and be
better established. Only Lodowick King of Hungary took up Arms, and endeavored
help from all parts, whose Kingdom was likely to partake first of the mischiefs
of War; for Soliman would not renew the Truce with Lodowick, which when it was
formerly offered him by his Father Selino, was by him refused, being thereunto
advised by the Emperor, and the King of Polonia, because Selino was then
busied in Wars far off, which was perhaps a generous, but no good counsel.
Lodowick sent therefore his Ambassadors to all Princes Courts, chiefly to Rome
and Venice, admonishing what danger others were in by his ruin.

To this the Venetians answered, that the Ottoman Empire was a good while since
grown very formidable to all men, but more particularly to their Commonwealth,
by reason of the neighborhood of their States: That for their parts, they had
never refused such invitations, but had often times both by words and example
excited other Princes to withstand the growing power of so great an Empire. But
what were they able of themselves to do?

They therefore chose Marco Minio for their Ambassador, whom they sent with
their acustomed presents to Constantinople, to confirm the Articles of peace
after the same manner as they were concluded a little before by Antonio
Iustiniano, as you have heard; adding thereunto those things which Selino after
his conquering of the Mamalucchies Empire, had lately promised to grant. To
wit, that the Venetian Merchants might enjoy the same priveledges, and
immunities in their goods, in Egypt, and in Soria, as they had anciently done.
Which Soliman was so ready to grant, as the Eastern Seas being then much
infected by Pirates, he offered to send out his Fleet against them if the
Commonwealth would do the like, to the end that the Seas might be kept open,
and that the Venetian Merchants might continue their trafique by Navigation
into Nations which were under the Ottoman Empire; of which his ready will, and
desire of peace and friendship, Soliman had given testimony, having at the same
time that Minio prepared to go for Constantinople, sent Acmat Ferrat on his
behalf to Venice, to acquaint them with his accession to the Empire, and that
he would continue those conventions and friendly offices with the
Commonwealth, as his Father Selino always had done.

This peace with the Turks was very opportunely made, to the yet unsettled
condition of Italy: and for the quieting of those suspicions which the Senators
were full of, the beginning of this year, by reason of News that was spread
abroad of a great Fleet that was to put forth from Constantinople; wherefore
the Senate not thinking it fit to be at the discretion of a barbarous Prince,
naturally ambitious, and grown insolent by new victories, had been very
diligent in furnishing all their Sea-Forts with great Garrisons, and added 50
Galleys to their Fleet, wherein the Commonwealth's chief hopes seemed then to
lie; and they made Andrea Gritti Captain General of the Navy: Moreover the
order of the Militia, of the men of that same Country, was instituted in the
Kingdom of Candia, as it was done some years before in the State by Terra
firma; to the end that upon any sudden occasion, the Garrisons of Cities in
Countries far off, and which it would be hard to succor speedily, might be
increased. The charge hereof was given to Gabriele Martiningo, who was honored
with the title of Governor of that Island. But these provisions proved
unnecessary for that occasion; for Selino had by his death, put a period to
these thoughts of War, and Soliman did readily confirm the Articles of peace,
as has been said; wherefore the Venetian Fleet, the other dangers being
removed, went into the Seas of Barbary, which were infested with many Pirates to
secure their great Galleys, which Sailed through these Seas not without great
danger of Pirates; by the taking of many of whose ships, the Sea was much
cleansed, and the way was opened for those Voyages.

Thus did the Venetians temporize with the Turks, and kept friendship with
them, since there appeared no hopes of overcoming them: For that the Christian
Princes kept still at en^ity within themselves, little minding the much greater
common danger. The King of France being greatly scandalized at the con^erment
of the Empire upon Charles of Austria; and fearing least his Forces and
Authority being so much increased, he would suddenly fall into Italy, and
bereave him of the State of Millan; had signified to the Pope, and to the
Venetians, that their States would be in great danger, if the new Emperor
might be permitted to pass Armed into Italy; he therefore propounded that a
firm League and good Intelligence, might be established between them three,
whereby each of them should be bound to defend the Honor, and Territories of
the rest, against whosoever should go about to injure them, and particularly to
oppose Charles his Forces, if he should come with an Army to Rome, to take upon
him the Emperial Crown, as it was thought he intended; which could not be done
without much danger to whosoever had any State in Italy, as well by reason of
all Emperors ancient pretenses, as for what was discovered to be in the mind
of this new Caesar. The King of France did so much apprehend this, as he
persuaded the Pope to send Charles the Crown of the Empire, by way of Bull,
before he should be resolved to come into Italy; which being better examined by
the Venetians, was found to be rather prejudicial then good for the common
Interest; for this would not have been sufficient to have altered Cesar's
desire; that indeed was not to take upon him the Ensigns of the Empire, but to
get more Territories in Italy. The Venetians readily assented to the
proposition made by the King of France of a new confederacy, having the same
fear, and the same desire to secure themselves from Cesar's getting farther
footing into Italy: And these were increased by the mischiefs they suffered in
the late years, by being of themselves to resist the Forces of so many Princes.
They therefore said that as it had always been their firm and constant
resolution never to part from the friendship of the Crown of France, so upon
this occasion they were to set the higher value upon it; as that by which they
might recieve the greater advantage; wherefore they would still adhere to his
counsels. But the Pope being irresolute, was assaulted by variety of reasons,
and diversity of affections; for he thought himself not safe from the fear of
Cesar's Forces, without the favor and friendship of the King of France, having
manifestly opposed his Election, by showing his incapability of receiving the
dignity of Emperor, he having sworn at his being invested into the Kingdom of
Naples, that he would never endeavor it, nor accept of it; of which Oath the
Pope had not as yet freed him.

On the other side, the Diet at Worms being intimated, wherein Martin Luther's
doctrine was to be treated of; not only concerning the Tenets of faith, but
even of the Popes authority, Leo thought it imported much upon this occasion,
to keep Charles his friend, at least, not to incense him with new Leagues, lest
he might become less diligent in proceeding against Luther, and in condemning
his Ten^yts, whereby his authority might increase, to the great disparagement
of the church of Rome. The Pope was likewise much troubled, that the reputation
and power of the French should be increased, whereby they might be confirmed in
their possession of the State of Milan: Proceeding therefore slowly, and
irresolutely, he seemed desirous to join with the King of France, and with the
Venetians, in defense of the common cause* but when the business drew to a
conclusion, he would not yield that any agreement should be made in writing,
saying, That it was not good to exp^se themselves to danger by writing, whereby
the business, wherein secrecy was chiefly required, might the more easily be
made known: That the words of Princes, to do what was agreed upon between them,
might su^^ice. The business drawing thus out at length, and the King of France
growing with time somewhat more cool in his former fervency, the Venetians began
to grow jealous, lest he might hold some secret intelligence with the Emperor,
which might be the chief cause of the Pope's irresoluteness, and of the so long
delay in confirming the things agreed upon. This suspicion was fomented by many
things; as the certain knowledge that Monsignor di Chiures, a Spaniard, was
gone from Cesars Court into France, to agree of an Interview with the King of
France, as was by them given forth; and that in this Interview, the Peace
should be confirmed which was made some months before between the King of
France, and the King of England; wherein Charles being named as one of the chief
contractors, he had not as yet ratified it. Moreover, the articles wherewith
the King said he had dispatched away Monsieur di St Marscho from France, were
kept very secret, when he was come to Rome; and also the said St Marscho
departed from Rome, before the League was established, when there was most need
of his presence for the consummation thereof, and left none with the Pope in
the King's behalf, but Alberto Carpi, who was so grievously sick, as he was not
fit for any negotiation: These were things which argued strongly that the King
had altered his mind: Yet the Venetians continuing their former resolution, of
not foregoing the friendship of the French, acquainted the King with this their
jealousy, but did not seem any way to resent it, nor to alter their
resolution: Nay, they said, they did assure themselves, that if the King had an
intention to make any new confederacy with Caesar, their Commonwealth should be
mentioned and comprehended in the agreement, whatsoever it should be; so as
whatsoever differences they had had with Maximilian, should now be accommodated
with Charles, and all occasions of new troubles should be laid aside.

But on the other side, Charles, when he was declared King of the Romans, having
peradventure his thoughts bent upon the affairs of Italy, as has been said,
and knowing it would become him chiefly to hold fair with the Venetians, seemed
very desirous to agree those differences with them, which had been formerly
between the Commonwealth, and his predecessor Maximilian: and that his actions
might correspond with his words, he had sent his Commissioners to Verona, with
full power, not only to Treat of the things appertaining to the last Truce of
five years, but also to accomodate all those other particulars which in the
former agreement made two years ago, were not yet decided. Commissioners on all
sides being met, Francisco Pesaro for the Commonwealth, who was chosen many
months before for this employment, and four of the chief Counselors of
Ispruch in the Emperors behalf, to whom he had particularly committed the
business, and Iouanni Pino being likewise sent thither as Ambassador from the
King of France, who (as has been said) was made Arbytrator in the differences
which were by reason of the last Truce: The Venetians propounded that all Towns
which were taken in the last War, should be restored by both sides, and that
all things should return to their former condition* alleging, that only such
an agreement could put an end to all past differences, and bring a certain and
a long peace. But the Imperialists finding out sometime one difficulty, sometimes
an other, spun out the business, not concluding any thing, and sometimes making
new demands; as, That all such as had been banished from their Country by the
Venetians, should be thereunto restored; together with some other such like
things, whereof no mention had been made in the articles of Truce, and whereby
a firm agreement might be rather kept off then made. Some months being thus
spent in vain, Cesar's were sent for home by their fellow Counselors of
Ispruch: Yet at this very time the Ambassador of Venice had great hopes given
him at the Emperors Court, of a good issue of this business, promise being
made, that new Commissioners should be chosen, who should be sent with better
Instructions to Friuli, that being near the places of most important
differences, they might decide them the sooner, and with more ease. All Charles
his chiefest Ministers of State, showed that he had a great desire to live
neighbourly with the Venetians, and to make a firm peace with them; whereby it
was clearly seen, that Caesar desired friendship with the Venetians, and that he
cunningly prolonged the accommodation of differences with them, so to get them
to make a straiter League with him, and forgo their respects with the French,
whose friendship they seemed to value so highly, as he had but little hopes to
agree with them answerable to his need and designs, unless they were moved
thereunto out of some such necessity. But the Venetians replied, that they much
desired peace and quiet; that the institution of their Commonwealth had always
been such, and that they would use the same means; but that it became them in
honor to keep their plighted faith: wherefore they must profess clearly, that
they could not, nor would not do any thing, which might any ways cross their
League with the King of France.

But since I shall several times have occasion to discourse of things that past
between these two most famous Princes, both in this, and in other ages, and
with whom the Commonwealth had both War and Peace, and several Treaties of
things of very great importance; it will not be far from the purpose of this
our discourse, to know some thing of their natures and customs: for as they
were both of them very desirous of Empire and Glory, so they took several ways
to arrive at this their end. Charles was very wary, quick of foresight, mature
at deliberation, grave at business, wonderful patient, and much given to
perseverance; whereby he knew how to wait for time and opportunity, and to make
use of them to his best advantage. But Francis was of a magnanimous spirit,
which made him willingly embrace any thing whereby he might purchase the
applause of being generous, and honor in war; he desired to overcome his enemy
rather by true valor, then by advantages, and craft. His words and countenance
discovered his most inward thoughts: Caesar loved men that were wary and
warlike: his words were few, his thoughts deep, he was very ambitious, but not
very open therein; striving still to cloak his aspiring after greatness, under
the pretense of uprightness, and common Interest.

But Francis favored and embraced all such, and was very liberal unto them,
who were rare at any profession; he affected to be thought eloquent, affable,
civil, liberal, and was chiefly desirous of warlike glory: Neither did he
conceal this his desire, but discovered his will and thoughts by his words and
actions. These two Princes did at the same time, but by several ways, endeavor
friendship with the Commonwealth, that they might make use of her Forces in
their Affairs in Italy, in which businesses this year was spent, without coming
to any conclusion in any one thing.

In the beginning of the next year, which was the year 1520. the peace of Italy
began not only to be disturbed, but even Christendom in several parts to be
molested with great mischief and dangers: Which though they were foreseen by
all, none did seek to prevent; for Soliman, finding himself very prosperous,
and not willing to grow effeminate through idleness, nor to degenerate from the
Worth of his Ancestors, resolved to wage War, as it was formerly suspected, in
Hungary, hoping thereby to reap the greater glory, for that the fame of that
Nation was very great for War, and because though that Enterprise had several
times been undertaken by his Predecessors, it was not as yet brought to a good
end.

Therefore the year 1521. being begun, Soliman marched with a powerful Army
from Constantinople, himself in person into Hungary. At which great warlike
Preparations King Lodowick being much troubled, not finding himself able to
support so great a bulk of War, and the danger growing every day more apparent,
he did again by new Embassies solicit all Christian Princes to succor him in
the defense of his Kingdom, and therein befriend all Christendom. To this
purpose he sent Philip More, Bishop of Agria to Venice, who being brought
before the Duke and his Senators, spoke to this purpose.

My King, most Illustrious Prince, and you famous Senators, does so much
confide in your faith, humanity and power, in the strait conjunction which for
these many years has been between your Commonwealth, and his Crown, as that
for the common Interest of both States, for the Justice of his cause, and out
of the usual custom of your selves, and your Ancestors, you will favor what is
just, and assist him with your help, who in this eminent War of the Turks would
make his chief recourse to you, and communicate his Affairs, and Needs first to
you: Hoping not only to find you ready in your selves to do what you are able
for the defense of his Kingdom, but that by your power and intercession you
will apply your selves to other Princes, and facilitate their assisting of him;
and truly reason tells us that the first applications belong to this
Commonwealth, when opposition is to be made to the increasing of the Ottoman
Empire; for as her opportunity is great of troubling this Enemy, by the power
she has at Sea, so for the neighberhood of so many of her States, she ought to
covet the abasing of it, and to be careful that together with the ruin of
others, her own danger do not increase. Therefore if you my Lords will be the
first who shall move other Princes to take upon them the defense of the Kingdom
of Hungary, so as the courage of this new, and fiercely minded Emperor may be
allayed, who will leave nothing unattempted whereby he may hope to purchase
Glory and Empire, you will reap the fruit of real and true Honor, of great
safety, and of the increasing of your State. Consider Gentlemen to what an
height the Ottoman Family is risen of late years: And chiefly (if I may be
permitted to say so) through the negligence of Christian Princes; for meeting
with no obsticle, he marches on apace to Supreme Monarchy; if Constantines
entreaties and protestations had been listened unto when Mahomet assaulted
Constantinople, assuredly the Grecian Empire would not have been destroyed: Nor
would the like of the Mamalucchi have now fallen, if that had stood. These two
joined together did so counterpoise the Turkish Forces, as their safety would
have freed now the Kingdom of Hungary, and the rest of Christendom from danger.
He who shall well consider the progress of the ancient Monarchs, will find that
their chiefest difficulty lay in getting to such a pitch of power and force, as
no one Potentate could of himself alone give a just counterpoise to their
power. Other acquisitions have been the sooner, and more easily made by reason
of the almost insuperable difficulties which have been still met withal in
getting many Princes join in the destruction of one alone. The Romans spent
many years in conquering Italy, but being by the Conquest thereof made stronger
then the rest, they in a few years vanquished so many Princes, as they
subjugated the greatest and farthest distant Provinces. It is therefore
evident, that the longer Christians defer to oppose the Turks, they make the
danger the greater, and the remedy more difficult. I will not say that to take
upon them the defense of Hungary is a glorious thing for Christian Princes to
do, not that it is a duty which they owe to their Religion, to their
profession, not that it makes for every one of their Interests, but I will more
truly say it is necessary for the preservation of their States. This Kingdom
being lost, which has for so many years withstood the violence of the Turkish
Forces on this side, and retarded the course of their Victories, what remains
to keep them from overrunning Austria, from disturbing all Germany, and from
entering into the Confines of this your State? This very Kingdom, which has
hitherto been the great Bulwark to hinder their advancing, if this be lost
(which God forbid) it will be of great opportunity for them, to the subjugating
of other Nations, and to the ruinating of other Kingdoms. But this being
defended, as it is necessary it should be, so is it neither impossible, nor yet
very hard to withstand their farther progress, if Princes do not rather want
will then Forces. The Hungarian Nation by ancient custom, and almost by nature,
ha^h always been warlike, our Princes and our people have won great and
particular praise and honor in War; nor has my now King and Master, nor his
Subjects degenerated, nor are they to degenerate any whit from the Worth of
their Ancestors: They have minds, and for as much as is possible for men to
have, Forces ready to defend themselves. But alas how can one only Kingdom, not
very great, not very rich, find men, moneys, munition, and so many other
requisites for War, to withstand the numerous Turkish Armies, gathered together
out of so many Provinces? Marry if it be assisted and succored by other
Princes, the Kingdom of Hungaries Forces will not only be so increased, but
even the Honor and Courage thereof, as we no ways doubt to frustrate all the
Enemies designs made against us; nor will we refuse if occasion shall be
offered, to give him Battle in a pitched field, so to secure by our own dangers
(if God shall please to favor) as we are to hope he will, our pious and
generous boldness) not only of our own Country, but all the Kingdoms and
Provinces of Christendom for many years. But I find I have transgressed my
bounds by my too long speaking: I speak of things that are well known, and to
those that understand them better then I do. The sum of all is this. Our
Kingdom is one of the outwalls of Christendom, against the fury of the Turkish
Forces; Common safety, and common defense, ought to be provided for by common
Forces and Counsels: Your wisdom and piety makes you foresee, and consider
dangers, and your power and authority endows you with means to give a speedy
and opportune remedy thereunto.

The Ambassador was very attentively listened unto, whose speech made the
greater impression in all that heard him, because they were all very well
minded to the business, it was therefore resolved, that endeavors should be
made with all the Princes of Christendom, by means of the Commonwealths
Ambassadors, to make them all join with common consent and force, to assist the
Kingdom of Hungary, and to provide against such great dangers, to the which
they readily offered their best assistance, and the power of the whole
Commonwealth: But these Treaties wrought no better effect then they had
formerly done; so as the danger growing daily greater, and King Lodowick
thinking himself necessitated to fight the Turks, for the freeing of Belgrado,
a strong and important City, and the Frontire Town of that Kingdom, from the
fury of the Turks, before which the Turkish Army was already encamped, he sent
Iovan Statilio his Ambassador again to Venice, to borrow some moneys of the
Senate, by which he might increase his Forces, and put himself with better
hopes upon the fortune of Battle. The Commonwealth had formerly many times
furnished the King of Hungary with moneys, to assist him against the Turks; and
they thought themselves now more obliged to abbet that Kingdom out of the
particular strait conjunction which they held with King Lewis, and for that by
reason of the greatness of the Ottoman house, those respects were grown more
considerable, for which he had endeavored the preservation and prosperity of
that warlike Kingdom. The Senate therefore resolved to send thirty thousand
Ducats to King Lodowick, together with greater promises and offers, and not
concealing the friendship which they held with him, they ordered Lorenzo Orio,
who was their Ambassador in Hungary, to follow his Camp. Bet the King's forces
had ill success, Belgrado was lost, nor were the other Cities of the Kingdom
free from fear of the Turkish forces; for Soliman left his Artillery, and part
of his Militia in Hungary, intending to return thither (as he told the
Venetians by one of his Chiaus, whom he sent to Venice, to acquaint them with
this his victory) and subdue that Kingdom. At this time, to the great grief of
the whole City, Duke Loredano died, who had governed the Commonwealth very
prudently for the space of twenty years, and who encouraging others by his
invincible spirit, had overcome the malice of Fortune, and reduced the City to
a peaceable and quiet condition. He was of a great wit, and natural insight
into Affairs, and of much experience in the world; having spent his youth in
continual Navigations, and his riper years in managing the most important
Affairs of the Commonwealth, exerc^sing the chiefest places of Magistracy both
within the Commonwealth and abroad. He dyed being almost 90 years old, having
even till then had vivacity in his Intellectuals though his body was subject to
diverse infirmities. His Encomium was made by Andrea Navaghiero, and he was
buried with great pomp in St John and St Paul's Church. Antonio Grimani was
chosen to succeed him, a man famous for his wealth, and for the honors he had
attained to in the Commonwealth, and one who had often times tried both
prosperous and adverse fortune; and who was lately returned to his Country,
after having been many years banished, for that being General at Sea, he had
not made good use of occasion in fighting, and in overcoming the Turkish Fleet
at Lepanto. Grimani took upon him the place of Duke, the Commonwealth being
(as you have heard by what is past) in Peace and Tranquillity. But such seeds
of discords and war between Princes were already sown, as it was to be feared
they might bring forth new troubles in the Commonwealth, and perhaps
necessitate her to take up Arms again; for Caesar (who was already gone to
Aquisgrane in Germany, where he took upon him the first Crown of the Empire)
had still a great desire to come into Italy, wherefore he had often times
sollicicited the Venetian Senate to join with him; thinking that the Friendship
and Forces of the Commonwealth, would be of great importance for his designs.
Therefore amongst other things, he promised to invest them fully with all those
Towns and Territories which he then possessed, and unto which the Empire laid
any claim, or pretense; which the Venetians, who knew that by just title and
right they had long belonged to them, did little value; and therefore this was
of no greater force then his other promises, to make them alter their first
intentions. Wherefore they delayed sending to congratulate with him, according
to custom, for his acquired Dignity; and having chosen Francisco Contarini, for
their Leiger Ambassador, in the place of Gaspero Contarini, who had stayed at
that Court the usual prefixed time; lest they might give any the least
suspicion to the French, of their joining with Caesar in any undertaking, they
retarded his expedition. Wherefore Caesar dispairing to make the Venetians
forego their friendship with the French, he took a new resolution, which was to
send Monsi^ur Philiberto, Ambassador to the Court of France, with a resolute
intention, as he would have it believed, either to agree with the King of
France touching the Affairs of Italy, excluding the Venetians; or else that
they being jealous thereof, might at last be moved to join with him, so to shun
the greater evils which they had a little before had trial of, by the joining
of those two Crowns against the Common wealth. And that he might leave nothing
unattempted, he, by his Ambassador, who was then resident in England,
complained grievously to the King thereof, (whose Authority was then so great,
as he was made Arbitrator and Moderator of all the important businesses which
past amongst the Princes) accusing the Venetians, for that, not having observed
what they had promised in the Agreement made with Maximillian, they had refused
peace, when he had offered it them.

But the Princes did the less believe these things, for that Caesar, at that
same time that he seemed so much to desire peace, was known to prepare for war.
Therefore King Francis, acquainting with great sincerity the Venetians, with
this whole Treaty, would not listen to Cesars Proposals, but growing rather
every day more and more desirous, either to fall foul upon Cesars Territories,
or else to defend his own Dominions from being assaulted by him, he applied
himself to confirm his friends, thereby to increase his power and reputation:
he therefore spoke with the King of England, at Ardes, a Town in Picardie, to
confirm the peace made between them but a little before; and having a daughter
born unto him, he desired the Senate, that she might be held at the Font by
their Ambassador, and proceeded very civilly in all things with the
Commonwealth. But for all this, the League, which had been long treated of at
Rome, was not yet concluded: but the Articles being drawn up by common consent,
and the Venetians having sent sufficient Commissions to their Ambassador, then
resident at Rome, to ratify them, the Conclusion was deferred by reason of new
difficulties which arose: For the King of France, who was at first content that
the League should aim only at the peace and safety of Italy, to the which, the
other Italian Prince* being invited, there was place reserved for such as would
Confederate; to the end that they might join in the Common cause, made, now new
proposals, which aimed at other ends; moved thereunto, either out of new
desires, or out of some new occasion, seeing Caesar busied about many weighty
affairs; for there were many Commotions in many of the chiefest Cities of
Spain, which in a tumultuous manner sought to withdraw themselves from Charles
his Government; and constituting a popular Government, to enjoy Liberty, as
many Towns in Germany do: Besides, many of the Princes and people of Germany,
showed themselves to be but badly satisfied with the new Emperor, for diverse
of his actions; especially, for Martin Luther's being banished, by Imperial
Proclamation, at the Diet at Worms; so that, he had reason enough to be
troubled. Wherefore the King of France, thinking that those dangers were
sufficiently secured, which had first made him endeavor the League, being
little satisfied therewith (as humane minds, especially those of Princes,
disquieted with new longings, are easy to give way to new desires) he more
fervently coveted greater matters; thinking, that he had now a fitting
opportunity offered him, to oppose Cesar's greatness, which did already grow
too immoderate; and particularly, to drive him out of his Territories in Italy,
wherefore he made his forces move toward Navarre, to assist the King, and
repossessed him of his ancient States, which were formerly taken from him, by
King Ferdinando; and did little less then discover his intentions openly, in
the Treaty of League with the Pope and Venetians.

The Pope moved by these or by some more hidden reasons, he likewise being full
of new cogitations, began to propound new Articles in the conventions of the
League; desiring, that it might be specified, that all the Colleagues should be
bound to assist him, in punishing the Churches contumatious Subjects; whereby
it clearly appeared, that his ancient desire of driving Duke Alfonso d'Este out
of the Dominions of Ferara, was risen up in him again; which was nothing else,
but to kindle a great combustion in Italy: for the less able the Duke knew
himself to be, to resist the power of the Colleagues, by reason of his small
forces, and the little love his Subjects bore him, the more he should be
enforced to have recourse to Foreign aid for his defense, and to leave no
stone unturned.

The Venetians knowing that whereas they desired to procure quiet and safety,
both to themselves, and to all Italy, the way would, by these new Obligations,
be opened to new troubles, and to greater dangers; they began likewise to
proceed more slowly in concluding the Agreement: For they maturely considered,
that it made not for their good, wholly to break the Truce for five years,
confirmed by Caesar; and to anger the King of England, who they knew would not
be pleased with the new Confederacy; he having done many friendly offices to
the Emperor. Whilst the business of the League, for these Respects, was
delayed, and doubtful; it was known by a new, and unthought of Accident, which
did alter the whole course of affairs, and was cause of grievous and important
Tumults, that the Pope, after having showed so great a desire for the peace of
Italy, and after so many negotiations had with the French, to oppose such as
should go about to disturb it, had secretly agreed with the Emperor, to
assault the State of Millane, by their joint forces. All men, especially the
Venetians, did strangely wonder, and were very much confused, that the Pope, by
taking away the Counterpoise of the French Forces, should by his forces and
authority increase the Emperors power in Italy, which he himself had, but a
little before, made appear to be so suspicious and formidable to the Church,
and to all the Italian Princes; and that it ought to be suppressed, or at least
moderated. By the Pope's consent and counsel, several secret practices were
held by the Imperial^sts with those that were outlawed in Millane, whereof
there were many principal Noble men, of great attendance, and authority; that,
by their means, tumults should be unexspectedly raised, at one and the same
time, in several Cities, to drive out the French of Force, who feared nothing
less; whose Garrisons were already much lessned, and when Lautrech was absent,
who was gone a little before to France. But these consultations coming to the
knowledge of Monsieur di Lerce, brother to Lautrech, and to whom he had left
his Lieutenant in Italy, before the time was ripe, to put them in execution, he
speedily raised so many men as did suffice to suppress these Plots; and many of
the Outlawed being by him driven out of the State of Milan, where they had
secretly hid themselves, and fled to the City of Regio, where they were
received by him that was governor for the Pope, who, as has been said, was
conscious of what was formerly agreed on with Caesar, and knew all these
Designs. And these men being pursued by the French, even to the gates of Regio,
the Pope complained grievously, that the French, bea^ing so little respect to
his dignity and authority, and to the friendship which he held with the King of
France, should go to his Forts, and seek to use violence; anticipating by these
complaints, which were chiefly made to the Senate of Venice, those which were
rather to have been made by the King of France; that the Pope, contrary to the
agreement which was made between them, should suffer that his rebellious and
contumacious subjects, and who were Outlawed, should be received into the
Cities belonging to the Church, just when they sought to disturb his affairs.

But the Venetians being desirous (as much as in them lay) to appease these
tumults (for the Pope's more resolute will, and his confederacy made with
Caesar, though it were ratified by him, was not as yet publicly known)
labored to free the Pope of these suspicions; showing, that the proceedings of
the Kings of France, had always been such toward all Popes, and that upon
their knowledge, the now present King bore so great a respect to the affairs of
the Church, and such observance to this Pope's person, as a contrary opinion
was not now to be grounded upon so slight an occasion; nor ought so continued,
and so good an Intelligence betwixt that Kingdom and the Apostolic See be
broken upon such a cause: They therefore earnestly desired Leo, that before he
should settle in such an opinion, as might produce many pernicious effects, he
would be pleased to write to the King, to know his mind, and to be better
informed of what had happened. But it was in vain to persuade the Pope; who
though he seemed to put on new resolutions upon this new accident, had
notwithstanding, for certain established his agreement already with the
Emperor, wherein it was accorded,

That when the State of Milan should be recovered by their joint Forces, the
Cities of Parma and Piacenza should return to the Church, and all the rest of
the State of Milan should be assigned over unto Francesco Sforza: That the Pope
should forthwith absolve Charles of his oath, which he took at his being
invested into the Kingdom of Naples, that so he might with the better Title
hold the Empire.

All Treaties of agreement being then despaired of, the Venetians resolved to
be by no means failing to the obligations which they had to the King of France,
touching the preservation of the State of Milan. It was known that many
soldiers were assembled by order from the Pope and Emperor, to the end, that
since they succeeded not in their secret practices, they might forthwith betake
themselves to open force: To which purpose the Pope, though under other
pretenses, had already taken six thousand Switzers into pay, and Prospero
Colonna, who was declared Captain General of the Enterprise, went to Bologno to
raise a great many soldiers, and the Viceroy of Naples, with the Cavalry of
that Kingdom, and Marquis Pescara, with the Spanish Infantery, were come to the
banks of the River Tronto, to be ready to pass over upon the first occasion.
Wherefore the Venetians hasted to take six thousand Italian foot into pay, and
mustering all their Horse in Brescia, they ordered their Governor Theadoro
Trivulcio, to march with them to the banks of Ada; and that if the French
affairs should require it, he should pass over it. They likewise commanded
Paolo Nani, who was then Commander of Bergamo, that he should wait upon the
Governor, and follow the camp, executing the place of Commissary. This news
being this mean while come to France, Lautrech returned speedily into Italy,
began to provide for the succouring of the State of Milan in time, there not
being sufficient Garrisons there in it, to defend it, if it should be fallen
upon by a powerful Army: His chief care and diligence was, to keep the new
succor which the enemy expected (who had already about a thousand Curassiers,
and eight thousand foot) from joining with them. The Pope had lastly taken
three thousand more Switzers into pay; for half of his former number of them
were diminished: And at the same time, Ferdinand, brother to Charles, being come
to Villaco, to raise six thousand foot in those parts, prepared (as soon as his
number should be full to pass with them into Italy, for whom Caesar demanded
passage from the Venetians: They answeted, they could by no means satisfy him
in that his desire, by reason of the agreements which they had made with the
King of France; wherein to fail, was to falsify their words: But to be sure
that they should not enter against their wills, they gave order for the
stopping of all passages, and placed diligent Guards in them: And because there
were several Passes whereby the Dutch foot might fall down into the Territories
of Verona, and join with Colonna's men, so as it would be a difficult matter to
secure them all, by putting sufficient Garrisons into them, the Venetians were
minded to erect a Fort between Peschiera and Lonato, whereinto their Forces
being put, which were then eight hundred Curassiers, six hundred light Horse,
and six thousand Foot, they might hinder the enemy from advancing any further;
whatsoever way they should come; which it was thought they might easily do: for
those Dutch Foot had neither Horse nor Artillery with them, nor any warlike
tackling, whereby to force their passage. This advice was at first much
applauded by Lautrech, who affirmed, that he would come himself in person, with
his men, and join with the Venetian Army; confessing often, that this was the
securest way to defend the State of Milan; yet altering his mind not long
after, he desired the Venetians, that leaving the thought of hindering the
enemies passage, which he thought to be impossible, they would send their men
to join with the French in the Territories of Cremona: So the Venetians leaving
the Passes, Guarded the best they could by the people of the Country, ordered
Trivulcio to go with all his Horse and Foot toward Cremona; and for that
Lautrech desired that he might have some Venetian Gentleman with him, of
authority and experience, with whom he might advise what way that War was best
to be managed, the Senate sent forthwith Andrea Gritti to the Camp, continuing
Paolo Navi there still, to provide for all things necessary for the Army.
Ierolimo da Pesaro, was moreover chosen Commissary General on Terra Ferma, to
whom the care and custody of the Forts was particularly commended; where into
were put 2000 foot newly taken into pay, and some Curasiers to secure
themselves upon all occasions from danger. Moreover the Senate resolved at
Lautrech's entreaty, to take 3000 more Foot into pay; and gave willingly way
likewise to the contributeing of maintaining some Horse and Foot, with whom the
Duke of Ferrara promised to march in behalf of the French: To the end that the
King, and all men else, might acknowledge that nothing was wanting one their
side for the safeguard of the State of Milan, nor to the ready, and sincere
maintaining of the agreement which was made between them and the French.

But the French were more diligent in exhorting the Venetians to make good the
Articles of the confederacy, then to make requisite provisions themselves,
wherein they proceeded but slowly; which is very prejudicial to the essence of
War: For though Lautrech did continualy affirm that Monsieur di St Vallie^ was
to pass imediately over the Mountains with 6000 French Foot, and that 10000
Switzers being already raised by the King, would soon begin to march, yet they
were never seen to appear.

On the other side the Enemy, being already grown very strong, the Dutch Foot
being joined with them, passed safely into the Territories of Mantua, and from
thence to those of Millan; and knowing what advantage it was for them to make
have, they went to Besiege Parma, the taking whereof would be of much safety
and honor unto them. But Lautrech, who when he first saw them begin to move,
had some suspicion of the business, and had sent his brother Monsseur di Lescu
thither with a good Garrison; which did not, notwithstanding, keep the
Cesarians, and Ecclesiastic Commanders from pursuing their first intention,
hopeing to take it, since the Town was but weak of it self, and their Army very
strong: Which they had done, had not Lautrech, to whom a great recruit of men
was come from France, resolved to march nearer up to the Enemy with his whole
Army, by whose coming and because the Duke of Ferrara had raised a great many
Foot, theatning to Assault Modena, and Regio; Colonna was forced (as he himself
said afterward) to rise from before Parma: Which the Pope* was wonderfully
displeased at who in his joining with Caesar did chiefly covet the getting of
that Town. The bad success of this first enterprise begat (as it usualy happens
upon such like ocasions) no small jealousies between the confederates; for the
Pope complained of the Imperial Commanders, as if cunningly prolonging the
taking of Parma, they had taken an occasion to rise from thence to enforce him,
whom they knew to be so desirous of that place, to contribute readily to all
the expenses of the War. And on the other side the Emperor, finding the Pope
so ill satisfied, grew more confirmed in his former suspicion, that he would
either forsake him, when he should have achieved his end, in getting by the
confederacy all that belonged unto him; or else that failing that hope, and
being soon weary of the expense and danger of War, as also being naturaly given
to change in opinions, he might as easily forego his Friendship, as he had done
the like of the King of France. Therefore thinking it necessary, for the well
grounding of his designs, to draw the Venetians into the confederacy, because
the Pope, by reason of the Authority and Strength that they would add unto the
confederacy, would be more cautious in breaking it; and because the
Commonwealths Aids would be readier, and more constant then those of the
Church; he resolved to send Francisco Laus to Venice, to recide there as his
Ambassador: And by him he did again very much press the Venetians to join with
him and the Pope. Saying that this was the only way to that peace which he
desired no less then they; and that this was his intention might easily be
proved, by his ready condiscention to invest Francisco Sforza, Duke of Bari, in
the Dukedom of Milan, thereby to reduce the affairs of Italy to a peaceful
condition, when he might lay just claim thereunto. But the Senate, not altering
their first determination, partly because they thought Caesar would not be as
good as his word, partly calling to mind the last actions done by the French in
service of the Commonwealth; thought it stood not with their faith and honor
to abandon them, upon the first occasion of danger. The War went therefore on,
and more men were daily raised, as well in the French and Venetians Army, as in
that of the Emperors and Popes, by the coming of many Switzers to both Camps;
for Cardinal Sedunense went into Switzerland, where he took many of that Nation
into pay in the Popes name, who finding the opportunity of some Barks, passed
therein over the River Oglio, though the Venetians had endeavored by all means
possible to hinder their passage, and to guard the Banks, and so entered into
the Territories of Brescia, and not without great harm to the Country people,
got to the Emperors Army: And the 10000 Switzers which had been so long
expected, came at last to Lautrech. Thus both Armies being very strong, so as
they gave a just counterpoise one to the other, they did nothing for a good
while, but stood doubtful; till at last Colonna was the first that moved, to
pass over the River Ada, and marched toward Milan. Which when Lautrech heard
of, he resolved to depart immediately from the Territories of Cremona, where he
had tarried a good while, and marched toward Cassano, to hinder the Enemy from
passing over the River, but they preventing the Frenchmens design by their
speedy March, past the River safely between Riva and Cassano, and continued on
their March toward Millan: So as Lautrech failing of his first hopes, followed
the Enemy with more diligence, intending, if he conveniently could, to give him
Battle; b^^ Prospero who loved not much to hazard himself upon Fortune, kept
him from doing so; and Lautrech at last brought his Army into Milan, leaving
the Venetian Commissary with the Artillery, and part of his men at Lodi. The
rest whereof being led on by Trivulcio, entered Millan too. But Colonna thinking
that he might attempt Millan without much danger, came speedily to the Suburbs,
rather to try what he could do by an unexpected assault, then out of any hope
of good success. Advancing therefore a Band of select Soldiers, he assaulted
one of the Gates of the Suburbs after Sun set, when the Defendants did least
fear it, giving order that these should be readily succored by a greater
number, if the first assault should prove prosperous. Trivulcio had the guard
of this Gate with some companies of Venetian Foot, who (such Orders being given
as the shortness of time, and the unexpected action would permit) made stout
resistance, and advertised Lautrech of the sudden accident, and of what danger
he was in. But many Harquebusiers coming in to assist the Enemy, and no supply
coming to the Venetian Foot; for the Switzers being commanded by Lautrech to go
thither, would not stir; and the Guascons who were sent afterward in their
steed, came too late; Trivulcio was enforced to retreat with his Soldiers, and
to give way to a greater Force: So as the Imperialists entering the City, where
all things were full of fear and confusion, they fell to plunder the Houses
with such fury, as there was no distinction made between those that were for
the Imperialists and the contrary party. In this tumult Trivulcio was taken
Prisoner, Mercurio Bua Captain of the Venetians light Horse, Luigi Marino
Secretary to the Commonwealth, and many others; Lautrech minding nothing else
but how to save the Cavalry, wherewith he got safe and entire out of Milan, and
got quickly to Com^. The Venetian Curassiers, who being gone from Lodi, were
coming toward Milan, were stripped by the way, and the greatest part of them got
into Bergamo. And the Switzers who first began the mutiny, the tumult
increasing, valued not their Captains commands, but returned to their own
homes* Milan being thus taken, and the French Army in so great disorder, Lodi,
Pavia, Parma, and Piacenza, yielded suddenly to the Imperialists, as did
Cremona soon after, though a great number of French arriving, who made good the
Castle, it was soon recovered. Thus the French, not having received any rout,
nor having so much as struck a stroke, being very strong, were by a very slight
accident put to great disorder and confusion, and lost so large and so fair a
State, the winning whereof had cost them so dear. This is the change and
uncertainty which all humane actions are subject to, wherein we often labor in
vain, the labor of many years being lost in one day, in one moment. Colonna
endeavoring to make use of this good Fortune, and to defeat the remainder of
the French Army, pursued Lautrech, who leaving Como, was gone toward Lodi; but
not making any stay there, he went with his Curassiers into the Country of
Geraddada, and not tarrying long there neither, he went to Leonato, in the
Territories of Brescia. Which though it were very grievous to the Venetians, by
reason of the inconvenience which would thereby redound to that Country, which
had been already exhausted by long War, being to find food for so many Horse,
whereof Lautrech had 5000. Every complete Lancier having 10 Horses, yet being
unwilling to refuse the admittance of the French into their State, they made
other proposals to them. They put them in mind of carrying their men into the
parts about Ferrara, which indeed the Duke did desire for his own ends; for
that being a very fat Country, and not touched upon by the War, they might be
there fed commodiously, and it was very opportunely situated; moreover it might
be advantageous; for the Pope, who was still apprehensive, being by reason of
the Neighberhood of so many Warriers, jealous that Bologna, and the State of
Urbine might run some hazard, had caused the Army of the League to come into
those parts; so as this might be a means of some good success. But Lautrech
refusing this and all other proposalls, the Senate was contented to please him,
by suffering him to winter his men in their Dominions; at which, when the
Emperors Ambassador seemed to be troubled, answer was made; that in case of
such misfortunes, not only friends and confederates, but even enemies ought to
be assisted: that therefore, both in respect of their Articles of capitulation,
and out of mere civillity, they could not but assist the French in this their
adverse Fortune, and afford them all convenience, for the preservation of their
men, which were to serve either for the defense, or recovery of the State of
Milan, to the which the Commonwealth was by particular agreement bound. It was
therefore ordered, that the French, and our men also, should forbear molesting
the enemy, whilst they tarried in those Territories; least the enemy might
take occasion to pursue them too within the Venetian Confines, which would be
very prejudicial to the Country.

But Bartolomeo di Villa Chiara, and Monsignor Visconte being past over the
Ada, and entered with some of their Troops into the Bergamasco, to infest the
Country; Commissary Gritti gave leave for the defense thereof against the
Imperialists; so as some Troops of light Horse, and some Gentlemen that were
banished out of Milan, coming out of Crema, and passing likewise over the Ada,
they assaulted some of the Enemies Curassiers at unawares, plundered them, and
did them further harm. This mean while Lautrech propounded to go with all the
men he then had, to Cremona, intending to throw a Bridge over the Po at
Pontinico, near the greater Cassal, that he might be master of the country on
both sides of the River, and might hold intelligence with the Duke of Ferrara,
who was come into the field with no small forces to attempt the taking of
Modena and Regio. This Seat was likewise thought very opportune to fall upon
the Territories of Mantua, and particularly Viadana, a very rich and opulent
Town, from whence they might get good store of Victuals for their Army: and the
Marquis of Mantua, who was in the Leagues Camp, as Captain General of the
Churches forces, would be forced to depart from thence, and come to defend his
own affairs. But the Venetians not thinking it fit to make any attempts before
they had greater forces, not to draw new enemies upon them in time of ill
fortune, not being thereunto necessitated, dissuaded Lautrech from this: When
things were in this condition, Pope Leo died, whereupon the face of things did
soon much alter.

This Pope was famous for many virtues, particularly for his Princely
liberality and munificence, wherewith he cherished and befriended the
Litterati, and all such as were excellent in any knowledge: But he would have
left a better memory of his Popedom behind him* if he had not obscured his
glory, by busying himself and others in troublesome Wars, and suffering himself
to be sometimes transported by his affections: He seemed both by his words and
intercessions, to be well affected to the Commonwealth, and to desire her
greatness, yet covering his contrary proceedings, by various pretenses, he was
always a back friend to her. It was evidently seen, that the reputation of the
Colleagues would be much lessened by the Pope's death: for the Switzers, who by
reason of their confederacy, renewed (much to their advantage) with the King of
France, were always troubled to be led on against him, having already begun
their wonted tumults, when they heard that Leo was dead, they presently left
the Camp, and the State of Milan; and it was thought that the College of
Cardinals would at their first meeting, recall the Churches forces out of
Romagna, whereby great opportunity appeared to be offered for the recovery of
the State of Milan, with as much ease as it was lost before, the City not being
over-well Garrisoned, and the Enemy not having sufficient forces in the field
to succor it. Moreover the Town was full of confusion, the people were very
ill satisfied with the Imperialists, by reason of the many mischiefs done by
the Switzers, Spanish, and Dutch foot; hating them and their Nations, almost as
much now, as they had formerly done the French; and the Cardinals of Medices
and Sedunences were gone from the camp, that they might be present at the
election of the new Pope; and by their absence, the authority of the League,
and all men's observancy thereof was much lesned. Out of these respects, as also
to free their Territories from the expense of feeding the French, the Venetians
hasted to raise soldiers every where, taking the greatest part of the
Garrisons from their Cities; they those also new Commanders, for Malates^a
Baglione, and some others, had foregone the Venetian pay, that they might
recover their particular States in the vacancy of the Apostolic Sea. But the
hopes of good success consisted chiefly, in the Protection which the Switzers
had taken with much fervency of the French affairs, and of the recovery of the
State of Milan, in the last Diet of Lucerna; to which purpose, they had, by
resolution of the same Diet, sent some to Venice, to desire the Senate, that
they would continue their forwardness in favoring the affairs of France, and
to make good their Articles of confederacy; promising that they would take upon
them, to defend those who should in this case help, and adhere unto the king of
France: wherefore Lautrech reassuming courage, resolved, though it were in the
very depth of winter, to move with those men which he had got together, and to
enter the Territories of Milan. But Colonna this mean while minded the mending
of the Rampires, and enlarging the Platformes, and the securing of Milan, by
many other works: the Garrison whereof (which consisted only of Spanish Foot,
was much increased by the Dutch, who were first brought from Como, to
Marignano, and from thence to Milan. The Marquess of Mantua was no less
diligent in Lodi, where he had 200 Horse, and but a few Foot.

The French and Venetian Commanders falling to consult what they had best do,
at first, many things were propounded, with some difference of Opinion.
Frederico di Bozzuolo propounded, the sudden assaulting of Parma and Piacenza,
wherein there were but weak Garrisons, and those made yet the weaker by the
uncertainty of the Switzers Loyalty, it being gathered by some discourse which
had been had with them, that they would pass over to the French camp, But it
being necessary, that to effect this, the whole Army must be carried beyond the
River Poe, it was openly gainsaid by the Venetian Commissary, as a thing
wherein there was more danger, then hopes of good success; especially, since
they could not very well guard the Pope, so as they might at their pleasure
retire. He therefore was for carrying all their men to Cremona, and for getting
the country thereabouts, the greatest part whereof held for the Spaniards, and
that then they might make use of time and occasion, in falling upon other
enterprises: Thus both of them persisting in their opinion, it was resolved,
that (neither of these counsels being fully allowed of, nor yet fully
rejected,) Frederick should pass the Poe, with part of the forces, and draw
near Parma, but without any artillery; because, if his design did not succeed,
he might retreat the sooner, and without danger: and that the rest of the
French Army, and all the Venetians, should return to Cremona. But affairs not
falling out succesfully about Parma, Bozzuolo, without making any atempt upon
Piacenza, returned to join with Lautrech; who was already gotten into the
Territories of Cremona; and this was all that was at that time done, and
wherewith the year 1521 ended. But the two great Princes, Charles the Emperor,
and Francis king of Fance, were still set hot upon war, which foretold great
combustions in Italy, and other Provinces, in the beginning of the next year.

The French Army being now very strong, for many Switzers were come unto their
Camp, and the Venetians, who were then 6000 Foot, 600 Curassiers, and 800
Light Horse, being already thereunto joined; Lautrech, by the consent of the
other Commanders, resolved to attend the final issue of the War, and to march
toward Milan. Being therefore advanced with the whole Army, the French
encamped themselves at Cassano, and the Venetians at Binasco, upon the Road
that leads from Pavia to Milan, to hinder the Victuals which were brought by
that way. Whilst they were in these quarters, some Companies of Switzers, and
some Troops of French Horse, were sent to Novara, which place, not being time
enough relieved by the Marquis of Mantua, who was come out of Pavia to th^^
end, it was easily taken and sacked by the Assalliants, and Philip Torniello,
Commander of the adverse Party, was made Prisoner. Novarra being taken,
Vigevena soon surrendered; which purchase was thought the greater; because it
opened the way for Succors, which were expected from France, to come and join
with the Camp: in hopes whereof, they did the more easily bear with many
hardships, which the camp began already to undergo, for want of moneys, and
through other inconveniences; there being no hopes of bringing the War to a
final good end, without other new and important succors; the King of France
had given out, that he would come himself into Italy: and being gone in the
beginning of April to Lions, he sent the Admiral there forwards to Granople,
and gave order for the levying of 12000 Foot of several Nations, being very
sollicitous in ordering such a preparation for war, as became his forces, and
such an enterprise, on which his heart was so set, as he would often times say,
That rather then to give it over, he would hazard his own person, and his
kingdom. He therefore endeavored, by many fervent solicitations, to keep
the Venetian Senate in their first and constant resolution, of not foregoing
his friendship, for any offers that Caesar could make them. He writ likewise
particularly to Gritti the Commissary of the camp, as to one that he knew very
well, and esteemed very much, recommending the business to him, and assuring
him, that he might safely build upon his coming into Italy, and upon the
Forces which he would bring with him, which should be certain, and sudden:
which made the Venetians concur the more readily to the charges of the war, not
only for what belonged unto themselves, but in the concernments of the French,
assisting them at their needs with much ammunition, and many other things; and
with good sums of money to pay their soldiers.

For all this, provisions came not from France, answerable to what was
requisite, and to their promises: But after long expectation, Monsieur di
Lescue came, without any men, and but with little moneys. Therefore thinking
that they should do no good by tarrying longer about Milan, they resolved at
last to remove, and to come with their camp before Pavia; hoping, that the
strength of their Army, and the weakness of the Garrison which was in that
City, being considered, they might get a sudden, and a safe victory; for
though, out of some such suspicion, the Marquess of Mantua was entered the Town,
with some soldiers, yet there was not, at that time there, more then 12000
Italian Foot, 500 Curassiers, and some few Light horse: wherefore it was
thought, that when the Marquis should see the French Army draw nigh, he would
come out, and forgo the defense of the City, as a thing too hard to be done.

The whole Army, both of the French and Venetians, being encamped before the
walls, they began to batter, and having already thrown down about 50 foot of
the wall, the Switzers: who are naturally impatient of delay, desired the
French Commanders, that they might be led on to the assault. But they thinking
it better to let the business grow more ripe, till they might be more sure of
victory, differr'd the doing so, till a Mine might be accomplished, which was
preparing to be made by the invention of Petro Navara under a great Bastiome,
by the downfall whereof, the assault might be the better given. And the mean
while, a bridge being made over the Tesino, the Light Horse made inrodes, even
to the very gates of the city, keeping the enemy from either coming in, or
coming out. Yet all passages could not be so diligently kept, but that some
Foot sent with succor from Milan got into the City, by the way of Marignavo,
though many of them were kept back by the Cavalry, and many brought prisoners
into the camp. But businesses went slowlier forward then the present necessity
required; for Navaro's Engines required length of time, and were hard to
compass; and some pieces of cannon were expected from Lodi and Crema, wherewith
to renew the battery. By this delay, Colonna had opportunity given him, to draw
forth his whole army into the field, and having taken up his station in a
strongly situated place, upon the way to Pavia, the French were very jealous,
lest he might advance farther, and endanger them, whilst being busy about
assaulting the City, they were the less intent upon other business: Therefore
they placed 10000 Switzers, and 600 French Curassiers on their back, who if
need should be, might sustein the brunt of the enemy, who should come to
assault them. In this interim, some French horse which were gone out to
overrun the Country, advancing too far, fell upon the Enemies Vanguard, by
whom they were chased, and many of them taken Prisoners; Colonna's men leaving
their first Quarters, came and placed themselves in a strong situation at
Binasco, about 8 miles distant from the French Camp, which made the French
Commanders more jealous and afraid; for to tarry long idle about the Walls of
the City, without using any violence, redounded much to the disreputation of
their Army, and there was much danger in making an assault; for if they should
be beaten back, they feared lest the Switzers, having made this trial in vain,
dispairing of good success, might quit the Camp, not being well satisfied that
they had not received the pay which they had already deserved. Moreover, being
of some days past much straightened in victuals, they could not have been able to
refresh their wearied and afflicted Soldiers, nor supply their greatest
necessities.

But say that things should have succeeded luckily, and that they should have
taken the City, how could any Commander hope to keep his Soldiers, especialy
the Switzers, from plundering; wherein being bu^ied without either any Order or
Government, the whole Army was in danger of manifest ruin, having so powerful
an Enemy so near at hand.

These things being considered, Gritti advised that they should raise the Camp
from before Pavia, and go to some strong and safe place, where they might
expect the coming of the King of France, which they were informed by new
messages from France, would be very soon, and with great Forces. And it is most
apparent that his presence accompanied with such a strength of men, would have
brought so much reputation to that Army, and have won so much favor from some,
and infused so much terror into othersome, as they must have been sure of a
notable Victory. Nothing pleaded against this commendable and wholesome advice,
but the Switzers fickleness; who not admitting of any reason, did obstinately
demand either to be dismissed, that so they might return home, or else brought
to fight the Enemy: And it was the harder to appease them, for that the
scarcity of Victuals was now grown greater, because the Country being overflown
by very great rains, and the Bridges over Tessino being broken down, whereby
Victuals was brought from Novarra, and Vegivene, they had much ado to get
provisions for the Army.

Whilst these doubts and difficulties were disputed in the French, and Venetian
camp, they understood that the Imperialists being risen from Binasco, were
marching forwards with all their Forces. Whereupon Lautrech resolved suddenly
to meet them, and to fight them. He was very diligent in putting his Army in
good order, behaving himself like a valiant, and well experienced Commander.
But the Enemy hastening their march, got into a strong Station, so near the
Charterhouse, as Colonna and the Marquis of Pescara, were quartered in the very
Monastry of the Carthugiens; a place very Famous for the stately and excellent
Building: Lautrech not being then able to do what he first intended, moved to
march forward, and get beyond the Enemy, and to settle in some fitting place
upon the way to Milan, thinking to make Colonna dislodge, and draw nearer
Milan: But this being argued in the counsel of War, and many difficulties being
found therein, it was resolved that they should go to within two miles of the
Emperor's camp, and that the Switzers and French should Quarter on the outside
of the Park of the Charterhouse, and the Venetians within the Park; but yet so
as both parts of the Army might commodiously succor each other through some
gaps which were made in the Park wall. And before the camp was settled,
Lautrech, to try the Enemy, ordered that two Bataglions of the Switzers and two
great bodies of Curassiers, should advance near the Enemy, against which none
appearing, it was thought that the Imperialists were suddenly removed, and
returned to their former Quarters of Binasco, whither they came two days after;
Colonna having the mean while, much to his praise, relieved Pavia, and made the
Enemies camp to rise from before it. But the French camp were in great
disturbances, by the Switzers mutinying, who though they knew that the Moneys
destined for their pay was come to Arona, yet they continued still to mutiny,
refusing to go any whither, save where they might soonest, and most
commodiously receive their money. Wherefore they propounded that the whole Army
might go by the way of Biagrassa, toward Vigivene, and that making a Bridge
over the Tesino, a safe convoy might be sent to bring them their Moneys. Which
Gritti did openly gainsay, saying, he would not go so far from the Territories
of the Commonwealth, and expose his men to so much the greater danger, as that
the Switzers being in a better, and safer way homewards, might the more easily
forsake them. After diverse debates, it was at last resolved that the whole Army
should march toward Monz, to which the Venetian Commanders consented; having
first caused Lodi to be well munited, and thrown a Bridge over the Ada at
Trecco, that they might upon all occasions have a way to retreat safely, and to
secure their Men and their Country.

When the Switzers were come to Monz, they would presently have passed over the
Tesino,

Openly blaming the French for their irresoluteness, and backwardness, and
complaining grievously, that they, who were a Valliant Nation, should be put to
suffer so many inconveniences so long, without recieving their just, and well
deserved pay; and without being brought to try their Valor in War. That they
had several times offered to be the first who should go on in assaulting Pavia,
that they had often times desired to come to a day of Battle with the Enemy,
who were more encouraged by the fear, and cowardliness of others, then by their
own Forces. That they had never refused any danger, labor, or millitary
action, wherein they might serve the Crown of France; but that yet they would
not be held to be base, and servile, such as would do their work, without such
reward as their Valor and Labor did deserve.

And though the French Commanders did what they could to appease this
tumultuous proceeding,

Showing that the Kings service (which was the thing they ought chiefly to
respect) required them to do what they had done, and what at least would
redound to their glory, and secure the Victory; that the delay of their Pay
proceeded not from any want of care in the King, or negligence in his
Ministers; but from unavoydable impediments, all the passages being blocked up
by the Enemy.

Yet they had much ado to appease the tumult, and to keep them in the Camp.

The Cesarian Army which was come to Bicocca, a place about four miles from
Milan, was in great disorder for the same cause: For the Lanschenets muty^i^d,
demanding pay; and many Italian Foot, who were not paid, passed over into the
Enemies Army, and were taken into pay by the Venetians; and some of the Spanish
companies had let our Commanders understand that they were ready to do the
like, if they might be received. Moreover there was no good correspondency
between the chief Commanders; for Pescara being high minded, scorned to do any
thing by any other man's order, or counsel, or to depend upon Colonna's
Authority.

But so great was the Switzers impatiency in the French Camp, as it marred all
good resolutions, and would not suffer the Commanders to make use of time, or
to draw any advantage out of these the Enemies disturbances. So as the Switzers
affirming still that they would go over the Tessino, and Gritti being
necessitated therefore to say, that then he must need depart the same day with
his men toward Lodi; Lautrech, partly disdaining these Proposals which were
made on all sides, partly to shun the being thought a Dastard (for the French
are always naturally friends to sudden counsels, though not safe, more then to
long expectance, though with more security) resolved to try the Fortune of
Battle, though upon great disadvantage, being to assault the Enemy within their
Quarters, which were naturally strong, being environed by many waters, and made
the stronger by many works which the Imperialists had raised with much
industry, for their better safety. The assault was so ordered as all the
Switzers went in the first Squadron, being divided into two great Battalions,
with 14 pieces of Artillery, and they were attended by Babon di Naldo, with 800
Venetian Harchebusiers on Foot: After these were the French Curassiers to
follow, and then the whole body of the Venetian Foot with 9 pieces of
Artillery, backed by their Curassiers divided into two parts. The Switzers
marching thus apace, but in great good order, went boldly on to the assault;
and though the badness of the place appeared to be far worse when they were at
it, then they had conceived it to be, yet not at all abating their fierceness,
they strove to beat the Dutch Foot back, who did defend the Rampires: Who
making use of the advantage of place, fought the more courageously, to the end
that they might not dispute the business with the Enemy upon equal terms, if
they should be suffered to win the Ditch. At the same time the Sw^tzers were
played upon on the Flanks by great abundance of Musket shot, by the Spanish
Foot; but all of them readily encountering the danger, those who remained alive,
soon revenged their companions death. Whilst it was thus stoutly fought on all
sides, on the Front of their Quarters, Monsieur di Lescu, wheeling about with
the French Horse, assaulted the Enemies on the back, and finding the field open
on that side, he advanced a good way in, committing great slaughter, and put
the Enemy into great fear and disorder: So as it was generally thought, that if
he had been followed by good store of Foot, the French and Venetians would that
day have easily routed, and defeated the Imperial Army. But the Switzers, who
after five hours fighting, found they were in vain to overcome the disadvantage
of the place, began to retreat by little and little to within their Squadrons
in a stupendous order, carrying off all their Artillery, and being more
encouraged in their orderly retreat, because they saw themselves backed by the
Venetians, who making good the Rear, secured them from being pressed upon by the
Imperialists. O^ the French Army there perished in this assault more then 20^0
men, all of them Switzers; but the loss was peradventure greater in the
Imperial Camp, they having lost many men of good condition. Though this action
had no very good success, yet as being full of confidence and courage, it was
likely rather to have added unto, then to have lessened the reputation of the
French Army, and to have invited them to other undertakings, had not the same
impatiency of the Switzers, which formerly persuaded them against reason to
attempt the Battle, disturbed all their designs, and frustrated other hopes by
their returning to their former tumults; Lautrech loaded the Captains of the
Switzers with gifts and promises, and prayed them that by their entreaties,
reasons and authority, they would endeavor to keep their Foot in due
obedience, which they all did: But amongst the rest Alberto Pietra, a man in
much favor and authority with his Nation, calling them all together, spoke
thus unto them.

You gave yesterday, My valiant Fellow Soldiers, so noble a proof of your
daring, and military experience, as that action is not to be numbered amongst
the least of praises which by common consent are given to our Nation, in all
that appertains to the Militia: But to arise to the height of glory, it is
requisite that we persevere in the same purpose of beating and quite conquering
the Enemies Army: And that we return to try the fortune of War, lest it be
thought that by yielding to the first no very fortunate encounter, it was
fickleness, not true valor, which made us expose our selves to the dangers of
Battle: Or else that we confess we are overcome, though in truth we be rather
Conquerours, having assaulted the Enemy even within their works, done them much
harm, and retreated safe and in good order, not any one of the Enemy having
dared to come out of their Camp, and pursue us: No not so much as to show any
resentment, or that they do equal us in Force and Valor. But if we do first
quit our Quarters which we now are in, it will assuredly be said, that the
Imperialists got the Victory, and that we are gone, not of our own wills, but
driven away by the Enemy. Whereas on the contrary, if we tarry here, we may get
many notable advantages; we shall confirm all men in the opinion, that the
Victory was really ours, we shall not a little encourage those that adhere to
the French party, we shall infuse such terror into the Enemy, as to avoid the
danger of more assaults, and of more certain ruin, now that they are aware we
are better acquainted with the situation of their Quarters, and with our
advantage, and disadvantage, they will retreat to within the Walls of Milan,
and will leave us Masters of the Field, and free to fall upon whatsoever
Design we shall please: We have understood by express Messengers, that it is
the will, nay the express command of our Masters and Governors, that we
continue during this Militia, in the service of the King of France, How can we
disobey what they command? Or, wherefore ought we to do it, in a business,
which for our own glory and profit, we ought to seek and pursue, yea, though we
were forbidden? We must not then certainly refuse to do it, when it is enjoined
us under pain of disobedience. We are assured that the King will very shortly
come into Italy with a great warlike preparation, nor can I see what forces the
Enemy have to withstand so great a Force, or how they can oppose our Designs.
The whole State of Milan will assuredly fall suddenly into the King's hands,
who to revenge himself of the City for her rebellion, and of those his Subjects
for their many injuries, and to reward the valor of his Army, will give the
prey and plunder of them and it, unto his Soldiers; and you who have hitherto
shared in such labors, and in so many dangers, will you lose the advantage
thereof, and not be at the sacking of so many, and so rich Cities; for the very
hopes whereof, though you were in Countries far off, you ought endeavor by all
means possible to be present at this Militia, that you might receive fitting
rewards for your military actions? What consideration can there be of so great
moment, I beseech you, which can counterpoise so great glory, so great
advantage? What else is it that can make you forego such hopes? You complain
for want of pay, and in resentment thereof, will revenge your selves upon your
selves: Consider better what the injury is that is done you, what it is you can
with reason complain of: The King has not provided moneys time enough for your
occasions: his Ministers may peradventure have been negligent therein: Can you
doubt that your Pays are stopped* or that there is any doubt to be made of your
receiving them? We know for certain, that the moneys are already in your
masters hands, and that the delay of payment, is only because the passages are
so shut up and guarded by the Enemy, as the moneys cannot without manifest
danger be brought unto the Camp: If you will resent this, revenge your selves
upon those that are the true cause why they are detained. Think of beating the
Enemy, and so all the ways will be open, the Country will be ours, all things
will depend upon us, and not upon the will of others: These are more useful,
more generous thoughts, and more answerable to your former actions, then to
think of returning home, as chased by your enemies, to whom you have been a
terror, and will be so still, if you be not wanting unto your selves.

T^ese words unwillingly lis^ned unto, made no impression in the Soldiers, as
being contrary to their already resolved will; who persevering obstinately in
their former refractoriness, required that the Camp might be removed from
thence, and that they might be dismissed the Mi^itia: wherefore Lautrech* to shun
further danger, was forced to rise, and went with his whole Army toward
Trecco, where finding the Bridge already made, he lodged upon the Banks of Ada,
^is men being quartered, some on the one side, some on the other side of the
River; the Venetian Commanders desiring it should be so, for the better
security of their affairs: Where having stayed a ^ew days, the Switzers
disbanded, and went several ways to their own homes; but most of them took
their way toward Lecco, where they unde^stood the moneys for their pay was
come; The Grand Ma^stre, Monsieur de Mommorancie, Monsieur de Palissa, and
other Frenchmen following them, with their companies, since neither words nor
act^ons were able to prevail with the Switzers, to make them tarry any longer;
for it was so provided by the Venetians, that they should be defrayed by them
without moneys, till their pay was come from France: For the Venetians were
very much troubled, and damnified by the Switzers departure; Lautrech
affirming, that he must be en^o^ced to return with all his men to France,
together with the Switzers, and through their country, if they should resolve to
go, so as the parts about the Ada being left unguarded, the Imperialists might
freely at their pleasure enter in hostile manner into the Territories of the
Commonwealth. But if the French should stay in Lombardy, they desired the
Senate that they might be permitted to quarter in the Territories of Brescia,
against which there were many objections to be made; the country was wholly
ruined by so long Wars, and by so many Garrisons, and it was to be feared, that
it might afford the Imperialists occasion of passing into the confines of their
State, who did alrea^y complain, that they had exceeded the bonds of their
confederacy, in favoring the French; so as in many considerations, several
inconveniences and differences and difficulties arose by the departure of the
Switzers; who not being by any means to be detained, the Senate resolved to
satisfy the French in their desire, and to receive them into their State, that
they might not lessen their past deserts with the King, and because the
preservation of those men made for the common safety, and facilitated the
business of Milan, against the King should come into Italy*. But Lautrech, and
the other Commanders, being persuaded either by the reasons formerly alleged
by the Venetians, or out of no small fear of what might ensue, if they should
so suddenly abandon the whole State of Milan, resolved that part of their men
should go to Cremona, whither also Lautrech himself went, and the rest to Lodi,
with Frederico da Bozzuole, and Giovan de Medici; though Medici not being able
to make his men move without money, came not time enough thither: and the
French Garrison which was in Trecco, not being sufficient to defend it, the
Venetian Commissary sent Giovan dal Saracino thither, who was under the pay of
the Commonwealth, with two companies of Italian Foot: But Lautrech seeing that
nothing came from France but fair words, and news of great warlike
preparations, things which did little avail the present business, resolved to
pass over the mountains, and to go himself to Court, to give an account of the
affairs of Italy, leaving his brother Monsieur di Leiscue in Cremona; whither
Colonna coming with all his Army, and no succor appearing, Lescue was forced
to ye^ld up the City unto him, he having taken Lodi but a little before by an
unexpected assault.

thither. The Venetians succor the Imperialists. The French before Milan. The
Viceroy of Naples passes into Lombardy. Bourbone is declared Cesars Lieutenant
General. The Venetians are jealous by reason of a Treaty of Peace between the
French and Cesarians. The Venetian Ambassador is dismissed from France. The
death of Adrian the sixth. Clement the seventh is chosen Pope. Antonio Grimani,
Duke of Venice, dies: and Andrea Gritti is chosen in his place. His conditions.
The French fall upon the Millanoise. The Duke of Urbane, General to the
Venetians, does many things. Renzo da Ceri upon the Confines of the Venetians
with 8000 Gris^uns. The Admiral joins with the Switzers. The Ambassador of the
three Leagues at Venice. The Pope exhorts the Senate to hold with him. The
Popes designs. He sends his Datario, Giberti to France; The French again before
Milan: They take it. The King of France besieges Pavia in his own person.
Which causes jealousy and irresolutions in the Pope and Venetians. Gregorio
Cornaro and Dominico Trevisano make Orations in the Senate hereupon. The Siege
of Pavia is prolonged. The Pope, Venetians, and Florentines join in a defensive
War. The Venetians adhere to Trevisano, and secretly conclude a League with
France. The Cesarians come to the relief of Pavia; they assault the Kings Army,
get the victory, and take the King Prisoner. The Italian Princes fears
hereupon. The Popes League with France troubles the Imperialists. The Duke of
Ferara offers himself to the Pope. The Duke of Urbines Valor. The Pope being
afraid, treats of agreement with the Imperialists, and draws the Venetians
along with him. Cesars joy for the Victory at Pavia. His offers unto the Pope.
The Queen of France her endeavors with the Venetians; their perplexity. The
Pope makes an agreement with Caesar, who alienates the Venetians, from himself,
by detaining the Dukedom of Milan. Who break off all treaties of agreement, and
join with the Pope. They are favored by the King of England; the Venetians
treat of a League with France: But grow jealous at France her agreement with
Caesar. The King of France his complaints against Caesar. His entreaties
thereupon to the Pope and the Venetians; his actions contrary to his Proposals.
The League between the Pope, France, and the Venetians is at last published.
The Armies of the Colleagues join upon the Territories of Milan. Burbons Valor
renders their designs vain. Pietro Navaro, General of the Confederates Fleet,
attempts to take Genua: But Andria Doria deals treacherously. The Duke of Urbin
returns to before Milan: Sforza yields hims^^f up to the Imperialists. The
Spaniards fail him, and therefore he ratifies the League with the Confederates:
Who winning Cremona, assign it over unto him. The Colones^ enter Rome, and s^ck
it. The Pope treats therefore of Truce with the Spaniards: His immoderate fear.
The King of England presents him with 30000 Crowns. New treaty of peace. Caesar
prepares to succor Genua. Giorgio Sfonspere musters 10000 Dutch at Bolzano;
and in despite of the Confederates passes into the Country of Mantua. Giovan de
Medici his Valor. The Dutch pass into Tuscany. The Venetians succor the Popes
State, and send Marco Foscari to Florence. The Imperial Fleet toward Genua, is
pursued by the Venetian Fleet, chased by Navarro, gets at last to Gaetta, and
lands the Viceroy of Naples. Renzo de Ceri sent by the King of France to Rome.
The Viceroy succors the Collonesi, and besieges Frussolone. The Colleagues
attempt the taking of Naples: their proceedings. Important actions before the
City. The Neapolitans are afraid, and are supported by Don Ugo Moncada: The
Ecclesiastical Army in disorder. Burbone comes forth of Milan, to join with the
Duth, and goes to Bologna: The Pope the mean while concludes peace with the
Viceroy: his little discretion in laying down Arms: his fears, and his excuse
to the Colleagus Ambassadors. A Tumult in Florence, appeased by the Duke of
Urbane. Burbone despairing of the Enterprise, marches toward Rome: desires
passage from the Pope, which is denied; wherefore he besieges the City, he is
shot upon the walls thereof with a musket, and dies. The Emperors Army enters
Rome. The Pope retires to the Castle of St Angelo. Rome, in a few days,
undergoes the miseries of being sacked, of Famine, of Pestilence, and suffers
total desolation of all things, as well sacred, as profane.

THe Fortune and reputation of the French being much declined, by their being
driven in a short space out of the State of Milan, and by Forces not greater
then their own; it was generally thought, that the Venetians, whose Army was
defeated, and the greatest part of their Horse by them dismissed, they having
likewise given leave to their Commissary Gritti to return from the camp, and
come home: having largely made good their Confederacy with King Francis, though
they got but little good thereby, would at last follow the victorious Fortune
of Charles the Emperor: who as he had formerly seemed to desire their
friendship, so did he now more then ever endeavor to draw them to side with
him; hoping, by reason of the low condition which the French were in, to be
able to separate them from King Francis; and believing that the preservation of
the State of Milan, and the good end of all the war did chiefly depend upon
this new Confederacy, and upon the assistance and forces of the Venetians; for
it was very certain, that king Francis made great preparations to pass into
Italy with a powerful Army; and that if he should be assisted by the
Venetians, the Emperialists and Sforzas would not be able long to maintain the
burden of so heavy a war: As on the contrary, if the Venetians should join
with the Imperialists, it was thought, that the French would be kept from
retiring into Italy, being they were to meet with so stout resistance: and that
King Francis, seeing himself deprived of the Venetian's aid, would lay aside all
thoughts of coming into Italy, as despairing of good Success. Caesar therefore
labored hard to effect this; and did not only treat thereof at his own Court,
with Gasparo Cotarini, who was Ambassador there, for the Comwealth,
acquainting him with many reasons, wherefore the Senate should be persuaded to
join in like Confederacy with him, to defend the States of each other, as they
had of late years done with the King of France; but he likewise interposed the
authority of the King of England, with whom Charles having had speech at his
return from Spain, he had had much discourse thereupon; and the Cardinal of
York had the copy of the Capitulations, drawn up by the Emperor's Lord
Chancellor; and having acquainted Gasparo Contarini with them, offered to
moderate them, and to make them such as the Commonwealth (which had complained
thereof, as being too severe) should have reason to accept them. But the
business requiring some length of time, by reason of this distance of place, a
League was concluded between Charles and Henry, reserving room for the
Venetians to be comprehended therein, if they would declare within three
months; and if they would accommodate their affairs first with Caesar, either by
way of Truce, or Peace: which being communicated to the Senate, produced as
then no other result, save only fair correspondency in general, with a show of
being much inclined to peace, and to friendship with Caesar, so it might stand
with the honor and safety of the Commonwealth: and that, since the Cardinal of
York had already offered himself to be a Mediator, and stickler in the business
of greatest difficulty, it was requisite, to hear what he would propound,
before any resolution could be taken.

But the news of the French preparations for the affairs of Italy increasing
daily, and greater doubts arising in Charles, and Henry, by reason of the
Venetians delaying to put on any resolution, that their State would continue
their confederacy with France, they resolved to send Ambassadors to Venice, to
accelerate the conclusion of the League which was propounded by them. The King
of England's Ambassador came thither first, which was Richard Pace, who having
received his Commission from his King, whilst the said Richard was at Rome,
discharged his trust, together with the Emperors Ambassador, which was
resident at Venice; desiring in their Princes name, that the Senate would
declare, what they intended to do, when the King of France should return with
an Army into Italy, to possess himself of the State of Milan. But the Emperors
Ambassador proceeded further, desiring that the Commonwealth would wage war
against the King of France, if he should not desist from troubling Caesar, and
from disturbing the peace of Italy: alleging, that the Venetians were bound to
do so, by a particular Confederacy made two years before at London, wherein by
particular consent of their Senate, the State of Venice was named amongst the
chief Contracters.

The Venetians proceeded very maturely in this Treaty; weighing how pernicious
any resolution they could put on might prove to the Commonwealth, according to
the various events which might happen in the affairs of Italy, and by the
secret Counsels of Princes: for it was certain, That if the King of France
should, through any accident that might happen, delay sending a powerful army
on this side the Mountains, his reputation would be so much lesned, and the
Forces and authority of his enemies so confirmed, as the adherers to the French
would be exposed to eminent dangers: and, on the other side, to forego their
Friendship, to boot, that it went against their general inclination, brought
with it no lesser difficulties: For it was rather to be believed, both in
respect of the power, and wealth of the Kingdom of France, and out of the
immense desire that King Francis had to get the State of Milan, that the French
would return with powerful Forces on this side the Mountains, and regain his
former power, and authority, so as they might have means to revenge themselves
of the Italian Princes, for any injuries received by them; which if they should
not be able to do, they might peradventure join in League with their own
enemies, against the Commonwealth; as King Lewis had done some years before,
which was the beginning of her so many and so heavy calamities. Out of these
and other such respects, the Senate being resolved not to make any new
confederacy, unless necessitated; and being unwilling either to forgo
Friendship with the French, or to make Caesar despair of what he was in treaty
with them; acquainted the King of France with these practices; and answered
Charles and Henrie's Ambassadors, in general terms: seeming to be as desirous
of Cesar's friendship, as he was of theirs: But the present condition of Times,
and the many late afflictions of the Commonwealth did require, that being to
make any new agreements, they should aim at putting their State into a quiet
and peaceable condition, and shun whatsoever determination might (though upon
like, or greater hopes,) be an occasion unto them of new disturbance and
danger: That therefore, if the King of France should come into Italy, they
would so keep their Confederacy with him, as they would have a care not to
violate the Truce, and their Promises made to Caesar; nor would they the mean
while be wanting to do all good offices, as well for the common service of
Christendom, as for their own particular good; to the end, that arms might be
laid down, and injuries cease to be done on all sides: But, that if this might
not be compassed, they had not any just pretense to make war with the French,
with whom they had so long had Friendship, and that Friendship confirmed by
many obligations: The League made at London not being any ways valid to that
purpose, as well, because it was never completely perfected; as also, that Leo
being dead, who was one of the chief Contracters, it became invalid, and null.

Whilst the Imperial and English Ambassadors could get nothing but general
answers, though they labored that the Ambassadors of the Commonwealth who
were resident at their Princes Courts, might have Commission given them to come
to some conclusion concerning this propounded League: Girollimo Adorno the
Emperors Counselor and Chamberlain, came to Venice, sent by Caesar with
Commission, to treat upon and conclude those things wherein there lay any
difficulties between him and the Commonwealth; knowing that to treat thereof
at his Court, or at the Court of England, as was begun to be done, would
require much length of time; a thing very unfit for the present business.
Adorno labored in a long speech to persuade the Venetians to quit their
Friendship with France, and to embrace the like of Cesar's, which was offered
them upon honorable, and advantageous terms. But the Senate still moved by
the aforesaid respects, continued in the same answers, neither resolving nor
dissolving this Treaty; but looking to find out in process of time what would
be best for the Commonwealth to do; they excused this their delay by the
Importancy of the business, by the condition of the times, and of the state
wherein their Commonwealth then was, and by the form of their Government;
where all things being to be sifted, and resolved by the liking, and judgment
of many, which are most commonly (especially in such things as are hard and
difficult) several, and sometimes contrary, Affairs could not be so soon, nor
so easily ended, as in Princes Courts, where they pass through the hands but of
one only, or but of a few.

This mean while the number of Spaniards increased very much in Giaradada;
wherefore the Venetians raised many Foot, and increased their Garrisons, which
begot many jealousies in the interessed Princes (for minds contaminated either
by too immoderate desire, or fear, use to judge of things according as their
affections lead them, not as they are in themselves) Caesar, and Henry thought
this raising of men to be made in favor of the French; and on the other side,
the King of France being already grown jealous of these negotiations, though he
were made acquainted with them, began to think that the Imperialists might be
entered into Giaradada, by the consent, and counsel of the Venetians; and that
the Soldiers raised by the Venetians, might be to effect some new confederacy,
which they might have made privately with the Emperor. The one and the other
of them being much troubled hereat, they all of them endeavored to make the
Venetians side with them, or at least, to declare themselves.

The King of England, to add necessity to his endeavors, made two of the
Venetians great Galleys, which were full fraught with rich Merchandise, and
which chanced to be then in his Havens, to be unloaded, under pretense that the
Emperor would make use of them for his navigation: But notwithstanding all
such occasions being over, the vessels, and goods, were still detained in that
Island, to the great inconveniency of particular Venetian Merchants, and to the
offense of the public dignity.

On the other side the King of France did often advertise the Venetians of the
very great preparation for War which he made to come with, into Italy: Touching
which, he desired to receive the Senates opinion and counsel. To which, answer
being made in very affectionate terms, but without any particular expression
concerning the Enterprise, they commended much the Kings wisdom, saying, that
he knew best the fittest time, and the condition of Forces wherewith he might
securely effect what he had designed; but that it was to be believed, it was
speed which was to do him most good therein, so to prevent the counsels and
preparations of the Enemy. At the same time that these things were in treaty,
News came that Soliman prepared a powerful and numerous Fleet, to assault, as
was better known afterward by the effect, the Isle of Rhodes, the seat and
peculiar habitation at that time of the Knights of Jerusalem.

The News of this preparation made the Venetians make Dominico Trevisano their
Captain General by Sea; they increased their number of Galleys, and the
Garrisons of their Islands, minding chiefly the security of the Island of
Cyprus, which, according to no slight suspicions which were given out, Soliman
intended to assault with this Fleet. Trevisano was ordered to advance toward
Cape Malio, to observe the ways of the Turkish Fleet, which if they should make
toward Cyprus, that then he should go first to that Island, and should possess
himself of the Haven of Famagosta; and that if the Turks should intend any
prejudice to the Commonwealth, he should by all means possible endeavor the
safety of the State, and the indemnity of its Subjects: But that if he should
see they bent their Forces elsewhere, he should carry himself so, as Soliman
might know, that their Fleet was intended for the safety of their own affairs,
and not to hinder his designs: Thinking it no wisdom to expose the
Commonwealth, which was hardly as yet freed from the malignity of fortune, and
from so many cross and calamitous events of War on Terra firma, to greater, and
more grievous dangers, for the safety of others, at a time when the other
Christian Princes, being bent upon their private and present Interests, did not
mind the public cause of Christendom. Adriano Fiorentino, by Nation a Low
Country man, was now chosen Pope, a man but of mean Parentage, but highly
esteemed by all men, for his goodness and learning, as also by reason of
Charles the Emperors grace and favor, whose Tutor he had been: He took upon
him the name of Adrian the sixth, and departed soon by Sea from Spain, where he
then was, to Nise, and from thence to Rome: Whither many Prelates and
Ambassadors from Princes, flocked from all places, to do their wonted
obedience: The Senate of Venice sent six of their chief Senators in a solemn
Embassy to Rome, to present themselves according to custom before the Popes
feet; To wit, Marco Dandalo, Luigi Mocenico, Vicenzo Capello, Antonio
Iustiniano, Pietro Pesaro, and Marco Foscari. Who being gone as far on their
way as Bologna, staid there, because the Plague was grown very hot in Rome, and
the infection still increasing, so as the Pope himself was forced to quit the
City, they after a few days returned to Venice.

The Pope wished very well to concord and general quiet, and was very zealous
of the welfare of Christendom; for as soon as he took upon him the Popedom, he
set himself wholly upon accommodateing of differences between Princes, and sent
Briefs unto them all, wherein he piously and efficaciously exhorted them, all
to lay down the arms which they had taken up one against another, that they
might turn all of them jointly against the Turks, the common Enemy, who
threatened grievous and instant danger to Christendom, and had now assaulted
Rhodes with so great a power, threatening ruin to others. He gave many grave
and fatherly admonitions in particular to the Venetians, exhorting them not
only to dispose themselves to peace, but that they would, together with him,
endeavor to accommodate the differences which were amongst other Princes; to
the end, that they might at last join all of them in a firm League, and oppose
the power and greatness of the Ottomans.

But finding the Princes very slow, and cool in embracing his rememberances;
and on the other side the dangers of Christendom increasing; for the Island of
Rhodes was already taken by Soliman, with a powerful Army; the Pope thinking it
became him to proceed more severely in this business; he made his Legates who
were resident at all Princes Courts, to present them with Monitories, whereby
he made all such liable to Ecclesiastical censures, who did not within the
space of 3 Months, apply themselves to accept of the universal Truce, which
was propounded and treated of: And because the differences which were between
Caesar and the Venetians, was a principal impediment to the bringing of this
business to a good end, he offered to take upon himself the care of
accommodateing all their difficulties. The mean while, he desired that a League
might be made between the Church, the Emperor, Venetians, the Duke of Milan,
and the Florentines, for the de^ence and quiet of Italy. Which thing though it
was known to be of it self very good and advantageous and was willingly listened
unto by the Senate; yet there arose some difficulty in the manner of the Popes
propounding it, whereby it was clearly seen, that the end of this League aimed
at the taking up arms against the Turks; by which vain rumor, the Venetians
feared lest they might provoke the anger of a most powerful Prince against
them; who was now more proud, and puffed up then ever, with his new victory: So
as they might be the first, and peradventure, those alone, who were to
withstand the violence of his Forces. The aforesaid Ambassadors were therefore
more speedily dispatched away from Venice, to do their obeisance unto the
Pope; and that they might inform him with their rational respect, and
therewithal ascertain him of the Senates good will, always ready, and disposed
to peace, and true quiet with Christian Princes; and no less ready to wage War
with the Turks, when they should see it might be done jointly, and with Forces
fitting to suppress their power.

The Ambassadors were honorably received by the Pope, who commended the
Senates good intention, promised to enlarge their privileges, and that he
would so handle the League, as that it safely might be embraced by the
Commonwealth; hoping (as he said) that when he should have any earnest of the
other Princes good will, the Venetians would be the forwardest, and most
servent in providing for the safety of Christendom, and in preventing so many
eminent dangers. The Venetians did not this mean while intermit the treaty of
agreement with Caesar, but to the end the particulars thereof might be more
commodiously treated of, the Senate deputed three Senators, of several orders
of the College, to wit Luigi Mocenico, Counselor, Georgio Cornaro, Savio of
the Counsel; and Marc Antonio Veniero, Savio di Terra firma: To negotiate all
things thereunto belonging, with Adorno. The chief difficulty lay in finding
how to accommodate things which were taken by all sides in time of War. Caesar
propounded that all parties should keep what they were then possessed of, but
the Venetians desired that all places which were usurped should be restored,
and that all jurisdiction should return to the same condition it was in
before. Whereunto was added that Caesar would have the Venetians bound by virtue
of this confederacy, to defend not only the State of Milan, but the Kingdom of
Naples also, generally against all men; the which the Venetians refused to do:
For to oblige themselves to take up Arms against the Turks, seemed so
dangerous, as the safety of this League did not counterpoise it; and that by
sending their men so far from the State, would more weaken their affairs, then
Cesar's friendship could secure them. Moreover this League aiming at the
defending of Charles his Territories in Italy, from being offended by the
French, the Kingdom of Naples was thought to be safe enough, by defending the
State of Milan: the condition of times, and the Commonwealths occasions
required, that before all other things, regard should be had to keep friendship
with Soliman, who had a great Army ready to assault Hungary, as he did
afterward; so as it was wisely done to shun all occasions of irritating a
powerful Prince, whose friendship they might make use of to the singular
advantage of the City, by reason of the great good it reaps in time of Peace,
by its many negotiations to the Levant: and the Commonwealth having at this
time particularly sent Pietro Zeno to Constantinople, by reason of the success
at Rhodes, he was honorably received by Soliman, and had quieted some former
distastes, occasioned by certain dep redations made upon the confines of
Dalmatia; and had obtained very large orders to the Sangiacchi of those
neighboring places, that they should deal friendly and neighbourly with all
the subjects of the Commonwealth.

But to return to the Treaty of the League. Many things were urged by Cesar's
Agents to obtain their intent: That it was not reasonable, that since Caesar did
prefer the friendship of the Commonwealth before his other conveniences and
interests, he might also make use thereof for the preservation of his own
States; nor ought it to be esteemed so hard a thing, nor so prejudicial to the
Venetians, to send their Armies into the Kingdom of Naples, since there was an
example thereof, when not many years since, they sent the Marquis of Mantua
with their men, to assist the King of France. To satisfy which particulars in
part, the Senate resolved to promise Caesar some Galleys for the defense of the
Kingdom of Naples, provided that in time of such need, they should not be
busied in the Turkish War.

The slow and irresolute councels of France, concerning the affairs of Italy,
made the Venetians the more inclinable to agree with the Emperor; which
affairs they thought the French to be far from thinking upon; for that it was
said, all their forces would be turned upon the Kingdom of England: and truly,
if no other accidents had intervened, the confederacy with Caesar had then been
concluded: for Ambassadors came from the Archduke Ferdinand, in whose name
Cesar's agents had formerly treated; who brought word, that their Princes
pleasure was, not to come to any certain agreement of Peace at that time, but
only to a renewing of Truce for five years: for being but newly entered (as he
said) into the Government, he was not so well informed of the State of his
affairs, as was requisite, to come to such an agreement: so as the Archduke
being excluded from this confederacy, whereby the chiefest difficulties which
were between the Commonwealth, and the House of Austria, were kept on foot, the
Venetians resolved not to conclude any thing with Charles the Emperor.
Moreover, the Pope had at this time sent Campeggio, Bishop of Feltre, to the
Venetian Senate, to exhort them to embrace the Universal League, and to put all
other differences which were between them and Caesar, into his hands; alleging
for this his request, that he feared if the Commonwealth should first
con^ederate with the Emperor, and so forego the friendship of the French, the
French would the more hardly be brought to join with the other Christian
Princes in the general League against the Turks: This gave the Senate a just
cause of new delay: but of all things else, Adorno's death did chiefly impede
the conclusion of this business, who died in the beginning of the year 1523. A
wary and wise man, who by his fair carriage, had won favor with the Senators.
Marino Caracciola, the chief Apostolic Notary, who was already gone from
Spain, and destined an Ambassador for Rome, was sent to Venice by Caesar, to
supply his place.

The King of France having certain knowledge of these practices, who did much
suspect them before, sent Renzoda Ceri, and soon after Ambrogio da Fiorenza,
and Monsieur di St Valiere to Venice, that they might assure the Venetians of
the many preparations for War, which were making in France, and of his
resolution of coming himself in person into Italy; and that consequently, they
might solicit the Venetians to order their forces for the sudden attempting
the enterprise of Milan; thinking hereby to remove the chief cause of the
Senate treating of a new confederacy with Caesar, which the King and Court knew
to be, because they feared that Forces would not come so soon, nor so strong
from France as was requisite: But all these endeavors were of less efficacy,
because little belief was given to the words nor promises of the French, of
whom they had heard so much, and seen so little. Wherefore some color for
delay being made, by reason of the endeavors of an universal Truce, as has
been said, which was so much put for by the Pope, the Senate answered the
Ambassadors, That they neither could, nor would do any thing, till they saw an
end of this business, left they might seem to trouble the peace of Italy, and
spoil the hopes of great good to Christendom. But the King of France having
reasons for Truce propounded to him by the Venetians, and by the Pope himself,
said, That he was not dis-enclined to lay down Arms, nor that he did desire to
enjoy what belonged to another; but that his honor would not permit him now to
desist from the recovery of the Dukedom of Milan, which was his; wherein if the
Pope and Venetians would assist him, they should find him very ready for the
future, to do any thing which might be for the common peace and safety: but
that it was in vain to attempt the union of the Christian Princes, and the
settlement of the affairs of Italy, without this. To which purpose, and in
witness of his good will, he sent Lodouico Canosa, Bishop of Bayeux, to Rome,
and to Venice. But howsoever, there was more noise of Wars heard, then effects
seen: so as many months being spent in these transactions, with great variety
of counsels and opinions, Peace and League was at last with great solemnity
concluded between Caesar and the Venetians, the particulars whereof were these.

That the Venetians should possess the Cities; Towns, Villages, and other
places of their Dominion^, in the same Jurisdiction as now they did* That they
should pay two hundred thousand Crowns to Caesar within the space of eight
years. That the Citizens of their State, who had adhered to Caesar, should
return into their Country, and should be received into favor, all faults being
forgiven to such of their Citizens as had followed Caesar 's party, to whom (in
lieu of their confiscated goods) five thousand Ducats of yearly Revenue should
be assigned. That restitution of all places taken, should be made by all
parties, as was agreed upon at Worms; which, as soon as it should be performed
in its other parts, the Venetians should be bound to disburse thirty eight
thousand Ducats, as was likewise determined by the agreement at Worms. That it
should be lawful for the subjects of the Venetians, as also for Caesar 's
subjects, to live freely, and commerce in either of their Dominions, and that
they should be civilly and lovingly treated, as subjects of the same Country.
That for the defense of Milan, Sforza ( for whom Caesar engaged his word) should
be bound to maintain continually in time of Peace, five hundred Curassiers, and
that the Venetians should maintain as many; but that in time of War, the number
should be increased to eight hundred Curassiers, five hundred Light Horse, and
six thousand Foot, with an answerable Train of Artillery; and that Charles
should be obliged to do as much, for the defense of the State of Venice: and
they all of them promised to hinder, for as much as in them lay, the coming of
any victuals to any Enemies Army, which should come to the prejudice of their
States. It was also added, that the Venetians should be particularly obliged to
defend the Kingdom of Naples in time of War, with five and twenty armed
Galleys; which defense was intended to be made against Christian Princes, and
when the Commonwealth should not be busied in any Turkish war. The Kings of
Poland, Hungary, and Portugal, the Duke of Savoy, Commonwealth of Florence,
Antonio Adorno, Duke of Genua, the House of Medici, and the Marquis of
Monferato, were included, as friends to all parties concerned in this
confederacy; and the Pope and King of England were named as Keepers and
Conservators of these Articles.

The Peace being thus concluded, Lorenzo Pri^li, and Andre^ Navagiero were
chosen Ambassadors to be sent from Venice to the Emperor, and Carlo Contarini
to the Archduke, Cesar's brother, to congratulate this renewed confederacy, and
to witness the Senates desire to continue in friendship with the House of
Austria. And because Trivultio, Governor of the Venetian Militia, depended
much upon the French party, that charge was taken from him; yet they were very
civil to him in their words, and seemed very well satisfied with his service,
offering him a pension of three thousand crowns a year, if he would live in the
Commonwealth as a private man, till a better time and occasion should happen.
But he refusing all offers, would return to France. This place, under the same
Title of Commissary General, and upon the same conditions as Trivulcio had
served, was given to Francisco Maria della Rouere, Duke of Urbine, he and his
State being protected by the Commonwealth, against whosoever should molest it.
They discharged themselves to the King of France, answerable to the time and
occasion, excusing this their resolution, partly by reason of the slowness of
his provisions, by which their hopes, which were grounded upon his forces and
assistance, were too much weakened; and partly by reason of the Pope's commands,
that they might no longer hinder, nor delay the Treaty of universal peace,
which he did so affectionately propound and desire.

But the resolution the King of France put on, when he was assured of the
League made between Caesar and the Senate, was certainly very strange, differing
from the common opinion of men, and very void of reason: Whence it may be
conceived, how hard it is to know the secret thoughts of Princes, by any force
of argument, or by the rules of ordinary reason; or to foresee their actions
before they be done. King Francis, who being entreated and solicited by the
Venetians to come into Italy, when he might hope to be received, and assisted
by the Commonwealth, which he in his own judgment knew to be of great
concernment, was either averse thereunto, or at least, but cool therein: now
when he wanted such friendship and aid, when he was sure to meet with great
opposition in Italy, where all were become his enemies, when the dangers and
difficulties appeared to be greatest; resolved to undertake the business of
Milan: But the Duke of Burbon's rebellion being at this time discovered, so as
he had reason to apprehend danger at home, he was forced to forbear that his
fervency at that time; so as tarrying himself with part of his forces in
France, he sent Monsieur di Boniuette, Admiral of France, into Italy, with two
thousand Lanciers, and twelve thousand Foot of several Nations. Though Prospero
Colonna was not ignorant of these preparations, yet did he not so much consider
them, as the importancy of the affair required.

But when the French Army began to move, and that those suspicions proved true,
which he would not credit before, he assembled speedily all the men he could,
and came first to the banks of the Tesino, hoping to hinder the enemies
passage; which quickly finding he could not do, he entered with part of his
soldiers into Milan, and with the rest increased the Garrisons of Pavia and
Cremona, abandoning Lodi; to the end that he might not weaken the more
important places, by dividing his small forces into so many Garrisons. The
Venetians being advertised hereof, that they might readily make good their new
confederacy, ordered their Curassiers to go toward the banks of Oglio, and
resolved at the same time to raise six thousand Foot, and four hundred Light
Horse, for the defense of the State of Milan, and other three thousand to
dispose of in the Garrisons of their Cities. They made Lunardo Emo Commissary
General of the Army, and acquainted the Duke of Urbine, that he would come
speedily into Lombardy, to execute the place which he had taken upon him. But
the Admiral being quickly past over the mountains, and it being said that he
advanced with his Army to pass over the Tesino, the Venetians resolved to bring
their men into Giaradada, to secure the Cities of Bergamo and Crema, and that
they might be the readier to succor Milan. And because the Duke was long a
coming, they sent a Secretary of the Pregadi to hasten him. But the French
having taken up their quarters between Binasco and Bigrassa, twelve miles
distant from Milan, and the Duke not being as yet come unto the Army, they were
doubtful whether they should pass over the Oglio or no. Thinking it then the
safer way to bring their Army (which they understood the French intended to
assault) into some strong place upon the Banks of Ada, where it might be free
from that danger. So the Venetian Camp was at last brought to Pontivico,
whither the Duke of Urbin came within a few days. Not far from hence was the
Marquis of Mantua encamped with other forces: Wherefore Colonna did earnestly
desire both of them, that they would join together, and enter into Lodi, which
was not yet possessed by the Enemy. But they both of them refused to do it; the
Marquis saying that he would go with his men to succor Parma; holding himself
bound to do so, as being a Soldier of the Church; and the Venetians General,
because he thought he could not do it without much danger. So as Lodi being
abandoned by all, fell easily into the French-mens hands. Who having resolved
to succor the Castle of Cremona, sent to Marignano, Frederico Bozzole with
6000 Foot and 400 Launciers, wherewith they began to straiten the City; which
having within it 4000 Foot, and 100 Curassiers, did manfully defend it self,
and beat back the French several times. Yet Cesar's Ambassador and the Duke of
Millans did earnestly entreat the Senate of Venice, that their men might pass
as soon as might be over the River Oglio, and incamp in some strong situation
in the Territories of Cremona; that so by raising jealousies in the French,
they might keep them from persisting in the Enterprise of Cremona. But the
French intended nothing but Milan, before which they were sat down, and that
they might keep it from being relieved, endeavored to hold those forces which
might assist the Besieged, busied else where. For which their intention it made
much that they should keep their men at Caravaggio and Montia, in the
Territories of Cremona: Whereby the Venetian Army was troubled much to advance.

This the Enemies counsel being discovered by the Emperors Commanders, who did
not justly weigh the dangers and difficulties, was the reason why they did
greatly solicit the Venetians, that their men passing suddenly over the Ada
at Trecco, might place themselves somewhere, whereby the City of Milan might be
succored. Whereupon many things being discussed by the Senators, and knowing
that the best resolution to be put on therein, consisted in the particular
condition of places, and variety of accidents, they committed the whole
business to the opinion, faith, and diligence of the Duke their General,
leaving him to do what he thought might make most for the advantage of the
Enterprise, and for the satisfaction of the Colleagues: Having a convenient
regard to the preservation of that Army, on which the security of their State
did chiefly depend. But the Duke, having maturely considered all the
situations, resolved to quarter his men beyond the River Oglio, between Romano
and Martiningo: at which the Imperialists being but badly satisfied, they
desired that the Venetian Camp might be brought nearer Trecco, and that if the
Duke should not think fit to pass with all his men then over the Ada, he should
at least send 3000 Foot, 200 Curassiers, and 100 Light horse to relieve
Colonna, when they should be desired by him to do so. Which thing being very
hardly to be done, the Duke sent Baldisera Signorelli to Milan, to inform
himself more particularly of Colonna's pleasure and designs, and of the Enemies
proceedings. This mean while other succors came to defend the State of Milan;
for 400 Lance Knights, whom Caesar had taken into pay in the Archdukes
Country* came to the Territories of Verona, by the way of Trent; and the
Viceroy of Naples was already on his way with an Army: To whom for his greater
honor, the Venetians sent their Ambassador Carlo Contarini to meet him, and
to be assistant to him. The Duke of Burbone was likewise speedily expected,
whom Caesar had declared to be his Lieutenant General, in Italy, and to whom he
had committed the whole management of the War. Yet amidst the fury of arms, the
business of agreement between the Emperor and the most Christian King was not
pretermitted. The Archbishop of Bari, who was once Nuntio from the Pope in
France, was at this time gone into Spain, to treat upon the conditions of
peace. Which though of it self it was pleasing to the Commonwealth, in
relation to the general agreement, yet could they not but be troubled thereat,
by reason that by former example they could not be totally free from fear that
these two Princes might agree, leaving them out, and peradventure to their
prejudice. Yet the Senate unwilling to be faulty to the obligations of
confederacy, without some more evident reason, gave commission to their
Commissaries, that if the Imperialists should have a mind to go into the field
with all their Forces, they should join with the Viceroy of Naples, and pass
over the Ada: But so as they might leave good Garrisons for the security of
their Towns, and be sure to quarter themselves in some strong and safe place,
and that above all things they should shun being necessitated to go into Milan.

But however, the execution of this Order was delayed; nor did the Army pass
over the Ada: For the Duke of Urbane thought it not safe, to go into the field
with those men, till the Lance Knights, and the Marquis of Mantua's forces were
arrived: and especially, having understood, that more Switzers were come into
the French camp, so as they now amounted to the number of 10000. Wherefore,
being desired by the Imperialists to go with his Army to Belrisguarda, he
refused to go; for, that quarter being but bare four miles from the French
camp, he had reason to fear, that being so near the Enemy, he might be forced
to fight, against his will, and upon disadvantage: He was moreover troubled, to
think that the Territories of Crema, or of Burgamo, might be assaulted by those
of Lodi, whether 2000 Switzers were lately come: which Country was threatened
also with another danger, it being given out, that 6000 Grisons were sent by
the King of France to endammage it; who, just at this time, had dismissed the
Venetian Ambassador his Court. But at last, the Viceroy continuing to
solicit the joining of Forces, the Senate, to avoid the giving suspicion of
any distrust, resolved to send again to the Duke of Urbane, to join with the
Imperialists; having, the mean while, taken into pay 3000 Italian Foot, and 400
Light Horse in Greece, for the preservation and safety of their State; and the
charge of these men was given to Iovanni Moro, who was then chosen Podesta of
Crema, with the Title of Commissary General in Bresciana: and Emo, who was
Commissary of the camp, being at that same time very sick, he got leave of the
Senate to return to his own Country; and Pietro Pesaro was chosen in his place.
But Carlo Contarini, after having staid a while with the Viceroy, was sent to
Milan, to the end that a Public person might be near the Duke, till such time
as Marc' Antonio Veniero, who was intended to be sent Embadour to him, but was
now sick, might go to perform his Embassy. By the Venetians drawing near to
the Town of Trecco, the Marquis of Mantua being gone, to the same purpose, to
Pavia, the French Army was brought to a great scarcity of Victuals; all
passages being blocked up, by which provisions were formerly brought to the
camp: in which the Venetians Greecian Horss did very good service: So as the
Admiral fearing least his Army might be reduced to the same necessity,
whereunto he had thought to reduce Milan, he resolved to enlarge the siege, and
to take up his quarters 12 miles further off. The Apostolic Sea being at this
time two months vacant, by the death of Adrian, a new Pope, to the general joy
and satisfaction of all men, was chosen: For Iulio, Cardinal of Medici, being
called up to the Supreme dignity, who was afterward called Clement the 7th,
and was held by all men to be of a mature Judgmement, great Ingenuity, and of
admirable dexterity, in weighty and important business; it was thought, that
Christendom was fitly provided of such a head, as did become the conditions of
those times.

The Senate, desirous to do all honor and reverence to the new Pope, resolved
to send him eight Ambassadors, all of them chief Senators of the
Commonwealth, to congratulate his election, and to do their obeissance to him:
These were, Marco Dandalo, Ierolomi da Pesaro, Dominico Veniero, Vicenzo
Carepello, Thomasa Contarino, Lorenzo Braggadino, Nicolo Tiepolo, and Luigi
Bono. Soon after, the Duke Antonio Grimani dyed, having had the Dukedom only
22 months: His funeral Oration was made by Frederico Valeresso, a young man,
very eminent for his learning; and he was honored with a stately Tomb in St.
Antonie's Church: Andree Gritti was created Duke in his place; a man of great
worth and fame, who had for many years before been employed in all the most
important businesses of the Commonwealth, both at home and abroad; as partly
may be seen by what we have related: So as it fell out very happily for the
Commonwealth; that in time of so great commotions of Arms, a man of mature
Wisdom, and of very great Experience should happen to be their head. Thus
ended the Year 1523.

The Year 1524 followed: In the beginning whereof, the Affairs of France, which
did already begin to decline, fell into much greater, and irreparable ruin:
For the Admiral being brought into great streights, both of Victuals and money,
so as many soldiers left the camp every day, did notwithstanding still
continue obstinately in his opinion, increasing rather the disorders thereby,
then seeking to remedy them, by some new resolves, till such time, as he was
glad to free the State of Milan from all danger, rather by his flight, then by
his retreat, as shall be said hereafter. By the enemi^s falling further off,
the Venetian Army was advanced to join with the Viceroy, and with the Marquis
of Mantua, who leaving a sufficient Garrison in Milan, were come before to
those quarters; so as the Imperialists being very strong, came too within five
miles of the French camp: and did not only hinder them from making any further
proceedings, but did much indammage them; hindering, and disturbing their
victuals: and afterward, assuming more courage, the Venetians and Imperialists
passed over the Tessino, near Pavia, to make themselves masters of the Country,
and to keep the Enemy from those things which it did furnish them withal.
Which the French Commanders not having timely foreseen, they were likewise
forced to pass over the River, to oppose the Imperialists designs: But the
Duke of Urbane being gotten beyond the Tessino, began to possess himself of the
Country, and much to the praise of the Venetian soldiers, stormed the Town of
Garlasco, a place esteemed strong, both by situation and Art, and wherein there
was a good Garrison, and did advance so gallantly with his Army, as many Towns
did of themselves come in to the Imperialists; which harms the Admiral had
hoped to prevent, rather by the forces and advice of others then his own; for
having heard that Renzo da Ceri being already come to the confines of the State
of Venice with 8000 Grisons, was ready to enter with them into the Territories
of Bergamo, he thought that the Venetians, moved by this danger, would have
recalled their Forces, to defend their own affairs: he hoped likewise that the
Switzers, which were sent him by the King, would come quickly, whereby he might
recrute his Army, which was much diminished: but failling in both these hopes;
for the Venetians provided sufficiently against the Invasion of the Grisons,
who finding that they were likely to meet with opposition, and not with help,
as was promissed them, retreated quickly to their homes: and the Switzers being
come to the River which they found so swollen, as they could not pass over it,
were forced to stay on the other side of the River; so as the Admiral marched
thetherward, but was still pursued by the Imperialists, and infected by them,
and throwing a bridge over the Sesia, passed his whole Army over it, that he
might join with the Switzers, and put himself into better order. But the
Imperialists, finding in what disorder the French were in, (for in their March
they had left many pieces of artillery, and other ammunition behind them,)
desired the Duke of Urbane, that he would together with them pass over the
Lesia, and so make use of the occasion which was offered them, of destroying
the Enemies Army totally: Which request the Duke did not deny, l^st the enemy
might have stayed there, if they had not been followed: But howsoever resolving
to go no further, (for the Articles of confederacy were fulfilled on the
Venetians part, in his having defended the state of Milan:) he ordered
Commissary Pietro da Pesaro, that, the very day which was destined for the
passing over Sesia, he should retreat with the Foot: and the Imperialists
beginning to pass over the next day before day break, the Duke passed over
likewise with all his Horse: which when the French understood, they quitted
their quarters, and hasted to return back over the mountains, lest they might
have been fallen upon by two Armies. The Duke after he had ridden a little
further on with the Imperialists, told them the Commonwealth was not bound to
do any more then what they had done, nor could he enter into the Duke of
Savoy's Country without a new Commission; so passing back again over the River,
he joined with Commissary Pesaro: for which the Duke was very much praised;
who, having showed his wisdom, valor, and Loyalty, in this, as in all his
other actions, the Senate, in acknowledgment of his deserts, though he had
served but some few months of 5 years which he was to serve, honored him with
the Title of Captain General, gave him the command of the Curassiers, and added
to his stipend; and his name grew very famous throughout all Italy.

While the Venetians were busied in this War, they were threatened elsewhere
with great dangers, and were full of Jealousy; which put them to many other
expenses: for they daily discovered more haughty and ambitious thoughts in
Soliman the Emperor of the Turks, numerous Armies, great preparations of
Fleets, and a mighty desire of Warlike glory. Wherefore their State being to be
in continual jealousy, by reason of the power and ambition of so formidable an
neighbor, the Commonwealth kept all her places by Sea strongly garrisoned;
especially the Island of Cyprus, which they knew Soliman did very much thirst
after. To supply so many expenses, they were forced to take several
extraordinary courses for the raising of moneys; particularly, by many Lones of
particular Citizens, and Cities; who seeing the occasion, did, with much
readiness, offer some of them 10000 Ducats, some more, according to their
several abilities. The difficulties with the house of Austrea were not at this
time fully ended, nor all the Capitulations agreed upon: Wherefore, Guiddo
d'alla Torre was sent to Venice by the Archduke Ferdinand, with whom they
treated, and concluded what belonged to the restitution of the places in
Friuli: But more difficulties arising concerning the parts about Verona, to put
an end thereto, it was resolved, that Commissioners should be sent, from all
parties concerned, to Riva di Trento; whether the Arduke's Commissioners being
come first, and not finding those of the Venetians there, after a short stay,
they departed, and left the business undecided: nay, new disputes arose to
hinder the effecting of what was formerly agreed upon with la Torre: so as to
the great displeasure of the Venetians, this root of discension between the
Commonwealth, and the house of Austrea remained yet alive. At this time, the
King of France, not having given over his thoughts concerning the affairs of
Italy, for all his Armies unfortunate success; nor any whit abated his former
fervency; but being the rather more incensed, for that the Imperialists, not
content to have defended the State of Milan, had endeavored to trouble him in
his own Kingdom, and to provoke the King of England against him, had been very
sollicitous, and careful in providing all things necessary for his own coming
very speedily, and very strong, into Italy: which he might the easier do, by
reason that all his men were returned safe into France. The Venetians were much
troubled at these mighty and important preparations of the French: Not only in
relation to the great expenses and disturbances, to which they were obliged by
the League which they had made with Caesar, for the defense of the State of
Milan; but for fear of their own affairs: The King appearing to be very much
offended with them, not only for what they had at first done against him; but
for that being afterward desired to reassume their friendship with him, they
would not forego Caesar: and for that Martino Bouolino, being lately come to
Venice, in the names of the Lords of the three Leagues, to entreat and exhort
the Senate to renew their ancient confederacy with the French, the Senate
persisting in their opinion, and justifying their last actions, by the
necessity of the times, and by the Popes command, said they could not at the
present satisfy their desires, by reason of their new League; which they could
not be faulty to, without some marks of infamy, and peradventure not without
some danger. Therefore things continuing in their former condition, and the
French Army passing notwithstanding over the Mountains, the Venetians made all
their Soldiers which were in the several Garrisons of the State, be brought to
the Territories of Verona: and having thereof framed the body of an Army, they
commanded the Duke of Urbi^, and the Commissary Pesaro, to come speedily
thither, and there to expect Orders from them.

But the Pope, being more afraid, and full of jealousies, did continually
solicit the Venetians to keep inviolably in good intelligence with him, and
in reciprocal good will, and to proceed always with one and the same advice and
counsel, since the respects were the same in them both, for the defense of
their own particular States, and for the common Liberty of Italy. He commended
their keeping fast to the Imperialists, and their minding the defense of the
State of Milan, if they really thought they could do it; but that if they
should see they were not able to resist the powerful Forces of France, they
should begin betimes to reconcile themselves with the most Christian King, not
tarrying to make peace upon unreasonable conditions, when the King should use
such insolences toward them, as do usually accompany the victories and good
fortune of Princes: That they must consider the power of the French was very
great, and apt to turn the whole State of Italy upside down: Since to boot with
the numerous Army which the King brought with him, his Forces that had defended
Marcelles (now that that City was freed from danger) were embarked for Italy,
and bent against the Kingdom of Naples, And on the contrary, that all the
Emperors designs upon the Kingdom of France were proved vain, and no less then
the rest, their hopes grounded upon the Duke of Burbones rebellions. That the
King of England growing apprehensive of the Emperors too much greatness, gave
certain signs that he would not keep the capitulations made with him: Wherefore
if it should be thought fit for the Church, and the Commonwealth, to think of
an accommodation with the Christian King, they must not lose time, which was to
their manifest danger and prejudice: But that they should rather send
sufficient commission to their Ambassador Marco Foscari, who was at Rome, to
intervene and listen to those Treaties, which were already promised by the
French.

Which things though they were propounded by the Pope by the way of advice, yet
it was evident that he was inclined to a new confederacy with the French, to
secure the State of the Church, and State of Florence; which he had the greater
care of, because the Duke of Albany being to pass through Tuscany, to the
prejudice of Cesar's affairs, the Florentines were exposed to more certain and
nearer danger. But the Pope, cloaking this particular Interest as much as he
could, labored to prove that his only aim was at universal peace, and to free
Italy from War, for the common good of Christendom; and that he labored to
break the business to the King of France, to dispose him the easilier to an
agreement with Charles and Ferdinand of Austria. To which purpose he said he
would send (as he did afterward) his Almner Mattheo Giberto to entreat the
King to make peace with Caesar. But which commission even then, as was
afterward known, to negotiate particular conventions for himself, and for the
Florentines; the Commonwealths interest, being neither wholly left out, nor
wholly considered. But the Senate were of opinion, that no greater necessity
appearing, they were not to forego their friendship and confederacy with Caesar,
as unwilling to show so much inconstancy, as also not to make the Emperor
their Enemy, before they had more certainty of the King of France his good
will: And therefore they had resolved that their men should enter in to the
Dukedom of Milan, for Cesars service. But the Duke of Urbin, not obeying this
order suddenly, gave them to understand that it was very dangerous for the
affairs of the Commonwealth, to pass at that time so forward with the Army; for
by securing the State of Milan so early by their forces, they gave the Enemy
occasion to turn elsewhere, and peradventure, upon their Commonwealth; that
therefore they might expect till the French Army was passed over the River
Sisa, and then put their resolution in effect. But the French without any
delay, came into the State of Milan, before it was thought they would have
done; so as the whole Army drew near the City, and got into the Suburbs by the
Gate Ticinese, before the City, which was but ill provided of Rampires and
victuals, could be sufficiently succored. So as all the Imperial Commanders
together with their men, that were within the Town, were glad to retreat
suddenly: the Duke of Bourbon, the Viceroy, and Sforza, went to Soncino, and
the Marquis of Piscara to Lodi: But their chief care was, how to Garrisonnize
the City of Pavia very strongly, which they thought might be better defended
then any of the other Cities. They therefore put Antonio da Leva thereinto,
with three hundred Curassiers, and five thousand Foot, part Spanish, part
Dutch, all of them being old Soldiers.

Thus did the French easily get Milan, which was abandoned by the Imperialists.
But the King would not suffer the Soldiers to enter the Town, to preserve it
from sacking.

At the same time, John Stuart, Duke of Albany, sent by the King of France to
assault the Kingdom of Naples, with two hundred Lanciers, seven hundred Light
Horse, and four thousand Switzers, desired leave of the Pope to pass through the
State of the Church, and through Tuscany, to go to Naples; which the French did
the rather endeavor, that the Imperial Forces drawing toward those parts, the
State of Milan might be the weaklier defended, whereof many Towns did daily
surrender, without making almost any opposition: But the main point of the War
was brought to about Pavia, to the taking whereof, the King was come in person
with his whole Army, firmly resolving not to rise from before it, till he had
taken it; for he thought, that to leave a City of the Enemies behind him, so
well munited with men, would be to the danger, and certainly, to the dishonor
of that his Army, which was said to consist of above 24000 Foot, 2000
Curassiers, a great Train of Artillery, and wherein were all the famous
Warriors of France: and on the other side, the Cesarians placed their chiefest
hopes of good event, in the preservation of that City; wherefore all men's eyes
were turned upon this business, whereupon other important effects were to
depend.

The Pope and the Venetians were chiefly solicitous herein; fearing on the one
side, that the French forces, who were but badly satisfied with them, might
prove victorious; and on the other side, that if the Imperialists should beat
the French, they would remain the sole Arbytrators of all Italy: So as it being
hard to know which party it was best to take to, in so difficult a business,
they spun it out in length, pitching almost upon a Neutrality; therefore
neither did their men go to assist the Imperialists, neither did they come to
any agreement, with the French; but expecting what the success at Pavia would
be, which the Town being now besieged, would require some time, they thought to
make advantage of time.

Yet the Pope, to the end that if need should be, he might come to better
conclusion with the French, he by means of his Almner, who was already sent to
the camp, did negotiate diverse things tending to agreement. To the which the
King of France seeming to be very well inclined, the business would have been
soon agreed, had not the arival of some new advertizements stopped it on the
Popes behalf; for News being come that 6000 Dutch Foot, which were sent by the
Emperor to relieve Milan, were already come to Ispruch, with whom the
Archduke Ferdinand was to come himself in person into Italy; and also that the
Spanish Foot which were destined for the same purpose, were already embarked
the Pope being somewhat encouraged, and thinking it stood with his honor (since
he was not enforced by any greater necessity) to seem that he had realy
(according as it was given out) sent his Almner to the French camp to treat of
general peace, together with particular agreement; sent Paolo Vittori to the
Viceroy, to witness unto him his great desire answerable to the place he was
in, to make peace between the King of France and Caesar, so as they might both
attend, according to their callings, to repair the present mischiefs, which
were threatened Christendom by Soliman, who was already armed in the field. That
having therein all fitting respect to Cesar's benefit and satisfaction he would
propound very good conditions unto him, if, as he had often affirmed, his mind
were inclined to peace.

To wit, that he might freely keep possession of the Kingdom of Naples, wherein
he would oblige himself to maintain, and defend him: And that the French should
possess the Dukedom of Milan, but upon particular promise, not to make any
other attempt upon Italy, without the Popes consent.

Which negotiations being held on for a few days, produced no other fruit, but
diverse jealousies, both in the French, and Spaniards; so as both parties did
continue to solicit the Venetians to favor them; Girolemo de Pij came to
Venice, on the behalf of the French, endeavoring that the Commonwealth would
renew their Friendship with the most Christian King, or at least, that she
would not be against him. And the Viceroy sent Charles of Aragon thither,
desiring the Senate that they would cause their men to join with the
Imperialists. The French Ambassador was answered in general terms, showing
that they had referred this whole business to the Pope; but they gave the
Viceroy many reasons why they had delayed sending their men. Thus they
continued to proceed irresolutely a good while; till at last the Pope having
made agreement, though very secretly, with the King of France, in behalf of
himself and of the Venetians; reserving a caution unto themselves, and entering
protestation likewise, that they did not enter into the League to interrupt the
general peace; the Senate was necessitated to come to some resolution. Many
things, and with much diversity of opinion were consulted hereupon. And the
Senate being met upon a day appointed, to put a final end to the business;
Georgio Cornaro, Procurator, who had still been of the same opinion, spoke thus.

I was never of their minds, who think that States may be always governed by
the same Rule; and who are for the continuing in the same opinion on which they
have once been of, without distinguishing of times or affairs. I very well know
the uncertainty and variety of th^se affairs that we busy our selves about in
these our discussions, and therefore I do little rely upon my self* or my own
judgment; and I use not to be t^o forward in speaking my sense of things, lest
I may say somewhat which I may afterward repent: Which custom of mine I do
now the more willingly follow, for that the business is dubious and difficult,
and subject to various and important accidents. We speak of making a new League
with the King of France, and of foregoing that which but some months ago we
made with Caesar, which was published, and begun to be observed. I see that the
State of the affairs of Italy is in a sho^t time altered; and our designs,
hopes, and fears, altered through new accidents; but I see also and very well
know, that this fluctuation and variety is such, as we cannot ground any
counsels we can take, upon assured foundations; nor can we presume that o^r
this days results, though now good, will prove so to morrow; for the Fortune of
War is still in question, and what the success shall be of the offense, or
defense of the State of Milan, is uncertain: The whole condition of the
affairs of Italy is most uncertain, she is shaken and disturbed by the arms of
two of the chiefest Princes of Christendom. Wherefore, to know whereupon we may
with most s^^ety repose our hopes, and our advices, we must accurately consider
the State of affairs; ballancing the various, nay rather, contrary respects;
but chiefly, we must lay aside all affection of love or fear, by which we may
be yet more blinded in coming to the knowledge of this truth, which is of it
self obscure, and hand to be f^und.

The King of France is come into Italy with a most powerful Army contrary to
the opinion of all men; and therefore finding the State of Mi^lan for the most
part unprovided, he has so happily begun his Enterprise as by marching, not by
fighting, by the bare name and reputation o^ his Forces, he without use of
weapons, or exposing himself to danger, has put the Enemy to flight, won a
great part of the Country, taken the very City of Milan and found all things
prosperous and obedient: But it seems this his too hasty Fortune is very soon
at an end; and having now sat down before Pavia, he meets with expense of
time, and unexpected difficulties, in compassing his end: so as the issue
thereof is not only doubtful, but the whole fortune, and end of the War,
depends thereupon. It is above forty days since the French sat down before
Pavia; yet do we not find their hopes of getting it, much increase, nor the
courage and fervency of those that do defend it, diminish; nor the Imperial
Commanders slacken in their diligence to relieve it: It is certainly a very
hard bu^iness to foresee the event of this Siege; but it is easy to know, that
all other successes will for the most part depend upon this: for the
Imperialists having the Cities of Lodi and Cremona, whereinto they have put
great Garrisons, and are very busy in fortifying them, if they can likewise
defend Pavia, who (as we know) do expect a succor of Spanish and Dutch Foot to
be brought them by the Archduke Ferd^n^nd himself, they may easi^y maintain the
State of Milan, and force the French to pass back over the mountains; and the
more numerous their Army is, and full of all the Nobility of France, so much
the more it may be doubted that it may disband, both by reason of the great
expense, and inconveniences, which it will not be long able to undergo; as
also, out of the natural custom of that Nation, not go^d at patiently
supporting any enterprise long, as of late years we have had many experiences.
If then this should happen, as it easi^y may, and that the French being either
driven away by the Enemies Forces, or confused by their own disorders, should
forgo the Dukedom of Milan, and should return to France, and that we shall have
abandoned Caesar 's friendship, not have valued our Confederacy, broken our
Covenants, and by this ou^ inconstancy and fickleness of faith, shall have
purchased, not only the Emperor's d^spleasure, but shall grow hateful to all
men, what is it that we may not have reason to fear: The Imperialists being so
very strong, s^^ll satisfied with us, fit to offend us, and disposed so to do?
Whereby our own troubles will not be a little increased, and our afflictions
and dangers will be the less compassionated by others, since it is our selves
who have been the occasion of our mischief, which God grant it may not prove
very great; and that (together with our own ruin) we draw not after us, the
r^ine of all Italy: For the Imperialists being armed, and strong in Italy, as
they are, and the counterpo^se of the French Forces being taken away, who knows
not that they will not only possess the State of Milan quietly, but will be
Arbytrators of all the affairs of Italy. For the prevention whereof, si^ce the
Forces of all the Italian Princes are not able to make head against him, and
effectually oppose so great and formidable a Power,

There is no other remedy against so eminent a danger, but to take all occasion
of anger from the Emperor, by showing our selves ready and willing, whereby he
may be the more induced to establish peace. But if we should be otherwise
minded, it is not these reasons only which persuades us to continue our
confederacy with Caesar, but even necessity does force us so to do. For, for us
only to follow this advice, and to unhearde our selves from the other
Potentates of Italy, in the defense of common liberty, would be to take too
great a weight upon us, with no small danger: For I know not what grounds we
can have to rely upon the other Princes of Italy. The Pope is immoderately
fearful, inconstant, irresolute in his Counsels, low in moneys, and ready to
repose his safety rather in the reverence which is born unto his person, and in
the respect which is to be had unto the Church, then in his own forces, or
those of his confederates; The Florentines must do as he does: The Duke of
Ferara, fearing to be bereft of the City of Modena by the Pope, and of Reggio,
is ready to side with any body, and come what will come, to close with the most
powerful, ^o^ save his own stake: And the other lesser Potentates, not
thinking that they depend upon the Authority of any others; so as they may by
any means, preserve themselves will side with the Conqueror. But on the other
side, if we shall continue our League made with Caesar, and that the French get
the upper hand in this War; we are not to fear the like dangers, for our
Counsels, and Actions, will be much excused by the tie of our League with
Caesar, which is very well known to the French; and which they know it was
necessity which forced us to no free will; nor was it without some fault of
theirs, by reason of their slowness in making necessary provisions for
maintaining War against Caesar. Moreover, as we being mindful of the friendship
which for these many years we have had with them, those respects and dangers
being over, shall willingly join with them; so it is to be believ^d that they
will have the like inclination; which clearly shown by their Kings having so
often and so fervently pressed us to close again with him, and to renew our
ancient friendship, and confederacy. But that which may better witness his will
thereunto, is his own interest, which will always easily persuade him, to
endeavor our friendship, and to put an esteem upon it; either to keep what he
has gotten, or to make further acquisitions in Italy: For he shall happen to
drive the Spaniards out of the State of Milan, he will not notwithstanding,
have driven them out of all Italy: Nay, as long as the Spaniards possess the
Kingdom of Naples, so Noble and so Principal a place, the French will still
have new suspicions of their Forces, and new desires to possess themselves of
that Kingdom; to the which they pretend as well as to the State of Milan:
Wherein our Forces, and our assistants will be too useful for them to make them
despise us or to refuse our friendship. By all these reasons it clearly
appears, that come what will come, we may more easily make friendship with the
French, then with the Spaniard. Therefore, my opinion is, that whilst things
are in this doubtfulness, and suspention, and the event of War so uncertain, we
make not too much have to have that with danger, which we may soon after hope
to have with more honor, and safety, when there shall be a fitter occasion to
treat: For the p^esent, we may do better to temporize, and put our selves as
little as we can out of our own power; neither to agree with the French, nor
totally to satisfy the Imperialists, but to wait the advantage of time: for a
few days will show us what we had best to do, for the safety of our
Commonwealth, and for the Liberty of Italy.

Cornaro was willingly listened unto, and his wise counsel much commended: But
to the contrary of his opinion, Dominico Trivisan, Procurator, and a Senator of
great authority, spoke thus.

Our Commonwealth is at the present in such a condition, both in respect of the
potent Princes, who set all their thoughts, and bend all their Forces upon
Italy; and in respect of our own low and weak condition, by reason of long
Wars, such expenses, so many, and so grievous misfortunes, for so many years,
as we are necessitated to accommodate our selves to the times, and to change
often our opinions, our thoughts, our friends, and our enemies, to be jealous
of all Powers, to fear much, to be but little confident, and vigilantly
observing other men's ways, to govern our selves accordingly; having amidst this
Inconstancy, a constant, and firm object in all our actions, to wit, the safety
of our State, and the flourishing of our Commonwealth: By doing thus, we have
freed our Commonwealth from many calamities, whereinto she was fallen of late
years: By the like we may still preserve her, and bring her at last into a
quiet condition. We have for many years past followed the friendship of the
French, and therein made trial both of prosperous and adverse fortune; but in
these last days, finding that the King of France neglected the affairs of
Italy, and that the burden of the War whereinto we entered to serve him, lay
upon us, we were forced to close with Caesar, to provide in time for our own
safety. When we were joined with the Imperialists, we were not wanting in our
duties; but by the assistance of our forces, and of our Armies, the Admiral was
driven out of Italy, and the Dukedom of Milan secured: But if the Imperialists
have drawn the King of France his forces again into Italy, by provoking him,
and by assaulting him in his own Dominions, and that through their negligence,
and by their not having provided time enough for the affairs of War, they have
left the way open and easy for a new Invasion into the Dukedom of Milan, Are
we to make good their faults, or to supply their Omissions? He who shall
consider all things aright, will always think, that the French first, and now
the Spaniard, have rather been wanting both to themselves and us, then we to
any of them: But such considerations are more esteemed of, by reason of a
certain institution of this State, of preserving their Word and Honesty, then
out of the ordinary reason of State used now adays by Princes; who measure all
things by their own peculiar Interests. Let us then consider according to this
true rule, what we are now to do; Whether (as the present condition of affairs
stand, we may hope for greater security, peace, and quiet, by the King of
France his friendship, or by the Emperors. We have always constantly hel^, that
the chief means to preserve our Commonwealth, and the Liberty of Italy, in
these mis^rable times whereinto we are fallen, is to keep these two potent
Princes powers equally counterpoised, that, of the Most Christian King,
Francis; and that, of Charles the Emperor. And that to endeavor that both of
them may have some footing in Italy, since the power, forces, and intelligence
of the Italian Princes is not able to drive them both out, is a good and
wholesome advice: So as that there may be continual emulations, suspicions, and
jealousies between them. This it is that makes them put an high esteem upon the
Friendship of the Commonwealth, and endeavor it by all means: For he who can
join with us, gets the better of the other, is more certain to keep what he
has, and confides more in getting what he desires. If we then shall continue
in League with Caesar, and shall by our Forces make his weakness good; and when
his Armies shall be grown stronger, and we joining with them, we shall
endeavor to drive King Francis out of Italy, (as lately befell his Commanders,
and his Army) are we not aware that we do hereby draw great mischief upon our
selves, and put all Italy under the Spanish yoke; and by confirming them in
the greatest part thereof, make way for their immoderate ambition to become
Masters of the rest. The French, if all these their so great Forces shall prove
vain, will despair of ever doing good in Italy; they will turn their
Weapons, and their thoughts elsewhere, especialy when they shall see that all
Italian Princes grow obdurate against them; it will be then too late to have
recourse to them for help against so emminent slavery, or to curb the
Spaniards insolency; for all that is said by him who is of a contrary opinion,
makes much for what I say: Since the greater Caesar 's power grows, the more
need have we to withstand it betimes, by endeavoring to moderate it, and by
not permitting, that, through our idleness, or (as some would have it) through
our assistance, it grow more formidable. But if it be good for us at the
present, neither to assist the Imperialists, as we are bound by our League to
do, nor yet to join in new confederacy with the French; we must consider on
the contrary, that this our slowness may produce the same effect, as our total
alienation from the King of France would do; for by prolonging the War, the
end thereof will be always doubtful: Which may the more easily happen, for
that we are certain the power of the Imperialists will increase very much, who
finding themselves at the present inferior in Forces to the French, we may
assure our selves, that when they shall know that our Forces, wherein they do
not a little trust, shall be turned against them, they will come to some
agreement, and will yield up the possession of the Dukedom of Milan; which is
already in part lost, and so the War will be ended, and greater dangers for a
time secured: So as by our speedy resolution the sole name and reputation of
our friendship may be of more advantage to the French, and in my opinion,
consequently to our selves, then our whole Forces will be able to do at
another time, if we do not retard our resolution. And if we shall forbear
resolving any thing, to the end that in so great a suspension and doubt of
Affairs, we may be the better advised, and stay till we see an end of the War,
or at least which way it is likely to lean, to the end that we may serve the
time, and accomodate our selves to the fortune of the Conqueror; I am
confident we shall be no less deceived therein; nay it may be our neutrallity
will be so much the more pernicious, for that we are secure on neither side,
and come what will come, we are exposed to the discretion of the Conqueror.
For it is not to be hoped that Caesar seeing himself abandoned by us at his
greatest need, will bear us any respect when he shall be at the highest pitch
of his prosperity: Nor that King Francis, who has so often in vain sought our
friendship, when his fortune, though favorable, was yet doubtful, will have us
for his Friends and Confederates, when he shall be totally Victor, and free
from the fear of his Enemies: It is then the best course by much, to side early
with those, whom we may promise our selves we may make use of, as our truest
friends and neighbors, who can most opportunely assist us in our affairs, and
who we have reason to believe, will in this great action bear away the victory;
and these are doubtlesly the French, with whom we have been joined in Amity for
these many years, between whom and us there has past so many friendly offices,
and reciprocal good will, who have the same affections, respects, and ends that
we have, to allay Caesar 's immoderate greatness. I am of opinion, that we ought
to carry our selves much otherwise in these affairs, then he advised, who spoke
last; for it is often seen, tha^ greatest hatreds and enmities falls out
amongst those, who have been nearest joined in affection and love, which
usually happens, because the omissions of a friend, who is tied by many
obligations to another, is held to be greater, then those of a stranger would
be; wherefore if we, who have so many ties of obligation to the King of France,
shall defraud his hopes, and interrupt his designs, by separating our selves
from him, I know not how we can hope, if we let slip this occasion, to regain
his favor; and though his own Interests may persuade him to embrace our
friendship, yet we must think that Princes are but men, and subject to like
affections as other men are, nay more then others, because they may the more
easily satisfy their appetite. Anger therefore conceived by the King against
us, may be of greater force, then any reason which should persuade him to the
contrary: But that which more imports our present Resolves, is, we see that
Fortune favors the French very much, and is ready to settle them in full
possession of the Dukedom of Milan, the King himself is in Italy with a
powerful Army, to the very fame whereof, as many Cities have already yielded,
so must Pavia quickly do to its Forces, and whatsoever else the Imperialists
hold in this State. Moreove^, the Duke of Albeny is ready to pass with a great
many men into the Kingdom of Naples, to molest the Imperialists also in those
parts who to succor it, will be forced to divide their men, and be the less
able to defend the State of Milan: I see not therefore upon what foundation he
grounded his judgment, who sought on the contrary, to show that Pavia may be
maintained, and that the ^rench Army will soon disband. We know by the last
advises, that that City is brought into great straits of all things, and that
the Dutch Foot, who were at first so ready to defend it, being now oppressed by
many sufferings, and not satisfied for their want of pay, do daily raise such
tumults, as they make their Commanders despair of any good success; the
Viceroy, and Duke of Bourbon confess, that unless Pavia be re^eved within a few
days, it must be lost, and then withal, the whole Dukedom of Milan: And what
hopes can there be of relieving a City environed with so great and so valiant
an Army, there being but few men in it, and fa^^ing of its expected succor. I
therefore think, that it may be feared with reason, that the Imperialists
despairing to be able to defend the State of Milan, will make use of all their
forces in the Kingdom of Naples, and the whole burden of the War will rest
upon us, if we do not early stave off this danger: And certainly, it is too
strait a precinct wherein he thought to save himself, and whereinto to reduce
our hopes, who dissuade us from friendship with the French, and slight this
safer receptacle, affirming that the Kings Army will disband of its self, and
will be ruined by its own disorders. On the contrary, methinks that nothing
has been attempted of many late years by the French Nation in Italy, which
has a fairer aspect of constant will, and of assured success, then this
present business, wherein the King seems to be very fervent, wherein the whole
glory, and warlike honor of that Nation is concerned, there being therein the
better sort of people, and the most cried up Commanders that France has; and
it being assuredly known, that if their so great Forces prove vain this time,
the Crown of France must for ever give over whatsoever it pretends unto in
Italy, and much to its shame, and to its greatest dishonor, tolerate Caesar 's
so vast greatness, and the like of the Spanish Nation, which is very odious to
them. Whence it may be probably argued, that the French will be very constant
in their prosecuting this Siege of Pavia, and that finally, they must have the
better of the whole war, the end whereof, as it becomes the wisdom of this
State to foresee, so it becomes us in like wisdom to provide early against
those evils into which our State may by such accidents fall, and to make use of
those means, which God of his Divine grace, has offered us, by suddenly
concluding a Confederacy with the most Christian King, which has been offered
us by him himself, and propounded unto us.

These words of Trevisano wrought very much upon the auditory; and his reasons,
together with the inclination which the Venetians have commonly had to France,
in memory of their long friendship with that Nation, did at last prevail; but
they were no less persuaded thereunto, by the fear which they had, on the one
side, of the present danger of the French, and on the other side, of Cesars
future ambition. Peace was then established and concluded with the French, by
means of Ambassadors at Rome; and was afterward confirmed in Venice, in the
beginning of January, the year 1525.

It was said in the preamble thereof, That Pope Clement, from the very
beginning of his Popedom, had always had peace between Christian Princes, for
his principal object, but that he could not effect this his desire before now,
by reason of diverse impediments and difficulties; that the present condition of
times would not permit the deferring of laying the groundwork of universal
Peace, by accomodating the affairs of Italy; wherefore his Holiness, and the
Venetian Senate, knowing that the most Christian King was well inclined to the
quiet and safety of Italy, long vexed with perpetual war, which drew on also
other wars, were come to agreement with the said King, not to offend one
another, nor to assist or favor either others enemies; whereby some hopes of
Peace was commenced: and moreover, the Venetians agreed to renew their former
interrupted confederacy with the King; but with a particular condition, of not
being bound to assist him in this present business.

These things being privately concluded, the Senate excusing themselves for not
making their men advance, answered the Emperor's Agents, who still pressed for a
resolution, That they could not disobey the Pope, the rather, for that it was
hoped, Peace would ensue thereupon; whereof the Pope, with Cesar's consent, had
begun to Treat: they therefore would not interrupt it, by fomenting the War, or
occasioning the prolongation thereof.

The agreement being thus established, the King sent Monsieur di Ron Cafore, to
congratulate the concluded League, and to testify his continual good will
toward the Commonwealth; though through the malignity of times, and through
various accidents, their friendships had been interrupted. He exhorted the
Senate not to trust the Imperialists, and promised that he would never forego
the Commonwealths friendship. He afterward desired, that this League which
was privately concluded, should be presently published: wherein he found the
Venetians of the same opinion; thinking it would be a means, that when the
Imperialists should know those Forces were now against them, which they hoped
would have helped them, to make them quit the possession of that Dukedom, which
they knew they could not keep, and so come to some agreement: whereas on the
contrary, nourishing themselves with hope of being assisted by the Venetians,
they would continue making provision for war, and growing in time stronger, it
would be harder to come to any agreement afterward.

But the Pope advised the contrary, alleging, That it was fit this confederacy
should be kept secret; to the end, of reducing the Imperialists to greater
necessity and danger; which they would be, when the French should be past over
the Po, as they said they would do, promising that they would pass back again,
whenever the Pope should please; but he was forced almost to discover it,
being to grant passage to the Duke of Albenyes men, who was sent (as has been
said) by the King of France, into the Kingdom of Naples. Wherefore the Pope
seeming as if the Duke had violently usurped license to pass with his men
through the State of the Church, and Tuscany, and that he was wholly minded to
stand a Neuter, and to endeavor a general Peace: He began to proceed with
protestations, admonishing both the Princes to lay down Arms, and to put
whatsoever either of them was possessed of in the State of Milan, into his
hands, that so they might come to make a firm Peace; wherefore the Imperialists
growing jealous that the Pope had agreed secretly with the King of France, as
indeed he had, and might seek to bring over the Venetians also to the French
party, they offered the Senate to refer the investing of Francisco Sf^rza to
them, and the pitching upon what sum of money the Duke should pay unto the
Imperialists for it: which the Venetians refused to do, saying, That such a
decision did not belong unto them, but to the Pope.

There were many things which past at the same time between the Imperialists
and the King of England, to move him to make War the next year against the King
of France; to the which purpose, the Cavalier Cassal was come to the Imperial
Camp; which made the Imperialists more fervent in their own defense; for that
they hoped, the King of France being molested in his own Kingdoms* might be
forced to pass speedily back again over the mountains, to defend his own
affairs; the convention made between him, and the Pope, and the Venetians,
being not yet published. For the news being confirmed of great preparations
made by the King of England, which was thought would make the French turn their
forces elsewhere, the Venetians did not much mind the divulging of it. But the
event of the business of Lombardy, and of all those councels, was finally to
depend upon the success of Pavia, the Siege whereof continued longer then was
expected, whereat the Pope and the Venetians were exceedingly troubled; not so
much for that the length thereof did much defacilitate the good end of the
business, as that they feared, the French Commanders, impatient of so long
delay, might persuade the King to come to a day of Battle with the Enemy;
whereby, together with that Army, the safety of their States, and of the
Liberty of all Italy, would be put to the arbitriment of Fortune; and Italy
having no other means of making opposition, would be left in prey to the
Imperialists, if they should prove victorious. Whereat the Venetian Senate
being troubled, they did very much solicit Ronchfancora, laying before him,
that the interest of the Confederates, and the Kings own safety and glory, and
victory, did wholly consist, not in hazarding any thing, but in making good use
of time, and of his enemies disorders and wants. The like desires the Pope made
likewise known to Alberto da Carpi, Ambassador at Rome, and did also send an
express messenger with the same desires to the Camp: But all these endeavors
did but little good, the King showing himself every day more and more resolved
not to rise from before Pavia; but rather, if the Enemy should draw nearer,
come unto a Battle; whereby he was unnecessitated to hazard his own fortune,
and the like of his confederates, which were all exposed to danger. Wherefore
the Pope, the Venetians, and Florentines, resolve^ to join in a defensive
League, for the preservation of their own States; being to this purpose to take
ten thousand Switzers into pay, upon the common expense, and each of them to
increase their own forces as much as they could: which things whilst they were
slowly, and with various resolutions discussed, the rout of the French Army
ensued, together with the death of many of the chief Lords of the Kingdom, and
the imprisonment of the Kings own person. The Cesarians were come from Lodi to
relieve Pavia, which was reduced to a great scarcity of all things, they being
gotten to be strong enough, and for Foot, almost equal to the French Army,
though far inferior to them in Horse; and drawing near to the French Camp,
they forced the King either to suffer them to relieve Pavia, or to come to a
day of Battle, the thing which they desired, that they might put their
desperate affairs to the utmost trial; and fortune favoring their forwardness,
they had the opportunity of assaulting the King in the Park, where he, contrary
to the opinion of his best experienced Commanders, would needs stay: So as the
French, not being able to come into the field till it was too late, nor to make
use of their Horse, wherein they did exceed the enemy, the whole Army was
routed and put to flight, and the King taken Prisoner, Monsieur d'Alanson only
escaping with the Rear.

This so great and signal Victory gotten by the Imperialists against the
French, was cause of much trouble to the Venetians, knowing that a heavy load
lay upon them; for the Counterpoise of the French failing, and all the other
Princes of Italy being weak, and full of Terror, by reason of this so mighty
success, they were, almost of themselves alone, to defend the liberty of Italy,
against the power of Caesar, which was increased greatly by this, his late good
fortune; nor could they hope, that he would contain his Forces within the
Confines of the State of Milan; it was rather to be believed, that his Army,
pursuing the victory, would enter into the neighboring States; whereunto,
their being so unprovided to make any stout resistance, might very well invite
the Imperial commanders. The Venetian Forces were only of some consideration:
for they had 1000 Curassiers, 600 Light Horse, and 10000 foot; they therefore
resolved to make use of these forces, and to increase them, and to exhort the
rest of the Princes of Italy to do the like, and to arm themselves so strongly
as they could. But their chief study, and care, was to join themselves with the
Pope, for they believed, that all the Potentates of Italy would finally depend
upon his Authority, and that there might be thereby some hopes of good. They
therefore solicited the Pope often; Showing him into what great dangers Italy
was brought, which, if they should not receive some sudden, and powerful
remedy, they would increase so fast, as all labor, and industry, and expense
to prevent eminent ruin would be in vain: That Caesar 's actions did clearly
show what his thoughts and intentions were; since he had not assigned over the
Dukedom of Milan to Francisco Sforza, as by his Confederacy he was bound to
do; but, that having defeated the French Army, so as there was now no more fear
of any enemy; he did notwithstanding keep his soldiers still in that State,
placed Garrisons in the Cities, and would have all things done by his
authority, and in his name; and that certainly Caesar had so fair a way opened
unto him, of making himself master of Italy (if the Italians would stand idle,
and leave their affairs to the discretion of others) as one that were never so
moderate, having so fair an occasion, could not abstain from turning his
thoughts, and Forces upon the taking of Territories so ill defended: and that,
in such a case the State belonging to the Church would be no freer from
offense, then the like of their Commonwealth; but would rather be in more
danger, because her weakness did the more expose her to injuries. Nor did such
thoughts and actions as these want several appearances of a fair color far
war; Chiefly by reason of the League made by the Pope with the French; which
being come to the knowledge of the Imperialists, they seemed to be more troubled
thereat; because it was made contrary to their opinion or sense: they put him
in mind that it became not a wise Prince to think upon giving satisfaction,
when he was able to take up arms, and to depend upon himself, and his own
Forces: and that truly the most expert men thought it a more easy thing, far
the Italian Princes to join together, and being joined, to defend themselves
against the Emperors Forces, if the Pope would declare himself to be head and
author of such an Union; For the Florentines were always at his command, and
had now particularly signified their will and readiness to defend themselves,
by Francesco Vettori, whom they had sent to Rome, to that purpose, thereby to
invite him, to take upon him the common defense: That the Duke of Ferrara would
be ready to do the like, in consideration of his own State, and to free himself
from the contumacy which he was run into with the Church, whereof he had
already given sufficient signs, he having sent an express messenger to Rome,
presently after the defeat of the French, to offer the Pope 250 Curassiers, 400
Light Horse, and all his other Forces, for the defense of the Apostolic Sea;
and for the welfare of Italy: That the other lesser Princes could not, nor
would not sever themselves from the authority, and from joining with the
forenamed; with whose joint forces the Duke of Urbane did promise to defend all
their States: That it was to be considered, the Cesarians wanted money, and
that the soldiers, chiefly the Dutch, being much behind hand for pay, ^ere
readier to mutiny, and to return home, then to fall upon any other Enterprise,
without being paid their Arrears: That the State of Milan was totally
exhausted, and unpeopled: That the name of a Spanyard was now more then ever
odious unto them, by reason of their many extortions: and since they now found
themselves deceived in their hopes, wherein they were a while nourished, of
having a natural Prince of their own: That the Emperor's Army was already much
diminished: and to conclude, That part of his men were sent from Lombardy, to
resist the Duke of Albany.

These things, though they were very punctually represented by the Venetians,
and diligently listened unto by the Pope, yet were they not able to infuse any
hope into him; or to keep him from precipitating into an agreement, and from
thinking of securing his affairs, rather unworthily, by receiving any,
whatsoever condition, from the Conquerours, then by his own forces, and by the
aid of other Princes, and Confederates: so as without so much as expecting
Cesar's will, or any orders from him, he had begun new Treaties with the
Viceroy; being hereunto induced by an immoderate fear, that the Emperors army
should be necessitated to pass thorough the state of the Church, or else
thorough Tuscany, and to bring either the one, or the other, and peradventure
both of them into great trouble and danger. The Viceroy listened willingly to
the Treaty of agreement promoted by the Pope; knowing that peace and union with
him did greatly concern confirming the Victory, and freeing the Army of many
necessities which it then suffered under; whose Authority being, as he
believed, to be followed by the other Princes of Italy, the State that was won
would be secured for the future from the French Forces; who could not hope to
do any good in Italy, without the assistance of some Italian Prince: These
considerations being discovered by the Ventians, who knew, that such a security
would at last cause more danger to them, and could not notwithstanding keep the
Pope from making this Agreement; they proceeded slowly in their Councels, not
making the Imperialists despair, nor yet joining in any streighter friendship,
or confederacy with them: but they persuaded the Pope, that, to the end he
might be provided for all events, in case the agreement should not be made
good, he should forthwith send Monsignor Verulano, who was long before destined
thither, into Switzerland, to make 1000 Switzers come in presently to the
defense of the Liberty of Italy, the nation being greatly ambitious of the name
of Liberty; and that he should, with the like diligence, dispatch away a Nuntio
to England, whether the Commonwealth would at the same time, send Lorenzo
Orio, whom they had chosen for their Ambassador, to negotiate with the King
thereof, who was in great esteem with all men, and who was then Moderator in
the weightiest affairs of Princes, touching preventing Italy from the eminent
dangers, threatened her by Cesar's greatness: wherein they hoped to find that
King the readier, because it was very like, that such a Victory would purchase
Charles much envy, and might alienate the mind of Henry more from him; who,
being haughty and ambitions, would unwillingly see him so eminent above all
others, and to become Lord of Italy. Yet the Venetiens, finding the Pope still
inclined to accord with the Imperialists; they, as resolving not to part wholly
from his courses, began to think upon some conditions: and therefore, the
Viceroy having sent Iovan Sermento to Venice, to give them an account of the
victory, they treated very civilly with him, seeming to bear good will to
Caesar; and ordered Lorenzo Priuly, and Ardrea Navagiero (who being formerly
destined to be sent to Charles, had by public directions tarried at Genua) to
pursue their journey, and go to Spain, to congratulate with him, for the
Victory which he had won, and to excuse their slowness in sending their men
to his Camp.

But Charles, when he had received the news of his Armies so prosperous
success, though he did inwardly rejoice, being inflamed with a desire of glory,
and Empire, and hoped for better things, yet showing great moderation in his
words, and outward appearance, he said, he would) as it became him to do, use
this signal favor, which God had been pleased to bestow upon him, to the
service of Christendom, and to universal agreement. Wherefore he sent the
Duke of Sesta, not long after, to the Pope, to proffer him peace, and to assure
him, that he very much desired the Peace and Tranquillity of Italy. He made the
like be done to the Venetian Senate by his Ambassador Alfonso Sauces, and by
his Secretary Caracciolo, who was not as yet gone from Venice. But the more the
Cesareans seemed to desire Peace and League with the Italian Potentates, at a
time when they might rather expect to be desired, then to desire others, they
gave the more suspicion, that their secret thoughts were pernicious to the
Liberty of Italy. The Venetians did therefore temporize; neither concluding nor
excluding these Treaties; and this the rather, because Propositions made unto
them by the French caused them to suspend their judgments; Gasparo Lormano
being come, at the same time, to Venice, being sent thither by the King's
Mother, who was then Queen Regent of France: who showing, That the Kingdom
feared no offenses, that it had fores sufficient, and ready enough to be
employed in the recovery of their King, desired the Senate, that they would not
abandon so glorious a cause, and so advantageous for their Commonwealth, but
that they would join with the Lords of France to set her Son at liberty, by
force of Arms, whereby the safety and liberty of Italy would likewise be had.

To which desires the Senate, showing first the great resentment they had of
the Kings misfortune, and that they wished very well to the honor and welfare
of the Crown of France, did not as yet give any positive answer; but replied
only that the weightiness of the proposition, required time and advisedness to
ground any solid resolution thereon. But in the mean while, the Pope, who had
sent the Archbishop of Capua to that purpose to Spain, ratified the agreement
which was formerly made with the Viceroy; including the Senate of Venice if
they would declare their consent thereunto within twenty days. Wherefore the
Senate was almost necessitated to dispatch the treaty by many, though
unresolved endeavors with the Emperors Ambassadors; and that they might
accommodate the most important businesses (for some others remained undecided)
Pietro Pesaro was sent to Milan to negotiate with the Viceroy. But the French
did not for all this forbear pressing their desires, not having altogether
quitted their hopes of making the Venetians join with them, though the Popes
authority and advice had as then drawn them to be of a contrary opinion. They
therefore sent the Bishop of Baiosa to Venice, and Ambrogio da Fiorenza, who in
the name of the Queen Regent, and of the whole Kingdom, did upon more mature
advice, make better grounded proposals then the first were touching the League,
and freedom of the King; in which respect, but much more because every day new
and clearer signs were discovered of Cesars ambition, and of his Counselors
designs which were all bent to make him absolute Master of Milan, and to put a
yoke upon Italy, the French Ambassadors had attentive audience given them in
the College, and the business was taken into new consideration, and put into a
way of Treaty. At this time the Marquis of Pescara was come into Milan with
3000 Foot, 200 Curassiers, and a good number of light Horse, and had desired
the Duke that he would cause the Castle of Milan, together with the like of
Cremona, to be delivered up unto him; publicly affirming that he was sent by
Caesar to take possession of Milan, in whose name all exactions, expeditions,
and the whole administration of Government was made; and he endeavored to make
all the Cities swear Fealty unto him: Wherein though the Pope did appear very
much, in striving to make Caesar keep his articles of confederacy, and assign
over the State of Milan to Duke Francisco Sforza; yet it did no good; sometimes
one reason, sometimes another, being alleged for the delay thereof; and
amongst the rest, that he had treated of delivering up the Castle of Milan to
the Venetians: A thing which was never so much as thought upon, much less
negotiated by any of the parties.

These things did alienate the minds of the Venetians from the Emperor daily
more and more, and increased their jealousies, and made them not adhibite faith
to what Gaspero Contarino, who was their Ambassador with Caesar, did inform
them of, being made to do so by him; that Cesars mind stood well affected to
the quiet of Italy, and to a general peace. Therefore the Venetians seeking out
an occasion to break off the treaty of agreement, proposed diverse difficulties,
the chief whereof was, that the Duke of Milan being one of the principal
Contractors, the League could not be well concluded, if it were not first known
what was to become of him, and of his State. The dispatch whereof was thought
to be cunningly delayed; which made them believe, that these calumnies were
forged, which were laid upon Sforza, thereby to bereave him of his State, with
an intention to keep it, though large promises were made that it should be
given to the Duke of Bourbone, or to any other that the Colleagues should like
of. The Pope likewise beginning to discover these artificial proceedings of the
Imperialists, did no longer believe any thing they said: Wherefore to proceed
speedily against the common danger, he resolved to join in a good and strict
intelligence with the Venetians quickly, since there would be some difficulties
in concluding the French in the League, which would cause longer delay, a thing
very prejudicial to the present business. The agreement was then concluded by
the Pope on the one side, who engaged himself for the Church, and for the
Republique of Florence; and on the other side by the Duke and Senate of Venice.
By which agreement it was said,

That these Potentates did join together to avoid the eminent dangers, as they
had been taught by the experience of times past, and to lay more solid
foundations for the quiet and safety of Italy, and for their own particular
States: That each Prince should take upon him the protection of the other
Princes States and persons; that all the Confederates should run the same
fortune; that not any one of them should treat with any other Princes in any
thing which might be repugnant hereunto; that they should succor each other
with 4000 Foot, 400 Curassiers, 300 Light Horse, and with greater numbers also,
according as their several needs should require* Hereunto was added, that the
Venetians should be bound to protect the greatness of the Medici, and suppress
such commotions as should be raised against them by any seditious Citizens; and
particularly, to favor, and assist whosoever the Pope should place in the City
of Florence as head of that Government.

These things being thus accommodated, the Pope beginning now to be more
sensible of that true fear, which he slighted before, gave straightways order
to the Marquis of Mantu^, that he should go with the Curassiers into the parts
about Parma, and was very diligent in continuing the Treaty of bringing the
Grisone Foot, and the Switzers, which being formerly begun was but slowly
prosecuted: And on the other side, the Venetians resolved to increase their
Army, to the number of 10000 Foot, to raise 300 light Horse more in Greece, to
bring other Commanders, and to provide for their own safeties in every thing;
being much encouraged in all this by the King of England; who growing jealous
of Cesars greatness, and perhaps envying his glory, discovered himself to be
very much displeased with the success at Pavia, and with the King of France his
being made Prisoner; affirming that he was ready to do any thing, whereby to
free the King, and to keep Italy in safety.

The Italian Potentates being thus agreed, there was hopes of easy coming to
an union with France; but the Treaty was proceeded in, in a diverse manner, and
in somewhat a diversity of affection; for the Pope thinking that he had put
some stop to the present dangers, by the already made confederacy, and that he
might enjoy better conditions from Caesar, and have them better observed,
proceeded coolly in the agreement with the French; the rather for that since
the coming of the Duke of Sessa to Rome, who was sent thither by Charles to
attest his desire of peace, and his willingness to restore the Dukedom of Milan
to Francisco Sforza, always provided that he should prove innocent, and if he
should be found guilty, he would invest his Brother Maximillian Sforza
thereinto. But on the contrary the Venetians were very fervent in their
endeavors, that they might come to a speedy agreement with the French, fearing
lest the Spaniards proffers might tend to no other end, then to break the
Treaty of the League, and to slacken the provisions for War: And fearing
likewise lest the Queen, by reason of these slow and irresolute counsels of the
Italian Princes, witnessing either their not very great good will toward that
Kingdom, or their weakness in forces; and that being resolved to do all that
she could for the release of her Son, she would at last make some conditions
with Caesar, with whom some Treaties to this purpose were known to be already
begun. Therefore the business with the French proceeded on with some diversity*
and uncertainty, not coming to any settled conclusion. The quantity and quality
of the forces which the Colleagues were to put together for the common service
of the League was already agreed upon: To wit 30000 Foot*^ 4000 Curassiers, and
3000 light Horse, to be employed in such service in Italy, as might prove more
advantageous. The French were moreover bound to make War with Caesar upon the
Confines of Spain; and other articles were in Treaty, when in the beginning of
the year 1526. unexpected News came to Venice, That an agreement was made
between the Emperor and the King of France; whereby the King was to be set at
liberty, and peace and good intelligence was to be had between these two
Princes, which was to be strengthened by the tie of Matrimony; the King being
to marry the Lady Leonora, Cesars Sister, and Caesar to marry the King of
Portugals Sister; and the Dukedom of Milan was to be given to the Duke of
Burbone, who was likewise to marry the Lady Renea, the Kings Niece.

A thing which had been formerly feared, but not now so much as before, for
that the Queen did constantly affirm, that she had sent her Ambassador Alberto
Carpi, who was then at Rome, sufficient commission to conclude the League. The
Pope and the Venetians were sorely troubled at these tidings, but this their
trouble was somewhat mitigated, out of a common opinion that King Francis would
not observe his articles made with Caesar. The which was the rather believed,
because it was said, that he was departed very ill satisfied with his
Treatment, whilst he was a Prisoner; and much worse with the agreement it self,
whereby to purchase his liberty, he was forced to put Charles into the
possession of Burgony. To know whether he was really disposed to do thus or no,
and to increase this desire in him, the Senate sent Andrea Rosso, Secretary to
the Pregadi, immediately away to France, to treat upon this important business;
and the Pope taking the like course, sent Paolo Vittori thither with the same
direction. Nor was it hard to draw the King thereunto, for at the very first
speech which he had with these, he complained very much of Caesar, for having
dealt severely with him in all things.

He said, That he would not be wanting to the welfare and safety of Italy, if
the Italian Princes would not be wanting unto themselves. Which he would
quickly witness, being ready to join with them, and to make good whatsoever had
been formerly negotiated, and for the most part concluded with the Queen his
Mother and the Kingdom; that therefore they should exhort their Princes to send
them sufficient authority there; for they should always find him ready and
constant in this point, and in the same mind for what concerned the common
good. He said he hoped that the King of England would be of the like intention,
and no less desirous to abate Cesars greatness, and to provide for the defense
of Italy. To whom he would speedily send his Ambassadors, and could wish the
Italian Princes would do the like; for it would help the business very much,
that the Emperors designs might be opposed by the full consent and forces of
so many Potentates joined together.

As soon as the Venetians heard these things, which were conformable to their
wishes, they were not slow in sending commissions to Rosso to conclude the
Leagues; the heads whereof (some few things being altered) were already framed
in the former Treaties. They also gave order to Secretary Gasparo Spinelli, who
did then negotiate the Affair of the Commonwealth with the King of England,
Lorenzo Orio their Ambassador being dead a little before, to be very earnest
with Henry to make him enter into the League which was in treaty in France;
much exalting the esteem that they put upon his authority, as desirous to have
him for the Preserver and Protector of this agreement, and for the particular
Defender of the Liberty of Italy.

But the Pope proceeded so slowly herein, as they were forced to go more hotly
to work with him.

The Venetian Ambassador did therefore often lay before him the great
opportunity that was now offered, of providing for the common safety, by
disposing of the King of France his mind, who was wholly set to revenge himself
for the injuries which he thought he had received from Charles. That if this
his indignation should in time grow less, and that he should resolve to keep
the Conditions which were agreed upon at Madrid, there remained no hope of ever
freeing Italy from the bitter slavery of the Spaniards.

The Pope having heard these things, and being somewhat moved thereat, resolved
at last, to send Don Caplino, a great confident of his into France, with
Commission to join in the League; though Don Hugo da Moncada did at the same
time labor the contrary, who was sent by Caesar to Rome, to confirm the Pope in
his first resolution of joining with him, and to exhort him to contemn all
other agreements and offers.

Don Hugo laid before him the weakness of the confederates, with whom he was in
Treaty to join; the natural fickleness of the French, the uncertainty of the
Venetian Councels: and on the contrary, he magnified Cesar's power, his
preparation for War, his abundance of Foot already raised in Ispruch, his
expectation of lusty and opportune succors out of Germany, from the Archduke;
and told him that Caesar propounded peace unto him out of his desire of the
universal good, and out of his particular respect unto the Church; not that he
did any ways doubt his being able to resist solely of himself all those
Potentates that conspired against him, being likewise confident to make them
alter their purposes.

Don Hugo signified almost the same by Letters to the Senate of Venice, whom he
acquainted with his being come into Italy as soon as he arrived at Milan; and
with the reason why Caesar had sent him thither

But to all these pressures, he received the like answers, both from the Pope,
and from the Venetians.

`That when Caesar should have a mind disposed to peace, as by his words he
seemed to have, he should find the like disposition, and reciprocal will in
them: But that they desired this might be witnessed by some real effects which
they would be readier to believe; and to this purpose that he would cause the
Siege to be raised from before the Castle of Milan; that he would restore the
State thereof to Francisco Sforza, that he would observe what by his
capitulations he was bound to do, and that he should then speak of laying down
of Arms, and of restoring peace and tranquillity to Italy.

No answer was made to all this but in general terms, and actions to the
contrary did still continue: Whence it might be clearly comprehended that the
treaty of Peace was made use of to no other end but to keep back the
preparations for War, and by these jealousies and tricks to alienate the French
from the Italian Princes. And this began to have some effect according as was
desired; for the business of the League began to cool very much in France;
either for that the King did not much confide in the Pope nor the Venetians,
thinking that they might be wrought upon by Ugo, all whose endeavors were
communicated to him; or else (as some others believed) because being only
intent upon the redemption of his Sons whom he had left with Caesar for
Hostages, and to compose the business of Burgondy with some other recompense,
he might make use of the name and of the reputation of the League, to make the
more easy agreement; and not for that he had really any more mind to meddle
with the affairs of Italy, which he had so often and still so unfortunately
attempted; or that he did any ways take the Interests of the Italian Princes
into his consideration: Insomuch as his Ambassador, the Bishop of Bayosa, who
was sent by him to Venice for that intent, was there a whole month without
hearing any one word from the King; neither of his resolution touching the
League, nor of any forces which he should prepare to effect the things agreed
upon. Others conceived this slowness of the French proceeded from some other
designs of theirs, to wit, to reduce the Confederates (to whom every little
delay seemed tedious and troublesome, by reason of the great scarcity of
victuals that was in the Castle of Milan) to give them the Dukedom of Milan, if
it should be recovered by their common Forces; bereaving Sforza of it, to whom,
by all that had been yet treated on, it was to be restored. Therefore that they
might leave never a stone unturned, but do any thing which might draw the
French into Italy, the Pope and Venetians did consult of making this offer
also, to the King; to the end, that he who had been always ambitious of this
acquisition, should more readily, and with greater Forces embrace the busine^s:
thinking, that for what concerned the present occasions, that which was ch^efly
to be put for, for the safety of Italy, was to drive the Spaniards out of the
State of Milan: and this they did the rather, for that, though the King should
be bound by agreement to assign it over to Sforza, they could not be sure that
he would keep his promise better to him, then he had done to the Emperor,
which would afford occasion of new wars, and of parting him from the Italian
Princes. But, on the other side, considering that it would not greatly redound
to the honor of the League, to give way unto this, but that it would rather
leave a blur upon the Italian Princes, since that they had always given out,
that their chief object was to restore the Dukedom of Milan to the Dominion of
an Italian Prince, they resolved not to part from their first Propositions. But
the King of France desiring that the Kingdom of Naples and the State of Milan
might be both of them assaulted at one and the same time, they endeavored to
give him some satisfaction in that point, by adding to the other Articles:
That, if it should appear, that, for the safety and quiet of Italy, it were
requisite, the Government of Naples should be altered, the Colleagues should
contribute such Forces as should be requisite to effect it: and that, when it
should be gotten, the Pope should determine to whom it should be given, so as
might make most for the quiet of Italy, and so as it were done with the
satisfaction of the Confederates, without whose consent the Pope promised he
would do nothing in that point: that the new King, who ere he should be, should
pay the usual Tribute to the Church, and 70000 Ducats to the King of France,
whose pretenses should remain entire to that Kingdom, if it were not won now.

This being agreed upon, the League was finally concluded in France; Don Capona
intervening for the Pope, and Secretary Andrea Rosso for the State of Venice.
The end of this Conjunction was specified to be, The freeing of the State of
Milan from the oppression of the Imperialists, the Liberty of Italy, and the
recovery of the King of France his children, adhering for what concerned
particularities, and preparations for War, to what had been formerly treated
on, and concluded with the Kingdom, before the King had his Liberty.

Yet it was not published, till they might know the King of England's
resolution; who was desired to be one of the chief Contractours: For it was
thought, that his name and authority might add much to the reputation thereof:
It was therefore resolved, that some should be sent into England from the
Colleagues, to request Henry, that he would quickly declare, in the behalf of
the Confederate Princes, against Caesar. For the Pope, there went Iovan Battista
Sanya, a man of an high spirit, and great with the Datario: for the King of
France, Joan Ioachino; and Mark Antonio Veniero for the Venetians, who was
intended before to be sent Ambassador thither from the Commonwealth. But the
king of England, though he said he was very well inclined to this League, and
not well affected toward Caesar, resolved notwithstanding, not to declare
himself publicly, till he had desired Charles, that, to gratify the
Colleagues, he would set the son of the most Christian King at Liberty, and
restore the State of Milan to Francisco Sforza; which if he would not do, he
declared, he was to denounce war against him in all their names: which, though
it was cons^nted unto, yet the business was prolonged, and diverse difficulties
promoted: So as any longer delay being thought to be unseasonable; the League
between France, and the Princes of Italy was published and proclaimed with
great solemnity: and it was generally thought, that the Forces of this League
would be able to quel the Imperialists, and to drive them out of the State of
Milan; especially, since the Castles of Cremona and Milan held still for
Sforza. There were at this time, in the Venetian Army 1000 foot, 900 Curasiers,
800 Light Horse, and a great many Switzers were suddenly expected, taken into
pay, partly by the Pope, and partly by the Venetians, and partly by the King of
France; who, when they should be arrived, it was resolved, that the Colleagues
would go to succor the Castle of Milan, to attempt the taking of that City:
and that, on the other side the Marquis of Saluzzo should fall down into the
Dukedom of Milan wi^h the French Curassiers, and 10000 foot, raised at the
Confederates common expense, and assault the Cities of Novarra, and Alexandria:
and that, in the mean while, the Maritime affairs should be prepared to molest
the Imperialists in other places, and to divide their Forces. The Venetians
gave order to their Captain General, and to Commissary Pietro Pesaro, to bring
their Camp, as soon as might be, to Chiari in the Territories of Brescia, to
begin the war: and the Pope ordered all his Commanders, and soldiers, to go
into the parts about Parma; to the end, that being joined together, they might
do what should be thought best for the League. But this joining of forces was
unseasonably deferred, by reason of the difficulty in what place the Armies
were to meet; for Francesco Guicchiardini, who was Lieutenant General of the
Ecclesiastical Army, would not give consent, that the Pope's men should go to
Cassalle Maggiore, as it was first resolved: alleging, that the State of the
Church was not to be abandoned: though it was urged on the contrary, that, they
being masters of the field, there was no cause of fear. This mean while
Malatesta Baglione came to Lodi with a Troup of Vinetians, where he had private
intelligence with Lodovico Vistarlino, a Citizen thereof, and though there were
in it a good Garrison of 1500 foot, yet he easily took it, and held it in the
name of Francisco Sforza. After this, the whole Venetian Army past over the
Poe, and two days after, the Popes men joined with them, and they went all to
Milan: the Duke of Urbane had good hopes to get the City at the first assault,
for he was informed by some of the Milaneses, that the people were up, and
ready to side with them, as soon as their Army should be come to the City: and
that the Imperial Commanders, having already sent away their baggage, would
soon be gone themselves, and give over the defense of the Town: This was so
verily believed, as Lodovico Count di Belgiojoso had desired the Duke of
Urbane, to give him 2000 Foot, with which he offerr'd to relieve the Castle of
Milan. The whole Army of the Confederates being advanced, they quartered in the
Monastory del Paradiso, toward the Porta Romana, with a firm intention to give
an assault, hoping to win the Suburb, and to lodge there: and the enemy, being
often come forth to skirmish, were still valiantly repulsed by our men: but
soon after came the Duke of Burbone, with a good number of foot, and did not
only make good his station against such as skirmished with him, but indammaged
them on sundry parts: so as the Duke of Urbane failing of his hopes of getting
the city by assault, and fearing lest he might fall into some greater disorder,
if he should tarry long in those quarters, retreated with the whole camp in
good order to Marignavo, without receiving any prejudice. But, great hopes
having been had by the Armies being drawn near Milan of good success in the
Enterprise, and there being great necessity of relieving the Castle of Milan,
the Senate, when they heard by their Commissary, that the camp was raised, were
very much amazed and grieved: and the Duke, to justify this his act, sent
Luigi Gonzaga to Venice, who might by word of mouth give an account of what was
done, and of the reasons which had moved the Duke thereunto: whereupon the
Senate were satisfied: but the Pope was not so easily appeased; he did not
only complain very much of this action, but likewise of the manner of the
Dukes proceedings; for not having acquainted those that employed him with his
most important counsels; which Guicchiardini did aggravate to the Pope, by his
bad offices done to the Duke, being displeased with him, because his Discourses
were not well listened unto by the Duke, nor had in such consideration as he
thought was due to his reputation and degree; but were rather despised, as
coming from one of another profession, and who (as the Duke had wont to say)
ought not to meddle in matters which belonged to military men: So, as to give
the Pope satisfaction, the Senate ordered the Duke, that for the future, he
should acquaint Guicchiardini with all businesses of importance which were
treated of in the Camp.

All things appertaining to the Fleet were this mean while prepared for, that
some attempt might be thereby made upon Cesar's Territories. The Venetians, to
this purpose, chose Luigi Armero for their Commissary, and sent him to Corfu,
where the other Commissary Iovan Moro was with the Fleet; from which Armero was
to take 12 Galleys, and come along with them with all speed, to the Sea Coasts,
near Rome, to join with those of the Pope, and of the King of France; and then
jointly fall upon such Enterprises, as might be for the service of the League.
Diverse things were propounded, touching whether the Maritime Forces were to go.
The Pope desired, that they might go into the rivers of Pugliae, to break the
designs of the Collonesi, and to divert their Forces in those parts; who,
having raised 7000 foot, and a good number of horse in Naples, began to be very
formidable unto the Pope. But the King of France, and the Venetians thought it
would be more advantageous for the League, to have them go against Genua; as
well for the fitness of that city for other actions, as for that, if they
should succeed well therein, it would add much to the reputation of the League.
Pietro Navarro was declared Captain General of the Confederates Fleet, a man of
long experience in war, who though he were propounded by the King of France,
yet he received stipend from the other Confederates, but the Galleys belonging
to the Church, and those of the Commonwealth being already in a readiness,
those of France were slow in coming with the Captain General, which gave them
just occasion of disl^ke, and of no slight suspicion, that the King of France
his ends aimed only at his own advantage, dispising the interests of the
League; of which his mind, there appeared other signs: for but little of 40000
Ducats, which he was bound to send into Switzerland, for the levying of 10000
Switzers was as yet sent thither: whereby the League lost no little reputation.
And, though the Venetians had sent Secretary Sabbadino thither, to solicit the
raising of those Foot; yet could he not much encourage them, nor hasten their
departure; nor was there any news heard of any preparation made by the King, to
make war upon Caesar on the other side of the Mountains, as by his Articles he
was bound to do. But the King, besides some excuses which he made, finding how
ill the Colleagues were satisfied by their pressing solicitations, or else
being conscious of his own faultiness, and fearing, that therefore the Pope and
the Venetians, laying aside his interests, as he seemed to have little valued
theirs, might treat of peace with the Emperor apart by themselves, sent
Monsieur di Sange into Italy to excuse his tardiness; with directions that he
should first pass thorough Switzerland to solicit the departure of those of
that Nation, or at least, to make it be beli^ved, that he had done what he
could therein: He therefore coming first to Venice, and then to Rome, used the
same endeavors in both places, laying the fault of the slowness of the French
men's passage into Italy upon the Commanders, and other officers; and affirming
the Kings very great desire to prosecute the war, and that he would not only
make good his Articles, but exceed them by increasing his Forces; for, besides
the forenamed Fleet, he was rigging up many tall Ships in Britannie, that he
might come forth the stronger, and suppress all the Forces that the enemy could
make by Sea: and that he was no less careful of levying the Switzers; and,
that by his procurement the general Dyets were summoned, wherein all things
should be resolved in favor to the League. But he chiefly assured them, that
the King would not treat of any agreement, save such as should tend to a
general peace, and so as the other Colleagues should be content with. The King
did likewise attest this his resolution to Iovan Battista Sanga, who, being
sent, as aforesaid, by the Pope, to the King of England, stayed some days in
the Court of France, for same business.

The Venetian Senate, taking these assurances very thankfully, and seeming
fully to believe them, answered,

That they never doubted the King's good intentions toward the Le^gue, and
particularly, toward their Commonwealth, as knowing both his wisdom, and his
ancient affection to the Venetians; they therefore promised, That not only in
th^^ cause, wherein their common interests were concerned; but in all other
things, and at all other times, their Will, and Forces, should be inseparably
joined to his: And as for any Treaty of Peace, they never were averse from it;
nor had they taken up Arms to any other end, but that they might come to a safe
peace: Therefore, as far as it might stand with the Dignity of the League, and
the Confederates safety, they should be very glad of it.

Yet knowing that such a peace was rather to be desired then hoped for at this
time, the Pope and the Venetians endeavoring to incite the King's mind the
more to War, resolved to let him know, that if they should get the Kingdom of
Naples, his Son should be King thereof; the Commonwealth retaining such a part
thereof, as should be answerable to their deserts, labor, and expense: To
correspond whereunto, the King made a new offer of other three hundred
Lanciers, and twenty thousand Ducats more monthly, for the service of the
League, if the enterprise of Naples should be undertaken. The Commissary Armero
was come from Corfu to Terracina with thirteen Gal^es, where meeting with
Andrea Doria, who was come thither with eight Galleys for the Pope's service,
they went in company together to Cevita Vecchia, and from thence to Ligorn,
where they met with Pietro Navarro with sixteen of the King of France his
Galleys; and being resolved to reduce Genua to the King of France his devotion,
to the great advantage of the Colleagues, they made Frederick Fregose, who was
Archbishop of Salerno, head of that Government, and came with their Fleet first
to Porto Venera; which Town, together with that of Spetia, and with all that
part of the River, till you come to Monaco, yielded soon to the Colleagues.
Then dividing the Fleet, D^ria, and the Vene^ian Commissary, went to Porto
Fino, twenty miles from Genua; and Navarro, with the French Galleys, to Savona,
which City willingly yielded unto him.

The first and chief design of the Leagues Commanders, was, to keep Genua from
being victualled by Sea; and the City being but badly provided of victuals and
not kn^wing well how to come by any, they hoped to reduce it by way of siege to
such a scarcity, as it must fall into their hands. To this purpose, there was
six Galleys deputed, two for every Colleague, which being to keep the Guard,
took some Ships, and diverse other lesser Vessels, which were bound with
victuals for Genua, so as the City began soon to be incommodated but it was
supplied by those of the River, who brought them corn, which under diverse
pretenses was permitted to be carried to neighboring places, though not
without some complaint against Doria; who, as either envying Navarro's glory,
by whom his Country was won and subdued, or out of some other design, was
suspected to have proceeded with but little sincerity, and misbecoming means,
to bring the enterprise to a speedy conclusion: But the Ge^ueses by way of
defense, had been very careful in securing the Haven, placing some great
Vessels in the mouth thereof, loaded with Artillery, and moreover, six small
Galleys, commanded by Gobbo Iustiniano, which came forth sometimes to skirmish
with those of the Enemy, putting so far into the Sea, and no further, then they
might be safe under the shelter of the greater Vessels, which lay in the mouth
of the Haven, and under the like shelter of Castello della Lanterna, all which
were furnished and fraught with Cannon: So all the hopes of gaining the City,
lay in the Siege, which was still continued, the Popes and the Venetian
Commanders having by certain Trenches secured themselves from being invaded by
those of the City, if it should so happen, that by fortune of the Sea, the
Fleet should not be able to get out of Porto Fino, where it lay. But the
Genueses seeing themselves daily more and more straightened, resolved to sally
out, and by assaulting the Rampires, endeavor to endamage the Enemies Fleet;
whereof the Captains of the Fleet being soon aware, they landed Philippino
Doria, and Iovan Baptista Grimaldi, with eight hundred Foot, and two pieces of
Artillery; and setting the poops of their Galleys toward land, when the
Soldiers of the City came, they did not only stand their assault, but repulsed
and worsted them.

At the same time, the Duke of Urbine, being much pressed thereunto by the
Venetians, and spurred on by his own desire to recover the reputation of the
Army, which it might seem to have suffered in, by its retreat from before
Milan; as soon as part of the Switzers, to the number of five thousand were
come to the Camp, resolved to return to before Milan, to relieve the Castle,
which as yet held out for Sforza, from which six thousand persons were gone out
under the conduct of Captain Pasqualino, and had luckily past the Enemies
Trenches, without any harm or impediment, whereby the scarcity of the besieged
was somewhat alleviated. The Army being come within a mile of Milan, two
thousand men were sent out to take Moncia, and to possess themselves of il
Monte di Brianza, very convenient places for the bringing of victuals from the
parts thereabouts to the Camp. When the Army had taken up its quarters, the
Commanders began to consult what course they were to take to relieve the
Castle, which being begirt about by the Enemy with double Trenches, and with
Bastions, the difficulty of relief was much increased; but whilst they vainly
consulted about succor, news came to the Camp, that Sforza failing of his
hopes of being relieved, by reason of the Enemies new works, had surrendered
himself to the Imperialists, and delivered up the Castle, upon condition of
being set at liberty, and suffered to go to Como, till such time as his cause
should be taken notice of by Justice: And not long after, the same Sforza came
into the Confederates camp, accompanied by Count Galliazzo, with two hundred
light Horse; but he stayed there but a while, being resolved to go to Como, and
in the first place, to take possession of that City, which was to be delivered
up unto him by the Imperialists, though the Confederates Commanders labored
much to dissuade him from so doing, acquainting him with how dangerous a thing
it was to commit himself again unto the uncertain word of his Enemies, when he
might repose surer hopes of his welfare and dignity upon that Army, which was
raised only for his particular service, and to repossess him of his paternal
State; and at last, when they told him, that if he neglected such offers, they
would fetch his brother Maximilian Sforza from France, he promised, that when
he should be come to Como, he would send Ambassadors to Rome, and adhere unto
the Pope's counsels.

But it was not hard afterward to draw Duke Sforza to side with the
Confederates, who soon had occasion to know how the Imperialists were minded
toward him; for they denied to take away the Spanish Garrison from Como,
though upon agreement the City was to have been delivered up free unto him. So
as ratifying the League with the Pope and the Venetians, he went to Lodi, which
City was freely given him by the League. Though the loss of the Castle was very
grievous, and of great concern, yet were they not quite out of hopes of getting
the City of Milan, wherein was a great scarcity of all things, and the number
of the Defendants not answerable to the greatness of the City, nor to the
Forces that were before it, more Switzers being come unto the Camp, and 4000 of
the same Nation being quickly after expected, who were raised by the King, and
who were said to be already come to Bisanso. So as it was thought the City
would soon fall into the hands of the Colleagues, either by force, or by Siege.
Whilst these aids were expected, the Duke of Urbin intended to send some of his
men to attempt the taking of Cremona, a business much desired by the Colleagues,
and chiefly by the Pope; but it behoved them to put off the effecting of this,
for fear lest the Imperialists might sally out of the City (as it was given out
they intended to do) and might assault the Confederates Army. At last Malatesta
Baglione went thither, but with fewer men, out of the same reason, then were
requisite to bring the business to a speedy and good end: For finding the City
fortified with double Rampires, and well provided of Defendants, he assaulted
it several times in vain; then finding it very hard to storm the Town with so
few men, and that to forego it before the business was finished, would redound
but little to the honor of the Leagues Forces; it was resolved that Commissary
Pesaro, Camillo Orsino, and Antonio da Castello should go with a good many Foot
to the Camp before Cremona, and soon after an other thousand Italian Foot were
sent to succor them, and 1000 Switzers. But neither these, nor those doing any
good, the Duke of Urbin resolved to go thither himself, though it were much to
the prejudice of the business of Milan. And taking a great many Pyoners along
with him, he cut Trenches, and by little and little won ground upon them; so as
the City being brought into great straits; was forced to yield. The Duke
dispatched away a Gentleman of his with this good News to the Senate at Venice,
to whom it was very welcome; not only for the good success of taking the Town;
but also for that they hoped the Confederates would by this good beginning be
encouraged to undertake greater Affairs. The City was immediately delivered
over to Francisco Sforza, who made his residence there, and the Senate sent
Secretary Luigi Sabbadino thither, that he might be present with him, as a
Servant of the Commonwealths to assist him. But this mean while a strange and
sad accident happened, which did much disorder the affairs of the League,
retarding and interrupting all their designs: for the Colonesi having got
together about 600 Horse, and 5000 Foot, entered Rome at unawares, plundered
many of the Prelates houses, the Church and Palace of St. Peter; the Pope
himself hardly escaping their fury (who intended to have made him Prisoner) by
retiring into the Castle of St. Angelo. So as not tarrying any longer in the
City, Cardinal Colonna having in vain labored to make the people take up Arms
in his behalf, they went out loaded with Booty, and carrying away goods to the
value of more then 300000 Ducats.

This accident forced the Pope for his liberty, and security to make Truce with
Don Hugo for four months; by which he promised to make his Forces pass back
again over the Poe, and to make his Galleys withdraw into the Churches
Dominions. But afterward thinking more maturely upon these affairs, and
knowing to how many dangers in the future he was incurred, to free himself from
the present danger; though in observation of his late capitulation, he recalled
his forces from those of the League, yet he by his Nuntio's asked counsel of
the King of France, and of the Venetian Senate, whether he should continue to
observe those things which necessity had compelled him to promise to Don Hugo;
or else not doing so, to pitch upon some other resolve. And soon after he sent
Monsieur di Lige who was come then to Rome, back again into France about the
same business. Clement being a witty man, and of a mature judgment, knew, that
to observe the Truce, was no better then to afford Caesar means of making more
bitter War, and of overcoming those difficulties by this delay, which he found
himself at present oppressed with, and in fine, of settling himself in Italy, and
of indangering all their liberties. But his immoderate fear perverted his
judgment, and suffered him not to discern this truth. Wherefore the General of
San Francisco being sent by the Emperor to Rome to treat of peace, he listened
attentively to him, and exhorted the Venetians not to descent from it;

For said he, Arms must one day be laid down, and that since it was now
offered, the occasion was not to be let slip. The Senate answered they did
never desire War, but that they had sought by War to secure peace. And that
they would not be averse unto it, so as it might be treated of and concluded,
by the knowledge and consent of the King of France: For if they should do
otherwise, they should much to their prejudice, alienate him for ever from
minding the affairs of Italy; and lose a safe refuge, in case of any adverse
fortune. They therefore endeavored to confirm the Pope, showing him that there
was no reason to come now to so precipitous a resolution, nor with so much
indignity to receive the proposals made by Charles, without expecting an answer
from France, especially upon so dishonorable conditions, as to pay a great sum
of money to Charles, and moreover to deliver up into his hands, as pledges of
his fidelity, places of so great importance in the Ecclesiastical State as were
Parma, Piacenza, and Civita Vecchia. And also that it did appear by many signs,
that Caesar was very weak in Forces; especially since the so many rumors of
succors, terminated only in the assistance of Georgio Frondisper. Whose Army
being to be maintained at his own private charge, and by some pillage, it was
to be hoped that it would very shortly dissolve: That the people of Milan
wanting pay, refused all obedience to their Commanders. And on the contrary,
that Renzo de Ceri was expected from France with moneys, and that there was
hopes that the King himself, who was already come as far as Lions, would pass
over in person into Italy; that the greatest danger of the Dutch was secured,
the business of Genua successfully begun, that all things promised fair.

The Pope being moved by these persuasions, and it may be much more by the
remembrance of his so grievous and so rescent injuries, and for fear of not
being preyed upon by the Spaniards, when he should be abandoned by the
Confederates, he resolved to suspend the Treaty of this new Truce, and the
observance of what as yet had not any effect, agreeing only to Treat of the
Universal Peace, and this by the advice and consent of the most Christian King.
The coming of Master Russ^l did not a little further this resolution, who being
sent by the King of England to present the Pope with thirty thousand crowns,
for the occasions of the War, came just in this nick of time to Rome, and
labored much to confirm the Pope in the continuance of the League, or at
least, that he would set his mind upon the introducing of a true Peace amongst
all Christian Princes; which the Venetian Senate did not dissent from, but gave
order to their Ambassador Andrea Navagiero, who was then in Spain, to
intervene at this Treaty, which was to be negotiated upon, and concluded in
France, but for the honor of Caesar, it was to be ratified at his Court, and in
his presence. The sum of the Treaty was,

That the King of France his sons should be set at Liberty. That Lombardy
should be left in a peaceful condition. Francesco Sforza's State restored, And
the debt paid which the King of England pretended was due to him by Charles.

Difficulties daily increased in the concluding, and in the observance of
these Articles, so as for all these endeavors, the provisions for War were no
ways slackned: But the business of Truce being suspended, the Pope sent his
men, whom he had recalled from the League camp, presently away, to recover
those Lands which the Colonesi had usurped from the Church. The worser the
Imperialists condition was, who were reduced to great straits, and the greater
the Confederates hopes were of good success, the more ^id the former endeavor
to relieve their affirmed affairs, and the others to keep out all relief,
whereupon it was that all good and bad success did depend, and the whole
fortune of the War. Therefore Charles made a Fleet be prepared in Carthagena, to
relieve Genua; he solicited his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand, to raise men
in his Territories, and to send them from the nearest parts into Italy, and he
had ordered the Prince of Orange to enter into the State of Milan, through the
Duke of Savoy's country, with a good number of Lands knights; but on the other
side, the Confederates being wholly bent to keep off all relief, made several
provisions, many ships were preparing in Britany, and at Marcelles, by the King
of France, and some Ships that were taken, as it was said, about Genoua, were
armed at the common expense, intending to put to Sea with a great Fleet, and to
hinder the passage of the Spanish Fleet: Diverse endeavors were had likewise
with the Duke of Savoy, that he might not permit the Imperialists to pass
through his State. But the greatest, and most apprehended dangers, came from
Germany; for it was said, that Georgio Sfonspera, an old Commander, and one
very affectionate to the House of Austria, was raising great store of foot in
Styria, and allured men by the hopes of prey; and that the Dutch Foot which
were in the Garrison of Cremona, being come to him, he had got together above
ten thousand Dutch Foot about Bolzano: Diverse things were therefore put in
practice at the same time, to hinder the passage of these men: The practice
formerly held with the Governor of the Castle of Mus was agreed upon, not only
the disbursement of five thousand Ducats, the one half whereof was to be paid
him by the Pope, the other half by the Senate, for the freeing of the Venetian
Ambassadors, who were detained by him whilst they were passing into France; but
also, that he himself should come in person with four hundred Foot to the
service of the League, wherewith he was to Guard the Lake of Como. The
Venetians sent likewise Secretary Nicolo Sangontino, upon the same occasion, to
the Marquis of Mantua, to desire him, that though these men should be advanced,
he should not suffer them to enter into his State: and because Artillery and
Munition were preparing in Trent, which made it be feared that Georgio
Sfonspera would fall with his numerous men into the Territories of Verona, the
Senate raised therefore four thousand Foot more, and made some Troops of
Curassiers, and of light Horse, come from the camp: they made Agostino da Mula
Commissary General on this side Menzo, and disposed of all things, in order to
fight, and beat back the Enemy.

But the Dutch Foot came by the Valley of Lagni, from whence they past quickly
after to Poldrone; which when our Commanders knew, who were in the parts about
Verona, Camillo Orsino went immediately with the light Horse, and some of the
readiest Foot companies to Salo, leaving the rest of the Army behind, with
orders, that passing over the Lake of Garda, they should come into the same
place: which not being to be done, for it fortuned that that Lake proved then,
as it sometimes is, unnavigable; Orsino could not march, till it was too late to
encounter the Enemy, who were already well advanced. Yet having possessed
himself of the passage della Corona, a strait place, and naturally strong, he
forced the Dutch, who had already taken that way, to go by the tops of the
Mountains; so as by very craggy and difficult ways, they came to Gardo, and
from thence to Castilione, and soon after they entered into the Marquis of
Mantua's Territories, thereby cozening the Commanders of the League, who
thought that the Dutch would have made toward Milan, through the Territories of
Bergamo, but passing over the River Olio at Rivalta, and afterward over the
Menzo* it was thought that they would take their way either toward Piacenza,
or Pavia: Wherein to hinder them, the Commanders of the League thought it fit
to divide the Camp into two parts, with the one whereof the Marquis of Saluzzo
taking with him the Switzer and Grison Foot, to the number of ten thousand,
went to beyond the River Ada, and quartered at Vauri, near the strongly seated
Cassano; and the Duke of Urbin, who conducted the rest of the Army, consisting
of as many Foot, went to Sansino.

But George Fonspra being already got beyond them with his Foot, and the Duke
not able for wan^ of victuals, to follow him presently with his whole Army, he
made his light Horse and some Foot companies follow them in the Rear, by whom
the Enemy were much annoyed, and chiefly by Giovan di Medici, who although the
rest of the Popes Captains were gone, stayed in the Camp, and took pay of the
King of France; but yet they advanced still, and passed over the Po, and the
Duke of Urbin taking the same way with his Army came to Borgo forte from whence
the Dutch were gone but a little before, and caused a Bridge to be made, to the
end that if occasion should be, he might pass his men over. But Fonspere not
knowing what way to go, when he was got over the Po, was cause of much
suspention with the Colleagues, and the Pope was chiefly much afraid,
beleiving that the Enemy would bend toward Bologna, and peradventure pass into
Tuscanie, wherefore he pressed the Venetians very much, to pass their men as
soon as might be over the Po, for the better safety of the Churches, and the
Florentines State; but their own Commonwealth was not free from the like
danger, wherefore the Senate to satisfy the Pope as far as stood with their
own safety, ordered Luigi Pisari, who was in the Camp with the Marquis of
Saluzzo, that if any number of Foot should be demanded of him, to increase the
Garrisons of the Towns belonging to the Church, he should readily relieve them.
Which Guiccher^ine demanding, Babone di Naldo was sent thither with 1000 Foot.
They writ likewise to their Captain General, that if the danger of the
confederates should increase, and theirs should lessen, he should pass over the
Po, either with the whole Army, or but with part of it, according as occasion
should require, and as he should think best: Which being by several accidents
delayed, this advice was altered, and it was thought more expedient for the
common service, that for the present the Marquis of Saluzzo should pass over
only with his men, taking along with him 300 of the Venetian light Horse, and
some pieces of Artillery, to be taken from their Camp. The Popes danger and his
fear also did much increase, by the Enemies approaching near Florence, for the
Dutch having passed the River Nura, and then that of Trebbia, not being any
ways disturbed by our men, stayed at Firenzvole where they expected to meet
with the men of Milan. But the Imperial Commanders finding it hard to make the
rest march, the Italian Foot and some light Horse, went only thither at that
time: But the Senate being desirous to give the Pope all satisfaction, sent new
Orders to their Commissary, to draw out some more men from their Army, and to
send them over the Po, that they might join with those that were formerly
passed over with the Marquis of Saluzzo, Therefore Commissary Vetury went
thither presently with 5000 Foot and some Troops of light Horse, the Duke of
Urbin being at this time (not without much trouble to the Venetians) gone about
some particular Affairs of his own to Mantua. These proceedings of the Enemy,
made the Colleagues suspect the Florentines; fearing least they apprehending
the danger that drew near them, might come to some agreement with the Enemy,
which would be much to the prejudice of their friends; wherefore the Venetians
sent their Ambassador Marco Foscary forthwith to Florence, to entreat them in
the name of the Commonwealth to keep their faith, and not to desert the
confederates by reason of this accident.

He laid before them on the one side, the scarcity of all necessaries which was
in the Dutch Camp, the weakness and difficulties of the Imperialists: And on
the other side, the confederates great Forces, their readiness to use them for
their great service, and to run one and the same fortune with them; the hopes
of better success for the Affairs of Italy by the assistance that was expected
from France, and many other preparations which were a making to make War upon
the Imperialists to some purpose, in several parts. He wished them to remember
their ancient generosity, and particularly the many prosperous successes which
they had had when they joined with the Venetians; told them they might hope for
the like now, if they would keep the like constancy, and generosity. That as
their continuing well inclined to the League, would certainly much increase
their reputation, and confirm the minds of the Confederates; so would it be as
prejudicial to them if they should desert them: And that through fear of an
immaginary danger, they would fall upon great and grievous mischeifs; for they
would ruin themselves, and therewithal draw on the ruin, or much declination
of others, and hazard the liberty of Italy. He therefore desired them, That in
respect of the love which the Commonwealth bore them, and for the great and
common concerns, they would not be wanting in their duties.

The Florentines seemed to take this very well, and sent their Ambassador
Andrea de Pazzi to Venice, to thank the Senate; promising to continue in the
League, and particularly in their good intelligence with the Commonwealth,
desiring that 6000 more Foot might be raised, at the common cost to resist yet
greater Forces, if it was true as it was said to be, that the Duke of Burbone
had drawn men out of Milan, to march toward Tuscanie.

Whilst these things went thus, the Colleagues Fleet continued still the Siege
before Genua, which was now reduced to great straits; many things were
propounded to hinder the relief by the Spanish Fleet which was said to be
preparing in Carth^gena, to the number of 40 Ships. Navarro was for going into
the Spanish Rivers, and for fir^ing the Spanish Fleet, as it lay in the open
Haven, before it should put forth; which advice was approved of by the Venetian
Commissary. But Doria though he seemed to like this motion well, considered
notwithstanding the season of the year, and the danger by Sea made much against
it, since they were not like to find Havens, whereinto to put upon any bad
weather; he likewise raised many other difficulties, wherewith the rest being
staggered, and he himself being resolved not to go to Carthagena, it was
decreed that they should go to to the Island of Corsica, or to that of
Sardinia, and to keep about those Rivers, and to wait for the coming forth of
the Imperial Fleet, and to fight it as it should pass by; to which purpose some
great Vessels were made to come from Marcelles, and the Ships which were
formerly taken before Genua, were armed.

Whilst these things were a preparing, the Imperial Fleet, which consisted of
thirty and six armed Ships, making more haste from Spain then was expected,
came sailing with a prosperous South-East wind toward Genua, fifteen miles
from land, wherein was Don Carl^ di Lanoia, Viceroy of Naples, Captain
Albercona, and Don Ferran^e Gonsaga; which as soon as the Venetian Commissary
understood, who was then in Porto Venere with sixteen Galleys, to solicit the
arming of the Ships, he put presently to Sea, to pursue the Enemy; but meeting
with contrary winds, he was forced to put back again into the Haven, whilst the
Spanish Ships pursuing their course, drew still nearer land, that they might
get into the Haven of Genua. But as they past by Monte St Frettoso, they were
discovered by Novarra, from Codemonte, who lay underneath the point of land
with seventeen of the Leagues Galleys; wherewith lanching forthwith into the
Sea, he went boldly and courageously to fight the Imperial Fleet; and it so
fell out, as one shot which was made from Novarra's Gally, whilst it was hoised
up by the waves, struck off the Banner from off the Standard or Mast of the
Gally wherein the Viceroy was; at the same time Giacopo di Mezzo, and Paolo
Iustiniano, two Captains of two of the Venetian Galleys, putting in with the
forwardest, and nearest the Enemy, did with their first volly, shoot two of the
Enemies Ship through and through, the one of which sunk almost presently; and the
other lying on one side, had time to stop the hole, and save her self: Captain
Albercona, who was in her, got quickly out, and got into a Pinnace that was
hard at hand: Many shot were made afterward on both sides, but not much hurt
done; with much disorder and fear to the enemy, their Ships being more exposed
to danger then our Galleys, which shooting nearer the superficies of the water,
did more certainly hit the great Ships, and mist seldomer. Whereupon Navorro,
who in this action showed youth-like gallantry, though he were seventy years
old, began to cry aloud, Victory, Victory; and thereby encouraging the rest to
fight vigorously, they pursued the enemies Fleet, which began already to fly,
hoping to make themselves masters thereof. But the Tempest at Sea did increase
so much, hourly, as they saw clearly, that to pass any further, was to expose
their Galleys to manifest danger, and to the discretion of Fortune, and of the
winds. Wherefore leaving further pursuit of the Enemy, they resolved to put
back into the Haven: Commissary Armero being by the same occasion hindered from
assisting his companion in the fight, who put several times to Sea to that
purpose, but was still beaten back. The Viceroy after having run much hazard;
got safe with some of his Ships into the Haven of Santo Stefano in the Seneses
jurisdiction; the rest of the Ships passing by Sicily and Corsica, landed their
men safely at G^etta, having in vain pursued and sought after the Leagues
Fleet, when the Sea was calm.

This succor which was landed by the Spaniards, began to break the designs and
hopes of the Confederates: Wherefore enquiring diligently (as is usual when
things proceed not prosperously) into the occasion of these disorders, the
Venetians grew jealous, by what was said by some who were but ill satisfied,
that Commissary Armero might be in some fault, who was therefore sent for to
Venice by the Council of Ien, that he might give an account of his actions, and
particularly, of the Corn which he had suffered to be brought into Genu^, and
why he went not with his Fleet to Carthagena, and Augustino de Mala was chosen
to be put in his place, who was then Commissary in Friuli, and who had formerly
exercised the like charge at Sea. But Armero did so fully clear himself of all
the faults that were laid to his charge, as he was absolutely acquitted
thereof: And it was known to be true, that the not sending of some men from the
camp in Lombardy, who might have straightened that City by Land, as had been so
often desired by the Commanders at Sea, was the cause why the Fleet missed of the
fruit of the hoped for victory. But the Pope was more troubled at the Viceroys
being come into Italy, then the rest were, and grew more jealous and fearful;
for it was said, that these men that were landed by the Fleet, were to join
with Fronspera's Forces. Wherefore the Archbishop of Capua was sent to Gaetta
to treat of agreement with the Viceroy, and to propound a suspension of Arms
till it was concluded. But the Viceroy standing upon hard conditions, requiring
a great sum of money, and the assignation of some Cities, the Treaty broke off
for that time: The Pope being somewhat enheartned, for that his Army was much
increased in reputation and Forces, by the coming of Renzo da Ceri, who being
sent by the King of France into Italy, and having brought the Fleet to Savona,
was already come into the Ecclesiastical Camp, which kept about Rome, to
suppress the Collonesi: But on the other side, the Viceroy was the more
solicitous in endeavoring to get into the Ecclesiastical State, to defend the
affairs of the Collonesi, to enforce the Pope to quit the League, and to
contribute some moneys to the Army: Therefore making forward, he went with the
Camp to Fursolone, hoping to get the Town either by siege or storm, having
already twelve thousand Foot in his Army. But Renzo da Ceri, and Alessandro
Vitello being come thither with the Churches Forces, which were much increased
in number by the Popes diligence in raising new Foot to relieve the Town, after
some days battery, and some slight skirmishes made with them within, who
sallied boldly out to disturb the Enemy, the Imperial camp rise from the Town,
not having done any thing remarkable, and retreated to Cessano, and afterward
to Ceperano.

The Pope being somewhat encouraged by these good successes, and beginning to
hope well, suffered himself easily to be persuaded, to enter immediately,
(though it were now in the depth of winter, and January being begun, and
therewith the year 1527) upon the business of Naples, as had been formerly
proposed, and councelled by the Confederates. Wherefore the Venetians ordered
Agostina da Mula, their Commissary by Sea, to go to Cevita Vecchia, and that
joining there his Galleys with those of the Popes, they should both of them
fall upon the enterprise of Naples. But the French Fleet being slow in coming,
the Venetians went to Terracina, to take in 3000 Foot, brought thither by
Horatio Baglione, who was set at Liberty by Ciement, having been formerly
imprisoned by Leo; in favor of this undertaking, Monsieur di Valdamonte was
come to Rome from France; to whom, as being descended from King Renato, the
ancient pretenses of the house of Anjou, to the kingdom of Naples did
appertain; it being hoped, that, out of a certain affection which remained yet
in the memory of many toward those Princes, and toward the French party, the
presence of Valdamonte might be of some availment; whom the League professed they
would make King of those States, he being to marry the Popes Niece, who was
daughter to Lorenzo de Medici, and was commonly called La Dutchessina d'Urbino.
Valdemonte being got aboard this Fleet, which consisted of 22 galleys, with
these designs, and these hopes, they all made toward the Rivers of Naples;
Renzo being to go by land with 10000 Foot, and to enter into Abruzzo. Doria
went before with his Galleys, and assaulted Pozz^olo, a very opportune place
for the Confederates, if they should get it, by reason of the convenience of
the Haven of Baia: but, being beat back by the Artillery at his first accost,
he gave over any further attempt; and when the rest of the Leagues Galleys were
come up, they resolved to batter Castello a mare, that they might have a safe
receptacle for their Galleys: and after having thrown down some parts of the
wall, the Forces of the Galleys were landed, that they might assault it both by
land and Sea: and Paolo Giustiniano, master of one of the Venetian Galleys, was
the first that entered the Town, with his men, through a breach, made by the
Cannon of the Galleys, who being followed by the rest, the town was taken, and
sacked, and the Castle yielded not long after. After which success, almost all
the Maritime towns, whithersoever the Leagues Fleet came, surrendered; and if
any made resistance, it was presently stormed, as was that of Lorento, and of
Torre del Cervo: so as they were, in a short time masters of almost all the
Rivers, and were got very near Naples. Renzo was this mean while entered the
Kingdom by land, having happily passed over the river of Tronto, and rendered
all the Viceroy's endeavors vain, who sought to hinder him: and beginning
prosperously, he had reduced into his power, the Town of Aquila in Abruzzi, and
the Counties of Tagliacozzo, Alva, and Celano. Wherefore the Captains of the
Fleet, being now near Naples, and being thereunto invited by these prosperous
successes, consulted, whether they should draw near Naples, or no, and put for
a period to the War. They considered, That if this city should be won, the war
might be said to be ended; the chief means of raising moneys for the
maintaining of the war, being thereby taken from the enemies: and they being
thereby driven out of their nest, and of their chiefest receptacle; by keeping
wherein, their chiefest hopes of desending that State did consist: whereof when
they should be deprived, their courage would soon fail them, so as they might
be easily driven out of the whole Kingdom; nor was the enterprise so hard, but
that they might have reason to expect the effecting of it. The City was but
weakly garrisoned, nor was it apt to expose it self to danger, nor to undergo
the troubles of war, or inconveniences of a siege, to preserve the insolent
Dominion of the Spaniards, which was most troublesome to them; nor were the
Nobles otherwise minded, though for fear of their goods they were forced to
appear well pleased with that condition. They considered further, that this
disposition of the Neapolitans might easily be increased, and that they might
be incited to some insurrection, by promising the city to forgive the so many
debts which it owed unto the chamber, and to free them for the future from many
grievances, if they would be willing to yield: threatening, on the other side,
that they would put them and their houses to fire and sword, if they would
obstinately persist, to defend themselves. They considered, that, at the
present, the Viceroy was far off, and that they could not hope to receive any
speedy succor from the Spaniards: and that, when they should have gotten the
city, they need not distrust the reducing of the Castles likewise into their
power; which, not being succored, must likewise suddenly yield. Yet others
were of opinion, that they were to expect, till Renzo was further advanced, and
that they might streighten that City with greater Forces; upon the getting
whereof, they knew all other good success did depend, and the end of the war;
wherefore they were to proceed therein with more mature advice, and well
grounded hopes, since, if the business did not succeed well, the whole
enterprise would be much prejudiced; that a short time might mightily
facilitate good success; for they knew, the city was in great scarcity of
Corn; which, after the late taking of some ships laded with wheat, which went
to relieve it, must needs grow greater, and almost insupportable; whereupon,
the people tumultuating, would by their disorders facilitate the Victory. That
therefore in expectance of such an occasion, they* were to draw unexpectedly
near to the walls of the City, and not give the Spaniards leisure to order
their affairs, and to provide for better defense, that it was to be considered,
that a little withstanding would be sufficient to resist the forces of that
Fleet, which were so weak and so few, as they could not attempt the taking of
the Town, but with more danger then hope. That therefore they were to expect
some more recruits of men, either by shipping from France, or from the Army by
land: and that the mean while they might go to Salerno, and reduce that* and
the other neighboring Towns, to the devotion of the League, before they should
be better garrisoned: and so the city of Naples would at last fall into their
hands.

But these reasons not prevailing, it was resolved, that a Herald should be
sent into the City, who should require the delivery thereof up into the hands
of the League, upon such promises and threats, as were mentioned in the
Consultation. But Don Hugo d^ Moncada, who was within the City, curbing the
people, and resolving to stand upon defense, when he understood, that the
Fleet was within four miles, marched out of the City with 2500 foot, and 300
horse, to disturb the designs of the captains of the League; who had already
landed many soldiers, under the conduct of Monsieur de Valdemonte, and of
Horatio, Baglione; who being got very near the City, to discover the situation,
met with Don Hugo and his men, fought them, and made them run; which was not
done so much by the soldiers valor, as by shot from the Galleys, which
playing upon the Enemy, who were upon the shore, prejudiced them much, but
frighted them more; so as, being disordered and in confusion, thinking, how
soonest to withdraw themselves from the danger, they fled toward the City, and
turned their backs upon our men, who pursued them so fast, as they would have
left some pieces of Artillery behind them, had not Don Hugo, by making some
Spanish Soldiers make a halt, recovered them. But being hereby necessitated to
retreat the flower, he had not leisure at his entrance into the City, to cause
the Bridge be pulled up, nor to shut the Gate, which Baglione, who pursued him,
made himself suddenly Master of. But having but a few Soldiers with him, and
fearing that if he should enter the Town with them, he should not be able to
keep them from plundering, so as being disordered and confused, they might be
cut in pieces, he retreated to the Galleys, which were but a mile off.

This success infused such terror into the Neapolitans, as they sent to
entreat the Captains of the Fleet, that they would not play upon the Town with
their Cannon, nor ruin the Country, for for their parts they were ready to
yield. But this so fortunate opportunity could not be made use of; for Don
Hugo, knowing that there were but few forces in the Fleet, appeared willing to
defend the Town, and to undergo any whatsoever inconvenience; and by this time
it was clearly known, that they could not storm the City, for that the
Soldiers of the Fleet were reduced to a small number, by reason of the
Garrisons which it behooved them to leave in the Towns that they had taken;
until the great Fleet, which was promised by the King, should be come from
France. Which not coming, the Captains of the League were necessitated to lie
idle, and to let the victory escape out of their hands. And though they had
often very earnestly desired that they might have a thousand Foot at least sent
them from the land Army, offering to send their Galleys to take them up at
Terracino, they could not get it effected. For great disorders were happened in
the Ecclesiastical Army: Little discipline, no obedience to Commanders, great
want of moneys, and of victuals; so as when it was expected that the Army,
answerable to the first prosperous success, should advance, and gather more
force and reputation, it grew every day less and less through its own
inconveniences. Which mischiefs proved the harder to be remedied, for that a
suspension of Arms being in agitation, and the Pope being according to his
custom, irresolute, and sparing in laying out of moneys, he was now more slow
and sparing therein: And this Treaty being known in the Camp, the Commanders
and Soldiers began to despise the Orders of the Popes Legate, and all
interests of the League. Insomuch as some of the Captains, who had been most
honored and best rewarded by the Pope, went over to the Imperialists, and took
pay of them.

These proceedings confirmed Clement the more in his former purpose, and in
buckling close to the treaty of agreement, insomuch as he would say, that since
he must serve, he would rather serve the Emperor, then always depend upon the
immoderate wills of Captains, and of every base Soldier. But the resolution
taken by Burbone, was above all things else cause of great disturbance to the
designs of the Confederates, and of particular trouble to the Pope; for Burbone
having at last overcome all difficulties, and drawn the Soldiers out of Milan,
was on his way to join with the Dutch, who expected him beyond the Trebbia, not
knowing particularly what enterprise they were to fall upon; only it was
publicly given out, that Bourbone to get the Soldiers out of Milan, had
promised them the sacking of Florence, and of Rome, which was the only means to
make them move. The Pope growing apprehensive of himself, as also of the
affairs of Florence, not out of any charity toward his Country (as was
afterward seen) but fearing least some alteration might happen in the
Government of the City, together with the suppression of his family, which were
then almost the sole Governors thereof, renewed other Treaties of Agreement
with the Viceroy, though he had formerly promised not to conclude any thing
without the knowledge and consent of the King of France, and of the Venetians,
who had declared themselves, since Caesar persisted in so hard conditions, to be
otherwise minded.

But besides the aforesaid considerations, the exhortations made by the
Generale di Santo Francisco, were of great force with the Pope; who being
lately returned (as has been said) from the Emperors Court, did very much
witness Cesars well wishes, and good inclination to peace. So as making use of
the same general in this treaty with the Viceroy, he continued it in such a
manner, as he seemed to place all his hopes of defense therein: Becoming
himself, and making the rest likewise become more slow and negligent in their
providing for War: And consequently, through too much fear, making the danger
more eminent. Which was the more wondered at by all men, for that whereas
Clement ought to have remembered the recent troubles and injuries which he had
received from the Colonesi, and the wrongs which he had afterward done them,
and the Imperialists; he ought therefore to have adhibited the less belief to
words, nor have committed his safety and liberty into the power of others; but
having broken conventions agreed upon with them, he ought so much the more to
fear that the like might be done to him, by a desperate people, having neither
religion nor faith; and who served a Prince, whose friendship he had not till
then endeavored, unless it was upon great necessity. The Pope seeking to cloak
the effects of this his immoderate fear, he said in generous words, that not to
be wanting to his office of universal Father and Pastor, having discovered a
great inclination to peace in Caesar, and in his Agents, he could not, nor ought
not, appear to be averse thereunto, nor neglect so blessed an occasion, as was
offered him, of causing all Arms to be laid down, with hopes to reduce all
Christendom to a desired peace and tranquillity. Bourbone was this mean while
got to Bullonia, it not being yet well known what way he meant to take, whether
for Tuscany or Romania; for the Soldiers did alike aspire to the sacking of
Florence and Rome; but it was thought he would rather take the way of Romania,
to enter on that side into Rome; whereof there were many tokens, especially the
levelling of the ways, made by the Duke of Ferrara's order about the Town of
Cento; with whom Burbone, being come to Finale, had had many private
discourses, and had received some pieces of Artillery from him, and some
moneys, and was, as it was then believed, advised by him to march toward Rome,
which would make much for his designs of possessing himself of Modena and
Regio, whilst the Pope was otherwise busied. Burbone had ransacked the
Bullonian Territories, and wasted much by fire, not out of any hatred that he
had to the Bullonieses, or to offend the Pope, but to make the Florentines
thereby close with him, and contribute some moneys to the Army, to free their
Country, which was full of noble Palaces, from the like ruin. These
proceedings made the Pope the more hasten the agreement; so as Monsieur di
Lange being come from France to Rome, to dissuade the Pope from thinking of any
agreement, and bringing for his better encouragement 20000 Ducats, with
promises of a far greater sum; and Cesare Ferramosca coming thither likewise on
the same day from the Viceroys Camp, to let the Pope know that the Viceroy was
content to accept of the Truce for eight months propounded by the Pope; he not
listening to the promises and encouragements of the most Christian King, clapped
up presently with the Viceroy, affirming that by delay his condition would be
worse, when the Viceroy should be better informed of the disorders that were in
the Leaguers Army, and that the danger of the Kingdom of Naples, did not
counterpoise that of Tuscany and Rome; which was the only means to make them
agree together. The Pope being wholly set upon this, that the things agreed
upon might be sure to be the better effected, used means to bring the Viceroy
in person to Rome, and Cardinal Trivulcio, who was Legate in the Camp, was to
go the mean while to Naples, for the Viceroys better security: who consented
afterward to come without this condition. And being come to Rome, where he was
very honorably received, though the day proved very tempestuous for thunder
and wind; which was by some interpreted as an ill augury to the business; he
without any difficulty confirmed the suspension of Arms for 8 months, upon the
same terms that it was first agreed upon by Ferramosca, and with a particular
promise that Burbone should retreat with his forces, and should not molest the
Churches State, nor Tuscany: Which if he should not be able otherwise to
effect, he would take the Spanish Soldiers out of the Camp, over whom he had
the chiefest authority, and which were the Nerves of the Army. Wherefore the
Pope, who was apt to believe that which he did so much desire, was persuaded
that he had now put his Affairs into a good condition, and promised to pay the
Army 70000 Ducats, to pardon the Colonesi, and particularly to restore Pompeio
Colonna to his former Dignity of Cardinalship, whereof he had a little before
deprived him; and as concerning their Towns, that the Pope and they should
retain such as were at this present in their possession. But his greatest
error was, that he made his Army presently retreat to the Confines of the
Kingdom, and caused the Fleet to come to Cevita Vecchia, and commanded the
Captains both by Sea and Land, by replicated Orders, that they should
immediately restore unto the Imperialists all the Towns and places that they
had taken in the Kingdom; falling so headlong to disarming (as if he had been
guided by some hidden power to his perdition) as he dis-banded some of the
Soldiers that were in Rome, though the Colonesi, who kept still in Arms, used
many insolences: Nor did he keep any more for his Guard, then 100 Light Horse,
and some companies of the black Troops, who did belong to Iovan de Medici,
which was come to Rome to accompany the Viceroy: And as if he should never have
any more need of Soldiers, he withdrew some pay from the Captains and
Soldiers of his Army, leaving them so ill satisfied, as many of them went over
to Burbons Camp. The Senate of Venice was not wanting at this time in giving
the Pope good counsel. They told him he might do well not to trust ^oo much in
the Viceroys promises; for though he should proceed sincerely, it was much to
be doubted that Burbone, who pretended to be equally entrusted in authority by
Caesar, as was the Viceroy, might not obey his Orders, nor ratify what he had
agreed upon, without his consent. They minded him also of the many disorders
which might arise, by disarming; and particularly that when the Senesi and
Collonesi (whose hatred and ambition was not laid aside by this agreement)
should see his Arms thus laid down, they would take an occasion to invite the
Cesarean Army to advance, who when they should have this occasion offered them,
it might be that even Burbone himself would not be able to detain Soldiers who
were ill paid, and disobedient to their Commanders. But the Pope despising
these reasons, and seeming to be still more resolute in his determination, made
that saying true; that, Good and faithful counsel, given by an interessed and
suspected person, causes the sooner precipitation.

Clement believed that the Venetians made these dangers to appear the greater,
out of their own Interests, as desiring that he would not sever himself from
the confederacy; wherefore not believing their words, he ran the more hastily
upon his own ruin. And continuing still in the same persuasion, that the
agreement was so settled, as no doubt nor danger could arise therein, though
Burbone himself had written to Rome, that he could not rule nor detain the
Soldiers, who were not well satisfied with the few moneys which they had as
yet received; the Pope said Burbone did this, not that he was really averse
unto the Truce, but to draw more money from him by this fear, or to show some
Military ostentation: Though after all this, alleging some more rational cause
for this his credulity, he had wont to say, that though he might have doubted
of some sinister accident, yet he should not have thought it fit to do
otherwise then he did, for he would rather that his ruin, and the cause of so
much mischief to Christendom, should be attributed to the falsifying of the
faith of others, then to his own obstinacy. But not being able then to believe
that any thing should happen otherwise then he conceived, he had already
destined to send his Almner, Mattheo Giberto, Bishop of Verona (through whose
hands all businesses of greatest importance did then pass) Legate into Spain,
to treat with Caesar upon the particular conditions of peace. But the Venetians,
when they were assured that the Truce was concluded, they ordered the Duke of
Urbin, that he should assemble all his men together, who lay then between
Modena and Regio, and join them with the Marquis of Saluzzo's forces, who were
in the parts about Bullonia; to the end that they might oppose the Imperialists
designs, it being suspected, that now, that the agreement was made, they would
fall upon the Commonwealths Territories. They also commanded Sebastian
Giustiniano who was Ambassador with the King of France, to assure the King,
that though the Pope had quitted the League, yet they would not forego his
friendship, and that they hoped they might be able by their joint forces to
beat the Imperialists, and effect those things which they had proposed unto
themselves as the end of their confederacy. But that if the King should judge
it fit to accept of the Truce, they were ready to be governed therein by his
Majesty. The Pope in his agreement made with the Viceroy, had reserved a place
for the Venetians, who of themselves were not much averse from accepting the
Truce: they thought it not amiss to take time, that they might prepare
themselves the better for defense; the rather, for that they hoped, that the
marriage being the mean while concluded between the King of England's daughter,
and the most Christian King, whereby he might declare himself for the League;
it might increase in force and reputation. It made more over much for their
advantage, to keep the Pope at this time in suspense, that he might not be
their Enemy, but rather hoping that when his fear of the present dangers should
be over, they might draw him once more to join with them. Besides, by this
suspention of Arms, occasion was offered of negotiating the universal peace,
with safety and satisfaction to all; that being the true object, which their
taking up of Arms aimed at. But in the first place, they pitched upon
friendship with France, wherefore finding that the King did not listen to these
proposals, they thought no more thereof. But the King propounding the renewing
of War, and the reassuming the enterprise of Naples with their Armies, and
their Fleets; the Senate were for Arming, but showed that they could reap no
good by turning their Forces upon those parts, at this time; because their
honor, and the peoples favor was lost, by the Popes having withdrawn himself
from the League, and by the restitution of the Towns which they had gotten.
They therefore proposed, as the safest and most advantageous course which could
then be taken, to defend the States of Lumbardy, if the agreement should go on;
and if not, that they should not abandon the defense of the Churches
Territories, and the Florentines, because their oppression would redound much
to the prejudice of the League.

But the Imperial Army, after the agreement made in Rome, though Cesare
Feramosca had sent them orders to keep where they were, were it either that
Burbone would not, or could not detain them, marched toward Romagna, and
sitting down before Cottignuola, they took it by agreement, and then went
toward Furili, But keeping the way to Meldola, they seemed as if they would
pass over the Alps by the Valley of Arnoe, and so enter into Tuscanie; hoping
to be able to repair themselves by the conveniences which were offered them by
the Senesi, and to supply the great need they stood in of victuals. Wherefore
the Venetian Senate, according to their former resolution ordered the Duke of
Urbin, that leaving so many men as he should think fitting for the defense of
their Country, he should advance with the rest, to assist the occasions of the
Church, and of the Florentines, and to oppose the Imperialists in all their
designs; whereupon the Duke, carrying part of the Army along with him near to
Bullognia, the Marquis of Saluzzo went with the rest by several ways, and in
several Quarters, to Imola, and fixed his Camp between Ravenna, and Faenza,
before the Enemy were gone from Cottignuola. The manner how to govern the War,
was long argued by the Captains of the League; and by a joint consent it was
agreed, that the Forces of the League should be divided into two several
bodies, to enclose the Enemy in the midst, to hinder them the more from
victuals, and to impede their designs whithersoever they turned. Yet the Pope
blaming post factum, the counsel which was formerly praised by Renzo, and by
Camillo Ursino, and by all his men, sought to excuse his precipitous agreement,
by having as he said, argued much coolness by these proceedings in the
Colleagues, as concerning the defense of his Affairs, and that therefore he was
forced to think upon some other course for his own safety.

But then the Pope, who before not crediting the dangers which were apprehended
by all the rest, thought himself secure; being mightily astonished at these new
advertisements, sent for the Ambassadors of all the confederate Princes, and
showing on the one side, his desire of the common good, nay, the necessity
which had enforced him to accept of the Truce; and on the other side, how
abusively he was used by the Imperialists; desired them to intercede earnestly
with their Princes, that upon occasion of so much danger, they would not, to
the common prejudice, abandon him and the Florentines: And he entreated
Dominico Ventero, the Commonwealths Ambassador, particularly, that he would
be a means to the Senate, that they would give order to the Duke of Urbin, to
carry his Army beyond the Alps, promising that he would renew the League, and
inviolably observe it. And the Senate, though the sending of those men so far
from their own State, and the hazarding of them amidst the Mountains, bore with
it no small difficulties, and though the Pope, following his own counsels, and
several from theirs, had given them occasion enough to lay aside all thought of
his Interest, yet continuing their first intention, they gave order to the Duke
of Urbin, and to Luigi Pisani (who when Contarini was left Commissary in
Lumbardie, was gone unto the Camp) that they should, if occasion should so
require, pass over the Alps. Whereupon the Imperialists being past, they were
quickly pursued by the French and by the Venetian Camps; so as almost at the
same time, all the Armies were brought into Tuscanie Burbone quartered near
Arezzo, and the Leagues Army at Barbarino; the City of Florence being as it
were in the midst between these two Armies; which occasioned great tumults in
the City, wherein the minds of the Citizens being variously contaminated by
the humor of factions, some desiring a popular Government, others the powers
but of a few, and the exaltation of the house of Medici, they fell easily to
civil contentions, and the popular faction began already to prevail* the
preheminency of Government being taken out of the hands of the Medici, and of
their dependants, and Hipolito, and Alessandro (both of them being the Popes
Nephews) were par^cularly declared to be Enemies to the Country. But the Duke
of Urbin coming opportunely to Florence, in the time of these commotions; who
as soon as he saw Burbone bend toward Tuscany, taking only 80 Gentlemen along
with him, hasted with the Commissary Pisani, and with Frederick Bozzuole, to
Florence, to keep the Florentines in loyalty to the League, put a stop to the
audacity of the young men, through ^ear of his army, which was not far off, and
reduced Affairs to their former condition, without any bloodshed or prejudice
by civil dissension: And got thereby thus much good to the Colleagues, as that
the Florentines being received into protection, promised adherance to the
League; and to maintain in the camp, at their own expenses, 250 Curassiers,
and 5000 Foot, or whatsoever other numbers the Pope should please.

Whilst these things were in treaty with the Florentines, the confederacy was
renewed in Rome by the other confederates; whereby the Venetians were bound in a
great sum of Money not to remove their men out of Tuscanie, or out of the
Ecclesiastical State without the Popes leave, and to be the first that should
send their Fleet against the Kingdom of Naples. Which conditions being thought
by the Senate to be too hard, as indeed they were, were not accepted of, but
their Ambassador, Dominico Veniero, having exceeded his Commission, was sent
for back to Venice, and committed all' Vf^icio dell' Anogaria, and Francisco
Pesaro was chosen Ambassador in his place; before whom, many had been chosen,
who would not accept of the employment: Alleging that they had other places of
Magistracy; wherefore a Law was made, that during the War, it might be lawful
for any one to be chosen, and taken out of whatsoever place or employment. But
lest the Pope might think they had any thought averse to the confederacy, or
common good, they sent immediately Secretary Andrea Rosso, to Rome, to
ascertain the Pope of their good will to the League; provided, that too heavy,
and almost insupportable conditions were not to be laid upon them, as had been;
especially at this time, when they were to reinforce their Army in Lumbardie;
Antonio da Leva being marched into the Field, and the Invasion of the
Landsknechts being expected. But Burbone, were it either that he did despair of
doing any good at Florence, to the defense whereof all the Confederates Forces
were brought; or that he did always intend the other, resolved to make toward
Rome, being thereunto invited, by Romes not being provided against these
dangers; for the Pope vainly confiding in the Citizens, and Country people,
great store whereof were entered into the City, and Arms were given to above
5000 of them, had been careless in raising new Foot, or in making use of those
which he had; insomuch, as having given Commission to Philippo Doria, to raise
3000 Foot, whereof he had already raised a third part, and brought them to
Civita Vecchia, he took no order for their coming to Rome: And he made his
Almnor write to Guido Rangone, who was come with a good number of Foot to
Otricoli, commanding him not to come toward Rome without express Order:
Wherefore though the Duke of Urbine had given Count Guido notice of Burbone's
March, to the end that he might go time enough to Rome; yet would he not stir,
having been commanded the contrary by the Pope. But he did not escape being
blamed for this by many, who said that in such a case he ought to have obeyed
the Duke of Urbine, as being the Captain General of the League. But Burbone
having now with great resolution overcome many difficulties, whereinto the Army
was reduced for want of moneys, marched toward Rome, wherein he used such
dispatch, as he advanced forty miles a day, making but one only Quarter
between Viterbo and Rome; the great rains which in many parts had overflown the
Country not making him slack his pace. Before he came to Rome, he sent to ask
leave of the Pope, to go (as he said) to the Kingdom of Naples; being thereunto
moved, either by the scarcity of victuals, or for fear of being surprised by
the Army of the League which followed him, if he should have made too long
abode any where, or (as some thought) that he might pick an occasion to do that
which he had already determined.

But the Pope was not pleased to listen to such proposals, or to give way
thereunto; were it either that he did now know the Enemies most intrinsecal
thoughts, or that he did sufficiently confide in the assistance of the people,
and in the Leagues Fleet, which was now at Cevita Vecchia with some store of
Foot. But howsoever it was, Burbone having somewhat refreshed his men with
victuals, which the men of Aquapendente, of St Lorenzo, and of some other Towns
which he had taken, furnished him with, he resolved on the sixth of May to
accost the Walls of Rome, and to give an assault. Renzo da Ceri, to whom the
Pope had committed the charge thereof, had made but weak defenses for the
Suburbs, and provided but slightly for all other defenses: So as the want of
diligence to secure dangers, made the Soldiers fool-hardiness more successful;
so as clapping the Ladders to the Walls of the Suburbs, and not being
discovered till it was too late, by the Defendants, by reason of a very thick
mist which fell that day, after some few hours dispute they won the Walls, and
entered the Suburb. Antonio di Montefalco, who had the custody of that part
where the first assault was given, and had 100 Foot with him, repulsed the
first Assalliants, and being afterward relieved by many of the armed people,
he for a while withstood the violence of the Enemy. But Burbones Soldiers
continuing to fight stoutly, those new and unexperienced people, when they saw
the danger increase, and growing very apprehensive of themselves, and of their
own particular Affairs, gave over the defense of the Wall, and began to run,
leaving free entrance to the Enemy; Burbone was one of the first that mounted
the Walls, who receiving a Musk^^ shot through his side and right thigh, fell
presently down, and dyed. Yet did not the Soldiers forbear going on, egged on
by the fury of Battle, and desire of prey. Then the Pope, teaching by a notable
example, that when the height of danger is in question, it is wisely done to
think all things possible, and to seek all opportune remedies against them, as
if they were sure to happen; being deceived in his trust, and in his hopes,
which were more grounded upon the Enemies disorder, then on his own Forces,
being poorly advised, and full of fear, after he had tarried a good while in
his Palace, expecting what the event of the Battle would be, resolved at last
to save himself, together with many of his Prelates, in the Castle of St Angelo.

Renzo, who had been long born away with the same error, and seeking too late
to amend it, ran up and down the City, calling upon the people, and soliciting
them to take up Arms, and to stand upon their defense. But they were so
possessed with fear, by reason of this unexpected and bitter accident, as his
words were not heard; nor was there any thing to be found in them but confusion
and terror. So as the Enemy making themselves soon, and without much ado,
Masters of the Suburbs, and of the Transtevere, they entered into the City
between the Gates Aurelia and Settimiana, which were not defended either by
Walls (for they were quite ruined by age) nor yet by armed men.

Thus a great and noble City, in a few hours space, and without almost any
defense, fell into the power of cruel Enemies: Much time, many men, and great
labor having been often formerly spent in the same War, in taking the meanest
and least Castles. Philippo Doria, and County Guido, when they saw Burbone
approach near Rome, were, without receiving any Orders, marched away with their
men, the one out of Orvieto, the other out of Cevita Vecchia, to assist the
Pope: But being prevented by Burbone, who had blocked up the Avenues to the
City, they soon returned to from whence they were come. And the Duke of Urbine,
following the Enemy, though somewhat the slower by reason of the hindrances
his Army met with, came therewith to Viterbo, where, finding the Country wasted
by the Enemy, he was forced to stay for want of victuals; not having above
seventeen thousand Foot in his Army, of the thirty thousand which by obligation
of the Confederates it ought to have consisted on, so much was it diminished by
various accidents: The Light Horse and the Foot going often out of these
Quarters, got many Booties, which they took from the Imperial Soldiers, as
they came loaded with prey from Rome. There is nothing so calamitous, so
bitter, wicked, nor cruel, which Rome did not at this time undergo: Falling
from the height of all prosperity, to the very bottom of all misery; which
affords a notable example of the change of fortune, and of the frailty of
humane Affairs; for in the times last before these, to wit, in the Popedom of
Leo; the Court of Rome was gotten to a great height, and to such a
magnificency, and splendour of living, as there was nothing of worldly felicity
more to be desired in her. Great store of Courtiers, men excellent in all arts,
Palaces princely adorned, abundance of all things. So as the people of Rome
being enriched by the concourse of so many Nations, and by the profuseness of
their expenses, lived merrily and luxuriously; and though Clement, as well by
nature, as by accidents of War, was somevvhat more sparing and modest, yet this
course being once begun, the same manner of life was still continued both in
the Court and City. The Dutch and Spanish Foot being entered the City, as has
been said, they became barbarous, with much rage and fierceness, to all things;
not distinguishing between what was sacred, and what was profane, without any
bounds to their avarice or lust: sacking, rapine, and other miseries which
attend the conquered, and which use to end in a few days, continued in this
City for many months; the soldiers grew furious against the popularity,
killing as well such as were unarmed, as such as were armed, sparing neither
Age, Nation, nor Profession: having assaulted the houses, they made the Masters
thereof Prisoners, taking away what they had of most precious, nay, using
torments to make them discover what they had hid, and showing no more respect
toward churches; they with their wicked and sacrilegious hands robbed Altars,
took away holy Relics from the Shrines, and the piously consecrated vows of
many devout persons of all Nations, and violating even the holiest Pixes, they
threw the most blessed Sacraments to the ground, and that they might leave
nothing uncontaminated, or free from their wickedness, they dragged noble
Matrons out of their houses, and sacred Virgins out of their Monasteries, and
stripping them stark naked, led them through the public streets, and most
libidinously satisfied their dishonest wills. Nor were the greatest and noblest
Prelates of the Court more secure then others, to whom the Dutch Foot
principally, using all sorts of scorn and infamy, showed the immense hatred
they bore to the Church of Rome.

This miserable Fortune, and so many grievous calamities, made all men confess,
that the ancient ruins brought by the Northern Barbarians to the City of Rome,
were renewed; nay, that the cruelties of the Goths, and other barbarous
Nations, was so far outdone by these most cruel and wicked men, as their
detested memory would last longer then that of any others: But the scourge of
this miserable people did not determine in the power of men; for through the
nastiness of these base people, and by their dissolute way of life, or were it
through the malign influence of the heavens, great sicknesses ensued soon
after; which growing contagious, slew men suddenly, so as the infected fell
down dead as they walked and talked in the streets. This mortality was followed
with such a sterility of the earth, and with such a scarcity of corn for humane
life, proceeding either for want of manuring the fields, or for that heavens
anger was not as yet appeased, as not only people of mean condition, but even
those that had wont to abound in wealth, being reduced to great poverty, and
feeding upon the vilest of meats, went begging their bread; in such sort, as
this most noble country being made a receptacle of Soldiers, and such as were
her most capital enemies, was abandoned by Citizens, and by the Court, and
became a horrid and loathsome spectacle; so as it might be truly affirmed of
her, Behold a City reduced to solitude, and enslaved, which had wont to command
all Nations.

for the restitution of the Towns pretended to. The Senates Answer, and their
reasons. The Princes desire Peace, but the means how to compass it is not
found. The Senate resolves upon war: who grow apprehensive of the French, by
reason of their slender provisions: and therefore ^orbear not to arm themselves
well. Various success of Arms in the Kingdom of Naples, and in the State of
Genua: wherein the French prosper but badly, and Monsieur St. Paul is taken

distasted. Caesar comes into Italy. The ^greement made at Cambrai, wherein the
Venetians are excluded. The Emperors pretenses to the Towns of Puglia. The
Turks proceedings in Hungary makes him incline to Peace: The Senate is much
perplexed, who at last resolve to restore Cervia, and Ravenna to the Pope; and
the cities of Puglia to the Emperor; whereby an universal peace is established
in Italy.

THe Senate of Venice was greatly troubled to hear of the taking and sacking of
Rome, and of the Pope's imprisonment. Others were moved to compassionate the
miserable misfortune of that noble and flourishing City; the sad condition of
so many Court Prelates, and chiefly that of the Pope; being brought from the
most supreme degree of reverence and authority, into much lowness and danger,
and was still exposed to the fury of Arms, and to many injuries: others were
sorely grieved at these proceedings of the Spaniards, who they imagined would
now neither want boldness nor fortune to attempt any thing to the prejudice of
the Liberty of Italy; especially, since there was no slight occasion of
jealousy, that they would carry the Pope prisoner into pain, to the end, that
they might afterward by their accustomed cunning, and vain pretenses, possess
themselves of the Churches dominion, and make the way easier for themselves to
be lords of Italy. Wherefore the Venetians moved partly out of compassion and
disdain, for the injuries done unto the Pope; and also out of State policy, not
to suffer Charles his fortune to increase further, to their yet greater
prejudice, they resolved, to concur with all their forces to the freeing of
the Pope, and to spare neither cost nor danger therein: Wherefore they gave
strict order to the Duke of Urbine, their captain General, and to their
Commissaries Pisani and Vetturi, to advance with their Army, and setting all
other things aside, to attend the relief of the Castle, where the Pope was shut
up, and to use all possible means to set him at Liberty, and to free him from
danger; and, that they might not be disturbed in this enterprise, they fell
forthwith to the raising of new foot, whereby to add unto their army which was
given them in Lombardy 10000 men more, that they might therewithal encounter,
Antonio da Leva, who being marched into the field, and meeting with no
obstacle, was likely to grow daily stronger by the succor which he expected
from Germany. The Venetians were much encouraged in this their intention; and
their hopes of good success was increased by the great preparations which the
Kings of France and England made, to fall upon (as they constantly gave out)
the Provinces of Flanders with their Armies and Fleet, whereby to force the
Emperor to reduce all his forces into those parts, and to abandon the affairs
of Italy. These things did very much rescent what had happened to Rome, for
which respect, the King of England hastened away the Cardinal of York, who was
sent to the court of France, to take some order for the intervene and meeting
of the two Kings; wherein the chief thing to be treated of was, the Popes
freedom, and the securing of the Ecclesiastical State, nor did the King of
France show himself less forward herein; who had immediately sent orders to his
Commanders in Italy, to attend the freeing of the Pope with all their might;
and the securing of the Churches dominions: for the better effecting whereof,
he advised the Cardinals, which were yet at Liberty, to meet all of them at
Avignon, whether the Cardinal of York promised also to come, this place being
made choice of, as safe and commodious for the Transactions which were to pass
between them and the Court of Spain: and the Cardinals, accepting of the advice
of meeting, chose Bullognia for the place of their convention. But Caesar,
hearing of what had befallen at Rome, and of the Popes captivity, appeared to
be no less displeased at it, then were the rest: affirming publicly, that he
had rather his Commanders had not been Victors, then to have used the Victory
so: and going about to justify himself, as of a thing not only done without
his consent, but even against his directions: He alleged his long endeavors
for Peace, out of a desire whereof, he had passed by so many injuries received
from the Princes of the League; and had in many things condescended to their
desires; especially in such things as concerned the Territories and honor of
the Church, and the exaltation of the Apostolical Sea; which was always of
such force with him, as he had always preferred it before his own interests,
and before the satisfaction of many of the States of the Empire, which sought
to withdraw themselves from the obedience of the Popes of Rome; the knowledge
whereof had made Leo, and Adrian the 6th his friends, and had made them ^avour
his desires and enterprises, as just and honest: That he was now the more
troubled at it, because his dislike was not able to undo what was done; but
that as for himself, he was ready to remedy it as much as he could, and to
embrace all fair conditions of agreement, touching which he himself had written
to the King of England, and had treated thereof with diverse Cardinals of the
Court.

yet his actions answered not to these his words; for he neither gave any
positive answer touching the Pope's freedom, nor was he less diligent in
providing for War; and in his discourse, he would often excuse Bourbone, and
his Army; he would aggravate offenses received from the Pope, mention his
inconstancy, and breach of faith in past agreements, and show into what dangers
the Colleagues had endeavored to bring him; whence it might be comprehended,
that his intentions did not correspond with his speeches, and that nothing but
necessity, and force of Arms, would make him consent to the setting of the
Pope, and the King of France his Sons at liberty. Wherefore the King having
formerly resolved to take ten thousand Switzers into pay, for the affairs of
Lombardy, and being till now somewhat slow in effecting that his resolution, and
growing more jealous and apprehensive of the Imperialists fortune and designs,
after the taking of Rome, he forthwith sent moneys for that purpose to Lions,
and earnestly solicited their departure.

The Venetians were not wanting in increasing the King's desire herein, by
their fervent and frequent endeavors, minding him of the necessity of strongly
prosecuting this War, since Religion and State policy did concur, in not
suffering the Apostolic See, and the Liberty of Italy to be suppressed; and
that they might invite him thereunto no less by actions then by words, they
resolved to rig up their Fleet with all speed, which had suffered much by bad
Weather at Cevita Vecchia, and by other misfortunes; and moreover, to Arm four
other Bastard Galleys, whereof Antonio Marcello was made Commander, that their
Fleet might be the readier, and more able to assault the Marshes of Puglia:
They propounded likewise to the King, that ten thousand other Foot, besides the
Switzers, might be raised at the common expense; and the mean while, they took
many Commanders into their pay, such as were then esteemed most experienced in
Military affairs; and amongst the rest, Count Gaiazzo, and the Marquis
Palavasino; and to enhearten Francisco Sforza (whose friendship and ready will
was thought necessary above all things else, for the good success of the
affairs in the State of Milan) they lent him ten thousand Ducats, wherewith he
promised to increase the number of his men, which were already above two
thousand Foot, and to come with them in person to Lodi, and join with the
Venetian Army. And because the Towns in Romagna were exposed to much danger,
not having any one who did assist or succor them in times of such misery and
disorder, the Senate being much pressed thereunto, sent moneys to the Governor
of Ravenna, to raise Foot, and to Garrison that City, encouraging him to hold
out, and promising him greater supplies if need should require; which they soon
after made good, by sending three hundred Foot, and an hundred light Horse into
the City, under the command of Iovan di Naldo, charging him to hold that City
in the name of the Apostolic See, and of the League; but some disorders
arising between the Citizens and the Soldiers, the City sent Iovan Donato, one
of their citizens, to Venice, to desire they would send one of their Nobles, to
be as Commissary in Ravenna; to which purpose, Bartholomeo Contarini was
chosen. The like also did those of Cervia soon after, the Guelfs having driven
out those of the Ghebeline faction, and received in a Venetian Garrison and
Magistrate, not only giving way unto, but requiring an Apostolic Legate, for
the quiet and preservation of those Cities.

But the Duke of Urbine having received Orders from the Senate, and ordering
all things in reference thereunto, having first made sure of the City of
Perugia, which was then governed by Gentile Baglione, who was suspected to have
held intelligence with the enemy; and having put a good Garrison thereinto, he
went with his Army to Todi, and from thence to Orvietto; near unto which place,
the French and Ecclesiastiques being joined to the Venetians, as was formerly
agreed upon, the Duke calling a council of the chief Commanders, and causing
the Senates Letters to be read, affirmed resolutely, that he would march
toward Rome, and according to his Commission, endeavor by all means possible,
to get the Pope out of the Castle; and not refuse, if the Enemy should come
forth, to come to a day of Battle with them, wherein he himself would be in the
first rank, and put himself upon the greatest dangers. Which resolution being
approved of by Commissary Pisani, was likewise assented unto by all the rest;
only Commissary Vetturi opposed it, and entered his protestation against it in
writing, as being a precipitous advice, full of certain danger, and uncertain
success; saying, that our men were far inferior both in number and worth to
those of the Enemies Army, wherein there were many men, and most of them well
disciplined, accustomed to fight, and to overcome, and therefore grown bold,
and ready to with stand a much greater force. This did somewhat allay the Duke's
former ardour, yet still he continued his resolution of carrying his Army
nearer Rome, intending to take up his quarters in some strongly situated place,
where he might be ready for whatsoever event should happen. He therefore betook
himself to new councels; which was, to endeavor with less danger to bring the
Pope out of the Castle; to which purpose, he in great haste sent Frederico da
Bozzole with a Troop of Curassiers, good store of light Horse, and some
companies of Dragoons toward the City, hoping that by his unexpected coming,
the Pope might find some way of getting out; and having so sure a guide, might
come to the Leagues Army. Which course, through several accidents, proved but
vain. But the Army advancing still the mean while, they heard that new Trenches
were made about the Castle, and so secure, as the enterprise grew more
difficult; and moreover, that some Spanish Foot were expected to come to Rome
from Naples, from whence Captain Alcone was already come with some companies.
Wherefore the Duke, with the consent of the rest of the Commanders, thought it
not fit that the Army should advance any further, whereof he gave the Senate
speedy notice, acquainting them with the cause of his stay, and requiring much
greater forces, that he might more safely, and with better hopes, attempt the
freeing of the Pope; to effect the which, he said it was requisite to have
fifteen thousand Switzers in the Army, a great number of Pioners, and a greater
Train of Artillery.

The Venetians were much troubled to hear this, that the Pope should continue
so long, in so sore troubles; and the rather for that some Letters were at this
time read in the Senate, written by the Pope himself to Guicchardine, the
Ecclesiastical Commissary, and by him sent to Venice: Wherein deploring his
adversity, and sad condition, he entreated, solicited, and conjured the
Confederates to procure his freedom. Nor was the loss of the Leagues reputation
by reason of this slowness less grievous; whereby the credit of the Enemy was
the more increased, and the fear daily increased, that the Pope out of mere
desperation would agree upon any terms with the Imperialists: So as they knew
not now whereupon to ground their hopes, or how to lay their designs of War:
For the things that were required were difficult, and asked length of time,
whereby things would grow worse and almost impossible to be repaired. Wherefore
the Senate, understanding the hindrance which Commissary Veturi put in the
Armies approaching near Rome, took the place from him, and committed him to the
Office of the Avogaria, that he might give an account of his action; but his
trial being delayed, and the anger which was conceived against him being with
time allayed, and it being found that his advice was not without some reason,
he was absolved in Court.

But the Senate persisting still in their first opinion, did with greater
efficacy then before, renew their orders to their Captain General, and to
their Commissaries, that using all possible diligence, they should resume their
former resolution, of drawing with their Army near Rome and of endeavoring to
free the Pope; whereat all of them were so highly distasted, as the Duke of
Urbine was ready to quit the Commonwealths service: But afterward dislikes
being on all sides tempered, his place was confirmed upon him for two years
longer, the Senate taking him and his State into their protection. But to give
better security, and as it were, a pledge of his fidelity, he sent his Wife, and
the Prince his Son, to live at Venice, which the Senate took extremely well,
and by Letters full of thanks and affection, desired to confirm this good
opinion in him, showing how great expectation every one was in of his worth
upon this occasion; and particularly the esteem which they themselves had not
only of his valor, but of his loyalty and love toward the Commonwealth. And
because in this commotion of Affairs, it much imported them to keep the
Florentines faithful to the League, the Venetians labored to increase the
disposition which they found in them to stand to the confederacy to which the
Pope had formerly agreed in their name: Though after what had happened at Rome,
they had driven the Medici out of the City, and reduced the Government into the
former popular condition.

The Popes Imprisonment, and the Spaniards prosperous success, proving daily
more grievous, and vexatious to the French, they betook themselves to make
diligent provision for War; the King said he would come himself in person to
Lions, that he might be nearer at hand to provide for what was requisite for
the Army; and that he had given order for the levying of more Foot, which
amounted to the number of 15000 Switzers, and 10000 Italians: He likewise manned
out Andrea Doria, at his own expenses, with eight Galleys, that he might be
therewithal serviceable to what should be done by Se^: and agreement being
opportunely made at this time between him and the King of England, he exhorted
him, since there were diverse accidents which deferred the waging of War with
Caesar beyond the mountains, to contribute moneys for the payment of ten
thousand Dutch foot, to the end, that they might make war with him the more
forceably in Italy: And that there might not want a Chieftain of authority in
the business, he resolved to send Lautrech into Italy, to be General of the
League, who might command in chief over all the Armies: and the Venetians to
honor him, chose Pietro Pisaro, Procurator of S. Mark, for their Ambassador,
who was to meet him as soon as he should be come into Italy, and to be
continually assistant with him.

Whilst affairs were ordering thus, the Imperialists which were in Rome,
although their numbers were much increased by the Spanish Foot, which were
lately come from Naples by Sea to that City, so as there was about four and
twenty thousand foot in the Imperial Army, yet did they employ their time
idely, in making use of the booty which they had got, not making any further
progress; the Commanders authority not being sufficient to make them go out of
the City, nor to curb their licentiousness, only some few Dutch Foot went out
of Rome (by whose going, it was thought that all the Army would rise) and
sacked Terni, and Narni, without passing any further, though the Leagues Army
were retreated; for that despairing of the business of Rome, the Venetians had
caused their Army, which was followed by the Marquis of Saluzzo with the
French, to retreat to the confines of the Senesi, to secure the Florentine
affairs, according to the ratification of the League; upon the obligation of
the Florentines maintaining five thousand foot in the Camp at their own cost:
in which they showed themselves the more ready, for that they were the most
exposed to danger; for the Imperial Commanders threatened to turn their forces
upon them, being incensed, for that having in the beginning of the Pope's
adversity, given them some intimation that they would adhere unto the Emperor,
they did afterward close with his enemies. The Venetians were then six
thousand Italian foot, two thousand Lansknechts, thirteen hundred Light Horse,
and two thousand Curassiers. The French foot exceeded not seven thousand,
though the King paid for a great many more. And this counsel proved very
lucky, for it kept the War far from the Commonwealth, it hindered the further
proceedings of the enemy, it preserved the City of Bullognia, by the reputation
of the neighboring Forces, which was in the more danger, by reason of the
Intelligence held between the Imperialists and Bentevoglii; whose faction was
grown the greater, by the addition of the Malvezzi; wherefore the Venetians, at
the request of Cardinal Cido, who had the Government of that City, sent two
thousand Foot to guard it. But the scarcity of victuals, and the many sore
sicknesses, by which the Army was much diminished, hindered them from making any
attempt.

Out of these reasons, the enemies forces being much increased, and those of
the Confederates diminished, the Pope, despairing of being soon relieved,
applied himself wholly to Treaties of agreement. Wherefore he very much desired
the Duke of Urbin, that he would suffer the Viceroy to come safely to Rome,
hoping by his means to obtain better conditions, then were then offered him by
the other Imperial Commanders: which succeeded otherwise, either, for that the
Viceroy had not authority enough to do it, or else, for that minding himself
more then the Pope, he agreed rather to those conditions which might please the
soldiers, that he might win their favor, and be made their commander, then to
those which made for the Pope's advantage; who still continuing earnestly to
desire an agreement, for he had been often deluded by those of the League, they
came presently to an agreement, but upon hard and dishonorable Conditions, and
which were often afterward refused by him,

He being thereby bound to pay 400000 Ducats to the Army, and to put into the
Imperialists hands the Castle of Angelo, the Forts of Hostia, Cevita Vecchia,
and Cevita Castellana, and moreover to cause the cities of Parma and Piacenza
to be delivered up unto them; for all which, he was notwithstanding not to be
then set at liberty, but to be carried to Gaetta, and there to expect Caesar 's
resolution, touching what was to be done about the ratification of the
Agreement, and concerning his person, and the like of many Cardinals, and
Prelates which were in the Castle.

The Venetians were much displeased at this, since by these Articles Cesar's
Forces, and reputation were greatly increased; having lately incensed Caesar yet
more against them, by having given Commission to their Ambassador, That,
together with the King of France's and the King of England's Ambassador, he
should require Caesar to set the Pope at Liberty, and in case of denial, they
were all of them to denounce war against him. But, it being known, that it was
great necessity, the fear of his own person, and chiefly, the hatred which the
Collonesi, and the Dutch Foot bore unto his name and person, which made him
accept of so prejudicial terms; believing that he might easily change his
mind, and that time might make way for better fortune; they resolved to hinder
such things, which, post factum, would be hard, and perhaps impossible to do:
therefore, for the preservation of Cremona, they caused their Army in Lombardy,
which quartered in the Territories of Crema, to pass over the river Ada, that
it might garrison those Cities, hinder the delivery of them up, disturb the
business agreed upon, and to keep the Imperialists in work, and to weaken them
by laying waste the Country about Milan, and Pavia. These forces of the
Venetians were then about 10000 foot, 500 Curassiers, 700 Light Horse, under
the command of the Duke of Urbine, and of Commissary Dominico Contarini; to
boot, with 3500 foot, which the Duke of Milan, (who was come according to his
promise to the Army,) had brought with him. Yet they did not purpose as yet to
fall upon any important Action, for they expected, Lautrech's coming, who,
being gone from France, with part of the Forces which were destined for the
enterprise of Italy, was already come to Piemont.

The Commanders differed in their opinion, touching the way of managing the
war: some thought, that it was best, that the French should join with the
Leagues Army; which, being again advanced, were quartered near Narni; these
alleged for their advice, that fit occasion might be taken from the disorders,
and inconveniences of the Enemy, of obtaining their chief end, which was, the
Pope's Liberty, by drawing to the walls of Rome; since that the Cesarean Army,
by reason of the Plague which was in that City, and thorough the licentiousness
wherein the soldiers had lived for many months past, was much diminished both
in numbers and Valor; the Foot lying, some within, some without the Town,
without either order, or military Discipline, and many of them going daily in
threaves from the Camp; so as by the addition of the French they might hope to
prevail over the enemy, and to drive them quickly out of Rome. Yet others
thought, that the safer way to atchieve this, was, to force the Imperial
Commanders to draw their men out of Rome, to relieve the State of Milan,
wherein the war being still hottest, it was thought, the Enemy would not be
able to make their party good, no, though they should recall their army from
Rome; and that the relief would either come too late, or not be sufficient to
stop the course of Victory: so as, many good effects might be wrought at one
and the same time, and peradventure a final end might be put to the war. This
being generally approved by the greatest party, Lautrech entered the State of
Milan, with powerful forces: 8000 Switzers, 3000 Gascones, and 10000 foot,
which were led on by Peter of Navar; and being come into the country of
Alexandria, he did not think it fit to advance any further, without attempting
somewhat with his Forces; he therefore sat down before the Town of Bosco,
which was guarded by ten Thousand Dutch Foot, which, after some days battery,
yielded. He with the like success got the Town of Alexandria soon after, and
put thereinto a garrison of five hundred of his men, that he might be sure to
have (as he alleged) a safe place for his men to have recourse unto, in case
of adverse fortune; and likewise to receive those that were to come from
France. But, both the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians were much troubled
thereat: and it proved afterward a great hindrance to the affairs of the
League, through some diffidence which grew among the Colleagues, who grew
jealous of the proceeding of the French, for their having detained the City,
and through no small scandal that Lautrech took on the other side, at this
their jealousy. The Venetians complained hereof by their Ambassadors, both to
Lautrech, and to the King himself; placing the occasion of their dislike
notwithstanding rather upon what judgment the enemy would make thereof, then in
any self interest, or doubt of theirs. And Monsieur di Taberna, who was
resident in the Court of France on the Duke of Milan's behalf, by not
rejoicing, nor holding any discourse with the King about this acquisition, did,
by saying nothing, witness as much his masters displeasure: Which, because it
might produce many bad effects, the Venetians labored to free him of this
suspicion, and to appease his displeasure, witnessing the Kings good will, and
excusing Lautrech: And, that these their endeavors might be the more
efficacious, and to maintain the Dukes reputation as much as they could, they
sent Gabriel Veniero Ambassador to him, to remain Resident with him, Luigi
Sabadino the States Secretary having been there till then.

Alexandria being taken, Lautrech gave out that he would march with his Army
toward Rome, to free the Pope, who though he had accorded with the Spaniards,
as has been said, was still kept Prisoner by them, many difficulties being met
withal as well in the payment of the moneys promised to the Soldiers, as in
the assignation of the Strongholds; nor did Caesar seem to be well resolved
therein, though by his Speeches he sought to make the contrary be believed. But
the Venetians did openly oppose this course; not but that they did equally with
the King desire the Popes freedom, but because they thought it little useful
for the common affairs; the same reasons and respects concurring then, and
being made more considerable by other new accidents, which upon narrow
examination before, were by common consent thought sufficient to persuade, that
Lautrech when he past first over the Mountains, was rather to come into
Lombardy then into the Territories of Rome; it being known that all the
remainder of the War, would depend upon the success thereof. That there was
great hopes at this time of getting the Cities of Pavia and Milan, each of them
being but slightly garrisoned; and Antonio da Leva, by whose diligence and
discipline that State was more maintained, then by his Forces, being very sick
and altogether disabled for action: That if this occasion should be lost, the
condition of all things would grow daily worse for the League; for a great many
Landsknechts were ready to fall down presently from the Country of Tinoll into
Lombardy: By whose coming the Enemy would become much stronger, and it would be
but in vain for the Confederates to attempt any thing: But that if these men
should find no safe receptacle in Milan, they neither having Horse nor
victuals, they would be forced to alter their minds, and to return home. Time
and opportunity would this mean while be gotten for the coming of the ten
thousand Dutch Foot to the Camp, which were raised with the King of Englands
moneys; by which the Army being much increased both in reputation and Forces,
might with assured hopes of victory, proceed on to the Enterprise of Rome, and
the Enemies would be soon driven from thence, and the Ecclesiastical State and
Liberty of Italy secured. Lautrech being overcome by these reasons, was content
to march with his Army toward Pavia, which not being timely succored by the
Forces which Antonio da Leva sent thither from Milan, fell easily into the
Leagues hands, and was sacked by the Army, the Soldiers using all sorts of
cruelty to the Inhabitants, because it was said that they boasted themselves to
have quelled the King of France; by the imprisonment of King Francis, which
happened whilst he besieged that City. This News was very welcome to France, the
French men thinking that by this victory, they had cancelled the infamy of the
Battle fought by that Nation in that place some few years before.

At the same time Andrea Doria was come to Savona with his Galleys, and some
others belonging unto the French, where the Venetian Galleys were to have
joined with him to attempt the business of Genna; it being thought that great
advantage might have been made by that City, if it should be reduced to the
Kings obedience. But after a whiles stay, and before the Venetian Fleet came
unto them, a very fair occasion was offered of suddenly dispatching the
business: For the Genouese ships being come loaded with corn to the Washes near
Porto Fino, the Genouese being very desirous to have them come safe unto the
City, were gone out to meet them with 8 Galleys, part Genouese, part Spanish,
and put therewith into the same Haven. Moreover, understanding that Doria had
landed some men, and that making some Trenches, he endeavored to make himself
Master of the Haven, and to hinder any relief from coming to those Ships, and
so get possession of them, they had sent Agostino Spinola thitherward with a
company of select Foot, to disturb the Enemies works, and to secure the Haven,
and the Ships. Wherein they had good success; for Spinola falling at unawares
upon Doria's Soldiers, whilst they were confused and in disorder, put them
quickly to flight, though they were more in number, and took Phillippo Doria
Prisoner. But News coming not long after to Genua, that Cesare, Son to Ianus
Frigoso, was come into the Valley of Pozzavera, and encamped in a Town called
San Pietra de l'arena, with two thousand Foot, and some Troops of Venetian
Horse, with which Lautrech had sent him to favor the business of Genua, and
that being gone from thence he was marching toward that City, they were all of
them on a sudden mightily afraid, for that their best Soldiers were gone out
of the City, to Porto Fino; and for fear of some rising in the City, by reason
of the several factions that were therein. Wherefore the Adorni, who had then
the chief Government of the City, apprehending these commotions, sent to
Spinola, commanding him to come speedily with all the men he had with him, and
to relieve the City: So as being enforced to abandon the Fleet, he left it a
prey for Doria, into whose hands eight Galleys, and six of the Enemies Ships
fell without any dispute or danger. The mean while the Adorni joining many
others of the people to the Soldiers which Spinola brought along with him, and
believing that by falling at unawares upon the few that Fregoso brought along
with him, he might overcome them, and keep the City safe and quiet; they went
forth, and drew near the Enemies Quarters: Who being advantagiously seated,
fought more confidently, and did not only make their party good, but began to
disorder them, and afterward to make them run, killing many of them, and
taking many of them prisoners, amongst which chief Commanders Spinola was one.
Wherefore Fr^goso pursuing his victory, and not being retarded by a company of
Spanish foot, of the Garrison, who were marched out to relieve their fellows,
he routed them easily, and marched toward the City of Genua; which being
bereft of almost all defense, and having many in her, who were formerly
resolved to surrender by reason of the love they bore to the family of Fregosi,
and to the French, did receive in Cesare Fregoso, and his Soldiers into the
Town* not making any opposition: And the Government being taken from the
Adorni, the City was reduced into the power of the King of France, in whose
behalf Theodore Trivulcio was left Governor there.

And the Venetians, that they might not leave the valor of their Captains
unrewarded, added 30 more Curassiers to Fregosa's conduct, and doubled his pay.
They likewise showed some testimony of honor to Guido Naldo, to Agostino
Clusone, Hanniball Fregos^, Cesare Martinengo, and to others who had behaved
themselves worthily in this action.

The business of Genua being ended, and Giovan Moro, Commissary of the Venetian
Fleet, being come with 16 Galleys to Legorne, where Doria waited for him; they
resolved to go with all the Army to the Island of Sardignia, which they thought
would be easily gotten, and would make very much for the enterprise of Sicily,
But the counsel proved unfortunate; for the Fleet being come near the City of
Sardo, and having got some maritime Towns, it so fell out, as there arose a
great Tempest at Sea, which scattered the Galleys, and made them go several
ways: Some that belonged to Venice, after being long beaten by the Tempest,
they got safe into Legorne; others, after having run much hazard, got into
Corsica, whither also all the French Galleys were first come, save two which
were split upon the Sardignian shore. And nothing being then to be attempted
more at Sea, the Winter drawing on, and the Fleet sorely rent, Commissary Moro
came with his Galleys to Corfu. At this time Pietro Laud, was made General at
Sea by the Venetians, He was commanded to coast along the neighboring Seas of
the Islands, and Dominions of Venice, to secure and consolate the Subjects; but
chiefly, that passing into Sicily, he should bring away as many Ships as he
should find laden with corn in those parts, and send them to Venice, to supply
the great scarcity of corn that the City was then in.

But the General having in this interim, sent Commissary Agostino da Mula with
two nimble Galleys, and Antonio Marcello with four bastard Galleys, to secure
the Eastern Seas, it happened that Marcello being in the Haven of Suda, in the
Island of Candia, and being told that a Turkish Gally was passing by the
Island, he believing that it was the famous Pirate Cortugoli, who at that very
time, and about those Seas, had rifled and burnt a Ship of Venice, and cruelly
slain all the Mariners and Passengers, he put forth to Sea, with a great desire
to vindicate this injury; and without any farther knowledge, having met with
her, assaulted her, took her, and brought her and her consorts into Bicorne,
where he might afterward ken 7 Turkish Galleys, passing by one after another;
whereof the Moor of Alessandria was Captain, to whom likewise the Gally that
was taken belonged; but Marcello keeping his station, and apprehending nothing,
especialy since he saw the Galleys dispersed, afforded the Moor opportunity to
assault him (as he had designed to do) at unawares; who having gotten all his
consorts speedily together, assaulted our Galleys on the flanck; Marcello being
affrighted at the unexpected assault, sought to escape the danger by flying, as
did his consorts; but not being able to be gone so soon, one only Gally
escaped, and the Moor took the other two, who carried them into Alessandria:
Which action the Captain being to give an account of, he was committed to the
Magistrate of the Avogadori, and was sent for prisoner from the Fleet, but he
dyed for very grief by the way. And Solimar, finding the Captains imprudency,
and the Senates respect, in a civility not at all usual with barbarous Princes,
did not only send back to the Venetians the Galleys which were taken, but also
great store of Saltpeter along with them; which was a very seasonable present
at this time, they having spent all the Saltpeter they could get out of the
neighboring places, by reason of their continual Wars. Soliman at the same
time had given many other signs of his love and good will to the Commonwealth
giving them free liberty to carry corn from Allessandria and from other of his
Countries, and using great civilities and expressions of love unto them in
their greatest adversities. Wherefore the Senate thought fit, in correspondency
to the effects of so great a Princes love, whose friendship was very behooveful
for the Commonwealth, to send an express Ambassador to him, who in the names
of them all, was to thank him for his so many testimonies of love to the
Commonwealth, and to desire the continuance thereof. To this purpose Tonnaso
Contarino was made choice of, who had many rich vestments, and other noble
ornaments given him, to present unto the Court Bashaws, and chiefly to Ibrahim,
who was then in great esteem by reason of the extraordinary favor he was in
with Soliman.

Whilst these things were a doing, Lautrech returning to his former designs,
when it was thought that pursuing his victory, he would have carried his Camp
to before Milan, past with all his men over the Poe, and marched toward
Piacenza, with a resolution (as he said) setting all other things aside, to
endeavor the Popes freedom. This caused much wonder in all men, that
abandoning the fortune and occasion which was offered him, of putting a speedy
end to the Wars of Lombardy, he would leave such relics thereof behind him,
as in time would be harder to be suppressed; nay which might much endanger what
he had gotten, since none but the Venetians staid there, and the Enemies
expected great and sudden succors: Which made many men doubt, that Lautrech
did this, rather out of his own particular affection, or out of some of his
Kings interest, then by any care he had of the Popes freedom. It was very
certain that he was very highly offended at the complaints that the Venetians
and Francisco Sforza had made, touching the affairs of Alexandria; and likewise
that at this time the treaty of agreement with Caesar was closely followed, for
which it made much for the King, that the whole state of affairs should remain
as yet uncertain, and doubtful. And this jealousy seemed to be the better
grounded, since Lautrech, who went so hastily, and so unopportunely from the
state of Milan, proceeded afterward very slowly in his m^rch; and that after
the arrival of the Dutch foot, the expectation whereof he alleged in excuse
formerly for his delay, he stayed still loytering at Parma. Nor did the Army of
the League make any greater progress, which being brought to Monte Falco, spent
their time idly, though the weakness of the Enemies Army afforded them
occasion of making some attempt. Whence the Venetians began to suspect, that
the Duke of Urbine, out of some particular respects of his own, did not proceed
with such sincerity as he ought to have done; wherefore they set a Guard upon
his Wife and Son, who were then in Mur^no. But the Duke having sent a Gentleman
of his, one Horatio Florido, to Venice, that he might get leave to come himself
to Venice, to justify his actions, the Senate, either being better informed,
or that they might the better accomodate themselves to the time and affairs,
would not suffer him to leave the Army; but removing away the Guard from his
Wife and Son, seemed to be satisfied with him: But the Venetians, since they
could not make Lautrech alter his resolution, made their men come into
Lombardy, which were then about fifteen thousand foot, having left three
thousand five hundred Light Horse with Lautrech, for the enterprise of Rome;
being thereunto moved, out of the pressing care which they had of retaining the
Towns which they had recovered in the Dukedom of Milan, the weight whereof lay
only upon the Commonwealth. Francisco Sforza being so exhausted of money, as he
was hardly of himself able to maintain the ordinary Garrisons of the City, much
less to bring men into the Field, as he was bound to do by his Articles, and as
was necessary to resist the Forces which were prepared by Antonio da Leva.
Moreover, the respect of their own affairs did not a little move them, and the
fear of bringing the danger home unto themselves, bereaving their Country of
defense, by sending their Forces so far off, and especially because they heard
that many armed people were gathered together in the parts about Tirol, and
that great provision of victuals and munition was made in the City of Trent, to
be sent into Italy: And this fear made the greater impression in them, because
now Ferdinando of Austria, who had quieted the affairs of Hungary, by the
victory he had gotten over Giovan, the Vayvod of Transylvania, had better
convenience to attend the affairs of Italy, as he had often times seemed very
desirous to do. Wherefore thinking it necessary to increase their Army to the
number of twenty thousand foot, and to make greater provisions to maintain
another great War, the Senate entreated the King of England, that he would be
assistant to the Commonwealth, and to the cause of Italy, by contributing part
of the expense in so great a need to the payment of that Army, which was to
maintain the Liberty of Italy, which he had so often promised to defend. But
the King affirming still that he would make War upon Caesar in Flanders, and
free Italy from any such danger, by diverting his Forces, showed that it was
good for the common service, to lessen the provisions which were destined for
such enterprises; so as the Commonwealth being to be alone at so great
expenses, and the public Treasury being already much exhausted by the so long
War, was forced to have recourse to many extraordinary ways for the raising of
moneys.

Amidst all these preparations for War, the business of Peace was not
notwithstanding quite laid aside; but the Emperor seeming to desire it, had
several Treaties with the King of France, and with the Venetians; sometimes
apart, for particular agreement; and sometimes jointly, for a general peace.

The demands which were made on the King of France his part, and on the
Venetians, were:

That Caesar should set the King of France his Sons at liberty. That he should
free the Pope, and forgo whatsoever he held that belonged unto the Church. That
he should restore Francisco Storza, Duke of Milan, unto his State, and that he
should remove all his forces out of Lombardy, and out of Rome.

Which Caesar neither wholly accepting of, nor yet altogether denying, he sought
by various difficulties to hold on the more certain resolution, chiefly by
demanding a great sum of money of the Venetians; whereby holding the business
on foot, but full of doubts, he desired to take the advantage of time, and to
steer his course according to the event of the affairs of Italy, and according
to the preparations made by his Brother, hoping the mean while to conclude the
particular agreement with the King of France, more to his own advantage; to
whom (as the King acquainted the Venetians afterward) he did at last propound,

The excluding of all the other Colleagues, and the appropriating of the State
of Milan to himself.

Whereby, and by his first resolution in all his Treaties, of having Sforza's
cause decided by Judges, and that in the mean while he should keep the City of
Milan in his own name, and with his Garrisons, it might easily be conceived,
that all his Treaties tended only to this, that the Confederates Armies being
disbanded, he might put himself in safe possession of the State of Milan; so as
all thoughts of Peace being laid aside, War was again denounced by the
Confederates, to Caesar, wherein thinking that it might make much for their
advantage, if they could draw the Duke of Ferara, and the Marquis of Mantua
into the League, and having tried them both, they concluded with the Duke of
Ferara, to receive him into their League, upon condition that he should
maintain two hundred Curassiers at his own charges, in the Colleagues Army, and
that he should contribute ten thousand Ducats monthly, for the space of six
months, toward the payment of the Foot: For which the Confederates were to
take him and his State into their protection.

After which agreement, a large and stately Palace, which did formerly belong
to him in Venice, was restored unto him. But the Treaty was somewhat more
difficult with the Marquis of Mantua; for he desired to be declared Captain
General of the League, in Lautrech's absence: To which the Venetians would not
consent, in respect of the Duke of Urbine. But at last, Girallimo Zane, Podesta
of Verona, being gone to Mantua, in the public name, to treat of this
business, he concluded it without that condition, taking the person, and the
State of the Marquis, into the Confederates protection.

But Caesar seeing he was to make his party good against so many enemies, and
desiring to make his cause appear less dishonest, and by so doing, to sever the
King of England perhaps from the rest of the Confederates, he resolved at last,
to give the Pope his Liberty. To which purpose, he sent sufficient commissions
to the Viceroy, and to Don Hugo di Moncada; who being dead, the Viceroy
concluded the Agreement.

The Pope being to leave, according to former Articles, Ostia, Civita Vecchia,
and Civita Castellana in the Emperor's possession, and paying the same sum of
money, though with some further respite of time: And passing his word, above
all things else, that he would not oppose Caesar in the affairs of Naples, nor
of Milan.

The Colleagues in the beginning of the year one thousand five hundred twenty
eight, prepared to make War with most powerful forces both by Land and Sea, and
chiefly to fall upon the Kingdom of Naples, as the King of France had long
before desired and intended: Wherefore he pressed the Venetians that they would
increase their Galleys to the number of twenty four, according to the first
capitulations. But they said, they had fully made good their promise with the
former sixteen; because, of these there were eight Bastard Galleys, every one
of which went for two Galleys, and that this made very much for the enterprise;
for these might keep and live at Sea in the Winter, and might counterpoise
those kind of Vessels whereof the Imperial Fleet consisted; they excused
themselves likewise by the necessity they were in to keep many men of War at
Sea, to secure the Navigation of their Galleys of Traffic, from so many
Pirates, with whom the Seas were fester'd; and yet, that they might not be
wanting to the prosperous success of the undertaking, they promised the King,
if (as the commanders advised) more men were to be raised, they would
contribute readily to that expense, which was thought to be very useful, nay
requisite; every one believing for certain, that when the Imperial Army should
part from Rome, it would go for Naples. But above all things, it was thought to
be of very great concernment, to draw the Pope into their confederacy, which
they had the better hopes to do, for that he in his giving an account to the
King of France, and to the Venetians; of his agreement made with the Emperor,
did very much excuse himself, as of a thing done out of great necessity,
confessing himself to be very much obliged to the Princes of the League, and
that he had been severely treated with in all things by the Imperialists.

Wherefore the Venetians, after he was out of the Castle, and was come to
Orvietto, sent Commissary Luigi Pisani presently thither, who was in the common
name, to condole with him for his past sufferings: to testify how greatly
displeased they were at it, and how endeavor some and diligent they had been
to procure his Liberty, and how great their joy was to see their desire
effected. That the Commonwealth had willingly employed their forces therein, and
had been at the expense of maintaining so great an Army, at a time, when they
were enforced to keep another Army on foot in Lombardy; nor had they refused to
undergo any whatsoever danger, for the preservation of the dignity of the
Apostolic See, and for the particular convenience and safety of the Popes
person; and that they did still continue in the same readiness, and in a great
desire to revenge the so heinous injuries done unto him, and to the dignity he
represented; and not to suffer, that the Majesty of Popedom, and the
Ecclesiastical State, should for the future be exposed to such danger and
indignity, as they saw by experience might easily happen, when the Imperialists
had Territories, and powerful Forces in Italy: that it became his great wisdom
to foresee, and to provide against so great dangers, and to endeavor by all
means possible to keep himself and his successors from falling into such
eminent evils, and not to suffer, that the time of his Popedom should be
contaminated with the perpetual memory of misery and calamity: That the King of
France, the King of England, the Florentines, and the Duke of Milan, were in
this, of the same opinion with the Venetian Senate: That a great desire might
be seen in them all, not to suffer so great an insolency pass unpunished. That
these wicked ones had provoked the anger of man and God against them: That it
was not to be doubted, but that justice and innocence would at last prevail;
and that he should gloriously be restored to more then his former greatness:
That therefore all the Confederates did desire, and expect with assured hope,
that his Holiness, assisting their pious intention by his authority, would, as
the head thereof confirm their confederacy, and ratify once more the things
wherein he did formerly join with them; for that, That first agreement ought to
be preferred before this last, since the first was made by him as Pope, and
willingly; and that he had consented to the last, being compelled thereunto as
a prisoner desirous of Liberty.

The King of France made the like Intercession, having sent Monsieur de
Longeveille to Rome, to witness unto the Pope his constant will to compel the
Emperor Charles by force of Arms to grant those things, which they had
propounded unto themselves, as the end of their Confederacy. These addresses
were graciously listened unto by the Pope, who returned many thanks unto the
King, and to the Senate, seeming to wish much good to these Princes; but being
notwithstanding very irresolute, and doubtful, or (as he said) considering his
office, and the condition of the times and troubles, he inclined to
neutrallity, and would not so soon commit himself again to the uncertain events
of war: suffering himself peradventure to be prevailed with by Cesar's
speeches, who had written very civilly with his own hand, seeming willing to
adhere to his counsels, and to put the Treaty of Peace into his hand: Or, it
may be more likely, that beginning then to think upon those things, which were
afterward discovered, being overcome with an ardent desire to revenge the
injuries done to himself and the house of Medici, he had forgotten all other
offenses, that he might the better resent those; but he endeavored by various
excuses and delays to conceal it: For, should he have discovered it, he might
have caused such mistrust in Lautrech, as he might likely enough have altered
his resolution of advancing to assault the Kingdom of Naples; which appeared
to be only means of drawing the soldiers out of Rome. But, this his will not
being yet revealed, Lautrech, who expected assistance and favor from him, did
with more fervency pursue the design against Naples. Therefore, after having
tarried long at Bullognia, whither he was come after the agreement made with
the Pope, and the Switzers, Dutch, and Gascone Foot, which he expected to
reinforce his Army, being come unto him; he resolved, though it were in the
midst of winter, to march with all his men toward Naples; not being to be
dissuaded by the many intercedings of the Venetians, who for the security of
their own affairs, for the new stirrings of the Dutch Foot, and for the service
of the Florentines, and Duke of Milan's Confederates, desired, that the Army
might not be carried into parts so far off, as it might not be ready upon any
occasion to assist all the rest: but Lautrech, being constant to his
resolution, went by the way of Remaga, and La Marca, thinking it better for the
convenience of Victuals, and intending to pass by the way of Tronto into the
Kingdom of Naples, whether the Venetian Forces were sent before; being divided
into two parts, the one of which was led on by Valerio Orsino, and Commissary
P^sant, and Camillo Orsino, and Pietro Pesaro followed with the other; and in
their march they took Civitella, Sulmena, and many other Towns, of l' Abruzze,
which yielded of their own good will. There were in the Venetian Army some
Troops of Albanesi Horse, to the number of 500, who were commanded by Andrea
Ciurano, a noble Venetian, who amongst the rest won great praise in all
actions, were very serviceable to our Army, and as much the contrary to our
enemy, and a terror to all the country.

When all the soldiers were assembled, and the whole Army mustered, near the
Town San Termo, it was found to consist of about thirty Thousand Foot, of a
good number of Horse, and of all other things requisite for whatsoever
enterprise. Therefore the Prince of Orange, and the Marquis Guasto, much
troubled at the danger which they saw their affairs were in, in the Kingdom of
Naples, did at last, though not without much ado, draw all their men out of
Rome, which was much furthered by twenty Thousand Ducats which the Pope gave
to the Imperial Commanders, (though under some other pretense) whereby they
were enabled to give some pay to the Dutch Foot, who were more unwilling then
the rest to depart. But the whole Army was not above fourteen Thousand Foot,
their numbers being much lessened by the Plague that was in Rome, and by the
going away of many soldiers loaded with prey. So as the Pope, being partly
free of that oppression (which made him proceed with some more reservedness
toward the Confederates) began to treat more freely with them, and to discover
part of his thoughts. He sent the Archbishop Sepontino to Venice, to demand the
immediate delivery up unto him of the Cities of Cervia, and Ravenna; and the
Bishop of Pistoia to France, to the King (whom he had held in hand till then,
with hopes of renewing the League) to excuse himself for not being able to
satisfy his desire in declaring himself; not being able by reason of his
weakness to think of any thing but Peace; to which purpose he sent the same
Bishop as his Nuntio into Spain, to treat thereof with Caesar, in which message
he mingled some complaints against the Venetians, for having taken, and still
detained some Towns belonging to the Church. The Venetian Senate were very much
troubled at this the Pope's request, not so much for the thing it self, as that
they knew, being made at such a time, and after so importunate a manner, it
showed clearly, that the Pope sought an occasion to alienate himself wholly
from them: for, it stood not with reason, that while all things were in such
disorder, and that many of the Ecclesiastic Towns were yet in the Imperialists
hand, they should rashly quit those Towns. Yet some were so fully resolved, not
to loose the Pope upon any whatsoever conditions, as they maintained, that
howsoever, the Pope was to be gratified; and for the rest, to rely upon his
word; hoping that he would never abandone the Commonwealths Interest. This
business being discussed in the Senate, Dominico Trevisano, a man of great
authority, as well for the dignity of being one of St. Mark's Procurators, as
for his long experience, spoke, as is said, to this effect.

Our proceedings in these last wars have hitherto been such, as, if we do not
go astray, and do not contaminate the sincerity and generosity, which has
accompanied them, they will remain, of perpetual glorious memory to posterity.
For we have wisely, constantly, and religioussy defended, and maintained the
Liberty of Italy, and the Grandezza and reputation of the Church of Rome: not
abandoning our own interests, nor having done any thing in respect thereof,
which was not just and laudable. We are desired by the Pope, to deliver up unto
him the cities of Cervia and Ravenna, whereinto we put our men at such time as
he was in greatest danger and trouble, that the Imperialists might not possess
themselves thereof, to which purpose we put our Garrisons into them, to
preserve them from the common enemy. Whether to give the Pope satisfaction
herein, be just, advantageous for the State, and for our affairs, and suting
with the present condition of the times, or no, may easily be discerned by any
one, who delights not in deceiving himself, and who will measure the present
result with reason, not with passion, I will not enlarge my self now upon the
right, and pretentions we have to these Cities; I believe they be true and
good. But I will say, we must consider things in the condition they are in, not
in that they ought to be: Therefore it will be sufficient to say, that when we
sent our men, and our Commanders into these Cities, they were in the Churches
possession; and they were guarded and defended by us, with an intention of
preserving them, not of possessing them. It will therefore agree very well with
that untainted fidelity, wherewith this Commonwealth has always proceeded, to
restore that which we would take, it is true, thinking it belonged to another,
though it were, or ought to have been ours. But set this respect aside, (though
it be of no small esteem in so religious and so well instituted a Commonwealth
as this of ours) let us consider, I beseech you, whether it be a useful advice
or no; whether it be a resolution well squared out to these times, to detain
these cities now any longer. The war is hotter then ever, and the event thereof
very doubtful: wherein, if (to the misfortune of the Italians) the
Imperialists prevail, who know's not, in how many dangers, and troubles we must
be continually; having many potent enemies at hand, and but few friends.
Therefore all our thoughts, all our endeavors should now aim at our confirming
the forces of the League, by driving the Emperors forces out of Italy, at the
establishing Francisco Sforza in the Dukedom of Milan, at giving a particular
King to the Neapolitans; upon which things the true safety and establishment of
our State on terra ferma does depend, which has been so long floating, and is
still exposed to great danger.

And what is of more moment to attain unto these advantageous ends, then the
Popes favor? what can be more prejudicial then to have him against us? Why do
you think it is, that Caesar does with such earnestness, and such humanity
endeavor his friendship, unless it be that he finds clearly it is his surest
foundation for greatness in Italy? And shall we be aiding and assisting to this
desire of our Enemies, whereas we ought to labor all that we can to break
their designs? And yet it is most certain, that if we add this ill
satisfaction to the inclination which the Pope begins to have to Cesars
proceedings, we shall make him to fall upon some prejudicial Agreement unto the
League, and particularly prejudicial unto our Commonwealth, which is most
concerned therein: When on the contrary, by gratifying the Pope in this his
desire, we may hope, nay rather be assured, to sever him from the Emperor, and
win him to side with us. And say this succeed not, we shall assuredly set^ce
him in that neutrality, wherein he acquainted us he would continue, unless he
were compelled to the contrary by some urgent necessity. We ought to endeavor
that he be thrust upon this necessity by some bad behavior of the
Imperialists, as it may very well fall out he may be; but shun, by all means,
giving him occasion to do so; which will redound to our prejudice. Which we may
assure our selves of, if we will reflect upon the many calamities, whereinto we
were led not many years ago by the like accident, and through the too great
desire of preserving these Cities; the names whereof I wish may not prove
fatal, and as it were, the original of many troubles to our Commonwealth. The
memory hereof is so fresh, and so unfortunate, as such an acquisition ought at
all times to be abhorred by us. Is this the first time that occasion has been
offered us, amidst the so great revolution of the Affairs of Italy, to possess
our selves of these Cities? Have we not been often invited thereunto of late
years by the French? And if we will remember well, we shall find, we have
formerly had both better opportunity and juster occasion to do it; both when
the Pope has had bad success, and in the vacancy of the Popedom; and when he
showed himself to be an Enemy to the State: Yet this very Senate has always
wisely despised such invitations, esteeming the loss certain, and the benefit
of such an acquisition but seeming. And we ought now to continue the rather in
the same opinion, for that this small addition to our State, if we were sure to
keep in free and peaceable possession of these Cities, it does either block up
the way of advancing to greater and more noble acquisitions, or does make it
more difficult; for if we succeed well in the business of Naples, (as we may
hope to do) if the Pope declare himself for the League, or at least appear not
an Enemy to it, we shall recover many Towns in the parts about Puglia, which
belong unto us by articles; which both by the condition of the Country, by the
convenience of Havens, and for the affection of those people toward our
Commonwealth, do in themselves, and in hopes of greater matters, deserve to be
esteemed by us equal with whatsoever other acquisition the Commonwealth can
make. But I beseech you, how do you think the King of France, or the King of
England will interpret our refusal, or prolonging the delivery of Cervia and
Ravenna to the Pope, they being required by him? Does not the King of England
profess that he engages himself in this War, only in regard of the Church and
Pope, as being desirous to preserve the name which he has gotten of being
Defender of the Faith? And the King of France, to whom (as we have lately
understood from our Ambassador) the Pope has intimated that he will enter
into the League if he have these Towns restored, what will he think of us, if
he shall see that we do neglect the so important Interests of the common
Confederacy? and yet it is in the friendship and assistance of these Princes
that we must place our hopes. We shall assuredly be drawn by their entreaty,
and by necessity, to do that which now we shall deny to do; and yet shall we
lose all our thanks for this action from the Pope? from whom we may expect so
many favors, and so much advantage, and lose the praise of having defended the
Dignity, and State of the Church, to which our Commonwealth has always
aspired? And to say nothing of what has been done by our Forefathers, famous
and worthy actions, have not we our selves even now been at very great expense,
and hazarded our men to so many dangers, to free the Pope out of prison, and to
drive the Imperialists out of the Churches Dominions? Who will certainly have a
fair pretense to keep those Towns which are in their hands, when they shall see
the same done by us; since by our example they may cloak their designs with
some excuse and seeming honesty. But since I have heard those that are of a
contrary opinion object more against the unseasonableness of the time, then
against the thing it self; let us confider I beseech you, whether being to do
it, it be not better for us to do it now, then to defer it to another time, and
to another occasion. Really I cannot see what more advantage can be hoped for
from the resignation of those Towns then that which is now propounded, since
the Popes friendship can never make more for our advantage, then at the
present, when it lies in his power either to further or obstruct our good
success in the Kingdom of Naples, according as he shall show himself
favorable, or an Enemy to the League. But if the affairs of War shall prove
amiss, as the worst is always to be feared; (for the end of War does often
differ from the beginning) nay I will say more, let what will happen, if Caesar
and the King of France shall agree, (as we very well know what Caesar has often
said, that though he should lose the Kingdom of Naples entirely, it will be in
his power to rehave it, whilst he has so good a pawn in his hands as the Kings
Sons) What will be our condition, when we shall be abandoned by the King of
France, have the King of Spain our Enemy, the Pope so far from befriending us,
that he will not be well satisfied with us, and perhaps necessitated by
contracts made with other Princes ( as it fell out in the times of Julio and of
Leo) to prosecute, and offend us? The fortune of the Commonwealth is not yet so
well settled after so many storms, as that we ought to lanch forth into the
same Sea, without fear of more dangers. We by the good advice of temporizing
have even in our greatest adversities, not only saved, but recovered our
Commonwealth, and her ancient Dignity, more then we could have done by force of
Arms. We may also hope for more prosperous success in the future, if we walk in
the same way. But howsoever we ought always to endeavor to carry our selves so
in all our actions, as though better fortune may peradventure be wished for to
our Commonwealth, yet it may not be wished that this Senate had been wiser.

These words wrought much upon the Senators, though most of them were formerly
of another opinion. Wherefore Luigi Mocenico, who was one of the chief of the
College, who had advised the Senate to dismiss the Popes Nuntio, with an
express negative, standing up, spoke thus.

If we shall regulate our thoughts and our opinions, according to the various
interpretations that may be given them, and not according to reason, we shall
proceed so diversely, and with such uncertainty in all our affairs, as we shall
make chance the guide of our counsels: But certainly, our actions have been
such, and such our intentions toward the common good, and particularly toward
the Apostolic See, as there is no cause to doubt our faith and sincerity:
Have we seized upon the Cities of Cervia and Ravenna by force, or rest them
from the obedience of the Church, to bring them under our Dominion? Is it not
well known, that being sought unto for help by the Governor of Ravenna, and
knowing what danger that City was in, of falling into the Imperialists hands,
at a time when we had so many other expenses upon our hands, we did resolve
first to assist it with moneys, and then with men? And at last, to the end that
things might be better governed within, and that the inward disorders might not
increase the dangers without, the City it self desiring it by an express
Ambassador, and the Apostolical Legate being therewith content, sent a
magistrate of our own thither, that he might be of more authority, and might
better attend the Cities preservation. The same manner was used at Cervia: If
we shall be blamed for these things, which deserve praise, what is to be said
more, but that innocence cannot be always safe from the malice of men? If any
one shall think, that to avoid calumny, we should hasten the delivery of these
Towns, which would not only be dangerous to us, but prejudicial to the
Apostolic Se^^ certainly such do more value appearances then the real essence
of affairs. The Pope desires that we may presently resign up these Cities: It
is not very hard to know, but very troublesome to consider, with what
intention, and with what justice this request is made: The Imperialists are
masters of the principal strong Holds in the Ecclesiastical State, which they
have forced the Pope to assign over unto them, as a reward for their
persidiousness, and for the ruin of miserable Rome: The Pope being yet out of
his Throne, with very weak forces, experience shows us what respect these
barbarous people bear to his person, and to his affairs: The War is hotter then
ever in Italy, the whole estate of business various, uncertain, subject to
many accidents and alterations; and in so great confusion of all things, only
we shall be a rule unto them, in what redounds to our manifest prejudice. These
considerations may make us believe, that rumors are not spread abroad in vain,
of new practices of agreement held in hand between the Pope and the Emperor;
not to procure peace, but to kindle new Wars, and raise more troubles in Italy.
To find some appearing reasons to do this, the Pope being desirous (not to say
resolved) to forgo the King of France, and us, though he may have known us in
his greatest calamity to have been his truest and most affectionate friends,
and lovers of the dignity of that holy See; propounds new things now, at such a
time, and in such a manner, as he knows cannot be granted, that he may thereby
pick an occasion to effect his desires, which are bent, as may be seen, to
satisfy his own particular affections, and to vindicate the private injuries
which he thinks he has received from the Florentines; and not upon the common
good, not upon the liberty of Italy, not upon the exaltation of the Church: In
which case, our condition will be too hard, who have undergone so much labor,
been at so great expense, and run so many hazards, not having received any good
at all thereby: But to be, as it were, reprehended for it, and by severe
command enforced to forgo that which ought to be ours, and which, if we should
now deliver up, ought either to be acknowledged from our liberality, or with
our rights thereunto preserved; or at least, we ought to be secured, that to
our loss and scorn, it should not be usurped by others, who have no claim at
all thereunto, but think all things lawful, which is possible to be effected by
force: It is most certain, that if the Pope, whom we do not find to be so
careful of our good, as we have been of his safety, shall now receive these
Cities from us, before we come to a good and firm universal peace; laying aside
any thought of our Interests, and measuring things only according to his own
particular ends, he will, when we shall hereafter come to lay down Arms, make
all Articles of Agreement, either the harder, or the more disadvantagious for
us. I might with justice and honesty propound, but much more according to the
reason of State, that we, who have been in peaceable and lawful possession of
these Cities, for the space of a hundred years, and who have new built one of
them at our own expense, should make use of the Popes troubles, as others have
done, and in our own right, rather then by doing injury to any other, retain
what is become, and what ought to be ours, with an intention of never restoring
it: and this so much the rather, for that we possessed these Cities when the
Pope was parted from the League; whereby we have new pretenses added to our old
ones: and for that (as it is very true) Pope Adrian, this man's predecessor, a
man of pious and upright intentions, did promise to restore the possession of
these Cities to us, knowing that they did of right belong unto our
Commonwealth, which came thereby not by fraud, nor by taking them from the
Church, but by just right, and by the disposal of those who were Lords thereof.

Moreover, it may be said, that this very Pope's example may seem to invite us
to esteem all things as null, which were agreed upon with Julio the second, in
times of our greatest necessity: since he denies that to be of any validity,
which was formerly agreed upon by the College of Cardinals, and by his
consent, with the Duke of Ferrara, concerning the Cities of Modena and Regio;
saying, That he is not bound to make that good now, when he may use his free
Will, which he then confirmed, being forced by necessity. But I am far from
councelling, or from going about to persuade this Senate, to do any thing,
which may even in the least appearance, seem to differ from its ancient, and
laudable Custom and Institution, of proceeding with great sincerity, faith, and
religion: I say only, that in a business of such importance, we ought to
proceed with much temper, and with mature advice; for otherwise, goodness will
become folly. Are these Cities to be restored unto the Church? Let it be done;
but at such a time, and in such a manner, as we may have some better security,
that our pious intentions toward the Apostolic See may have its true effect,
and that others may not hope to usurp it; so as we may not increase their
strength, who will use it against us, and so as we may enjoy our State with
such quietness, as is by us desired, and whereof we never were the first
disturbers. Now as the Popes authority and means may be of chiefest importance
above all other things, to bring these things to pass, so can there be no
greater spur to make him use his power therein, and to make him take an
opportunity to do it, then his desire to re-have these Cities; the assignation
whereof, will be a means whereeby our Commonwealth may come to universal Pea^e,
upon fairer, and more advantageous conditions.

Neither do I much consider the reason which is urged to prove that this is the
true means of arriving thereat, to wit, by gratifying the Pope, to draw him to
be on our side: to which purpose, I pray you let us weigh a little better, not
what we would have, but what reason tells us we may look for. If the service
which in all these hard times we have hitherto done the Pope, has not been
able to impress one thought of our affairs in him, which we see he is rather
ready to prejudice, then to secure; what hopes is there, that that which he
thinks it is our duty to do, should work more upon him? And if his desire of
Revenge, and of restoring his Family to their ancient Greatness in their
Country, be so prevalent with him, as it has made him forget the grievous and
abominable injury which he has received from the Imperialists, how can you
think that any reason can do good upon him? Moreover, Say it be true, that (as
it has been said) we are now to put a greater valuation upon the Pope's
friendship, because he may favor the League, at this present, in the affairs
of Naples; truly I do not see what assistance he can give to this enterprise,
he having neither money nor men, and the enterprise requiring present
assistance: But on the contrary, things appear to me to be so fairly begun, and
that there is such fair hopes of better success, as any Treaty we shall make
with the Pope, or Emperor, will be for our advantage by the prolonging of
time: and it may be, time will make the Pope himself see his error, as we may
verily believe it will be acknowledged by the Kings of France and England, so
as his endeavors will be of no validity with them, when they shall see that
they have been with reason refused by us.

The Senators minds were much affected with what these two had said, some
inclining to the one, some unto the other; but at last, they resolved to return
this answer to the Pope.

That the Senate had always been desirous of such a peace, as might be good for
the common service and safety, and for the exaltation of the Church, and that
therefore they would willingly listen unto any conditions of agreement: but
withal, they must look to the accommodation of other difficulties; wherefore
they would send an express Ambassador, who might treat of the business
propounded by the Archbishop Sipontino, and of all things else, whereby they
might witness their good will, and Gaspero Contarini was forthwith chosen for
this Embassy.

But the Pope being no ways satisfied with this answer, persisted more
earnestly in the same demand, and Count Guido Rangone, and Cavalier Cassale
being sent to him by Lautrech, to appease him, they could not only not do any
good upon him, but he made them be told in plainer terms then formerly, that if
those Towns were not restored unto him, he would not only not declare for the
League (as he was daily desired to do) but he must be forced to join with the
Imperialists: and he made almost the same thing be said by his Nuntio to the
King: but clearer evidences did afterward appear of this his inclination; for
he had sent an express Nuntio into Spain, to treat with Caesar, though he said,
he had given him commission to treat only of agreement, and of universal peace;
which if Caesar should be averse unto, he should denounce war against him, as
the other Confederates had done

But whilst these things were in hand, the Cesarean Army was already come to
the confines of the Kingdom of Naples, and the Commanders, with some difference
of opinion, treated how they were to manage the War: Some were of opinion, of
which Marquis Guasto was the forwardest.

That they ought to march to where Lautrech was with the French Army, and to
use all means to come to a day of Battle with him; and many things made for
this, as, that the Confederates forces were as yet divided, the number of their
foot was more then those that were with Lautrech; the risings which were every
day made by those of the kingdom in favor of the French, the scarcity of
moneys in the Cesarean Army, and the tumults which by reason thereof were begun
to be made by the Dutch foot; through which things, it being to be feared that
the loss of the Kingdom would certainly ensue, it seemed good advice to hazard
the fortune of a Battle, wherein there was as much hope as danger: and if they
should beat the French Army, the Towns which they had taken, would soon become
theirs, and the Kingdom of Naples would be in a very sure condition.

But others maintained to the contrary, it would be more safely, and more
wisely done, to quarter themselves somwhere, whereby the strength of situation,
and by the convenience of victuals, they might not easily be driven out by the
Enemy; and staying there, they might observe the Enemies ways, and govern
themselves accordingly; and that if the Army of the League should prosper, they
might march with all their forces to the defense of the City of Naples; upon
the preservation or loss whereof, the event of the whole War did depend. That
it was said that the Prince of Melfie, and Fabritio Maramoldo, were coming with
many soldiers, and with many of the Country to meet them, and to receive them,
when they should be come nearer Naples; by whose numbers, their Armies being
increased, they might doubtlesly stand the Enemy, and hinder their Designs.
That it was the Duty of an Army, which did defend a Country assaulted by
powerful forces, to spin out time, for time brings often great and unlooked for
advantages. That it was to be believed, the Enemies Army wanted not for
disorders, which were likely to be the greater, for that the Interests of the
Confederate Princes were different, and often times contrary. That nothing was
less governed by wisdom, and good counsel, then the event of Battles. That
nothing could be done more worthy the fame and experience of so many gallant
Commanders as were in that Army, then to hold the enemy in hand by several
pieces of cunning, and endeavor to make them moulder away by time and
sufferings, which might easily happen in the French Army, as had been proved by
many late examples. Nor was it to be doubted, but that the Neapolitans would
furnish the Camp with so much moneys as would suffice to satisfy the Dutch
Foot, till such time as the pay was come, which was already on the way from
Spain, whereby the whole Army might be kept together for a goodwhile, and hope
to do better things.

These reasons having the approbation of Alarsone, who was very stiff in that
opinion, prevailed. It was therefore resolved to advance, but slowly and
securely, and to enter into the Terra di Lav^ro, that they might be near the
City of Naples. But the Army being encamped at Troja, and staying there to make
provision of victuals, and to learn news of the Enemy, Lautrech (as the French
are generally more bold and resolute) resolved upon what the Enemy refused to
do; which was, to find them out, and to fight them; being thereunto chiefly
moved, as he said afterward, for fear lest the Army which was paid from
France, might suddenly dissolve, and lose what had been already won, because
the King did already appear plainly to be weary of so vast expenses, and that
his Officers, being variously affected, were negligent in taking care for
provisions. He was likewise persuaded thereunto, out of great hope of victory;
The Marquis of Saluzzo being already joined with him, and expecting daily,
choice of Foot from the Venetians and Florentines.

On the contrary, the Imperialists, though their numbers were not much
inferior, yet their prowess was much diminished; partly through great
sickness, partly through the luxury which they for so many months had lived
in; whereby their bodies and their minds being weakened, and grown effeminate,
they had almost lost their Gallantry. Moreover being used to live licentiously,
they did not observe Military order and discipline, as they ought to have done.
Lautrech did like wise much exceed the Enemy in Horse, and train of Artillery,
so as it seemed he did not without reason hope, to shorten and secure the
victory, and the acquisition of that whole State, by a day of Battle. The
Emperors Army hearing of Lautrech's approach, were gone out of Troja, and had
quartered themselves upon the leaning of a Hill, not far off; whereunto
Lautrech being already come very nigh, although the Florentine nor Venetian
foot were not come to him, he resolved to put his Army in Battle array, and to
face the Enemy; defying him, and provoking him, by many Cannon sho^, which he
made against their Camp. But the Imperialists being but little indamaged
thereby, by reason of the height of their situation, resolved not to join
Battle, but keeping within their quarters, sent out only some Horse and
Harquebusiers, to skirmish with the French; who still advancing, and winning
ground, got into a situation equal with the Enemy, from whence they might
prejudice their Camp with their Artillery. But those who went out afterward to
skirmish in much greater numbers, not being able to keep Lautrech from winning
the Hill, the Enemy resolved to retreat, and to quarter on the other side of
Troja, towars Nocera. But understanding not long after, that Horatio Baglione
was come to the Leagues Camp, with a great many Florentines, all of them expert
Soldiers; and that Camillo Orsino, and Commissary Pisano, were expected the
next day with the Venetian forces, they quitted l' Abruzzo, and marched
straight forwards toward Naples, following their first advice, and pl^cing the
total end of the business, and their hopes of maintaining that State, in the
defense of that City: and retayning only the Spanish and Dutch foot, about
10000 in number, they applied themselves diligently to providing the City with
victuals. Lautrech finding that he could not draw the Enemy to Battle, which
they had so manifestly refused, went about to make himself Master of the
Country, and not to leave any Town untaken behind him which was the Enemies,
till he should come, before the walls of Naples. Wherefore understanding that
the Prince was entered into Melsi, with a very strong Garrison of Soldiers, he
sent Pietro Navarro with the Gascoigne foot, and Baglione with the Soldiers of
the black Band, to take it; by whom the Town was played upon, taken, and
sacked: and at the same time, Commissary P^sani, with two thousand Italian
foot, took the Town of Ascoli, and then joined suddenly again with Lautrech, to
whom Barleti, Trani, and other adjoining Towns, did quickly yield; some being
moved by what had befallen Melsi; others, by the love they bore to the French,
and by their being weary of the Spanish Government; so as in all Puglia, only
the Town of Manfredonia held for the Spaniards. Wherefore Lautrech leaving 2000
Venetian foot, one hundred Curassiers, and two hundred light Horse to besiege
that City, and to keep those others which he had taken, marched with all the
rest of the Army toward Naples: all Towns coming in apace unto him by which he
past. At last, resolving to besiege it, as thinking it the safest, and most
successful way, whereby to get the City, he encamped himself within near about
a mile of the Walls, having taken up his Headquarters, together with the
greatest strength of his men, at Poggio Reale, in a strong situation, and
proper to keep the besieged from many conveniences.

At the same time, the Venetian Fleet being reinforced at Corfu, and put in
order, after the prejudice they had undergone at Sardignia, was come into the
Rivers of Puglia, consisting of sixteen Galleys, under the command of
Commissary Moro; for General Lando was gone to the Island of Candia, to appease
some commotions which were raised in the Territories of Canea, by the country
people. Six Towns in Puglia belonged to the Venetians by the agreement of the
League, which they had formerly been possessed of, to wit, Ottranto, Brandizzo,
Monopoli, Pulignan, Mola, and Trani: Therefore the Venetians were more diligent
in pursuing this enterprise, having to boot with their Galleys, diverse other
armed Vessels, of sundry sorts; and their hopes of good success were much
increased, to boot with the forces and reputation of the League, by the love
which those people bore to the Commonwealth; so as upon the Fleets arrival,
Monopoli and Trani yielded presently to them, and a good inclination was found
in the rest to do the like. Manfredonia had somewhat a better Garrison in her,
and the Citizens were not so well affected to the State; wherefore Almoro
Moresini, Captain of the Gulf, went with some of the Galleys to the reducing
thereof, whither Camillo Orsino was also gone with some land forces: Whilst
they were encamped about the walls, Ranu^io Farnese sallyed out with two
hundred Horse, and Girollimo Cremona with two hundred foot, against which
Andrea Ciurano advanced boldly with his Stradiotte Horse, and after many hours
skirmish, put them to flight, and drove them into the Town, killing some, and
taking other some prisoners, in which action Ciurano won much praise, and made
good the opinion which was conceived of his valor and skill, by reason of
other egregious deeds; and chiefly, by his having chased George Reins, a
personage of great renown, near Taranto; and by having taken the Governor of
the Town: but this his glory soon ended, for falling grievously sick by reason
of his much pains taken in the Militia, he died, being much beloved by the
Soldiers, and valued by the Commanders, for his liberality, carriage, and
military discipline.

Commissary Moro was before Brandizzo, who played upon the Castle, which was
yet held by the Imperialists with a good Garrison, though the Town was already
surrendered; this battery was recommended to the particular care of Bernardo
Segredo, a young man of much ingenuity and courage, who had brought it to such
a condition, as men being already landed to give the assault, it was thought
the enemy could not hold out long. But Lautrech, whose orders the Venetian
commanders had commission from the Senate to observe, sending for the Galleys
to Naples, made him quit the enterprise, and give over the hoped for victory.
Phillippino Doria was already come to Naples with eight Galleys; but these not
being sufficient to keep the City from being victuall'd by Sea, and it being
likewise thought that they could not be safe there, if the enemy should send
forth their armed Vessels which were in the Haven, Lautrech had continually
solicited the Venetian Commanders, to come as soon as they could, and join with
Doria's Galleys, to secure them, and to straiten the siege yet more.

Such were the proceedings in the Kingdom of Naples; but the Venetians were
busied with other affairs of no less importance: for Henry Duke of Brunswick,
after many rumors of his coming, being very much solicited by Charles and
Ferdinand, to pass into Italy, and to enter Lombardy, to divert the forces of
the League from the enterprise of Naples; which Kingdom being in great danger,
he saw he could not succor by any way better; passing from Trent into
Valledragi, was entered into the Territories of Verona, and had brought with him
about twelve thousand foot, with whom it was said, that Antonio da Leva was to
join, who was already come into the field with eight thousand foot, that they
might jointly fall upon the Town in the State of Venice, which Brunswick had
denounced war against, having with much vanity, and very ridiculously,
challenged the Duke thereof, Andrea Gritti, a man of fourscore years of age, to
fight a single Duel with him: But the Senate was not wanting in diligence, to
arm themselves; they designed to raise an Army of twelve thousand foot, of
which, four thousand to be Switzers, to which purpose they sent moneys into
Switzerland, and desired the King of France to further this their Levy by his
authority: They likewise brought great store of light Horse from Greece, and
from Dalmatia, and recalled the Duke of Urbine from Marc d' Ancona: And to the
end that their own State might not be bereft of defense, whilst they went to
defend the States of others, they commanded him to view all their Cities and
Forts of greatest importance, to put good garrisons into them, and to do
whatsoever else he should judge might make most for their safety: then they
chose diverse select Gentlemen, whom they entrusted with the particular charge
of the chief Cities: Girollimo Diedo was sent with one hundred and fifty foot
to Treviso. Pietro Sagredo with as many to Padua. Zaccheria Orio, Phillippo
Correro, Allessandro Donato, Ambr^gio Contarini, Ioseppe Badoero, Lorenzo
Lanudo, Agostino Canale, and Almoro Barbaro, were sent to Verona with 25
soldiers apiece, wherewith they were to guard the gates, and places of
greatest importance.

These preparations were judged worthy consideration in France; wherefore they
likewise prepared to send powerful Forces into Italy, which were to be
commanded by Monsi ur de St. Paul, one of the house of Burbone, a personage
highly esteemed for his birth, and other honorable endowments, but not much
experienced in war: and as it proved afterward, not very fortunate in this
enterprise. But these provisions proved too late for the present occasion; for
the Duke of Brunswick, finding himself strong enough, designed to fall upon
some of the Commonwealths Cities, being the more encouraged so to do, because,
at his first arrival, Peschiera, Rivoltella, and some other Towns neighboring
upon the Lake of Garda, yielded unto him. But the Duke of Urbine who was at
Verona, diligently observing Brunswicks marches, prevented his designs, and
went presently to Brescia, where he augmented the Garrison; and from thence to
Bergamo, putting many of the Inhabitants of those valleys, who were very
faithful to the Venetian interest, into the City; and begirting the city with
trenches and outworks, put it in a posture of defense. Moreover, he cunningly
made the men of those parts propound treaties of agreement, and giving of
moneys; wherein they spun out time, to the end, that by retarding Brunswick's
march, more opportunity might be had to secure the principal places: wherein
there being good store of Light Horse, they infested the Dutch Camp by sallying
out, and disturbed their Victuals: And amongst these, Geralamo da Canale did
very good service, with five hundred Crabats, which he had brought with him out
of Dalmatia. So as Brunswick, falling short of his hoped for success, and being
incommodated for victuals, after having according to the barbarous and cruel
custom of that Nation, ruined the Country; and burnt many noble edifices, went
out of the Venetian Confines, and came into the State of Milan, where he was
met by Antonio da Leva, who hearing of his arrival, was past over the Ada, to
join with him in some enterprise. Wherefore both of them repassing over the
Ada, they went to encamp before Lodi, from whence the Duke of Milan was gone a
little before, being advertised of the enemies approach, by Gabrielle Veniero,
the Venetian Ambassador; and leaving a good number of men in that city, he
came, by the Venetians advice to Brescia. But the Venetian soldiers, who were
in Lodi, and who were commanded by Paolo Sforza, the Dukes bastard brother,
having valliantly withstood many assaults, repulsed the enemy. Wherefore
Brunswick, not having much money to maintain the Army longer, finding that he
had spent much time in vain, began to be aware of his idle thoughts, whereunto
he had, out of vain glory, and hopes of Booty, been persuaded by Ferdinando d'
Austria; who minding more his brother's advantage, then the success of the
business, had earnestly persuaded him to pass into Italy, and without thinking
of advancing further, to enter into the Kingdom of Naples, as he had at first
purposed to do; he went by the way of the Lake of Como, to return to Germany,
being pursued by il Conte di Giazzo, and by Mercurio Bua: who issuing out of
Bergamo, fell upon his Rear, but did not much prejudice the enemy, because they
were too late aware of their departure. Yet many of the Dutch, who in great
numbers parted from the Camp, were ransak'd and cut in pieces by the country
people. The besieged in Naples were much troubled to hear of the dissolution of
the Dutch Foot; being thereby bereaved of the only relief wherein their safety
lay. For but a little before they had with bad success attempted to beat the
Galleys of Philippo Doria, that they might have the way open by Sea, since they
could come by no victuals by land; Lautrech having possessed himself of
Pazzuolo, and of the neighboring places.

The Imperial Commanders were likewise herewith much molested; for,
understanding that the Venetian Fleet was suddenly to come into those Seas,
they knew their danger would be the greater, and their remedy harder. Therefore
being resolved to prevent the Enemy, they determined to put out from the Haven
with 6 Galleys, and many other armed Vessels, and to assault Doria's Galleys;
and were so assured of Victory (as they thought) as the Marquis Guasto, Don
Hugo and other chief Commanders, went aboard those Galleys, as to an assured
Triumph: And having joyfully dined at the Island of Capri, they went to assault
Doria, who lay with his Galleys upon the coast of Amalsi, near Capo d' Orto:
being persuaded that the Genueses being terrified with this spectacle, and with
the unexpected assault, would either run away, or, that if they would join
battle with them, though upon disadvantage; that through the Valor of the
Spanish Soldiers, which were the very best, picked out of the whole Army, they
should obtain certain and glorious victory. But the business fell out much
otherwise; for, neither was Doria affrighted at the sight of the enemy, he
being a man very well experienced in Maritime affairs; nor came the assault
unexpected; he having been so timely advertised thereof, as that he had
opportunity to prepare for it, and to reinforce his Fleet with soldiers which
were sent unto him from the Camp by Lautrech: So as, resolving to wait the
Imperialists coming, and not to refuse battle, when he first saw the enemy
appear, he divided his forces, and with 4 Galley's made boldly toward them,
causing the other two, which were commanded by Lomelino, to fall off at the
same time to seaward, as if they fled away; but with orders to tack about, and
assault the Imperialists on the Flanck and Poupe, whilst they were busied in
the fight. Which counsel being wisely taken, and well pursued by the Captain
and his Genueses, who were very well verss'd in all things which belonged to
Sea, had such good success, as two of the enemies Galleys fell into Doria's
hands, two were sunck, and the other two being shrewdly shattered, saved
themselves with much ado by flight, the Marquis of Guasto, Asconio Colonna,
and other Commanders were taken prisoners; Don Hugo, Cesare Feramosca, and most
of the soldiers which were in the Galleys were slain; whereby the City of
Naples was deprived of her best and valiantest defendants.

General Lando came this mean while to the shores of Naples with 20 Galleys,
who being likewise come for the business of Puglia, and having tarried in the
Gulf of Massa, had already taken all the Towns appertaining to the Venetians,
as Trani, Mola, Puglignan, Monopli, Otranto, and Brandizzo; the Castles of
Brandizzo remaining only in the Imperialists power; Commissary Augustino da
Mula being left to guard them.

The arrival of the Venetian General was of great advantage to the French, and
as prejudicial to the Enemy; for leaving six Galleys at Gaetta, and as many at
Cume, he scowred the Rivers neighboring upon Naples, with the rest, from
Capanella to Massa, blocking up the Sea so, as he suffered not any vessel to
enter with victuals to the Besieged. The Venetian Galleys did likewise possess
themselves of some places where the Mills were, which grownd corn for the City,
so as the corn which they had yet lest, could not be made into bread, but being
delivered out unto the Soldiers ungrownd, was either eaten by them in po^tage,
or baked in pans.

On the other side, the Venetian Fleet was of great advantage to their friends;
for it furnished their Camp with victuals from Sea, whereof, by reason of the
great number of useless people who flock to the Camp (for the dearth that was
that year generally throughout all Italy) and by the carelessness of the
Commanders, there was great scarcity in the Camp. And Monsieur ae Barbasi, who
brought moneys from France with him to pay the Soldiers, meeting with great
impediments by the Imperialists, who had blocked all the ways, so as that he
was fain to take a great circuit about, was met by diverse of the Venetian
Generals men, whom he on purpose had landed, to assist Barbasi, against Don
Ferrante Gonsagae, who was come with both Horse and Foot out of Naples to
intercept the supply of moneys; and by their means, together with some others
that were sent from the Camp, both Venetians and Florentines, led on by Valerio
Ursino, and Hugo ^e Pepoli, he repulsed the Enemy; but Hugo being too forward
in pursuit of them, was taken Prisoner.

Thus far the affairs of the League went on prosperously, and with great hopes
of putting a speedy end to the War, by the acquisition of the whole Kingdom of
Naples; but now apparent signs grew, not only of their declination, but even of
their ruin: As it fortune could not long favor the French in Italy, to whom
she had so long showed her self therein an Enemy. Their Army fell into sore and
sudden sicknesses, whereunto many causes did concur. As the influence of the
Heavens, which had this year occasioned many pestiferous diseases in all pats;
the season of the year, which being in the month of August, was made the
worse, by the disorders committed by the Soldiers, in eating great store of
fruit. But especially the badness of the air, which was become unwholesom, by
reason of the waters, which being diverted for several months from their
ordinary course, did overflow almost all parts about their Quarters. Which put
Lautrech into great straits, finding inconveniences on all sides, and great
doubts and difficulties* in either continuing the Siege, (the commenced
inconveniences considered) or in enlarging his Camp. He was advised by almost
all his Captains, to carry the Soldiers into the neighboring Towns, and by
dividing them, to keep the mallady from spreading farther, and that the sick
might have the better means aff^rded them of cure. And truly the Army was
brought into such a condition, as necessity seemed to force him to such a
resolution; the rather, for that the Sea being still blocked up, he might
sufficiently incommodate the Enemy, though he enlarged his quarters. But on the
other side, Lautrech was greatly grieved to see a Victory escape his hands,
which was almost won: For if he should enlarge his quarters, he knew, that the
Imperialists, who did abound in Horse, would by their coming abroad, find some
ways open, to provide against their Incoveniencies. He understood by Simione
Romano, whom he had sent into Calavria, that all things succeeded well there,
that all those people did surrender, out of their particular affection to the
name of France; that the Towns, and Havens in Puglia were fallen into the
Venetians hands: that the Abruzzo was at very first reduced by the French: that
the Spaniards were already driven out of almost the whole Kingdom: And yet all
these acquisitions must prove to no purpose, if, by allowing those who were in
Naples (and who were already reduced to great straits) the benefit of time, he
should lose the opportunity of getting that City, upon which, the good or bad
success of the whole enterprise did depend. He was also ashamed, that the
Spaniards, suffering under great inconveniences, sickness, and scarcity,
should notwithstanding bear all this with such constancy, as that they would
not listen to any Propositions of surrender; and yet, he and his French, must,
through weakness of Spirit, yield to the very first frowns of adverse fortune;
and suffer themselves to be, as it were, overcome by those that were overcome.
Moreover, moneys which came to him from France, falling far short of
expectation, and being not sufficient to pay the Soldiers, he feared, that if
the business should be spun out at length, he should not be able to maintain
the Army. But Lautrech's nature was more prevalent with him, then all other
reasons; he not being accustomed willingly to listen to, or to value the
opinion of others, or to forgo that advice which he had once thought to be
well taken: So as, though he had every day reason to alter his mind, and to
accommodate himself unto the times: yet would he never give way to remove his
quarters, nor to give leave to any one to be gone, till extreme necessity
infor'd him to do that which reason should have persuaded him unto. For, many
dying daily, not only of the private soldiers, but of the most principal
personages, as Luigi Pisano, and Pietro Pesaro, both of them Venetian
Commissaries, and not long after, Valdemonte; many others who fell daily sick,
were carried to Gaetta, and to other neighboring places; and others without
leave abandoned the Camp.

But Lautrech was yet more molested at another accident, which broke all his
hopes of good success: Andrea Doria not being satisfied with the French, left
the Kings service, and took pay of Caesar. Many things had happened, which had
alienated Doria from the French: but especially, a disdain which he conceived
for not being esteemed, or rewarded, as he thought, according to his deserts,
he not having obtained the place of being Admiral at Sea, which honor was at
this time conferred upon Monsieur de Barbesi; nor been able to procure, that
his Country Genua should have the superiority over Savona, as she had formerly
had; many signs having already appeared of this his ill satisfaction, the Pope
had begun formerly to suspect Doria, and had signified as much into France,
exhorting, that he might be kept better affected to the League, and not to
suffer him to bethink himself of passing over to the Enemy, with so many
Maritime forces; to the great prejudice of the common Affairs.

But the King, being at this time jealous of all the Popes proceedings, his
advices were of less authority with him. Yet, the King finding this at last to
be true, and thinking it a business worth consideration, and not knowing how to
remedy it, or being peradventure desirous to free himself of this expense,
without being thereby disadvantaged, he earnestly entreated the Pope that he
would take Doria into his pay, whom he found inclined to serve the Church, and
not to suffer Cesar's forces to be so much increased by the addition of his
Galleys. The Pope seemed to have the same desire, but being loath to do any
thing which might displease the Emperor, excused himself, as not being able to
do it; adding, that when he should by the Kings means have recovered Ravenna
and Cervia, he might more freely lay some tax upon the Ecclesiastical estate,
and apply it hereunto. Wherefore Doria agreed with Caesar, to serve him with 12
Gallyes, and to receive for his sallary sixty thousand Ducke^s a year.

This alienation of Doria's, was very prejudicial to the Colleagues, and to the
business of Naples; for the Venetian Galleys being now left alone, were forced
to quit the works about the Trenches, which their Slaves wrought upon, and to
fall to guard the Seas; and Admiral Barbesi, being come with 16 Galleys from
France, not daring to go to Naples, stayed loytering at Savona, having landed
many of the foot which were destined to relieve Lautrech, that they might guard
Genua; so as things more grievous, and more prejudicial arising every day from
this accident; the League went daily less in reputation, and those of the
Kingdom who favored the French, were as much discouraged, as they were before
inheartned, and put in hopes by Brunswick's rout. Yet to make good the
enterprise of Naples, as much as might be, there were some Barons, who depended
upon the French party, as the Duke of Gravina, the Duke of Castro, the Prince
of Melsi, (whose ransom not being paid by the Imperialists, had made him turn
over to the French) and some other principal personages,, who raised some
number of Foot to assist Lautrech, and to maintain the reputation of the
League, and of the French in the Kingdom.

But Lautrech could not make any speedy use, answerable to the present
occasion, of the men that were with Renzo in Civita Vecchia, by reason of the
Pope's dubious counsels, who being pressed first by Lautrech in high terms,
and little less then threats, to declare himself for the King, and afterward
in a more submissive manner, and and with promise to re invest his family in
their Country, could not notwithstanding, be brought to any settled resolution,
seeming in words to be zealous of the common good, and that he had no other
object then peace; the which that he might mediate with better success, and
more fidelity* he would not forego his neutrality. But there appeared many
signs to the contrary, that he had a good inclination to make his friendship
with Caesar, upon particular Articles: Yet being unwilling to make Lautrech more
his Enemy, before all things were concluded; he said, that his declaring was
not of any great importance, since (as he had often said) he had not sufficient
Forces to join in any enterprise; but that without renewing any further
confed'racy, the King of France might assure himself of all safety from the
Churches Territories; and not to be any ways incommodated thereby. Through
these resons, the forces of the French army grew daily weaker, and disorders
did increase more and more. And on the other side, the besiegeds hopes did
better, in beleiving to be able to maintain the Siege, and to bring all things
to a good end.

The forces so often demanded by Lautrech, and as often promised by the King,
came not as yet from France; and the people which were mustered in the Country,
were not sufficient to recruit the Army, nor to supply the needs of all
military actions: there was great want of all things in the camp; for the
Enemies Horse issuing forth often, to disturb their victuals, which was
brought them from adjacent places, had made them of Besiegers, become besieged;
and by cutting off certain Aqueducts, had deprived them of their best water.
The inconveniences were so increased, as there was not any one company in the
Camp which was not sorely infected; the Soldiers grown weak and weary, could
not wield their Arms, but throwing them away, neglected all Military exercise,
kept no order nor discipline, and grew full of despair. Insomuch as many
Soldiers, and especially the Curassiers, abandoned the Camp without their
Captains leave; the Captains were some of them far off, being gone into other
parts to be cured; some kept useless in the Camp, being seized upon by grievous
sickness.

Amongst the rest, Lautrech himself fell sick, being not less afflicted in mind
then in body, by reason of the great danger whereinto he saw his Army reduced;
which was feared by all others, before it happened, and despised by him alone. So
his own default aggravating his displeasure of mind, did the more oppress him;
he could not for many days, either act, or advise any thing; and the other
Captains, by reason of the severity of his nature and government, proceeded
slowly, and with much caution in all things. So as though he, after being a
little recovered, and having gotten some strength, was very diligent in
correcting these disorders; severely punishing the Soldiers disobedience, and
in increasing his Forces, causing some companies of the Venetian Stradiotti to
come unto the Camp, which he recalled from the Enterprise of Taranto, and
soliciting the Florentines to send him two thousand Foot, which they had
mustered for the service of the League, yet all remedy proved in vain, and too
late. But those within the Town grew so bold, as sallying forth daily in great
numbers, they came up even to the French Rampires, taking away their baggage
and their free-bootings before their eyes, and greatly molesting the ways, and
infesting the Country, hindered the commerce between the Venetian Fleet and the
Camp. But soon after Lautrech relapsing into his disease by reason of his great
labor, and agitation of mind, dyed.

The Marquis of Saluzzo, in whom, after Lautrech's death, the supreme authority
of the Army remained, resolved, with the approbation of the other Commanders,
to raise the Camp: The present state of affairs not only requiring it, but even
necessity and danger; which was much increased by the loss of Capua, lately
fallen into the power of the Imperialists, by reason of the Capuans falsehood,
who were inclined to adhere to Caesar: Whereby the French Army was not only
deprived of many conveniences, but even of the opportunity of retreating. They
divided their men into three Squardrons, and on the nine and twentieth of
August, early in the morning, they marched away to Auversa, with all possible
silence, that they might not be pursued by the Imperialists, if they should be
aware of their departure. Which they could not notwithstanding do; for the
Enemies Horse being continually even upon their Trenches, and aware of their
departure, fell upon them in their Rear, guided by Monsieur de la Palissa, and
by Camillo Trivulcio, routed them, and slew many of them; and the Spanish Foot
coming in speedily soon after, broke their Battaglia, which was commanded by
Navarro; took many Prisoners, amongst which the Captain himself. But the
Marquis of Saluzzo, and Count Guido Rangone, who were first marched forth of
their Quarters with the Van, escaped the danger for the present, and got safe
into Auversa; but being presently pursued by the Enemy, and the City brought to
great danger, they were quickly forced to yield, upon discretion. Thus a great
and flourishing Army of the French was miserably wasted and destroyed, and of
Conquerours, became conquered; and the whole face of affairs was altered, to
the great discontent of the Venetians: Whose fortune, at least as much as
concerned the Kingdom of Naples, depended upon their Friends, and Confederates,
the French. Another sad accident followed this, which was very prejudicial to
the League, and was of great concernment for the weakening of the French in
Italy: For the Plague being got into Genua, and the City therefore abandoned
almost by all the Citizens, and Soldiers, Andrea Doria came unexpectedly
thither with his Galleys; and with the few Foot which he had, not exceeding
five hundred, and by the favor of the people, who loved the name of Liberty,
which Doria promised to introduce, he changed the Government, framed new
Orders, and reduced it under Cesars protection. Which novelty Trivulcio was not
able to obviate, having but a small Garrison of Soldiers, with whom he had
much ado to get safe into the Castle; hoping, as he said, if he should receive
sudden succor, to return the City unto its former condition, and to the Kings
devotion. Wherefore the Confederates Commanders, resolved to send suddenly
three thousand Dutch and Switzer Foot thither, who were to come quickly to
Alexandria, to join with other French, who came for Italy.

Whilst these things went thus, the thoughts and provisions for renewing War in
Lombardy ceased not: To the which Monsieur de S. Paul being destined (as has
been said) the Venetian Senate desirous, that Antonio da Leva might have no
longer time nor opportunity to make any farther progress, had sent Andrea Rosso
Ambassador to France, to hasten the coming of the Commander, and of the Army:
And being very diligent in all things else, they had sent pay to Iurea for five
thousand Landsknechts, who were taken into pay by the King for that Enterprise,
at the common expense. The Sena^e had likewise given Order to the Duke of
Urbine, to receive the Dutch Foot into their pay, who were disbanded from
Brunswicks Army; whereof there came a great many; so as the Commonwealth having
in her service in Lombardy, of several Nations, Dutch, Switzers, and Italians,
above ten thousand Foot, fifteen hundred light Horse, and eight hundred
Curassiers, with which forces, it was hohoped, that when Monsieur de S. Paul
should be come from France with those warlike preparations which had been
spoken of, they might be able to drive Antonio da Leva out of Lombardy: The
Duke of Urbine's opinion was, that of all other things, they were to put an
excellent Garrison into Lodi, as into a place of great importance for the Duke
of Milans Interests, and for the Venetians also, since the preservation thereof
would make much for the safety of Bergamo and Crema; which when it should be
done, as soon as the French should begin to ascend the Mountains, he should
pass over the Poe with the Venetian Army, and join with them to suppress
Antonio da Leva, according as occasion should best serve. As soon therefore as
Monsieur de S. Paul was come into Italy, who brought with him five thousand
foot, five hundred Lances, and as many Light Horse, it being about the end of
July, the Duke of Urbine spoke with him at Monticelli, a place seated upon the
Banks of Poe, to advise how they were to carry on the War, for the common
service; the Duke of Urbine being ordered so to do by the Senate, and it
agreeing likewise with his own opinion, propounded.

That they should keep all their Forces employed in Lombardy, to drive Antonio
da Leva out of the Dukedom of Milan, upon which all the affairs of Italy were
finally to depend: For as long as the Imperialists should have a secure
receptacle in that State, whereinto they might easily bring many Soldiers from
Germany; and from whence they received great convenience for the feeding of
their Army, which had now been maintained a good while at the private expense
of several men of the Country, there was no hopes of putting a period to the
War. That any thing attempted elsewhere, though it should succeed well, would
not be equally beneficial, to what might be received by driving the Enemy out
of those Confines, and by getting safe possession of the State of Milan.
Moreover, it might be hoped, that by keeping the Forces of the Colleagues
joined together, and near at band, they might at last draw the Pope into the
League, the which had been several times attempted in vain.

Monsieur de S. Paul, and the other French Commanders, were of another
opinion: viz, That the business of Naples was not to be abandoned, losing
thereby their reputation both with the people, and with the Enemy; showing
amongst other things, how necessary it was to keep the Imperialists employed in
the Kingdom of Naples, so as they might not come and join with Antonio da Leva;
whereby growing very strong, they might settle themselves in the possession of
both those States.

In this diversity of opinion, they pitch upon a way which might serve both
their desires; to wit, not to give over the affairs of Naples totally, but
howsoever to intend chiefly the business of Lombardy: wherefore since some
Towns in P^glia held yet for the confederates, and were well affected to the
Venetians, and to the French; it was resolved they should make head there, and
reinforce their men, that they might make some other attempt, and keep the
Imperialists in fear and jealousy. The Venetian Senate did therefore order
their Commissary at Sea, to go with his Fleet into Puglia, to put very good
Garrisons into all the Towns which held for the Commonwealth, and for the King
of France, and to fall upon taking the Castles in Brandizzo: and on the other
side, Renzo da Ceri, and the Prince of Melfi, were to pass into those Sea
coasts with five thousand foot, for the transporting whereof from Ancona to
Pugl^a, the Venetians sent eight Galleys, and other Vessels. It was also
resolved, that the Fleet should be increased, and reinforced, that they might
make some other attempt in the Kingdom, and keep the Imperialists busied in
several places. To which purpose, the Venetians promised to lend the King
twelve Galleys.

The Senate did moreover very much solicit the other Confederates, as the
Florentines, and Duke of Ferrara, that bea^ing patiently the adverse fortune
about Naples, they would seek to provide against other dangers, by lending
ready and stout assistance toward the renewing of the War in Puglia, whereby
the enemies forces would be kept far from their Territories, being employed in
defending their own affairs. Whereunto these Princes showed themselves very
forward, the Florentines offering moreover to keep up a body of men in Tuscany,
and the Duke of Ferrara an other at Modena, to provide for all occurrences: But
as for the affairs of Lombardy, and the State of Milan, wherein the forces
remained entire, it was resolved to advance toward Milan; and both the Armies
being come to Landriano, the Commanders thought it not fit to fall then upon
the expugning of Milan, which would be a thing too hard to effect, Leva being
entered thereinto with his Army, after he had fetched much victuals into the
City; therefore they took an other course, they fell upon the enterprise of
Pavia, which they thought they might be successful in, for that there was but a
weak Garrison there, of only one thousand foot: wherefore the Confederates Army
marched speedily thither, to prevent all impediments which they might receive
from Leva, if he should be aware of their march: they encamped before it, and
began to play furiously upon the walls: the Duke of Urbine having with much
persuasions got some pieces of Cannon to be brought along, and carried over the
River Tesino: So as a great Battery being soon begun, they prepared to give an
assault: wherein, the first place falling to the Venetians lot, it happened that
whilst they were ordering their affairs, some averseness thereunto appeared in
the Switzers foot: But the Duke of Urbine having sorely wounded one^ of their
Captains with his own hand (who said that there was not any one who could make
his Soldiers move but himself) and at the same instant turning the Cannon upon
them, he brought them all to be obedient: so as a hot assault being given,
wherein the Duke of Urbine was one, who together with some of his Curassiers,
all of them being on foot, put himself into the first ranks, and assaulting
such Bastions as were best defended, got the praise of being most nobly bold.
The Town was taken, and sacked, and the most of the defendants slain, and soon
after the Castle also yielded, whereinto Galleazzo da Birago, together with
such soldiers as were left alive, retreated; they had their lives given them,
the Dutch foot being permitted to return to Milan, and the Italians to return
to their own homes.

The getting of Pavia proved very advantageous, and of great credit to the
League, not only in its own respect, but because it was accompanied with the
quick surrender of Novara, and of other neighboring Towns, whereby the enemy,
who received much victuals from thence for the nourishment of the Army which
was in Milan, was much incommodated.

The Venetian Senate was much rejoiced hereat, hoping that it might in the
future somewhat counterpoise their late loss at Naples: they commended and
thanked Monsieur de St Paul for it, exhorting him to prosecute the prosperity
which was promised by this good beginning; not despairing, but by his happy
conduct, they should get Milan, and recover Naples. The alteration in Genua was
very unwelcome news to France: wherefore the King sent an express Commission to
Monsieur de St Paul, that before all other things, he should mind and endeavor
the returning of that City into her former condition, to the relief whereof,
the three thousand foot which were thereunto designed, refused to go, for want
of having received their pay; which put Trivultio into so great difficulties,
as he protested he would surrender, unless he received some speedy succor.
Thus the affairs of the League, which began to be a little refreshed, fell
quickly back into great straits; for as the opportunity which was offered of
getting Milan was very great, by reason of the rescent reputation won at Pavia,
and through the sufferings whereunto Leva's Arms was reduced; but chiefly by
the excessive and unsupportable Taxes imposed by the Imperialists upon the
people of Milan, which had made them ready to mutiny, and to throw off the yoke
of so severe servitude, so was it requisite, that to the ^ffecting thereof,
they should make use of all their forces together, and to beleaguer that great
City with two camps; and yet Monsieur de St Paul setting his heart upon the
relief of Genua, did not only refuse to go to Milan, but pressed the Duke of
Urbine very much to go along with him, and to carry his Venetian forces to
Genua, that they might proceed therein the more securely: to which the Venetian
Senate would not consent, since by sending their forces so far off, they should
not only lose all the advantage of their victory, and make the Duke of Milan
despair, but should expose Bergamo, and other Cities of their dominion to great
danger. Wherefore, being both of them resolute in their opinions, the French
Commanders rose with all their forces, and past over the Po, at Porta Stella,
to go by the way of Tuscany to Genua; and the Venetians (the Senate not
thinking it fit that they should retire) stayed at Pavia, to be assistant in
reputation to the affairs of Genua; and that they might tarry there more
securely, and fall upon any enterprise which occasion should offer, the Senate
resolved to raise new foot to recruit their Army, which was much diminished by
several accidents.

But the French had but ill success; for finding Genua strongly Garrisoned, and
they not being above two thousand Foot, they had no hopes of doing any good
there by their long tarrying, though they were already got very near the City:
Wherefore they resolved to return to Lombardy, and to quarter in the City of
Alessandria, whereunto Sforza gave way, hoping that when two thousand
Landsknechts, who were already past the mountains should be come unto him, they
might return with better hopes to the enterprise of Milan. But the mean while,
Trivulsio hearing of their retreat, and despairing of timely succor, yielded
up the castle; which was presently slighted by the people, that they might have
no such obstacle to their Liberty, Savona likewise, whereinto the succor led
on by Captain Montigiano, could not enter, returned to the power of the
Genueses. after this they fell to alter the Government, freeing it as much as
at the first they could from popularity; reducing those Families to a small
number, who were to partake in the management of the Commonwealth, and
instituting a magistracy of but a few citizens, temporising their authority by
that of the greater Councels; though Doria's greatness continued to be very
much in these civil institutions, upon whose will, and authority, their
establishment did depend. And that they might be free from the fear of foreign
forces, which might cause an alteration in this new State, the Genueses, by
public order interceded with the Venetians, desiring them to be contented,
that they might now remain in that free neutrality, to which they had formerly
exhorted them: alleging it for a reason, why they had taken up arms against
their city, because Antonietto Adorno was head of the government thereof, who
depending totally upon the Imperialists, was very advantageous to the enemy.
But the Venetians answered, that the face of affairs was much altered; since
they had very much offended the King of France, by driving out his men, and by
receiving Doria, who was his professed enemy; whereby they had provoked the Kings
forces against them; nor could they be wanting to be assisting to the King,
their friend and Confederate. And really the Venetians did very much desire,
that the business of Genua might be again attempted, for the Kings better
satisfaction, who gave apparent signs of being displeased, that they did not
send their men with the Duke of Urbine, to relieve Trivultio: and because they
thought it very convenient for their affairs, that the City, which was as it
were the Gate of Italy, whereby the Spaniards had convenience to enter
thereinto by Sea, might depend upon the will of their friend, the King of
France; and especially at this time, when Caesar had given out, (making use of
such an occasion) that he would come himself in person into Italy. They
therefore exhorted the Genueses to put themselves again under the King of
France his protection, who was a powerful and courteous Prince, in whom they
should find both power and will to preserve their Liberty. But neither the
season of the year, (which was a very bitter winter,) nor yet the weakness of
their Armies, which were very much lessened by several accidents, would not
permit them to use force: So as, though it were known, that there was a great
scarcity of victuals in Milan, that Antonio da Leva was sick, and the Army
sufficiently lessened, which might very well invite them to the attempt of that
enterprise, since the Forces of the League were nigh at hand: and though this
might be a means to facilitate the good success of Genua, and that the Senate
had prayed the Duke of Urbine not to let slip so fair an occasion; yet not
trusting too much to their own Forces, and apprehending the inconveniences of
winter, the Captains of the League resolved to bring their Armies into their
winter quarters, and to expect a better season, and greater Forces. So as, the
Duke of Milan going to winter with his Forces in Pavia, the Duke of Urbine was
forced to rise from thence, intending to go to Lodi, but not pleased therewith,
he resolved to go to the banks of Ada, and soon after past over the river, to
get into safer and more commodious quarters. But the French Army went into
Alessandria, that they might afterward join, as the sea son and occasion
should counsel. But the Senate was chiefly troubled about the towns of Puglia,
which being preserved, were very serviceable to the Commonwealth, both in
times of peace and war: and being by agreement to be restored, they might be a
great advantage to them, upon other occasion^. Trani and Monopoli held then for
the Venetians, and Berletta for the French, the rest being abandoned, and these
not without difficulty preserved by Commissary Vetturi, when the French Army
was routed* who being about the taking of Manfredonia, when he heard of what
had happened at Naples, sent a good number of Foot forthwith in Galleyes to
Garrison those Maritime Towns, writing forged Letters to the Magistrates, that
the French Commanders having been but very little damnified, were retired with
all their forces safe to Auversa, to keep the people in their allegiance; least
out of fear, they might be moved, as many others had been, to agree with the
Imperialists. Camillo Orsino was entered into Trani, as soon as he rise with the
Camp from before Maufredonia; Iovan Corrado Orsino, Iulio di Montebello, and
Horratio da Carpenna, being parted from Brandizzo, were in Monopoli: and Renzo
da Ceri, who had the title of Lieutenant of the Kingdom, was come to Barletta*
Whither also Simion Romano was come with his light horse. The Venetians were
three thousand Foot; Renzo brought with him five thousand; and two thousand
were raised at the charges of the Florentines, and of some of the family of the
Orsini; so as, they amounted in all to the number of ten thousand Foot, to
boot, with four hundred Venetian horse, and 300 horse which Renzo brought with
him, and in Abruzzo; Iovan Iacopi Franco, being got into Matrice, and Camillo
Orsino into Aquila, they set up the French colors, and held those Towns in the
name of the King of France, to whom the country people seemed much inclined;
as, on the contrary, the name of Caesar grew very hateful to them, by reason of
the many extortions which his Officers used to the people. The Venetians being
intent upon the preservation of these places, and hoping not only to be able to
hold the enemy play, and to keep the war from the State of Lombardy, but to
make some advancement, since the Imperialists wanted not many
disaccommodations; resolved to relieve those Towns, sending them all sorts of
munition; and to recruit the Garrisons with six hundred Foot raised in
Dalmatia, which being conveyed thither in some Galleys, in the depth of winter,
two of them ran on ground, and split upon those shores. But Commissary Mula,
who had kept till then upon those coasts, for the safety of the Towns, and to
preserve those men upon all events, and that the Galley-slaves might work upon
the Fortifications leaving four Galleys to guard them, retreated by public
order to Corfu: which the Senate did, out of the need the Fleet stood in of
being refreshed; and that they might add to the number of the Galleys, that
they might join with the Fleet which was prepared by the King of France in
Marcelles; and impose the Imperialists Maritime Forces: who were said to
prepare good store of Frigates in Barcellona, to the end, that joining with
Doria's Galley's, they might go out strong to Sea. In this Interim, the Pope
ceased not his desires to have Cervia, and Ravenna restored unto him; to which
purpose the King of France had sent the Vicount Turin to Venice, desirous to
give some satisfaction to the Pope, in whom his former ill will to the King was
increased, by the Marriage of Renea the Kings kinswoman to Hercoles, the Duke
of Ferrara's son, knowing that by this alliance, the king was obliged to defend
the Duke, from whom the Pope desired to repossess himself of the Cities of
Modena and Regio, as well as those in Romagna from the Venetians and he hoped
to have been therein assisted by the King according to his promise.

But the Senate, desirous to give the King satisfaction in all things,
acquainted him with their pretentions and interests; that they had Ravenna,
from Obizo Polenta, the Lord thereof, 400 years since it was in the Churches
possession; and that Cervia was possessed by the Commonwealth by the last Will
and Testament of Dominico Malatesta, charged with many pious uses, wherein the
will of the Testator was continually fulfilled; that if they had desired to
enjoy what belonged to others, they would not have refused the offers made by
those of Furli, and of other Towns in Romagna, to come under their command;
that they had been at no little charge in maintaining Bologna, and other Cities
under the Papal Dominion; that they possessed these Towns when the Pope had
quitted the League; and and therefore in that respect they had just reason to
hold them, since they had spent more Treasure in these wars by much then those
Cities were worth; that his Majesty would be pleased to consider, whether it
would make for his advantage, that his friends and his confederates should part
with so convenient places to the Pope who was but ill affected to the Crown of
France, nay, to the Imperialists upon whose authority it was apparent that the
Pope did depend, either out of will, or fear. That to boot with his own
concernments, he should weigh the injury which would be thereby done to the
other Colleagues, to the Florentines, and to the Duke of Ferara; who certainly
would be very much troubled at such an action, which might ^inder their
forwardness in adhering to the League: That he ought likewise to consider these
Towns were as a curb to keep the Pope within his duty; and that this respect
ceasing, he would the sooner discover himself to be a friend and confederate of
Caesar 's.

Visconte being conjunct by these reasons, went to Rome, where he propounded
diverse expediences to the Pope for the accommodation of these Affairs; as, that
these Towns might be given in fee to the Commonwealth, upon some recognition
to the Church, as he had done by several other Towns. Or else that they would
be deposited into the King of France his hands, to be disposed of as he should
think fit. Which proposals being put unto the Senate, they were neither wholly
accepted, nor wholly refused; but mentioning what the State had done, and what
they were ready to do in order to the Pope's service, they seemed to confide
much upon Clement's wisdom that he might of himself find out some fair and
rational accommodation of these difficulties.

Thus was this business suspended, and the success of War uncertain, and the
time of laying down Arms most uncertain, when the year 1528 ended.

The year 1529 began with various hopes of peace, and with fear of new
combustions of War; for great weariness, and weakness appeared plainly in the
Princes: Which as well as the bitterness of the winter, was the reason why all
Military actions were ceased; nor did any such notable effects ensue either in
Lumbardy, or in the Kingdom of Naples, as might have been expected; the one
party being quite dissipated and destroyed, the other remained totally
victorious, and arbitrator of all things: which were so balanced, as each
party might bear its own fortune, and hope for better in the future: Wherefore
it was thought that the condition of affairs being thus; an agreement would be
the more easily made. Caesar professed openly that he desired universal peace;
and above all things, to accommodate his Affairs to the Princes of Italy; to
which purpose he had sent the General of Franciscans to Rome, who having
received the Cap, took upon him the title of Cardinal of Sancta Cruce; which
Commission (as it was given out to cause Hostia and Civita Vecchia to be
restored to the Pope, and to treat with the Popes self, touching the
reconcilment of all difficulties. The King of England used all efficacious
means with the King of France, and to bring him to an agreement; and had sent
express Ambassadors to Rome, to exhort the Pope to undertake such a treaty, as
a thing that did better belong to him, and more properly then to any other. Nor
did the King of France appear to be there unto averse, he having sent
Commission to his Ambassador at Rome, for universal peace. The Venetians did
the like, giving sufficient warrant to their Ambassador Gaspero Contarini to
say, that the Senate following the advice of the King of France, and according
to their own inclination toward the peace, and common good of Christendom,
would make good whatsoever had been formerly agreed upon by particular
conventions. They moreover did of themselves, desire, the Pope that he would
take upon him the weight of so important a business, and bring it to a good
end, as might be hoped from his power and sincerity; promising that upon the
concluding of an universal peace, they would witness their good will in any
thing remained in dispute between them and the Apostolic See, touching the
Cities of Ravenna and Cervia. But for all this, many things gave reason to
suspect, that all this was but a Copy of their countenances, and that the
Princes were inwardly otherwise inclined; being more intent upon their own
advantage, then agreed with the accommodation of so many great differences, and
to putting an end to Wars of so long duration. It was known that the King of
France was very jealous of the Pope, so as he did neither believe much what he
said, nor did he much confide in him: Holding all his proposals to be doubtful
and uncertain. Therefore he treated apart with the Venetians, that they would
reorder their Forces by Sea, and by Land, seeming not to be at all discouraged
for what had happened at Naples; as a thing which had fallen out by misfortune,
and not through any cowardice of the Soldiery: Wherefore he was more desirous
then ever to renew the Wars in Italy. As for the Emperor though he said he
would come into Italy. to take upon him the Crown of the Empire, and to procure
peace, yet he made so great preparation for War, as it appeared he intended not
to do as he said; especialy since his desire of making himself Master of the
State of Milan was so very well known. And as for the Pope, who was to take
upon him the chief care herein, he still retained the desire of recovering not
only the Towns in Romagna, but also Modena, and Regio; and likewise he longed to
revenge himself, for the injuries done him by the Florentines, and to replace
his Nephews in their pristine greatness, and dignity in Florence; which were
not things to be done without War. And the Venetians though they had been so
many years involved in Wars, wherein they had already spent five Millions of
Gold; and that therefore they desired to give some ease and refreshment to
themselves, and to their Subjects; yet they persevered resolutely not to
abandon the Duke of Milan, not to permit that that State should fall again into
Cesar's power; nor would they easily part with the Towns in Puglia and Romagna,
unless upon the establishing of universal peace upon fair and rational
conditions. Thus did the Princes at this time steer their thoughts and actions;
and this was men's opinion touching ^uture War and Peace.

This mean while the News increased of Cesar's coming into Italy, for which
great preparation of Shiping was made at Barcellona; and the Archduke
Ferdinand came to Ispruch, and raised much moneys in the Dyets, taking foot
Soldiers into pay, to send them for Italy, to serve his Brother, giving out
that he would assault the States of Venice. Yet at the same time diverse
treaties of agreement were propounded to the Senate, by Andrea Doria, and by
some other Imperialists; showing that the Emperor had very good thoughts
toward the Commonwealth; and offering to negotiate peace, wherein the
Venetians proceeded very cautiously; fearing lest this might be a trick to
separate the French by these jealousies from the freindship of the
Commonwealth; so as they slackned not their preperation for War; for the
Senate would depend upon themselves, and treat of Peace with Sword in hand, and
with honor.

The time of the Duke of Urbines command being at an end, they continued his
employment for three years longer, with the increase of ten thousand Crowns a
year pay, and with as many Curassiers, as made up those that were before under
his command two hundred.

Moreover a particular Troop of fifty Curassiers was given to his son Guido
Ubaldo, who was likewise taken into the Commonwealths service, and had a
stipend of a thousand crowns a year given him. Gianus Maria Fregoso was made
Governor General of the Venetian Militia, in reward of his loyalty and worth:
And because the Duke of Urbine had many occasions to be absent from the camp,
as he was particularly at this time; and that it was thought fit for the
public service, that some person of great authority should always be in the
Army, Antonio Alberti was sent to him, Savio degli Ordini with Orders that he
should go speedily from Brescia, where he then was, and come to the Army; in
which journey, for his greater honor, he was accompanied by the said Alberti.
Other chief places of the Militia were disposed of to others. Count Gaiazzo was
made General of the Light Horse; and Antonio da Castello Captain of the
Artillery. Hercoles Fregoso, Farfarella da Ravenna, and other Commanders were
taken again into the Commonwealths service: A good sum of money was sent to the
camp, to Commissary Navi, with Orders to raise new Foot, and to fill up the
companies. Nor were they less vigilant about Maritime Affairs. Girolamo Pesaro
was created Captain General at Sea, and Andrea Pesaro being chosen a little
before Commissary of the Fleet, and Vicenso Iustiniano Captain of the Bastard
Galleys, they were both of them ordered to prepare for Sea; there were other
ten chosen for Governors, to arm the ten Galleys which were disarmed the
preceding Winter; so as the Commonwealth had above fifty Galleys at Sea, and
though by the Articles of confederacy they were not bound to furnish out above
sixteen Galleys, they promised notwithstanding to add four more thereunto, so
as there should be twenty for the service of the League, whereof Girolamo
Contarini was made Captain. And because the Duke of Milan, and Monsieur di S.
Paul, who were desired to increase the number of their Foot according to their
Articles, excused themselves for want of moneys; the Senate resolved to lend
the French twelve thousand Ducats, and eight thousand to the Duke of Milan.
But the Venetians did chiefly desire, and pray the King of France, that he
would not be wanting to the Colleagues upon so important an occasion, since he
had found them all so affectionate to him, and so constant in prosecuting the
War. And truly these remembrances were no more then necessary; for all the bad
success of the French in the affairs of Italy, arose from their slowness in
making provisions, and from too much confiding in themselves; the French being
naturally given to promise all good success to themselves at the first
beginning, which makes them easily undertake any business, but they are not
constant in the prosecution, and but little careful in providing necessaries
out of the hopes they have of bringing it soon to an end, measuring it often
more according to their own desires, then according to the truth. Monsieur de
S. Paul was reduced to want of men, moneys, and almost of all things requisite
to maintain War in Italy: Nor was there any preparations seen for doing any
thing beyond the Mountains, which the King had so often promised to do. And yet
it was now more necessary then ever to do both these, and that with powerful
forces, to keep the Emperor from coming into Italy, either by preparing
strongly to resist him there, or else by keeping him employed in defending
Spain, and in muniting the heart of his Dominions. They therefore told the King
that it was a thing becoming him, and the forces of that powerful Kingdom, to
interrupt Cesars designs, and to bring him by force of Arms to an agreement,
and to the restoring his Sons, since he could not be persuaded thereunto by
reason. After these persuasions the King appeared to be somewhat more fervent
touching the affairs of Italy; so as they hoped they might be able at one and
the same time to renew the Wars both in Lombardy, and in the Kingdom of Naples:
And to make some notable advancement by anticipating the coming of Caesar, and
of his succors. The Senate were therefore of opinion that the Duke of Urbine
should come to Venice; where in the presence of the Ambassadors of the King of
France, and of the Duke of Milan's, and of a Gentleman sent to that purpose
from Monsieur di S. Paul, many long consultations were had touching the manner
of managing the War. And at last it was concluded, that the first thing to be
done was, to mind the business of Milan, but rather by the way of siege then
assault, by taking in the neighboring places, and by reducing Leva's Army to
want of victuals, and in the mean time to raise greater forces; and the number
pitched upon were twenty thousand foot, to wit, eight thousand French, eight
thousand Venetians, two thousand of the Duke of Milan's, and two thousand
Landsknechts, which were expected from Lions, and were already taken into pay
at the common expense; and as for the Enterprise of Genua, that it should be
managed according as occasions should fall out, and as things should succeed in
Lombardy, But the greatest security for the affairs of Italy was judged to
depend upon the keeping off Cesars coming; it was therefore resolved that the
French Fleet should be increased as much as might be, as also the Venetian
Fleet, and particularly in great Vessels, to the end that they might keep the
better at Sea, and oppose the Imperial Fleet, which consisted of like vessels;
to the end that when Caesar should see he could not sail without great danger,
he might keep from doing so. Yet it being afterward known that the Kings
inclination lay to make War with Caesar beyond the Mountains, accordingly as was
formerly designed, the Senators began to differ in their opinions ( Andrea
Navagiero being at this time chosen Ambassador to be sent to the Court of
France, to renew the first desires) what they ought first to exhort the King
to, whether to come in person into Italy, or to send his Armies to the Perenean
Mountains, and assault Spain.

Amongst the rest, Luigi Mocenigo, a man versed in the management of the
weightiest Affairs of the Commonwealth, and one of great authority, was of
opinion, that they were chiefly to persuade the King, to send his forces to the
confines of Spain, so to divert the War which was intended to be made in Italy.

In these times, so full of difficulties, said he, in an Oration which he made,
we must take many things into consideration, and proceed therein with much
temperance. The Art of a skillful Physician consists in curing his patient, so
that his malady draw not on another sickness: and the Pilot, who sails in the
sea, where are many Rocks, if he know not how to steer his ship, whilst he
endeavors to shun one rock, may give against another. We are now assuredly in
a very narrow condition, we have to do with all the precepts of civil wisdom,
and are to consider many things at once: Our Commonwealth, through so many and
so long wars, is now become weak; the times are subject to chances, and we sail
amidst many dangerous rocks.

Doubtlesly we ought to be concerned in Caesar 's greatness, for he threatens
the ruin of the Italian Potentates. It is a useful, or rather a necessary
Counsel, to seek by all means how to suppress him. For by fautering him, or
suffering him to grow greater, he becomes daily more formidable, and the
remedy proves harder. Yet I am of opinion, that to attain unto our true
intentions, it is not good, neither ought we to use all remedies, though they
may seem proper to cure our present maladies. For it is not our thoughts, nor
our intentions, to keep Caesar low, out of any hatred we bear unto his person,
or out of any Rivalship that our Commonwealth has with him; but only for our
own convenience, and safety; that our State may not be exposed to his
victorious will: That, if he should possess himself of the State of Milan, we
meet not with so powerful a Neighbor, as to be in perpetual jealousies of
him. Whence it may be easily conceived, that it makes not for our advantage, to
suppress Caesar so, as to raise up another Potentate in Italy, of equal power
and authority with him, who may in time bring us into the same dangers, which
now we strive to shun. For my part, I doubt very much, whether the coming of
the most Christian King into Italy, be like to prove that powerful means which
others may believe, of keeping Caesar far off; and (to confess the truth) I
cannot promise my self, that when we shall have our desire in this, we shall
find such continency in the King, as that driving the Imperialists out of
Italy, he be to restore her to peace and safety: but that he will rather claim
the whole fruit of the victory to himself. The King of France is no less
desirous to become master of the Kingdom of Naples, and of the Dukedom of
Milan, then Caesar; nor are his pretentions thereunto weaker. The so many wars
made, for this intent^on, and many other signs, discovered upon other
occasions, though cloaked under other ends, show, that this Kings thoughts have
been suc^, and such the like of his Predecessors. Who can secure us, that when
the King shall be become Arbytrator of the Affairs of Italy, and not being
counterpo^sed by the Imperial forces, and that he shall know, he stands not in
need of our help, to keep possession of these States, that he may not slight
our Interests, and forget all that we have done to exalt him. The desire of
Rule does often times so blind men, as it suffers them not to see reason, makes
them violate all Laws, and value nothing but their own peculiar and apparent
profit. So as, if Italy be to be subjected, what does it imp^rt us, whether it
be by the Spaniards, or by the French? He who shall consider things aright,
will find, that these two differ in many things among themselves, but that as
for us) they are to be of a like prejudice and danger. For though, for what
relates to our present affairs, it may seem that we ought as much to desire the
coming of the King of France into Italy, as to fear the like of Caesar 's, the
one being a Friend and Confederate, and that the dangers which may incur by
him, are more uncertain, and farther off; and that the other thinks himself
injured by us, and meets with many occasions of discord from our Commonwealth:
Yet it is not to be doubted, but that it were by much best for us, that neither
the one, nor the other of these Princes, had either State, Forces, pretentions,
or so much as thoughts upon the affairs of Italy: Which, since it cannot be
entirely effected by us, answerable to our occasions, and desires: yet we
should endeavor, as much as in us lies, to keep their persons far from hen^e:
for we may be sure, that the sight of these noble provinces of Italy, will
kindle in them (who are easy to take such Impressions) a greater desire of
possessing themselves thereof: and that by their presence, those things will be
much increased, which we would lessen: For where a great prince is in person,
he a^ds much of reputation to his affairs, and he may easily, and by many
ways, purchase unto himself favor, authority and power. Wherefore do we not
think then of some other means of keeping Caesar out of Italy, since there be
others, whereby we may much better effect our desires, without these dangers?
For, say the King should resolve to pass over the Mountains, it is not likely,
that that would keep Caesar from coming also into Italy by sea: nay, it may be,
if ^e were less resolved to do so, this would make him do it the sooner, lest
he might s^em to yield unto a Prince, who is not only his rival in glory, but
his open and declared enemy; as if he should confess, that after he had
divulged he would make such a voyage, he had forborne doing so, for fear of him,
leaving his Army, and all that he is possessed of in Italy, a secure prey for
others. But if on the contrary, the French will resolve, to march with
powerful forces to the Confines of Spain, and assault some of their Frontier
Forts, what reason is there to believe, that when the Emperor shall be
molested in his own Dominions, he will abandon their defense, to fall upon
Italy, a business of such difficulty; and that he will leave his own affairs in
apparent danger, out of uncertain hopes of getting what belongs to others.
Hannibals example is very remarkable, and may be very well paralel'd to this
which we now treat of; whom the Romans could never get out of Italy, till they
resolved to assault Africa, and so compel him to turn those forces which he
had long made use of against them, to defend his own Country. Moreover, it is
an excellent rule, when the fire of war cannot be totally extinguished, to keep
it as far from our own houses as we can, and to carry it elswere; and we who
see that Italy is made the seat of war, whereinto so many Transalpine Forces
have had recourse, to vent their fury, and glut their wicked wills, to the
great prejudice, and almost total ruin thereof; shall we mediate the coming in
of new foreigners thereinto, so to continue those miseries, and to make them
more? and to foment that fire in our bosoms, which has long burnt to our
great cost, and prejudice? if the King of France shall come into Italy, we are
sure we shall rekindle a new and heavy war: for, either Caesar will resolve, (as
I verily believe he will do) to come in person with so much the greater forces,
for that he shall know he is to meet with so much the slouter resistance; or
else, he will send the greater forces into Italy, and will add thereunto as
much as he is able, in the Kingdom of Naples, and Dukedom of Milan; for it is
not to be imagined, that, whilst he shall be safe at whom, and sufficiently
powerful and victorious in Italy, he will abandon his fortune, and forego the
possession of so many places which he is master of in Italy, for fear of the
coming of the French. And, why should not we think, that the king may be of
himself well inclined thereunto, whom we hear (that moved thereunto by these
reasons) has set his thoughts upon Spain, and that he already begins to
prepare for it. So as the moving him to make war there, will not one^y be
advantageous for us, but we may the sooner obtain our desires. I know not
therefore what we have to commit unto our Ambassador, Navagiero 's charge in
this point, since the Kings will, and our advantage concur therein. And
certainly if we know, how to use the time and occasion which is offered us, we
may hope, that the King, by the authority of this Senate, and by Navagiero 's
wisdom, and eloquence may be persuaded to confirm his opinion in molesting the
Emperors Dominions with new wars, and with Forces befitting the cause, and the
grandeur of his majesty and of his kingdom; whereby we shall not only attain
unto our chief end of keeping the Emperor, for the present out of Italy, but
we may hope to find him the easier to be brought hereafter to make a fair
agreement.

Many were pleased herewith; but it was opposed by many others, particularly,
by Marc Antonio Cornaro; who, though by reason of his years, he was of less
Authority, yet he was of great esteem for his eloquence. This man, in answer to
what Mocenigo had said, spoke thus:

If it were as easy to find out a remedy for the so many miseries of Italy,
and for our molestations and dangers, as we have just cause to commiserate the
condition of these unfortunate times, I should very much approve, that we
should think of what might secure us not only from our present dang^rs, but
from all those which may a long time hereafter befall us. But I am shrewdly
afraid, that whilst by an immature cautiousness we fear every thing, and would
forese^, and provide against whatsoever accidents may occur, we ruin our
present condition, and lose the opportunity of applying those remedies, which
doubtless may help us at this our present and greatest need. Concerning Caesar
's coming into Italy, as we may be sure thereof, unless his way be stopped, so
is it for many reasons very much to be feared. He is at the present possessed
of almost all the Kingdom of Naples, and of a good part of the Dukedom of
Milan: he has powerful Armies in both these Countries: Genua also, a city, so
opportunely situated for the affairs of Italy, has put it self into his
protection. If he settle himself in these several parts by his coming into
Italy, and by extinguishing the remainder of the French Army, what hopes have
we of ever driving him out? he pretends to possess the Kingdom of Naples by
right of Inheritance: and by the investment of the Pope himself: we may see how
he means to behave himself concerning the Duchy of Milan; since making diverse
subterfuges, he could never be brought to assign over the City of Milan to
Francisco S^orza, as by agreement he was tied to do. On the other side, the
King of France is not now possessed of almost any thing in Italy. He has put
the Towns of the Dukedom of Milan, which he has gotten by his forces, into
the hands of Francisco Sforza; in the Kingdom of Naples, he quits the Towns of
Puglia to us; and is content, that a particular King be put over the rest: He
has no other Army in Italy, then those few men that are with Monsieur St.
Paul, and which are so much lessened as they exceed not the number of five
thousand Foot: So as, we see, that if the counterpoise of the French Forces be
totally taken away, whereby Caesar 's greatness may be moderated, all Italy must
necessarily be either subject to him, or depend upon him: or if any one
Potentate shall preserve his Liberty, he must live at perpetual expense, and
in continual jealousies of so powerful an neighbor. To all which mischiefs
and dangers, it is well known, there is no sufficient remedy, but the coming of
the King of France into Italy. For, how negligent and full of delays the
French are, in making Provisions for the war, when the King is not present in
person, the fresh examples of so many of his Armies, routed, and ruined out of
this only respect, may sufficiently witness. Moreover, If the Emperor shall
come, as the French Army ought to be in all things, at least equal, if not
superior to his, it must be accompanied with like reputation, which can only
be effected by the King's presence, which will help as much as almost an other
Army; will make the Pope declare for the League; will confirm the Florentines
and the Duke of Ferrara; and will make all the people and princes of Italy
ready to assist, and adhere unto him in all his enterprises: so as, either
Caesar will be kept from coming, or if he do come, he will meet with such a
counterpoise, as will frustrate all his disignes, and will make him pass
quickly back again over the Sea. These advantages are not to be expected, by
making any attempts upon Spain, which can but little or not at all avail our
intentions. For, Caesar knows, that his situations being strong by Art and
Nature, and his Castles being excellently well garrisoned, the King can make no
important nor speedy advancement there, nor can he tarry there long, but rather
is in danger of consuming his army through several sufferings, in that barren
Country. Where, whilst mountains and walls shall fight against the King, Caesar
finding in Italy a fruitful Country, weak Cities, and those but weakly
garrisoned, he will possess new Territories, he will fortify those which he is
already possessed of, and will confirm himself in the possession of the
greatest and best part of Italy. But it may peradventure be said, that the one
may be done, and the other not left undone; the Affairs of Italy may be
provided for, and Spain may be assaulted. He who shall be of that opinion, may
be s^id, to deceive himself willingly: For, late experience shows the contrary:
we see how great difficulties and what impediments are found, in bringing men
and moneys from France, to recrute the Army commanded by Monsieur St. Paul, and
to bring it into a condition of being able to extinguish the little remainder
of enemies which are yet in Milan, under Antonio da Leva: and yet the King is
not employed in any other enterprise. I pray you, what do you think the event
will be, when the king shall have carried with him the prime Flower of his
Nob^lity to the borders of Spain, or when the Emperor being strong in Italy,
there will be need of greater Forces to resist him, then those which are now
requisite; and yet we find a want of them. Assuredly, the best Commanders, and
best Soldiers will be where the Kings person is: moneys, and all Provisions
for war will be carried thither: for both the king and kingdom, and not
without reason, will have chief regard to those things wherein the glory and
safety of their king and Nation* concerned immediately: and yet on the other
side, if the French do not gallantly recruit their Army in Italy, the field
must be yielded to Caesar at his first arrival, whereof being Master, he will
possess himself of all Cities and strong Holds, which will have but small hope
of being re^ieved by weaker* Forces. Therefore, since it is impossible to
attend two enterprises at once, and to negotiate them both, with safety, and
hopes of bringing them unto a good end, I know not why we should doubt of
choosing that, wherein the benefit appears to be greater and more certain, and
the danger further off, and more uncertain, But I beseech you, since it is so
positively affirmed, that if Caesar be molested at home, it is not likely that
he will have leisure to think upon the affairs of Italy; he being to prefer the
preservation of his own Dominions, before things further off, and more
uncertain. Why will not we do the like, by providing principally, and primarily
for the safety of Italy, by the most assured, and most immediate way; and not
dream upon prejudicing Spain, nor seek how by a fallacious and far fetched
remedy to obviate a certain and apparent danger; nay, we should rather value
this reason the more, and the more observe this rule: for suppose, the
enterprise concerning Spain succeed prosperously, what fruit shall we reap
thereby? But Caesar is possessed of several Territories in Italy* so as by
coming into them, he may hope to secure them, and keep them from being
prejudiced: so as whether he stay in Spain, or come into Italy, his business
goes on advantagiously, and is likely to prosper: so as his counsel can never
be blamed, as peradventure ours may be, there being so great a disparity
between them. It Is true, what is said to the contrary, that we should have as
great a care, in keeping the King of France from increasing too much in power,
as in abasing Cesar's greatness: Yet, if I should enter into the consideration
of all the particulars in this point; this opinion would peradventure prove not
to be so absolutely true; nor would the reasons, nor respects of these two
Princes prove alike: But let us give it for granted, let us see a little,
whether the condition of the Times, and the present estate of affairs being
considered, we ought now to apprehend the power of the French so much, or be
jealous of the King of France his coming into Italy.

We have for many years last past, been joined in strait League and Amity with
that Crown; which being but for a very little while interrupted, was soon
redintegrated. Moreover, the King of France has not at this time, either any
State, nor many Forces in Italy, nor means of getting any, without our help and
assistance: On the other side, we meet with many pretensions, many
difficulties, and many occasions of diffidence in Caesar; so as it is i^possible
to have him our Neighbor, and not to be jealous of him. But that which imports
most, is, Milan holds of him, and many Towns in that State: the City of Naples,
and the greatest part of that Kingdom; and he has still two Armies on Foot;
the one in Lombardy, the other in the aforesaid Kingdom: And shall we at this
time, and with these concomitances, value things alike? And shall we fear the
power of the King of France as much in Italy, as that of the Emperor? Nay
certainly, keeping the same measure and proportion which has been spoken of,
we ought to assist the greatness of the French in Italy, where it is so much
lessened, to oppose it to the like of Caesar, which is so much enhanc'd. When
these scales shall be equally poised, it will then be time to think how we
ought to behave our selves, in not suffering either of them to grow too great,
though they should contend one with another; and by this contention, if the
Commonwealth cannot purchase perfect peace and tranquillity, as having forces so
near her, she will thereby at least get more security, and will live in better
hope, that Italy may one day recover her liberty. This is not the first time
that the Kings of France have passed over the Mountains; they have been invited
over by us, by their assistance we have recovered our State, and by their
friendship we have kept up the reputation of our Commonwealth: nor avails it
any thing to say, that we ought to carry the war into other parts, and keep it
far from our selves; for war is already kindled in Italy, our Country is
already on fire, and we treat not now how to inflame this fire by the Kings
coming, but rather, how to extinguish another more great and dangerous.
Diversion is used as a second remedy, when the first, of preserving a man's
estate from being endamaged by an enemy, cannot otherwise be prevented: but
when we have time enough to prevent Caesar 's coming, by increasing our forces,
by making our selves Masters of the Field, by fortifying our Towns, and in
fine, block up his passage, cut off his hopes, and break his designs; why shall
we apply our selves to less useful, and more uncertain remedies? When Caesar
shall be come into Italy, and shall have made some progress therein, which we
could not otherwise have prevented, it will then become us to think of
diversion, and to have recourse to these remedies, of drawing him out of Italy,
by assaulting his other Dominions, and by endeavoring to make him turn his
forces elsewhere. But certainly, it will not now be wisely done, to endeavor
that the forces of a Confederate King should go and waste themselves in the
barren parts of Spain, and suffer our enemies to feed fat, and enrich
themselves, in the fruitful parts of Italy. Who will think him wise, who in
lieu of preventing that the fire seize not upon his own house, will go and
kindle it elsewhere, and suffer his own dangers to increase, that he may
revenge himself afterward upon the author thereof? It will assuredly be wiser
counsel, to seek how to keep injuries afar off, then to think how to revenge
them when they are received. By these reasons it is clearly seen that the
coming of the King of France into Italy, will be very advantageous for us, and
that we have no reason to apprehend any danger thereby, especially at this
present conjuncture of time: therefore we ought to endeavor it, as much as we
can, and to charge our Ambassador, that he seek by the authority and counsel
of this Senate, to persuade the King, or in case he find him already so
inclined, to increase that his disposition in him, to come as soon, and as
strong as he can, into Italy, to the terror of his enemies, and consolation of
his friends.

Cornaro was listened to attentively, and after some dispute, his opinion
prevailed, and the Ambassador Navagiero was enjoined to deliver just what he
had said; who did accordingly, and being come to France, had great hopes of
obtaining his desire: for the King entertained the advice willingly, seeming to
approve of it, and that he would follow it: He therefore resolved to go
forthwith into Languedoc, that he might bring his men into the nearest and most
convenient part, to pass into Italy, whither he said he would bring above
twenty thousand foot, ten thousand Lantsknechts, and ten thousand Volunteers.
Thus the King's coming being certainly believed, the Senate ordered Andrea
Navagiero to stay in France with the Queen Mother and the Kings Council, that
Sebastiano Justinian, who was succeeded by Navagiero, should follow the King
into Italy. This mean while, the Senate being encouraged with hopes, did
diligently prepare for all necessaries for the War: a Bridge was built over the
Ada, with intention that at the end of April, the Commonwealths Army should
advance, and joining with Monsieur St Paul's men, should march to the
enterprise of Milan, which was thought would be the chief means of keeping the
Emperor from coming, since he would be thereby kept from that rendevous, by
the reputation whereof, by the help of the Fleet, and by the Kings presence,
they thought they might easily get Genua after, and effect whatsoever else they
should attempt. They at the same time were no less diligent in putting
Garrisons into the Towns of Puglia, sending a good number of Foot into that
Country, to keep all that they were possessed of, and upon occasion, to offer
at getting of more; as also, to hold the Imperialists forces busied and
divided, and keep them from coming into Lombardy, But amidst all this heat, the
King, without any appearing occasion began to cool, and to slacken his
provisions for War; so as moneys were scarcely furnished from France, for
Monsieur St Paul, who despairing of being able to maintain his Army, protested
he would be gone, and give over the business; for of ten thousand men which he
was to have had, he had scarce the one half; for they ran away in threves for
want of pay. After long expectation, Monsieur de Chattilion came from France,
but with far less money then was requisite; and going some few days after from
the Camp, he came to Venice, saying, he would pass into Puglia, to confirm
those soldiers and Commanders, and to carry them some moneys; for which
voyage, though the Senate had speedily furnished him with shipping, as he had
earnestly desired, yet he by several excuses delayed his going; with suspicion
that he had given out this only, not that he had really any moneys, or that he
intended to go to Puglia, but that the Venetians might not slacken the
provisions which they had made; which the King much fearing, because he knew he
had given them occasion so to do, he soon after sent Gioan Gioacchino, his
Ambassador to Venice, to hasten the going away of the Fleet, and of the other
provisions for War; and yet he brought no news of the King's coming, which was
so much expected, and of so great importance: This did the more increase the
Venetians jealousy, and was the occasion of much mischief, both in respect of
the dangers which they apprehended from Caesar, and because by this delay, they
lost the fruit of all their hopes, their Army being to lie idle about the banks
of Ada, because it was not able of it self to fall upon the enterprise of
Milan. But for all this, the Senate forbear not to be diligent in arming
themselves, and solicited the King touching the same affairs, as he, with less
occasion had solicited them. To which purpose, they sent their Secretary
Gaspero Penelli forthwith into France, to assure the King that all things were
ready on their side to begin the War; that they expected nothing but his
Majesty's coming, and that they would readily send their forces to meet him, to
the end that they might with more safety and speed fall upon any enterprise.
But this mean while, those that were banished the Kingdom, assembled themselves
together in great numbers in many places, and did much molest the Imperialists,
and Renzo promised good success if he were furnished with moneys, and some
foot. To which purpose, he had sent away Expresses sundry times into France, to
represent the State of affairs, and to desire aid; which though they were
promised to be speedily sent with the Fleet, yet the time of sending them was
prolonged, to the great prejudice of the League, whereby the Imperialists had
time afforded them to re-order themselves, and to increase their forces, and
won much favor with the Barons, and people of the Kingdom, by the fame of
Cesar's coming with such great warlike preparations; many desiring to purchase
his favor, either to provide for their own safeties, or else to get honors
and immunities. The Prince of Orange went therefore into Abruzzo, recovered
Aquila and Matrice, and opportunely got an hundred thousand Ducats by way of
Tax, out of the Country people, to pay the Army; yet the Imperialists did not
prosper much in Puglia, for a secret Treaty which they held in Berletta, was
timely discovered, so as it proved vain, and Gialio da Napoli, a captain of
some foot companies, together with some of the Towns Citizens, was put to death
for it. Moreover, the Venetians had caused some Soldiers to come from Greece
on horseback, who joining with Simeone Romano, made many sallies out of the
Towns, whereby they secured the Country, and kept the way open for the coming
of victuals, and drove Pignatello, Count de Borollo, from those confines; who
though he were very daring and forward for any action, could not with his light
Horse which he had picked up in the Country, resist the Grecians, who were much
better at that discipline, and sort of Militia: The Marquis of Goasto, who was
come with a regulated Army to take Monopoli, after the loss of much time, and
many men, was forced to retreat to Naples; and since this action was very
remarkable, it may not be displeasing to hear it more particularly related.

A little before the Marquis was come into Puglia, notice was had thereof* and
of what design he had in hand; wherefore Commissary Vetturi came with two
Galleys to Monopoli, bringing with him a Garrison of five hundred Foot,
commanded by two Captains, Richardo da Pesigliano, and Felice de Perugia.
Andrea Gritti was sent from Venice thither, to be the chief Magistrate, and the
Counts of Montebello and Carpenna, were here before, with some number of
Soldiers. These being very confident, fell diligently to make platforms, to
secure the Walls, to munite the Town the best they could every where, and to
prepare for defense: and amongst other things, they placed two pieces of
Ordnance, called Falcons, upon two Steeples, putting sacks of Wool about them,
to the end, that they might not be overthrown by the enemies shot, which proved
very advantageous to them, The Imperial Army being drawn nigh, the Marquis
himself advanced with some of his Troops to discover the situation; against
whom Pietro Frascina came immediately out, and skirmished with him a good
while, with alike fortune and valor: the Marquis began afterwar^s to make
Trenches, that he might approach nearer the wall, being necessitate for want of
earth, to make use of faggots made of Olive Trees, wherein that Country did
very much abound, and to keep commerce from between those of the Town, and the
Galleys, which afforded those of the Town many conveniences, and from whence
fresh supplies might be had; he, with much labor to the soldiers, made a
^^ort be quickly erected upon the Sea side, which before it was fully
furnished, was thrown down by shot from the Galleys, which played very
violently upon it, and a Bastion was by them built, and muni^ed n^ar the Haven,
so as they that were within, had always the way open by Sea, and Camillo O^sin^
had opportunity to come from Trau^ to the relief of the Town, who amongst
others, brought Ang^lo Sa^tocorto along with him, a very bold man, and a great
ma^^^ o^ artificial Fireworks: who coming into the field with some few (...),
for fire upon several places of the enemies Trenches, at one and the some time;
which finding matter to nourish it (for they were made of faggots, as has been
said) they were almost all of them quickly destroyed, and the labor of many
days was lost; so as a long time was required to re-make them, and those who
wrought upon these works, were likewise much damnified by the Artillery, which
playing from the Steeples, hit those who lay unsheltered in the fields. But the
Camp being at last got near the Walls, the enemy began to batter, wherewith
they made many breaches in the Wall, which were notwithstanding made up again
in the night by those that were within, who with singular industry and labor,
made use of the materials which were cast into the ditch to throw it down, so
as no place was left to make an assault: for the Cit^zens flocked readily with
the soldiers, to all military actions, insomuch as the very women were not
wanting in generosity, but getting upon the walls, encouraged the soldiers,
and brought of their own proper means refreshment to them, yea, even their very
beds to better munite the Rampires; so as though a great part of the Wall was
thrown down by the Artillery, insomuch as they might have entered on horseback
through the breaches, yet the Marquis durst not bring his soldiers to the
battle.

But at last overcome with tediousness, and want of many things, he resolved to
hazard an assault, wherein he met not only with stout resistance by those
within, but was beaten back, and lost many of his men: So as it behoved to
enlarge his Camp, and to think of getting the Town by Siege. But the Soldiers
meeting with many inconveniences by this delay, and their pay coming in but
slowly, they beg^n to mutiny; and chiefly the Italian Foot the most whereof
disbanded, and (...) into Monopoli, where they were willingly taken into pay by
the Venetians: But least they should incommodate the Siege, they were sent by
Sea to Trani; in which transportation three Galleys were lost by a violent
storm at Sea. And when news of this Shipwrac^ came to the camp, some of the
Spanish foot Companies went out to plunder the wracked goods, which were
afterward recovered by the other Italian Soldiers of the Garrison of Trani.
But the Siege continuing, Vetturi was of opinion that they might do well to
assault some of those Towns which were possessed by the Imperialists, (to do
the which those of Otranto, who were already up in arms offered themselves, if
they might be assisted) and thereby make the Enemy raise their camp, and
betake themselves to defend their own affairs. But this advice being
communicated to Renzo da Ceri, he thought it would be better to take in as many
Soldiers as they could into Monopoli, from whence they might sally out at
unawares and assault the Enemy within their camp, their Army being become very
weak by the departure of the Italian foot, and by the weariness of the Dutch.
To this purpose the Prince of Melfi being come to Monopoli, with 2000 foot,
whom the Marquis had labourd very much both by persuasions and offers though
all in vain, to draw over to side with the Imperialists: The Besieged sallying
out one morning early before the Sunrising, assaulted the Enemies Camp
furiously on several sides; and fighting in the Trenches, though they could not
overcome them, did them notwithstanding much prejudice; for they were often
forced to send fresh Soldiers to supply their places who were slain. But they
could not as yet make them dislodg, their situation and their Rampires being
very strong. But not long after, the Marquis understanding that the Venetians
were preparing great store of Galleys, to bring more Soldiers and Ammunition
into the Town, desparing of any good success, he gave over that enterprise, and
retreated with his men to Conversa, and so to Naples.

Thus the Confederates began to have some better hepes by reason of the Marquis
his retreat, and by the valient defense of Monopoli: So as many Barrons, and
others, repenting that they had adhered to the Imperial party, grew ready for a
new rebellion; which encouraged the confederates to make some new attempt.
Wherefore the Venetian Senate, finding that their Fleet was like to ly long
idle at Corfu, expecting the coming of the French Fleet, whereof they heard no
certain tidings, and which was very slow in preparing; they ordered the General
to pass into Puglia, whither being come with a good many Galleys, he lay before
Brandizzi, hoping that by reason of the affection which the Inhabitants bore to
the Venetians, he might easily win that Town, as he did: And receiving it upon
Articles, preserved it from sacking, and from being injured by the Soldiers;
and he made Giovan Francisco Iustiniano Governor for the Town, to keep it for
the Commonwealth. He fell then suddenly to besiege Castelli, the particular
care whereof, was committed to Camillo Orsino, who playing upon it and
begirting it on all sides, had brought it to a bad condition; yet hoping to see
the Emperors Fleet quickly in those Seas; they held out.

This mean while the Venetian Fleet infested the Sea, even to Capo d' Otranto,
to the great prejudice of the Imperialists. In this action Simone Romano was
slain, a bold and valiant man, and one who had done much service to the League,
and won much praise to himself in many actions. At this time General Pesaro
fell very sick, wherefore he got leave of the Senate to retire unto Corfu, to
be cured; and Vicenza Cappello was chosen in his place, to retain the same
degree, and Authority until Pesaro should be well: Who recovering sooner then
was expected, Capello came not as then unto the Fleet, but the next place was
reserved for him, upon the first occasion.

Things being in this condition, the Prince of Orange, knowing that the
confederates forces were not so weak as to be wholly driven out of the Country,
nor so strong as that they could do any thing of much importance; or were it
that Caesar desired that the Popes satisfaction should be preferred before all
other respects, that he might have him his friend and confederate when he
should come into Italy; resolved, after he had put Garrisons into the most
considerable places, to go with the rest of his men toward Perugia, to drive
Malatesta Baglione out of that City, and then to go into Tuscany, to put the
Medici into their Country again. Wherefore the Duke of Urbine, apprehending
that these men would fall upon his State, went suddenly from the Army, to look
unto his own affairs, upon this so urgent occasion. The Venetians were much
displeased with this the Generals absenting himself at so unseasonable a time,
both in respect of their own great Interests, and for fear lest the French,
growing either really jealous, or picking some fained suspicion out of this
accident, would grow the cooler in making their provisions for War.

The Senate therefore resolved, to send Nicolo Tiepolo forthwith to the Duke
(who was intended to have been sent unto him, to the camp) to acquaint him with
the new conduct of affairs, and earnestly to entreat him in the name of the
public to return immediately to the Army, and that he might the more willingly
do it, they sent him money to raise three thousand Foot, who were to guard his
State: But there was no need thereof at that time; for Orange understanding
that the Count de l ' Aquila, and Camillo Orsino called Pardo, having assembled
many of their neighbors together, were come to C^muli, and that their numbers
increasing every day, it was feated they would make some considerable
commotion, changed his mind, and would not as then go out of the Kingdom,
fearing some greater insurrection, by reason of the many extortions which the
people suffered under; who in that respect began to hate and detest the name of
a Spaniard: Wherefore he thought it best first to suppress these, reserving his
former purpose till another time; this suspicion being over, the Duke of Urbine
came forthwith to the Army, and as soon as he came, resolved to march therewith
to Milan, Monsieur de S. Paul having let him know that he meant to do so too.
They were hereunto invited by the Imperials straits, and by the good success of
the French; for though two thousand Spanish Foot were come to Milan, who were
first intended for the relief of Genua, the Genueses refusing to receive them,
their inconveniences were as much increased by their coming, as their forces,
for they were to be paid and fed, though there was great scarcity of moneys:
And on the contrary, many Towns beyond Tassino had surrendered themselves, at
this time to Monsieur de S. Paul, so as almost all that Country was reduced
(to his great honor and convenience) under his power. Both these Armies met at
Borgo S. Martino, five miles distant from Milan, where having long debated how
they were to prosecute that expedition, it was resolved, that they should
incamp about the City of Milan with two Armies, to the end they might begirt as
much of the wall as they could, and weaken the Enemy by making them defend
several places at once. But the Commanders were not so forward not diligent as
was requisite to effect this advice; for the French said there were fewer Foot
in the Venetian camp, then they had thought, and then what ought to be: So as
the forces being divided, each part would be too weak, and not without danger.
And on the other side, the Venetians showing that they had made good their
articles better then the French had done, said, they would see them first
encamped, and that then they would do so likewise; for they feared very much
what the French would do, having formerly observed in them a settled
resolution, to mind the business of Genua, and set all things else aside,
affirming that they had Orders from the King so to do. Wherefore much delay
being used on both sides, and the former resolution, wherein they found many
doubts and difficulties, being as it were, of it self revoked, the Armies
parted. Monsieur di S. Paul went toward Laudriano, the Duke of Urbine took up
his first Quarters at Montio, and the Duke of Milan went with an intention of
carrying his men into Pavia. From which places each of them playing their parts
severally, in blocking up the ways, infesting the Country, and by keeping
Antonio da Leva from victuals, they thought they might be able to suppress him,
and at last to compass their ends (though by another way) of possessing
themselves of Milan and Como; which were the only two places of importance
which held for the Emperor in the Dukedom of Milan. But the French were not
well got to their Quarters when they sent word, that they would go (as it was
before suspected) to Genua, being much solicited thereunto by Cesare Fregoso;
who weighing affairs as he could wish them, told them that the business would
be soon and easily effected; so as they believed they should soon return to the
same Quarters; and desired the Duke of Urbine, that he would tarry the mean
while with his men, and those of the Duke of Milan, where they were, or
thereabouts, to do what was formerly designed, not permitting the Besieged to
be relieved. The French Army, rising then with this intention the first day of
June, marched toward Pavia, which Leva being by his Spies advertised of, he
resolved to pursue them, and if occasion should serve, to fight them. It was
either his fortune, or rather the small experience of the Enemy that favored
his forwardness; for the French Army marched, divided into two parts, the one
of which, led on by Count Guido Rangone, who commanded the Van, Artillery, and
Carriages, was advanced eight miles before the other, which was slow in
following them. Wherein was Monsieur de S. Paul, who commanded the Battle, and
Claudio Rangone who ruled the Rear. When Leva, who advanced all in one body, in
good Order, and very quietly, was got very near the Enemy, he found their
disorder, and his own advantage, so as he resolved to fight them, and ordered
that the Light Horse should hasten to fall on upon the French rear: which was
scarcely got two miles from their quarters, and looked for nothing less: so as,
being all of them astonished and confused, at the unexpected accident, they
easily grew into disorder: whereby the enemy coming presently up to the Foot of
the Van, and charging them with their Light Horse, they forced the French to
retreat. But Monsieur de St. Paul standing firm, and in good order with the
battle, did valiantly resist the violence of the enemy for a good while: the
combat being made on all sides with much courage, and equal fortune: But when
Leva came in with the rest of the Army, wherein were the old Spanish Soldiers,
the French began apparently to give back, and at last to run. Many were slain
in the conflict, many taken prisoners, amongst which Monsieur de St. Paul
himself, whilst despairing of good success, he sought to escape the enemy by
running away. Some other escaped by flight into several places, and chiefly
into the Venetians State, wherein they were readily received, and well treated.

The Duke of Urbine hearing of this success, and knowing, that to tarry where
he was, was to no purpose, and not without danger, went from Montia, to return
to his former quarters at Cassano; which was much commended by the Senate, and
proved luckely. The Duke proceeded with much circumspection in his retreat, for
the safety of his Army, wherein was as then about five thousand Foot, four
hundred Curassiers, seven hundred Lighthorse, and many Carriages. He marched by
the upper way, endeavoring to keep the enemy on the left hand, on which side
he kept a great company of Harquebusiers to back the battle. He divided his
whole Army into three squadrons, but so ordered, as each of them might
commodiously succor the other, and be by them succored. The light horse,
traversing the Country, watched the enemies ways, that they might give timely
advertisement thereof to the General: and by this diligence the Duke brought
himself, together with all his men, and Carriages, safe to their quarters at
Cassan: which is a place seated near the river of Ada, which was on his back,
whereupon there was a bridge made, to pass over into Giaradada, and to the end
that victuals might be brought from several parts to the Camp, the quarter was
every where environed, and fortified with safe works, having but one way only
open unto it, which was likewise well munited. This was thought to be a very
covenient seat, since from thence they might relieve Lodi, and Pavia, and as
occasion should serve, offend the enemy, defend the Territories of the
Commonwealth; and upon need favor the enterprise of Genua: wherefore the Duke,
thinking that he might keep there with much safety, and honor, would not admit
of Ianus Maria Fregoso's opinion, and the like of some other Captains, who
advised, that the Army might be brought into Brescia, and thereby not exposed
to danger; they being much inferior in numbers to Leva's men, who being
encouraged by his Victory, and desirous to quite overthrow the Confederates
forces, pursued the Duke of Urbine, and had taken up his quarters at Vasri,
some two miles distant from the Venetian quarters, which caused our men to
fear, that they would pass over the Ada, to destroy the Territories of Brescia,
Bergamo, and Crema; but the Duke relied much upon his Light Horse, which were
more in number then the enemies, and exceeded them much in worth and
discipline: who scouring all the adjacent parts, did not only disturb the
carrying of victuals to the Imperial Camp, but had caused such terror, as none
of them durst stir out of their Trenches. The Duke resolved therefore to tarry
still in that quarter, to preserve his reputation, and to make use of the
Provisions of the neighboring Country, for the service of his own Army, which
otherwise would have been left for the enemies use; whereas, if he should have
retreated into the City, he should have wasted those Victuals which served for
the use of his Friends. But Fregoso grew daily more and more afraid, that if
the Army should tarry in those quarters, it might receive some notable
prejudice, which his mind was so full of, as it wrought upon his body, making
him fall grievously sick; to be cured of which malady, he was carried into
Brescia. Whilst the Armies were quartered thus near together, many skirmishes
past between them, wherein most commonly Leva's soldiers came by the worst;
who desirous to repair himself by some more considerable action, sent Cesare da
Napoli with three thousand Foot beyond the river Ada, to plunder the
Territories of Brescia and Crema: which, the Duke of Urbine having notice of,
he left Count Giazzo with the Camp, and went, with some of his Soldiers, to
lie in Ambush near the place where he knew that the enemy was to pass the
river: and suffering some of them to pass over, he fell unlooked for upon the
rear, who were yet upon the banks, having sent the Light Horse back to block up
the way, that the enemy might not escape back to their own quarters. Cesare da
Napoli, surprised by the unexpected danger, caused the bridge to be broken, to
keep the Duke from passing over to fight him: so as, the soldiers, who were
yet unpass'd, and were in number about one thousand five hundred, were either
slain, or taken prisoners. And it happened, that amongst the rest, a Spanish
Captain, was taken prisoner by a woman of a large stature, and manlike spirit,
who being clad in souldier-like aparrel belonged to the colors of Count
Giazzo; who sending one day, by way of sport, for the Spanish Captain, who was
taken prisoner, to come before him, he showed him Malgaretone, (so was this
woman called by the Soldiers) and told him, that this was the soldier whose
prisoner he was; the Spaniard, looking upon her, said, that he had comforted
himself in this his misfortune, in his being made prisoner, by a valiant man,
as she seemed to be: but when he knew, the was a woman, being overcome with
shame and disdain, he dyed of very grief within a few days. The Armies kept
many days after within their quarters. But the Duke, consulting with his
soldiers, wherein several things were propounded, desired very much so to
incommodate the Enemy, as to make him forsake his quarters, and at last he
resolved, having some advantage, and using Art and military discipline, to
bring Leva to a battle. He therefore placed all his Artillery only in one
place; from whence he went forth with all his Foot and horse, carrying only
three pieces of Artillery along with him; intending to leave them behind, and
to retreat as soon as the skirmish should be begun, seeming to do so out of
fear and necessity; so as, when the enemy should advance to get the Canon, he
might disorder them by shot of Canon from the Camp, which, if it should happen,
he would sally out again, and fall upon the enemy with greater violence, when
they should be disordered and in confusion. But this could not be done as it
was first projected: for Count Giazzo, being too far advanced with some of his
Foot, and the ba^^^ being begun a great way off his quarters, and not being
able to make his party long good with those few soldiers which he had, he was
forced to retreat in some disorder, though in his own person he behaved himself
gallantly. So as, it behoved the Duke, seeing him in distress, to advance
speedily with the rest of his men to relieve him; which he did with such
resolution, as the Imperial Foot, who were at first so forward in pursuing our
men, retired to their quarters in great disorder, being still followed and
damnified by the Venetians. Leva lost in this action above one thousand five
hundred Foot, so as, he durst not send his men any more out of his Camp, nor
attempt any thing; but was much perplexed, being full of thoughts and
difficulties. He could not tarry longer where he was for want of Victuals,
wherein he suffered very much: nor could he hope, though he suffered so much,
to get any good: he thought it stood not with his honor, to retreat to Milan,
which would be, as much as to say, he did it for fear, and being driven away by
a much lesser number of Enemies, to enter into the Venetian State, was to small
purpose, and not without much danger, all their Towns being very well
garrisoned: and on the other side, the inhabitants of Milan were very
exceedingly discontented, and ready to despair, by reason of the Soldiers
extortions, and injurious proceedings: Insomuch, as they had a great
inclination to mutiny, all of them crying out aloud for their Duke; who was
then with his men in Cremona; nor did they doubt, but that the Venetians, being
very desirous to see him reinstated, would be willing to hazard their Forces,
if they might see any hopes thereof. But at last, Leva being almost enforced so
to do, retired to Milan. Who being gone, the Duke of Urbine's desire was, to
remove his quarters nearer Mousa. But the Senate being somewhat jealous, that
Sforz^ negotiated some agreement with the Emperor: which, if it should prove
so, the way would be so blocked up, as their Army could not succor Bergamo;
they thought it better, that he should go with his army to Lodi, that they
might the better discover the Duke of Milan's mind. But, whilst these things
were in Treaty, the news increased every day, of the coming of the Dutch Foot,
and that they were to enter into the Territories of Verona, to join with Leva;
the Senate resolved, to bring all their Forces so within the Cities of their
own Dominions. Wherefore the Duke of Urbine, having received such orders,
retired with part of his Army into Brescia, and Count Gaiazzo went with the
rest into Bergamo: the Duke having, by the opinion of all men, won great
praise, and the renown of being a valiant and expert Commander, in all these
actions. But Ianus Fregoso growing still sicker, and his Melancholy humor
increasing, for that he saw, the affairs of the Camp proceeded so much
differing from his opinion, dyed within a few days, to the great grief of the
Venetians, who had been very well pleased with his loyalty and dexterity; which
they witnessed sufficiently, by conferring honor upon his three sons, making
Cesare General of their Light Horse, Alexander Conductor of their Curassiers,
and Hannibal a Colonel of Foot.

At this very time, there was continual negotiation of agreement had between
the Emperor and the King of France, wherein Margaret of Austria, Cesar's Aunt,
was the chief stickler, whom he had authorized to treat of Peace, and to
conclude it: Wherefore she having sent several Agents to the Court of France;
and the business being already begun, the King thought good, before any further
proceedings should be had therein, to send his Chamberlain Leluzb^iardo to her
into Flanders, to see Cesar's Commissions, and to examine whether they were
really such as were sufficient to conclude a business of such weight and he
finding them to be very ample, the King likewise destined to send his Mother to
Cambray, where she might meet with the Lady Margaret, and negotiate, and
stipulate the particular conventions of Peace between these two Princes. The
King did not acquaint the Venetian Senate with these Treaties, till it was very
late, when by the departure of Queen Mother to the Diet at Cambray, it could be
concealed no longer; nor did he then communicate any particulars unto them, but
did only promise, he would come to no agreement with Caesar, without their
consent and knowledge, and the like of the other Confederates: and afterward,
by endeavors which showed him to be very well affected toward the
Commonwealth, he exhorted to universal peace; which being (as he said) to be
treated of at the Diet, he desired that the Ambassadors who were at his Court,
might have Commissions sent them to conclude it. But the Senate, though they
were very jealous of the King's courses, by these proceedings; the rather, for
that they found he had long cunningly nourished them with hopes of his coming
in person into Italy, or of sending powerful forces both by Sea and Land, and
that yet he had done none of all this; the King forbearing to do so, for fear
of disturbing this Treaty, and expecting what the end thereof would be; yet to
show that they had still the same mind which they ever had to peace and
agreement, they resolved to send commissions, and authority to their two
Ambassadors, who were yet together in the Court of France, Giustiniano, and
Navagiero,, to intervene, and promise in the name of the Commonwealth, what
should be fitting to the Treaty of peace. But Navagiero having been very sick,
was dead before this Order came to France, which was a great loss to the
Commonwealth, and much lamented by them all, for he was a very learned
Gentleman; and when he betook himself to the management of public affairs, he
showed great ingenuity and wisdom: Giustiniano remained then alone to negotiate
this Treaty, who received particular instructions from the Senate, which in
brief were:

That all things contained in the agreement of the year 23. should be
punctually observed, and likewise, that whatsoever had been formerly promised
and confirmed in the Diet at Worms, should be effected; for in the not
observing of these things, the difficulties between the Commonwealth and the
House of Austria did depend: but chiefly, that whatsoever should become of the
Agreement, the restitution of the State of Milan to Francisco Sforza, should
primarily and principally be regarded.

But the Ambassador had no occasion to make use of these Instructions; for
though he followed the Queen to Cambray, yet he kept for the most part at St
Quintains, some few miles from thence, nor was he made acquainted with the most
important particulars of the Treaty. Wherefore the Senate began to be still
more afraid, that the King would mind himself only in the Agreement, without
any consideration of their, or of the Confederates Interests; and that his
promise not to come to any Agreement without them, was made, not with any
intention to keep it, but least the Confederates should prevent him, and by
accommodating their affairs with Caesar, should make his Agreement the harder,
and less advantageous. To this purpose, the King had likewise sent the Bishop
of Tarba to Venice, to treat of the particular provisions for War; the which
the less he intended, the more did he seek to advantage himself thereby in the
Treaty of peace, that the contrary might be believed: And soon after, Theadore
Trivultio being come to Venice, by order from the King, required the Senate to
deposite the Cities of Ravenna and Cervia in his hands, till some accommodation
might be found in that business; affirming, that he did it to make the Pope
declare himself, since it was a thing of great moment, to have him on their
side, if he should come himself in person into Italy; to which, answer was
made, that for as much as concerned his coming, the Commonwealth would in no
wise be wanting in lending such assistance as they had often promised; to
witness the which, they would be content to send twenty thousand Ducats by way
of Impressed for the first payment, to Susa, or to Asti: but touching the
assignment of the Towns in Romagna, that if the Universal Peace should be
treated of in the Diet at Cambray, that was likewise to be decided, together
with the other difficulties; and that the Senate would not be against such a
deposition, when they should see their affairs in a safe condition, and when
all other differences should be accorded.

But discovering the King's cunning, and contrary intentions in these
intercessions, they very much longed to hear the result of the Diet at Cambray.
The Senate therefore ordered their Ambassador in England, Lodovico Faliero,
that he should mediate with King Henry, who had always been a friend to the
Commonwealth, to take upon him the protection of the Republique, as he had
formerly done, when things went hardest with her, and endeavor, that in what
should be treated off in the Diet at Cambray, nothing should be concluded which
might prove prejudicial to her, nor to the Liberty of Italy, whereof he for
many years past, had to his infinite praise, been a particular Defender.

Whilst these things were in treaty, Caesar, who for all this negotiation of
peace gave not over thinking, nor preparing for his coming into Italy, came to
Genua, accompanied with many great Lords, with thirty five Galleys, and eighty
other vessels, having brought with him eight thousand foot, and a thousand
Horse from Spain, which he caused to be landed at Savona, that they might pass
the more easily into Lombardy. It was not easy to discern then what his design
was; for he had still constantly given out, that he came into Italy to settle
peace in her, and to accommodate his differences with all the Italian
Potentates; yet he was very diligent in increasing his forces, raising many
Soldiers from all parts, and giving order that all his men should meet in that
place where he himself should be in person: and resolving to go to Piacenza, he
sent forthwith to have his Lodgings prepared there. Leva had at this time
twelve thousand foot with him, the Prince of Orange was gone from Naples with
seven thousand to Spoleti, whither the Popes men were come: Ten thousand Dutch
foot began to fall down from Trent, into the Territories of Verona, which were
raised in the County of Tirol, and those that were lately come from Spain were
eight thousand. So as when all these should be met together, the Emperor would
have about forty thousand foot in his service, besides Horse, whereof the
number was not small; the Dutch foot being accompanied with ten thousand
Burgonian Horse. The Italian Princes grew mightily afraid of this so very great
power, which increased by the fame that was given out, (though the King of
France continued to affirm the contrary) that peace was agreed upon between him
and Caesar in the Diet at Cabrai, all the other Colleagues being excluded. Only
the Pope, measuring the danger according to the present state of affairs,
thought himself safe, by reason of the particular agreement made with Caesar at
Barcellona, which till now was kept secret; nay he thought to make use of the
Imperial forces, to satisfy his desire, and particular ends, in placing his
Nephews in their former power and authority in Florence, as it was agreed upon
before between him and Caesar. Wherefore for the Emperors greater honor, he
sent three of the principal Court Cardinals to meet him at Gen^a, and to be
assistant to him. The Florentines, who were in the greatest and most present
danger, sent also their Ambassadors soon after to Caesar to curry-favour with
him, and to understand his will, excusing themselves for having entered into
confederacy against him; for that it behooved them therein to follow the Popes
authority and commandment, and showing themselves ready to adhere unto him. But
these men having brought no public commission to accommodate the differences
which depended between the City and the Pope, and Caesar continuing firm in his
resolution, to keep his promise made to the Pope, and to give him all manner of
satisfaction, this Embassy proved to no purpose, and their affairs continued
in their former condition. Other Princes of Italy sent also their Ambassadors
desiring friendship, and fair correspondence; only the Senate of Venice
persevered in their opinion of not coming to any agreement with Caesar, unless
forced by necessity. Not but that the Venetians would have been as glad of
concord as the rest, but because they thought that Caesar intended nothing less
then the Liberty of Italy; and that his end was to bring things to such a
condition, as that all the rest should receive Laws from him. Wherefore they
thought that to appear humble and submiss, served only to puff him up the more,
and to confirm him in his desire, and hopes of commanding all Italy. They
therefore thought it not fit to send their Ambassadors to him then; but they
gave way that the Duke of Millan, who desired their advice in this point, as by
conventions he was bound to do, might send his Ambassadors, because they
thought it might become him to do so, who was a Vassal of the Empire, and that
it might turn to the common good, by opening a way upon that occasion to the
accommodation of his own particular differences, upon which the conclusion of
the universal peace did chiefly depend: whereof since no well grounded hopes
did as yet appear, the Venetians who saw themselves left almost alone to
undergo all the danger, betook themselves with all industry and diligence to
provide for all such things as might secure their State the best they could
upon this so important occasion. They raised new foot to increase their Army
and their Garrisons, which between the one and the other arose to the number of
fifteen thousand. They made Francisco Pasquillio their Commissary General on
Terra firm^, giving him a particular charge to survey the strong Holds, and to
provide all necessaries for them. They took diverse chief Commanders into the
Commonwealths pay, amongst which Sigismond Malatesta, together with a thousand
foot, and two hundred Light Horse. And because the Dutch foot, advanced already
in great numbers from Bolzano, Commissary Giovan Contarini and Cesare Fregoso,
were put into Verona with a good Garrison. And because the greatest concernment
was to keep the other confederate Princes of Italy as firm to them as they
could, the Senate failed not to mind the Florentines thereof, to praise their
constancy, to exhort them to defend their Country, and the liberty thereof,
promising to give them what assistance the times would permit them to do; and
particularly, to make their men enter into the Territories of Piac^nza and
Parma, as soon as Caesar should be gone from thence, so to draw the Imperialists
who were in Tuscany, to the defense of those Cities.

They used the like endeavors with the Duke of Ferara, sending Marc Antonio
Veniero Ambassador to him, who was to witness the constancy of the
Commonwealth, in their resolution of defending the Common liberty, and their
particular good inclination toward the Duke and his State; whereunto as they
were joined by neighborhood, and many other respects, so would they never shun
running the same fortune with him:

That therefore they desired to understand what his pleasure and opinion was;
as knowing that in times of such difficulty, a great esteem was to be put upon
his friendship and advice. But they chiefly laid before him the danger of the
Florentines; saying, that as they were common to them all, so they ought all to
assist them; that they should remember what the Popes desires were, which would
be the more inflamed by what of prosperity should befall Florence; and that the
Pope would the more molest his State, and the like of all others, unto which he
laid any just pretentions.

The Duke seemed to take these Memorandums very well, and promised many things,
and particularly that he would maintain a good body of men, which he was
raising about Modena, which should not only be for his own defense, but for the
service of all the Confederates.

At this time the Agreement made at Cambrai, was published, wherein as it was
long before commonly said, none of the Confederates were comprehended; only
place was reserved for the Venetians to be admitted thereinto, if within a
short space the differences between them and Caesar should be reconciled; which
was nothing but a mere complement; they being in effect totally excluded, since
the greatest difficulties remained still undecided.

The King of France was obliged amongst other things, to make the Towns in
Puglia which were possessed by the Venetians to be restored to the Emperor;
which if they should refuse to do, he was to declare himself their Enemy, and
help the Emperor to recover them by force. Which Article being to be put in
execution, the King sent his Ambassadors to Venice, to require the Senate that
they would cause the Towns which they possessed in Puglia, to be delivered up
to Caesar, as he was bound to do by the conventions at Cambray; alleging that
he did this in observance of the League made at Cugnack, wherein that was
comprehended: And he further added, that he did so much rely upon the affection
which the Commonwealth had always shown to the Crown of France, as if they
were not bound thereunto by Agreement, he was persuaded he might obtain it of
them by way of mere gratification; the occasion and thing it self being of so
great weight, and that without it he could not have his Sons, who were to
succeed him in his Kingdom, set at liberty by Caesar.

To this the Senate answered, That they did still continue that good affection
toward the King, and Crown of France as they had done for many years past; and
would still do so for the future; the Commonwealth being almost indissolvably
knit fast to the Kingdom out of many common interests. That they could not deny
but that they had very much desired their Commonwealth might have been
comprehended in the Agreement made with Caesar; not only to the end that their
safety might have been provided for, but that none might have doubted of the
good intelligence had, and held between the Venetian Senate, and Crown of
France. That notwithstanding they did confide much in the Kings goodness and
wisdom; that he would not be wanting to the good and honor of the
Commonwealth, by interposing his authority with Caesar, that her affairs might
be reduced to such safety, and tranquillity as they desired, and reason
required. But as concerning the restitution of the Towns in Puglia, it was
clear enough they were not thereunto bound out of any obligation; for since the
King had concluded peace with Caesar, without including the Common wealth, he
had freed them from that tie of confederacy, wherein it was agreed that the
King should not make any accord without them. Yet they desired to give
convenient satisfaction, even in this point, but that a fitting time might be
waited for, to do it; the rather for that his Sons were not to be set at
liberty yet these two months; in which time they hoped that some
accommodations might be found out between their and Cesar's differences,
whereby this might be ended with satisfaction to the King. To which purpose the
King sent the Admiral into Italy to Caesar, to exhort him to an universal peace,
and particularly to compose differencences with the Venetians; whereby he hoped
he should be able to make good the Articles of Cambray, by procuring the
restitution of the Towns in Puglia, having already as much as concerned him
begun to do so, by ordering Renzo da Cer^ to deliver up all Towns, and places
which he held under him; in the Kingdom of Naples, to the Impe^ialists; and had
endeavored that the Venetians would do the like but that they being first
advertized of the Senates pleasure, had refused to do it.

This was the present condition of the affairs of Italy; Caesar very powerful,
and in arms; the Pope his Friend, and Con^ederate; the other Potentates of
Italy, all of them almost for fear, to obey his will; the French driven fully
out of Italy; so as though they had not as yet laid down their arms, they were
bound by articles not to meddle with any thing concerning Italy, wherein the
Emperor might be prejudiced. Yet amidst all these difficulties the Senate kept
still their resolution of opposing Caesar, if he should (as it was thought he
would do) possess himself of the State of Milan. Wherefore the first
confederacy being broken with the rest, they did again ratify, and confirm it
by new obligations with Francisco Sforza, wishing him not to be wanting to
himself, but to hope well, for the Commonwealth would willingly serve him with
all their Forces.

At the same time Soliman, who had resolved to re-possess John King of Hungary
in his Kingdom, he being driven out of it by Ferdinando's forces, was entered
with a numerous and powerful Army into the confines of Hungary, and encamped
before the City of Buda; whereat the Inhabitants being mightily terrified, he
easily made himself Master thereof, and making his Cavalry overrun the
Campagnia of Austria, he plundered and wasted the Archdukes Country,
threatening to come with his whole Army to before Vienna, toward the which he
caused great preparation of victuals be made, and of warlike instruments, to be
brought to before that City by the River of Danubius. Caesar was greatly
troubled at this News, seeing his Brother imbroyl'd in so many troubles,
wherein he knew his own honor was concerned, and the safety of the Empire, if
he should suffer so powerful an Army to come so near him, whilst he being
busied about lesser affairs, should stand, as it were, an idle Spectator of so
sore dangers which threatened his Country, and himself too. Other occasions of
fear were likewise hereunto added; For he had received intelligence from his
brother, that the Heretical sects increased much in Germany; that they raised
forces, and that it was apparently seen they meant to put for novelty: which
pestiferous seeds, if they should not be rooted out, it was thought they would
soon bring forth malignant effects, to the great scandal of the true Catholic
Religion, and to the as much prejudice of the states of Temporal Princes, and
chiefly to that of the Empire.

These things being maturely considered, made the Emperor begin to think of
peace, and to make him really intend that, which it was thought he did at first
but seem to do. To forego Italy without having settled any of his affairs, was
neither for his honor, nor for his safety; and he knew he could not make
peace, though but for a while, without agreeing with the Venetians; upon whom,
whilst things were in this commotion, the state of Italy did depend; there
being no slight suspicion, that if the King of France could get the Venetians
to join with him, as either open Enemies, or but meanly satisfied with Caesar,
he would keep the articles of Cambray no better now that he had his Sons back
again, then he had done those of Madrid, when he himself was set at liberty.

Caesar having th^n for these reasons resolved to accommodate his differences
with the Venetians, and to establish the affairs of Italy by an universal
peace, he suffered this his will to be clearly understood, which made many
Personages of great authority, interpose themselves therein. Andrea Doria sent
Frederick Grimaldo to Venice, to offer his service in this treaty, saying that
he knew Caesar to be so well inclined to peace, as if the Senate would be
pleased that he should undertake the business, he hoped to bring it to a happy
end quickly. But the Senate neither accepting nor refusing this offer,
answered, That they had always endeavored peace, and did value the Emperors
friendship very much, as it became them well to do; and that they were still of
the same mind: But they desired to see some sign, whereby they might be
persuaded that Cesars real intentions were what they were affirmed to be; for
the tarrying of the Dutch foot still in an hostile manner in their State,
ransacking, and ruinating the Territories of Bresc^a, gave but small show
thereof. Soon after Sigismond dalla Torre, Chamberlain to the Marquis of
Mantua, came as Ambassador from him to Venice, to exhort the Senate likewise
to make peace with Caesar, affirming yet more constantly then Doria had done,
Cesars willingness to peace, and desiring them moreover that they would be
contented that the Treaty might be held in the City of Mantua, whither he knew
that Caesar would presently send his Agents with commissions to that purpose.
And he the Marquis offered his best service herein, as an Italian who was very
zealous of the Liberty of Italy, and as a friend to the Commonwealth.

Whilst these things were in Treaty, Caesar prepared to go to Bullognia to speak
with the Pope, according to the agreement made at Barcellona, which was chosen
for the place of meeting instead of Genua, as being more commodious for the
Pope, and more convenient for Cesars designs. Upon this interview the
resolution of many important things was to depend. Wherefore the eyes of all
men were upon the result thereof, especially of the Venetians, whose Interests
were of most importance, and involved in greatest difficulty. The Pope seemed
to consider very much the safety and convenience of this Commonwealth, and that
he might purchase the better belief, he endeavored very much by the means of
Cardinal Marco Cornaro, to persuade the Senate to lay down Arms, and to come to
^ome fair composition: and he had formerly sent the Bishop Vacenence his Nuntio
to Caesar; who as it was thought, had helped very much to bring the Emperor to
be of the good mind he was in, to make peace with all men, especially with the
Venetians. This was the cause why many of the Senators, proceeded with more
reservedness in this negotiation, expecting what the issue of the meeting at
Bolognia would be; but others we^e for accepting of the proposition made by the
Marquis, and for the choosing of Ambassadors immediately to send to Man^ua, to
treat of an agreement.

What is it (said these men) that we can expect more? Caesar is very strong in
Fo^ces, the Forces of the League are broken, weakened, scattered, or rather
dissolved; the Florentines, the Duke of Milan, and we, are all that are left to
sustain the bur^hen of so great a War: A thing altogether impossible, in
respect of the weakness whereinto we are all reduced, by so many expenses, and
in respect of the great Forces and dependances which Caesar has in Italy at
this time; yet in such a d^sparity of Affairs, whilst his hopes increase every
day, and ours grow less, Caesar is content to treat with us upon equal terms;
nay I may say, to humble himself, and to be the first that propoun^s friendship
and peace; and shall we refuse, or not value these invitations? No man can with
reason doubt, but that the things promised first by Doria, and afterward by
the Marquis of Mantua, are not only done by the consent of Caesar, but by his
express Order, since no man meddles in things of this nature between so great
Princes, especially with such asseverations of their good will, without good
grounds: And shall it be thought wisely done, to suffer an occasion slip out of
our hands, of doing that which we have so often desired, and which we ought now
to desire more then ever in a thousand respects? We have been for these many
years in a continual War, wherein we have spent above five millions of Gold: So
as this City, and our whole State, is almost oppressed, all our means consumed;
and yet when the way is opened unto us of finding some repose and quiet, with
safety of our honor, and with provision, as it may be hoped for, of security
to the Commonwealth, shall we be backward, and put our happiness to the
Arbitriment of fortune, which may (as it often times falls out) cause some such
accident arise, as may make Caesar alter his mind? And either tarrying armed in
Italy, increase our present danger, or if he shall go from hence, and leave
things unquiet and confused, oblige us to keep in War and trouble for as many
years more, and with as much expense, and God knows what the end will be? Those
who till now have praised the constancy of this Senate, in having, without any
consideration of expense, or fear of danger, been so zealous in the defense of
the common cause, and of the liberty of Italy, the very name whereof will cry
up the glory of the Commonwealth to posterity; seeing how much the face of
affairs is now altered, and that other counsels are to be required, then to
keep still the same course, and trust upon Arms, when our affairs may be better
provided for by negotiation; and that we may thereby arive at the true and
allowable end which thrust us upon War, may peradventure change their opinion,
and think us to be too haughty and obstinate, since we will not weigh things by
reason, but by our own will, and it may be, not over-wise, since we cannot
accommodate our selves to times and occasions, nor temperize in difficulty, and
expect better fortune. Advisedness is assuredly good and laudable, but it ought
to be kept within its due bounds, lest it fall into extremes, which are always
dangerous; for it is often seen, that as much harm accrews by too much
slowness, which makes men perpetually irresolute, as by too much haste; we have
hitherto kept excellently well from the latter, having maintained wars for so
many years, and tried all things possible, to bring our selves into a condition
of true safety and peace; let us now take heed lest we run into the other
extreme, lest whilst we covet too much security, and too much advantage, we do
sufficiently disadvantage our selves, and expose our affairs to greater dangers.

But others were of another opinion; these affirmed it would be more honorable
and more advantageous to expect a while, and not to seem too desirous of
agreement, they considered the unsettledness of Cesars Forces; they being in
great want of money, and victuals; so as the greater his Army was, the sooner
it was likely to dissolve; that all the strong Holds in their State were
excellently well garrisoned, nor could Caesar attempt any thing against them,
with hopes of bringing it soon to an end; moreover that Caesar was recalled into
other parts out of weighty respects, and of very great importance to himself,
and would be necessitated quickly to quit Italy; that Vienna was already
assaulted by the Turks, and was reduced to great straits: That all the rest of
his brothers Dominions, was overrun and wasted by the Enemies Cavalry: That
commotions of no small consideration began to be raised by the Heretics in
many parts of Germany, if they were not quickly allayed by Cesars Forces, and
by his presence; that when he should be gone from Italy, and his Army either
dissolved, or very much lessened, there was no doubt but that they might easily
make good the Dukedom of Milan, keep possession of their Towns in Puglia, and
in fine, prove victorious throughout the whole War, and reap thereby a glorious
name amongst all people, and in all ages: And whereas now they were to receive
such laws and conditions as would be given them by others, Caesar would be
compelled to endeavor, and accept of the Commonwealths friendship, upon terms
which would be advantageous for her; lest the French, who were always ready to
take up Arms, and to attempt Novelties, should go about to molest him, by
making new Leagues, whilst they saw him otherwise busied: That no man could
with reason believe Caesar would propound any conditions of agreement, out of
any affection which he bears to this Commonwealth, since he thinks himself
injured by us, for having for these many years adhered to France: But that it
was to be held for certain, it was his own Interest that moved him thereunto,
knowing upon how weak foundations his own affairs stood, and how impossible it
was for him to maintain an Army, and tarry any longer in Italy. That it is a
general rule, what is acceptable, and advantageous to an Enemy, is to be
shunned, as that which may produce contrary effects to the adverse party. That
this which had an appearance of humanity, and looked like a desire of peace and
quietness, was only a piece of cunning in the Imperialists, to conceal their
weakness, and to make it be believed that they intended the common good, when
they did only endeavor their own advantage. But suppose, said these men, that
we may do well for the present t^ agree with Caesar, it will be fitting at least
to expect what the result will be of the convention at Bullognia, where Cesars
mind and intentions may be better discovered, especially touching the
settlement of the Duchy of Milan, upon which the best grounded resolution of
peace ought to depend; by the obligation of ancient and new confederacy, and by
the disposition of the Commonwealth her self, introduced by many weighty
Interests: That it was also probable, that the Pope, though he were not very
well pleased with them as touching the towns in Romagna, would not
notwithstanding, for the Churches interest and his own, break the friendship
and peace between the Emperor and the Commonwealth (the safety and honor
whereof did finally result to the accommodation and grandezza of the
Apostolic See) as that also the present peace, would make for the business of
Florence, which the Pope did then so fervently endeavor, to the end that all
other respects and jealousies being laid aside, Caesar might for the Popes
satisfaction turn his Forces into those parts, and bring them to a sooner, and
a more certain end.

These reasons wrought much upon the minds of many men, who being now wonted to
War, were unwilling to lay down Arms, unless with great honor and safety to
the Commonwealth; insomuch as they did for that time forbear the choosing of
Commissioners to send to Mantua, to treat of peace, and resolved to send
Secretary Andrea Resso to the Marquis, To return their thanks for his offer,
and for the good Will which he seemed to bear to the Commonwealth; excusing
themselves for that they could not at the present resolve upon a Treaty, since
the Emperor and the Pope were to meet quickly at Bullognia, to find out an
accommodation for all the affairs of Italy; and for that Bishop Bosoniences,
the Popes Nunti^, had interposed himself in that business, and particularly in
what appertained to the Commonwealth.

This mean while the Pope being gone from Rome, went to Spoleti, and from
thence to Bullognia, to expect the Emperor, who came thither some few days
after the five and twentieth of October, which was the day the Pope entered that
City. As soon as they met, the Treaty of Peace began, both of them seeming
desirous to settle Italy in a firm condition of quiet. The first and most
important businesses to be accorded, were those which concerned the Duke of
Milan, who, after many former practices and endeavors, for which the
Protonotary Caracciole, and Don Garziadi Padiglia, were gone with several
propositions from Piacenza to Cremona, resolved (having formerly obtained a
safe conduct, and being counseled so to do by the Venetians, who for his
greater honor sent their Ambassador Mark Antonio Veniero to accompany him) to
go himself to Caesar in Bullognia, for one thing which made the business more
difficult, was, that Caesar took it ill that Francisco Sforza should not humble
himself to him, as it became a Vassal of the Empire to do, and that he did
negotiate his business either too arrogantly, or at least, distrusting too much
Cesars either justice or clemency.

The first thing which disturbed this Treaty, which was before brought near a
conclusion, was, that the Imperialists would have the Cities of Pavia and
Alessandria delivered up into their hands, as pledges for the observancy of
what should be agreed upon; which Sforza (following herein the counsel and
opinion of the Senate, who had put great Garrisons into those Cities, and had
lent the Duke ten thousand Ducats to maintain them) utterly refused to do; This
demand having renewed in him, and in the Venetians, their former jealousies,
that the Imperialists desired to appropri^te the State of Milan unto
themselves; wherefore the Pope desired those Cities might be deposited into his
hands, which the Duke said he could not do, without the consent of the
Venetians, alleging that it would be better to refer the discussion of his
cause to the convention at Bullognia: And thus he spun out the time, without
coming to any conclusion. When Sforza was come to Bullognia, where he was
graciously received by the Emperor, his business was brought to this
conclusion, the Pope interceding therein, to whom Caesar had promised, that he
would not dispose of the State of Milan, without his consent; that his cause
should be decided by Justice: Whereunto the Duke did more willingly consent,
then to any other proposal; to show that he relied upon his own Innocence, and
upon Cesar's Justice. But the Venetian Senate, seeing that the agreement with
the Duke of Millan (which had been the chief cause of beginning the war, and of
the continuance thereof,) was in a fair way of being concluded, sent
Commissions to Gaspero Contarini, who was their Ambassador with the Pope, to
treat, and conclude of peace, if they could agree upon particulars: they having
been very much, and with great expressions of love, solicited thereunto by the
Pope, who promised to interpose both his authority and favor with Caesar,
concerning this Treaty. The Ambassador Contarini, when he met the Emperor at
his first entrance into Bolognia, was very graciously received by his Majesty:
but nothing was as yet treated of, saving general civilities, which showed a
good inclination to friendship and peace. When the Ambassador had made it
known, that he had Commission from the Senate, to treat of an agreement, and
that therefore he desired to know, upon what terms it was to be made: The
Emperor seeming to correspond very much in a will and desire to peace, deputed
the Lord Chancellor Granville, and Monsieur di Prato, to this negotiation: in
which Treaty the Pope himself would intervene. At first there was great hopes
of coming to a speedy agreement: but when they drew near a conclusion, new
doubts and difficulties were started: which made it be believed, that but
little sincerity was intended therein: chiefly, for that, though many
endeavors had been had, the Imperialists could not be brought to remove the
Dutch Foot from the State of Venice, who continued still to the number of about
ten thousand in the Territories of Brescia, and did prejudice the Country much.
And moreover, twenty five Galleys being parted from Cevita Vecchia, to go for
Naples, it was publicly said, that these, together with four more which were
in that Haven, were ordered to go into Puglia. So as, all expenses and
provisions for war were still to be continued: not only keeping the land Army
entire, but the Fleet also: whereof part of the Galleys being proposed to be
disarmed, the Senate would not allow thereof, many of them being of an opinion,
that they were to renew the war more eagerly: and it was commonly affirmed,
that though the Emperor was well enough inclined to peace, yet this his good
intention was corrupted by many of his Councillors and Captains, and
especially by Antonio da Leva, so as, at the last he would be drawn to alter
his mind. Nor was the difference touching the Towns in Romania as yet
accommodated with the Pope, a thing which procured new matter of disagreement;
wherein there was somewhat of difference in the Senate it self: some being of
opinion, that they were to repose so much confidence in Caesar, as to put this
business to be decided by him, to the end, that he, as a friend to both sides,
might compose it. But others thought it better to negotiate this business with
the Pope's self: because they might either continue their possession of these
Towns, upon some recognition, or if they would resolve to part with them, they
might ingratiate themselves with the Pope, to the advantage of the
Commonwealth; making use of his favor and authority, in composing their
differences with the Emperor. Whereas if they should leave any authority
therein in the Emperor, they might be sure that he would prefer the Popes
satisfaction before any consideration of the Commonwealth. And this opinion
prevailed; so as the Pope continuing in his opinatracy, and the Senate being
unwilling that it should at any time be said, that for their own Interests they
had interrupted the common good of Christendom, and disturbed the hoped for
peace of Italy, when an universal peace was in treaty, they at last resolved to
restore the Cities of Ravenna and Cervia to the Pope, the rights of the
Commonwealth being preserved; and afterward in their treaty with the Emperor,
they were likewise content to restore the Towns in Puglia to him, having first
a promise from him that he would pardon all those who had adhered to them in
the times of War, and to deal well with them, cancelling the memory of what had
been past. Agreement was likewise made with the Duke of Milan, who was enjoined
to pay 500000 Ducates for his Investment, or being put into possession, and
300000 for the expenses of War; for pledge of which payments, the Imperialists
desired that the Castles of Milan, and Como might be delivered up into their
hands; but by the intercession of the Venetians, this desire was laid aside;
for they made it appear to the Imperialists that thereby the Duke would be made
the less able to raise the aforesaid moneys, or be necessitated to be the
longer in paying it; for doubtlesly the people of Milan, being extraordinarily
desirous to have their own natural Lord rule over them, would the more readily
apply themselves to undergo any taxations. Thus all things tended toward peace
and agreement; and it was hoped that Italy, after so many years of continual
Wars, would now be brought into a peaceable condition; and all men began to
rejoice, hoping to enjoy better times for the future: There remained nothing to
perfect this which was so much desired, but the accommodation of the
differences between the Florentines and the Pope, which appeared to be made the
more difficult by the present condition of the times, and by the agreement
which was made amongst the rest; for the Imperial army having proceeded very
slowly, after they came to the Confines of Tuscanie, which they did by orders
from the Pope, who desired to preserve the City of Florence, and the Country as
much as might be from being prejudised by the Soldiers; the Florentines had
opportunity to make the City more defenceable, by making several works about
the Walls, and by taking in of a Garrison of 2000 foot which Malatesta Baglione
brought with him thither, after he had yielded the City of Perugia upon
articles to the Marquis of Guasto; so as the Florentines began to grow the
harder to be brought to the Pope's will. The slowness of these proceedings at
the first, had begot a belief in the Florentines, that Caesar desired to satisfy
the Pope in resemblance more then in sincerity, and he would more consider the
interest of State (since the increasing of the Popes power did not at all
concern him) then the injury they had done him by siding with the French. But
on the other side, the Pope growing daily more and more incensed, for that the
City would not as he had desired them, put themselves upon his arbitriment,
though he had promised them to proceed with all humanity, and ingenuity; and
hoping to compass his desires so much the sooner, for that Caesar having now no
more occasion to employ his forces against the Venetians, nor Duke of Milan,
would turn with the greater force and readiness, to serve him in the business
concerning Florence; seemed rather desirous to use his utmost force against the
City, then to yield to any thing. The Venetian Senate was very much perplex at
these troubles and dangers of the Florentines, as being their friends and
confederates; but the Commonwealth was so over-burthened with disbursments,
still maintaining all her Forces, as she could not at the present assist them
answerable to their need. They therefore wished the Florentines to bring their
business to some reasonable conditions, if they could; and to agree with the
Pope upon such terms as might not be prejudicial to their liberties. But the
treaty of peace being as yet doubtful, the Senate in favor to the Florentine
affairs, as much as the time would permit them, and to cause jealousiein the
Pope, which might make him remove his men out of Tuscany; gave directions to
the Duke of Urbine, who had already mustered all their men, to above the number
of 10000, that he might be ready to march, and to give out that he was to go to
the confines of Parma; but after all these endeavors and proceedings, the
agreement with the Florentines, being (as aforesaid) the further off, by how
much the rest were likelyer to agree, the Marquis Guasto, who had already taken
Tortona, and Arezzo, received orders from Caesar, to advance with his army to
the Walls of Florence; other particular respects being added to his desire of
satisfying the Pope, to move Caesar to endeavor the return of the Medici into
their Country for having promised to give his natural daughter Margaret, in
Marriage to Alexander the Popes Nephew, he was the more obliged to do so, as
that his Son in law might have an Estate, answerable to the greatness of his
marriage. And moreover he thought it would make for the increasing and
confirming their power in Italy that the Government of that City which of her
self had always been much devoted to the French should for the future depend
upon him. Thus the whole War being brought into Tuscany, and to about the Walls
of Florence all the other parts of Italy were free and quiet; the Pope, the
Emperor, Ferdinand King of the Romans, and the Senate of Venice, having at
last ratified an Agreement upon these conditions.

That the Venetians should relinquish the Cities of Ceruia and Ravenna the
Apostolic See; and to the Emperor, Trani, Monopoli, and whatsoever they were
possessed of in Puglia, that all other Cities, Towns, and places, which were as
then in their possession, should remain under the Jurisdiction, and Dominion of
the Commonwealth; which was to enjoy them peacefully, and quietly. That the
Inhabitants who were in those Cities, and who had adhered to the Venetians,
might be suffered either to tarry there, or to go elsewhere; and that
wheresoever they should be, they might inj^y the goods which they possessed in
their countries: and particularly, that it might be lawful for such Venetian
Citizens, as had any possessions in these Territories, not only to enjoy their
Incomes, but to carry them whithersoever they should please, without being
subject to any prohibition or Tax. That the Venetian Citizens should also have
all those privileges, and immunities confirmed unto them, throughout the whole
Kingdom of Naples, which they had before enjoyed by the concession of the
former Kings; and that generally, free and safe abode and commerce, should be
allowed to all the Subjects of the Confederate Princes, in all their several
Dominions, and that they should be well dealt withal, and have Reason and
Justice done them, as if they were of the same Country where for the present
they did inhabit, or negotiate. That all past faults should be forgiven to
those, who during the time of War, after that Maximilian took first up Arms
against the Commonwealth, for having followed the Imperial faction; or had
either been accused and condemned for any thing thereunto belonging; and that
they should be restored to their Countries, and goods; except such goods as
were formerly confiscated, for which the Venetians promised to pay yearly 5000
Ducates. And that all faults should be forgiven to Count Brunoro di Gambara, by
name, and that he should be received into favor, who was then the Emperors
Chamberlain. That moreover the Venetians should pay unto the Emperor for what
remained unpaid of 200000 Ducates, promised at the agreement made the year
1523. 25000 Ducates within two Months, and the rest which should appear to be
due, within one year following: But upon express condition, that before the
disbursment of these moneys, those Towns and places should be restored to the
Commonwealth, which were thereunto due upon the same Articles; wherein if any
dispute should arise, the same should be determined by two Arbitrators, and one
Umpire. Moreover, the Venetians were contented to gratify Caesar with 100000
Ducates more within six Mone^hs; and that because the rights of the Patriarch
of Aquilegia were reserved in the Diet at Worms; wherein he pretended to be
injured in his jurisdiction by Ferdinand of Austria, that this cause should be
decided by two Arbitrators, and one Umpire, to the end, that the Patriarch
might be restored to what should be found due unto him: and that this agreement
might not only aim at the present peace of Italy, but to provide for the future
quiet and security thereof, each of the aforesaid Princes were bound to enter
into a perpetual League for the defense of each other, in as much as concerned
the Estates in Italy. And it was particularly expressed, that the Venetians,
and Francisco Sforza Duke of Milan, for whom the Emperor promised and stood
bound, should always have each of them five hundred Curassiers in readiness,
and that when either the Dukes state, or the Commonwealth, should be assaulted
by any Foreign Army, each should be bound to assist the other with eight
hundred Curassiers, wherein the foresaid five hundred were to be comprehended,
with five hundred Light Horse, and six thousand Foot, together with a
sufficient Train of Artillery, ammunition, and all the expenses thereunto
belonging, during the war: and that neither of them should grant passage,
victuals, or any other accommodation, to such as should intend prejudice to
either of them, but should use all the means they could to hinder them. And on
the other side, the Duke of Milan, and the Venetians, were bound to defend the
Kingdom of Naples from any assault that should be thereupon made by any
Christian Princes, with sixteen Galleys at their own expense. In this
capitulation, all the friends and confederates of these Princes were
comprehended, so as they should not prove enemies to any of the chief
contractors; and the Commonwealths of Genua, Sienna, and Lucca, the Duke of
Savoy, the Marquis of Mantua, and Marquis of Monferrat, were particularly
nominated by the Pope, by the Emperor, and by Ferdinando, and by the
Venetians, Antonio Maria Montefeltro Duke of Urbine. But with this difference,
that the Venetians were not bound to defend the States of the others, though
they were nominated: and the Duke of Urbine was comprehended in his person and
State, under the same conditions as were the chief contractors, as having a
dependancy upon the Commonwealth, and as being by her taken into protection.
Touching the Duke of Ferara, it was declared, that he was only understood to be
comprehended with the rest, when he should have accommodated the differences
which were between him and the Apostolic See.

Thus after so many vexations and long Wars, things were settled and
accommodated, and a certain and secure peace was made, to the great comfort of
the Subjects, and the no less praise of the Princes.

All men thought that this peace and agreement amongst the Christian Princes
was made at a very opportune time, so as they might jointly make head against
Soliman, who being wholly set upon the glory of War, and being encouraged by
the discords of the Christian Princes, was come with his forces against their
Kingdoms, threatening ruin. For though he was forced to rise from before the
Walls of Vienna, and freed her so from danger at that time, by reason that the
Winter came on, and that he had no great Train of Artillery, as also, for that
the City was defended by very many valiant Soldiers, yet he declared that he
would return the next Spring with greater forces, to assail that City, and
other Towns in Germany. Soliman at his departure from those consines, declared
John to be King of Hungary, showing that he aimed chiefly at the praise of
valor and generosity. He also made Luigi Gritti chief Treasurer of that
Kingdom* who was natural son of Andrea Gritti, Duke of Venice, born at
Constantinople, whilst Andrea being a young man, was there upon his own private
affairs. Luigi proved to be a very ingenious man, endowed with many noble
qualities; so as getting first into favor with Ebrahim, the chief Bashaw, and
of supreme authority in that Court, and afterward by his means, into the like
of Soliman, he had done the Commonwealth very good service in their last
troubles, by keeping them in friendship with the Turks; which was the more
requisite for them upon such occasions, for that the Haven by Sea lying open to
the City of Venice, whereby they trafique, and merchandising was preserved,
they had the better means to maintain War in Terra firma, whilst they
maintained the stock of their public revenews whole. But the Senate, as for
such respects they had been very careful to keep peace with the Turks, so with
a noble and generous mind, had they always refused the offers of assistance
made by them against Christian Princes, with which pious intention of theirs,
God being well pleased, he so favored the conclusion of Peace, as that a firm
foundation thereof being laid, the Commonwealth had been able to preserve her
self in honor and safety, even until this day.

PEace being made in manner as has been related, the Senate being desirous to
establish it, and to work themselves, as much as they could, into the favor
and good will of the Princes, showing themselves well affectioned toward them,
and how constant their desire was to preserve the peace of Italy, resolved to
send Ambassadors to the Pope, and to the Emperor, to witness the great
satisfaction which they had received by the agreement, and the desire which
they had to continue long peace and friendship with them. Those who were
deputed to this Embassy, were of the prime men of the Commonwealth, and of a
clear reputation for their own endowments, for the many places they had passed
through, both at home and abroad, Marco Dandalo, Luigi Gradinigo, Luigi
Mocenigo, and Lorenzo Braggadino; to whom, that the Embassy might appear the
more solemn, they added Antonio S^riano, who was with the Pope, and Nicolo
Tiepolo, who was to remain Liedger with the Emperor.

These six went all together in the beginning of the year 1530. to Bullognia,
where the Pope and the Emperor were as yet, by whom they were graciously
received, they delivered their Embassies severally, first to the Pope, and then
to the Emperor. They did not only praise the Pope, for having (as the common
Father) piously and prudently embraced the cause of Christendom, and put a
period to so many mischiefs and miseries, but they likewise thanked him in name
of the Commonwealth, for his particular care which he had therein of her, in
composing the differences between her and Caesar, and in freeing her from the
expense and troubles of War. They showed Caesar the necessity which had made
them take up Arms, and to continue the War, their being displeased at what was
past, but chiefly, their constant and firm resolution to make good the
agreement which was made, and their endeavors of perpetual friendship between
the House of Austria and the Commonwealth.

Though when the Ambassadors had delivered this, they had no more to do, yet
were they commanded to tarry in Bullognia, that they might be present at the
Emperors coronation, which was to be celebrated in that City. For Charles who
had first designed to go to Rome, to take the Imperial Crown upon him there,
according to the ancient custom of the Emperors, was resolved to accomplish
that ceremony in Bullognia, being called for back into Germany, upon other more
weighty State affairs, for which purpose, great store of people flocking
thither, and Ambassadors from all Princes, such an Embassy seemed to befit
that days solemnity and pomp, which was on the 24. of February; which being
over, the Ambassadors returned to Venice, being presented by Caesar with five
hundred pieces of Portugueses, to the value of ten crowns each piece, which
according to custom, were put into the Exchequer, for the public service. It
was wisely provided for by the first Founders of the Commonwealth, and
established by Law, that any who should be sent Ambassadors to foreign
Princes, and should receive any presents from them, they should bring them into
the public Bank, it being not thought convenient to refuse such
demonstrations of honor done to those who represented the Commonwealth, nor to
permit that such things as were given to public persons, should be converted
into private men's purses; which if they were permitted peradventure sometimes to
keep, it must be allowed of by the votes of the Senate, and be acknowledged
from their favor and liberality: thereby prevention was had, that evil men,
out of hopes of such gain, might not prove partial to other Princes, and
prejudicial to the Commonwealth.

Three Ambassadors were afterward sent by Caesar to the Senate; as well by way
of correspondency in friendly civilities, as also to end certain differences,
belonging to the articles of peace. They were received with great
demonstrations of honor, and were presented with cups of Gold to the value of
a thousand crowns a piece. And in favor to Caesar, who sought it at their
hands, many Subjects of the Commonwealth had their faults forgiven them, and
others had other favors done them. After he was crowned, Caesar went to Mantua,
where being received very magnificently by the Marquis Frederick da Gonsaga, in
memorial of which civil hospitality, the Emperor made him a Duke: and being to
pass from thence through the State of the Commonwealth, that he might go into
Germany by the way of Trent, the Senate ordered Paolo Nani, and Giovan Dolfino,
who were Commissaries General on Terra firma; and likewise Giovan Moro who was
Captain of Padua, and Pietro Grimani Captain of Vicenza, to meet Caesar, with an
honorable assembly of Gentry at Villa Franca, which lies upon the confines of
Verona and Mantua, and to wait upon him as long as he should be in the States
Territories. And they charged the Rectors of Verona, that they should be very
careful in providing victuals, and all things necessary for the Court and
Soldiers: and particularly, that they should present Cesars self in the name
of the Commonwealth, with excel^ent wines, fish, venison, sweetmeats, and with
every thing else of rarity which could be found for his refreshment. Thus Caesar
past on with all his people, being accompanied by a great many Lords, and
Princes Ambassadors, and amongst the rest by Nicolo Tiepolo, who, as has been
said, was appointed to stay as Leiger Ambassador with him: and crossing over
the Territories of Verona, without entering into the City, where double Guards
were placed at the gates and about the castles, he went to Chiusa.

As these things did increase confidence amongst these Princes, and establish
peace and friendship, so it was suspected that they would beget jealousy in
Soliman, that the Commonwealth would join with other Christian Princes against
him, which might be occasioned by many speeches that were spread abroad; that
these Princes had made peace, to the end that they might march with their
forces jointly against the Turks, and oppose Soliman's too deep and dangerous
designs upon Christendom. Who having been already before Vienna, threatened to
return with more powerful forces, and being made to hope for better things by
his recent victories, promised to himself succe^sful progress in Germany. Some
convention of Cardinals deputed thereunto, and wherein the Ambassadors of
other Princes, did intervene, were made at Bullognia, that they might think how
to govern themselves in their taking up of Arms against the Turks; and though
the Venetian Ambassadors did not intervene at there Treaties, and that no
result was had therein, yet fame (which always uses to amplify) had brought
greater tidings to Constantinople then were true. So as this course was blamed
by those that were wise, ^or experience showed, that whilst they consulted in
vain how to remedy our mischiefs, they drew on greater and more certain
dangers, incensing Soliman the more, and enforcing him to make greater
preparations for War.

The Senate being advertised of these the Turks suspicions, by Luigi Gritti,
who as Ambassador to John King of Hungary, had attended Soliman when he parted
from those confines, to Constantinople; and considering that they might be of
very evil consequence to the affairs of the Commonwealth, if they were any
longer credited by Soliman, and his Bashawes, they resolved to send an
Ambassador to Constantinople, who was to give an account of the peace which
they had made with Caesar, and of the reasons which persuaded them thereunto;
and who was afterward to affirm, that the Senate was resolved to continue
constant in their friendship unto the family of the Ottomans, and in their
commerce with that Nation, and that if the Ambassador should find the Turks
desirous thereof, he should again ratify the ancient articles of peace. The
Senate thought it the fitter for them to do this, because Soliman a little
before, as he went to Belgrade, had sent Ibraim his Ambassador to Venice, to
give an account of his success in Hungary, and particularly of his having
re-placed their ancient friend King John in his Kingdom. He had also sent
another Chiaus to Venice upon the occasion of the solemnity of circumcising two
of his Sons, inviting them to send their Ambassadors, who might be present at
the doing of it; and at the same time, in witness of his good affection to the
Commonwealth, he had presented them with 100000 pound weight of Saltpeter,
hearing that they were in great need thereof. Tomaso Mocenico was chosen for
this Embassy, who began his journey a few days after, and came very
opportunely to Constantinople, in respect of the aforesaid considerations; for
a Cruzado being published, the same and expectation whereof was the greater,
because the Preachers by the Popes directions, had earnestly exhorted the
people in their pulpits, to contribute moneys readily and cheerfully to the war
against the Infidels. These things had raised no light suspicions in Soliman,
that the Venetians had conspired against him, together with the other Christian
Princes, after the confederacy at Bolognia; wherefore looking the more narrowly
into all their former actions, Soliman complained that the Venetians upon the
making of peace, had contributed moneys to the Princes of the House of Austria,
who being his Enemies, might be thereby the better enabled to make war against
him. Hereunto was likewise added, that he took it ill at the Venetians hands,
who professed friendship to him, that he had not understood any thing of a
business of so great moment, save only the conclusion. But these rumors which
were already spread abroad amongst the Bashaws, and other chief Personages, were
quieted at the coming of the Ambassadors, and friendship was readily renewed,
and re-confirmed upon the former articles. The Ambassadors were afterward
present at the festival of the circumcision, which was performed with great
pomp and cost; in all which shows, the Ambassadors had honorable places
provided for them; and they, according to the custom of that Nation, and of
that solemnity, did present many rich vestments to the Grand Signeur, and other
things of price, amongst which a fair Unicorns horn, a thing which Soliman had
much desired, and which was very welcome to him.

In the time of these sports and festival, Soliman, who was born to effect
great things, was full of weighty and important thoughts. He discoursed often
with his Bashaws, of raising an Army to return into Hungary, and into Germany,
to abate the forces of the Austrian Princes, toward which he gave order for
many things. He in the next place designed to send out a great Fleet, whereby
he might upon occasion fall upon any enterprise, but with full resolution to
secure the Seas, which was at this time much infested with the Galleys
belonging to the Knights of Rhodes, who being permitted by Charles the Emperor
to come into Malta, molested Ships, and the Turkish affairs in all Seas: and at
the same time, as concerning affairs of peace, he endeavored to make
Constantinople the Staple Town of Merchandise, especially of such spices as
were brought from the Eastern parts into Alexandria, and other places of his
dominions, intending (as he said) to make that City, the Seat of the Empire, to
abound in all things, and especially in Gold: to which purpose, he had
forbidden men of all Nations to buy any Silks or Spices, and had already bought
a great quantity of these merchandise with his own moneys, that he might bring
them to Constantinople. The Venetians were much troubled at these proceedings;
for though the Turkish forces seemed to threaten other parts, yet their power
increasing by the ruin of other Princes, it would become likewise more
formidable to them, and the going out of the Fleet would always be occasion of
trouble, and of expense to the Commonwealth, especially if the Fleet should
come (as it was said it was to do) into the Gulf of Venice, where the Western
Vessels came oftentimes to pillage with much insolency. And the removing of
Traffic from the usual places, did much disturb their Merchandising, and the
ancient Navigation of their Galeasses, which were wont to go every year to
S^ria and Alexandria. The Venetians thinking how to give a timely remedy to
these things, exhorted the King of Hungary, who was found to have some
inclination to make peace with the Archduke Ferdinand, to pursue it, and
thereby to rid Christendom of so many occasions of danger and prejudice. They
likewise encouraged the King of Poland, who had formerly interposed himself in
this business, to reassume the Treaty of Agreement. They sought by many
endeavors with the Bashaws at Constantinople, and especially with Luigi
Gritti, who grew daily greater in favor and authority there, to keep the
Grand Seignior from sending forth his Fleet, by showing the care and diligence
used by the Commonwealth in keeping the Sea open, and free from Pirates; and
likewise from his other intention of bringing the Merchandise of Soria, and
Alexandria to Constantinople; showing many inconveniences that would arise
thereby, so as without any considerable advantage to Constantinople, and to the
great prejudice of his other Provinces, and of his Imposts, traffic would
lessen, by leaving those of the Western parts no occasion of making those
Voyages, if they should not be permitted to send forth so many sorts of
Merchandise, which they vented in great quantities in those Countries, and
wherewith they contracted for Spices, and other Merchandise, more then with
ready money. But to take all occasion from the Turks of sending out Galleys,
and especially into the Gulf of Venice, the Senate ordered the Commissary of
their Fleet, that he should warn the Galleys of Malta not to come into the
Gulf, nor to prejudice any Vessels which sailed into the Eastern Seas, which
were guarded by them; which if they should deny to do, that then he should
endeavor to disarm them. The Turks thought themselves very much in^ur'd
hereby, and complaining of the Venetians, they said, that it did not suit with
the friendship which they professed to hold with the Grand Seignior, to suffer
that the Turks, who were their friends, should be so much prejudiced at their
own homes, and before their faces, especially since their security was to rely
upon the provisions and forces of the Commonwealth; in which respect, to
preserve her jurisdiction, and to shun occasion of disorder, the Turks forbore
sending any men of War into the Gulf.

At the same time, Caesar having summoned a Diet of all the German Princes in
Augusta, many things appertaining to the State, and to Religion, were therein
treated on. The Protestants insisted chiefly in demanding a General Council,
wherein their opinions concerning the points of faith, might be examined and
decided: which they did, not out of any desire of sifting ou^ the truth, but
because they believed that the Pope would not give way thereunto, lest they
might enter into some other Treaties, whereby his authority might be
endangered, so as they thought they might have good occasion thereby to foment
their false opinions amongst the people. The Emperor seeking how to appease so
many humors, and how to cut off this root of greater evils, propounded the
business to the Pope; who looking for little good thereby, nay rather, occasion
of greater disorders, and yet being unwilling to seem to refuse it, sought to
spin out the business at length, alleging many respects, which gave just
occasion of delay; and chiefly, the discords which were then on foot amongst
Christian Princes; to appease the which, he said, it would be best first to
think how they might all concur jointly to assist and favor the Counsel. But
the Protestants growing more earnest in this their desire, and the Popes fear
increasing, he who greatly detested this sort of people, began to propound,
that they might be prosecuted by temporal arms: which he oftentimes mentioned
not only to Caesar, but to the Venetian Senate also: to whom be sent an express
Nuntio to exhort them to use their Counsels, authority and forces herein* and
to make Caesar undertake this business the more willingly, he offered him a
certain sum of money. But the Senate were much of an other opinion, and fought
to dissuade the Pope from it: Whose piety when they had praised, they showed
him afterward, that to take up arms at this time, and without any pressing
occasion, was no better then to show his fear the more is a just cause, which
he would go about to secure, by preventing by way of Arms, the power which the
concourse and favor of the people might bring unto the adverse party. Than it
became those who sustained the cause of Religion, to try all things, especially
by Scripture, and by reason. Moreover, that the Protestant Princes would be
necessitated to procure forces, and more followers, and their cause would be
more favored by the people, and have some fair appearance, since they were to
withstand the violence of Enemies, that the Princes of Italy were wholly
exhausted, by the so many wars. That it was to be suspected to what party the
Electors of the Empire would adhere in such a case, they being more desirous of
agreement, then of war, as appeared by their Ambassadors, who were sent to the
Emperor at Brussels: That the Hans Towns of Germany were resolved not to
assist Caesar, if he should go about to attempt any thing rather by power then
by reason: That Caesar was not able of himself to raise sufficient forces to
oppress the Princes and people, who were in commotion. There appeared such
reason in these things, and the Authority of the Senate was so great, (from
whose advice the Pope had very much differed) as changing his opinion, he
forbore sending his Nuntio to Caesar, as he had intended to do, and suspended
any such Treaty. And truly it was thought to be a much wiser course, and better
becoming the condition of the present times, to think rather of sustaining the
Turkish Wars, and to keep the forces of Christendom united as much as might be,
especially those of Germany, who were to withstand the Turks first violence:
For it was held for certain, that Soliman, whose haughty mind must needs be
scandalized, for his being enforced to rise from before the Walls of Vienna,
not only without Victory, but with some shame, would return very strong to the
same Enterprise, whereof there was much speech already in this respect, Caesar
did also incline more to agreement then to War, as also because he was very
intent and busy to get his Brother Ferdinando chosen to succeed him in his
Empire. Therefore without resolving any thing absolutely, he was conte^^ed with
ordering some things to be observed in point of Religion, till the next
Council. Caesar also* that he might bring all things in all parts to a peaceful
posture, desired that the differences which remained yet undecided, between the
Archduke Ferdinando, and the Commonwealth, might be fully ended; wherefore he
propounded that Arbitrators might be chosen to that purpose, as was agreed upon
by articles. To which, though the Senate did not only willingly assent, but
solicited the dispatch thereof, yet what was desired by both parties, was not
effected, for they could not agree upon an Umpire. The Archduke named the
Marquis of Mantua, the Bishop of Augusta, the Popes Nuntio that was resident
with him; and the Venetians, the Bishop Teatino, the Archbishop of Salerno, of
the House of Adorni, and the Nuntio resident in Venice. But those that the one
side liked, the other disliked; so as affairs continued still undecided, and
much prejudice ensued amongst the subjects, upon the confines, and occasion of
disagreement between the Princes. Nor was the Castle of Milan, nor City of
Como, restored as yet to Francisco Sforza, by the Emperor, though it grew
toward the end of the year: whe^efore the Venetians being very desirous that
the delivery thereof might be no longer delayed, lest time might prove
prejudicial thereunto, and Sforza not being able of himself to raise all the
money which he was to pay Caesar, they offered to lend him fifty thousand
Ducats, to make this payment, which was to be repayed by the profit of a
bargain of Salt, which was offered him also by the Commonwealth, which was, to
give him an hundred and fifty thousand Bushels of Salt, at the rate at 31 Soldi
of Imperial money, the bushel, to be brought to Pavia, which being vented in
the State of Milan at reasonable rates, the Duke would gain as much thereby in
a short space, as would enable him to repay the fifty thousand Ducats. But
Caesar being desirous to please some Merchants of Genua, and the Duke being
willing to please him, refused this bargain, but made another of the like
nature with others, which was less advantageous to himself; and by the same way
of Salt, found out moneys sufficient to satisfy Caesar; who presently after,
caused the Castle of Milan, and City of Como, to be delivered up to Sforza;
whereat the Venetians were well pleased, whose chief aim was, to secure
Sforza's State: who finding by many evident signs, that the Senate of Venice
had still the same care of his State, and of his Affairs, that he might make
use thereof to his own advantage upon any occasion; or else, that he might
therein please Caesar, by seeming to be jealous of the French, he earnestly
desired the Senate, that they would use their intercession and authority with
the King of France, to appease those rumors of Wars, which (as has been said)
had been much spoken off: And though it were not altogether believed, yet
continuing constant in their resolution of defending that State, and in
maintaining the capitulations, and thinking it expedient that their resolution
should be made publicly known, so to take all hopes from the French that the
Commonwealth would ever part from Caesar, and the other Colleagues, it was
resolved, that they would endeavor it, not only in France, but in all other
Courts; and to show themselves the more firm and resolute, it was resolved,
that when this should be discoursed of in the College where such propositions
are usually made by Ambassadors, that without taking time for any further
consideration, the Duke should say plainly in his answers, that the Senate was
fully resolved not to part for whatsoever accident should happen from the
League established with Caesar, and the other Confederates. But Caesar not being
herewith satisfied, did moreover desire, that those men should be raised, which
the Commonwealth by their Articles were bound to raise: Whereunto the
Venetians, fearing lest his aim might be at some particular end of his own, and
to draw them further then they were bound by the Articles of the League,
answered, that the state of affairs being now such as did promise peace in
Italy, they ought not to be put to so needless an expense.

King Francis had at this time taken a wife unto himself, and had recovered his
two sons, wherefore he seemed to be rather given to festivals and delights,
then to the troubles of war: and the Commonwealth, that they might congratulate
therein with him, had, to that purpose, sent Giovanni Pisano, procurator of St.
Mark, as Ambassador extraordinary to him. But if any real commotions should
appear, they promised, they for their parts would not suffer the common peace
and quiet to be disturbed, nor would they be any ways faulty to their
engagements. The Commonwealth being at this time in a safe and secure
condition, the Senators sought how to restore her integrally, and to recover
the preheminencies which she enjoyed before the late wars: amongst which the
Authority practiced by the Senate in nominating such as were to be promoted to
any bishopric within their State, was thought a great privilege; they had
often pressed the Pope much in that point, but not getting any resolution, they
forbear giving temporal possession of diverse Bishoppricks of their best Cities
to those upon whom the Pope had bestowed such benefices, a thing whereat he was
exceedingly troubled, and which he did so much resent, as it seemed, he sought
to break with the Venetians. This business growing every day more hard, the
Senate differed in their opinions; some were of opinion that they were either
to give it over, or to put the dispute off till another time; others who were
resolute in denying temporal possession, were for endeavoring to get the Pope
to gratify the Republique, and to restore this pre-eminence, and power unto
them, which other Princes enjoyed in their Dominions.

Those who dissented from this opinion, showed, how hard a business it would be
to effect, the Pope being so highly incensed, who would not be appeased by any
new endeavors, but was still the more offended: and, to nourish his anger, he
recalled to memory such things wherein he had formerly received but little
satisfaction from the Senate, and did sinisterly interpret their good actions.
They said, that the Popes of Rome were too deeply interessed in this business,
who had means to gratify their Kindred, and servants, by concession of these
rich Prelacies, as also, thereby to keep themselves in the more respect and
grandetza: to overcome which difficulties, it would behove them to wait for a
better time and opportunity, or expect a Pope, who might be better minded to
the Commonwealth. They further added, the thing was not in it self so much to
be desired, nor so advantageous to the Commonwealth, as to be so highly pressed
for, and so violently, endangering themselves, thereby to i^cur the Pope's
displeasure, and Ecclesiastique censures; things which had formerly proved very
prejudicial, and almost ru^^ous to the Commonwealth, in depriving her, as it
had often done, of her chiefest Senators: By giving them these dignities, and
charge of Churches, and by interessing so many Families in Ecclesiastical goods
and preferments; so as by the Laws, many Citizens were excluded from the most
important negotiations of government. How could it be thought to tend to the
public good, or that it was of small moment in their Cities, to introduce
hereby a Court-like life in many of their families, and mere of grande^za and
deliciousness, then became a private life, which their Ancestors had always
endeavored, as much as they could, to keep in an equality, thrifty, and far
from such things as might co^rupt the ancient customs of their forefathers, and
as might beget in some citisens too haughty thoughts, and in others, envy at
their too great fortune. That the ambition which was in all men, of attaining
unto the usual employments of the Commonwealth, was sufficiently advantageous,
without adding another ambition thereunto, of thirsting after ecclesiastical
dignities, which would be so much the greater, as the thing endeavored seemed
the more desirable, by the perpetuity of honor, and by the profit which waited
thereupon: and that though they were formerly suffered, it was to be
considered, that the manners of these times (as is usually seen in all other
human things) were already gone far beyond the bounds of that naked honesty,
wherewith their predecessors had governd themselves and the Commonwealth. But
others held to the contrary, that they were not to forbear their former
resolution of drawing the Pope to condescend to their reasonable requests, that
they had had experience enough, by their late successes, of what force a
constant and generous resolution was, whereby having overcome so many
difficulties of the severest and saddest times, they had recovered almost their
whols State on Terra firma. That it was not to be doubted, but that they might
soon reduce their Commonwealth to her former dignity, authority, and honor, if
they would still use the same means: And what reason was there to believe, that
the Pope, to whom peace was more advantageous then to any others, since thereby
he might settle his Nephew in that Grande^za in his country, which had cost him
so much labor and expense to put him into, would now, by troubling the affairs
of Italy, expose so great, and now so certain a Fortune, to new and doubtful
events of War. That they could not expect a better occasion or opportunity:
That Caesar would further this request, both out of the common Interest, and for
the need he had of keeping Friendship and good Intelligence with the
Commonwealth. That the thing it self was such, as length of time would prove
prejudicial to it; for, by endring the longer deprivation thereof, their former
pretense of possession, would become the weaker. But that, if they would
consider the particulars of this business more inwardly, the advantages, and
conveniences thereof would appear to be so many, as there would be no doubt of
the contrary. That other great Princes had this concession, and used it with
ample authority; and why should the Commonwealth, which was Mistress of
Kingdoms, be inferior to the rest? That it was apparent enough, how much it
imports Princes, in point of State, that Prelates, who are of such Authority in
Cities, should not only be their Confidents, but should also be bound unto
them: and that they should acknowledge that Dignity, and all their Fortune,
from their Natural Prince; so as they might proceed in all things with more
sincere Faith, and greater Respect. Nor could the Ambition after this degree be
more harmful, then that by which the magistracies of the Commonwealth are
usually procured: and that it had always been thought, that the need that one
Citizen stood in of another favor in the attaining unto honors, does help
much to the preservation of civil Government. Whereof, the more various and
important occasions are offered, so much more the love and union of Citizens
are confirmed and augmented. Nor was that wealth to be blamed in Citizens,
which is justly conferred upon them by the Public. And that it was the comfort
of many families, and made many out of such hopes to be the more careful in
breeding up good Subjects, who by their learning and manners might be capable
of such preferments, and prove after very fit for the Government of the
Commonwealth. And when provision is not had by the good Orders of a City, that
Citizens may of themselves love good demeanor, and the good of their Country,
it was in vain to blame riches, or praise poverty; since both of them may
equally allure corrupt minds to wickedness, though by several ways.

These and other reasons were alleged according to the diversity of opinions,
so as the business rested in suspense, and undecided. But at the last, taking a
middle way, it was resolved, that to gratify the Pope, possessions should be
given to all such, as till then the Pope had conferred Bishoprics upon in
their Dominions. But that nevertheless, not desisting from their former
demands, but professing that they had done this only out of respect, and
observancy to Clement, they should seem to hope the more to obtain their
desire. Yet the Pope, who did first require this in sign of their obedience,
could not be appeased, but appeared still more obdurate, so as the business
could be brought to no better condition.

But other more weighty affairs diverted them from this care, and advised them
to endeavor a good intelligence with the Pope; for in the beginning of the
year 1531. 'twas known that Soliman intended great war upon Christendom, having
already accommodated his differences with the King of Persia, from whom some
were already come to Constantinople, to confirm the peace. Many things raised a
jealousy that he would make attempts, not only by land but by Sea too; for he
had sent his Standard to Cariadino, surnamed Barbarossa, a very famous Pyrat,
for his skilfulness in Sea affairs, and for the great harm he had done to
Christendom: and this man he had received into the number of his Commanders;
which he acquainted the Venetians with, to the end that they might not proceed
with him any more as with a Pyrate, but as with one that belonged to him. And
though the Bashawes did often affirm that they would keep friendship and peace
with the Commonwealth, yet it being neither honorable nor safe, to leave the
Sea open to the discretion of these barbarous people, it behoved them to make
extraordinary provision of Galleys, and of Soldiers: which was the more
grievous to them, for that the public purse being exhausted by the late wars,
they could not well find moneys for so great an expense; therefore they were
forced to have recourse to other means, amongst which they thought, that to
seize on the Tithes of the Clergy within their Dominions, which were very many,
was a very good course; which they endeavored to obtain of the Pope, wherein
they proceeded with him, with much dexterity and humanity: But yet they could
not overcome many difficulties which stuck with him; so as the business was
protracted, nay, to a double displeasure of the Venetians, he designed to lay
two tenths upon all the goods of the Ecclesiastics throughout Italy, meaning
to make use of these moneys, as he said, in assisting the Catholic Cantons of
the Switzers, against which the Heretics had taken up Arms. So as the
Commonwealth was not only deprived of this benefit of Tithes, which being to be
taken out of the Incomes of their own Territories, seemed imployable for the
benefit thereof; but occasion was thereby given of greater disturbances, by the
jealousies given to the Turks, that these moneys raised in the Popes name,
might be for the service of some League to be made against them. Yet the
Senate, though they were deprived of these aids, and of all hopes of ever
attaining thereunto, the Pope being mightily scandalized, for that out of
confidence of obtaining this favor, they had begun a little too early to exact
them, would not delay making requisite provisions; but overcoming all
difficulties, resolved for the present to arm fifty Galleys, which were
forthwith put to Sea, in excellent order. But this great noise of war, did soon
after cease of it self; for Soliman being gone into Andrinopolis, with
intention (as was given out) that he might mind these preparations the better,
gave himself so to the delight of hunting, and did so defer the affairs of war,
as he did not this year trouble any place with his Forces. Yet the Venetian
Fleet was not all this while idle, the Sea being full of Pirates, who assembled
together in great numbers, infested all the Seas, and disturbed navigation, and
commerce: But these were driven away in all parts, and many of their Vessels
were taken, and destroyed, to the general advantage, and to the great praise of
the Venetians. At this same time, the King of Hungary, though he kept himself
in good order for war, and that his forces were greater then Ferdinando's, yet
were it either that he did expect succor from the Turks for his greater
security, or that he feared the aid which Charles was said to prepare for his
brother, or that he desired to accommodate his affairs rather by treaty then by
arms, by reason of the little confidence he had in his own Subjects, did not
attempt any thing.

Thus Arms being suspended, as it were by a tacit consent, on all sides, he
sent Iovanni Lasco Ambassador to the Emperor, from whom not being able to get
any resolution. Lasco past on to Ferdinand, and meeting with no less doubts and
difficulties touching his proposals in him, he intended to go to other German
Princes, to treat of his Kings affairs with them; but his safe conduct being
denied him by Ferdinando, he was forced to return to Hungary. But King John
made it known by other means in the Dyets which were held in several parts of
Germany, and especially amongst the Heretics, that he might keep Ferdinand
from being assisted by them; that Soliman would esteem them his friends or
enemies, who should appear friends or enemies to the Kingdom of Hungary. And
leaving nothing unattempted, he sent his Ambassadors also to Venice, desiring
the Senate that they would mediate both with the Emperor and Pope to embrace
his cause, and bring affairs to some composition; wherefore the Senate knowing
that King John was resolved to try all extremes, so as he might keep his
Kingdom, and that the Turks were still ready to defend him, they, that they
might remove all new troubles and dangers from Christendom, readily embraced
his cause, and moved the Pope in his behalf. But they could not do much good
therein; for the Pope, were it either that he did rather favor Ferdinando,
then King John, or that he was really so minded, seemed more inclined to have
the business decided by Arms, then by Treaty. So as the rumors of war
beginning again to be renewed, and Soliman having more certainly published his
resolution, of coming with very powerful forces into Hungary, to recover the
City of Strigonia, which was possessed by Ferdinando, the Pope sent his Nuntio,
the Bishop of Verona, to Venice, to require the Senate to delare what their
intentions were, and what they would do, if the Turks should return with an
Army into Hungary; and to desire them that they would join with the rest of the
Princes of Christendom, in showing their good will to oppose these common
Enemies. The Senators were very doubtful what to do herein; they were set upon
on one side by their zeal to Religion, and State Policy, by reason of the great
danger which accrew'd to the Commonwealth, by the increase of their Neighbor
the Turks forces, who were Enemies to all Christian Princes: And on the other
side, they were afraid they should find but little constancy in the Princes,
and that to shun more uncertain, and farther distant dangers, they might run
upon such as were certain, and present. Their inward thoughts were very
fervent, but they cooled therein apace when they considered the nature of the
business. The Enemy being very strong, and their friends not likely to agree in
uniting their minds, and forces; and that these very things had been many times
proposed rather to show an appearance of zeal, then out of any resolution, or
well grounded hopes, of effecting the thing propounded. So as neither totally
embracing this invitation, nor yet seeming altogether averse thereunto, they
returned this answer to the Pope.

That the desire of the good of Christendom was ancient, and hereditary in the
Venetian Senate; but that as this made them readily willing to do any thing
tending to the service thereof, so did it grieve them, that the present
condition, neither of times, nor affairs, would suffer them to show it. That
the greatest Princes of Christendom were now at great odds; so as there was
small hopes that they would join their forces against these common Enemies.
That the Commonwealth was too weak of her self, to oppose the Turks with any
hopes of much advantage. That they might affirm their State did confine for the
space of two thousand miles, leading from Cyprus to all Dalmatia, upon the
Turks; in whose power there was always likewise great numbers of their
Citizens, and of their subsistances to a great value; which things imposed upon
them a necessity of temporizing with the Turks; and which would not easily
permit them to declare themselves their Enemies. That they did notwithstanding
very much praise the wisdom, and piety of the Pope, in foreseeing, and in
providing against the dangers of Christendom; but that they did trust their too
just and too well known respects, would be both acknowledged and allowed of
throughout Christendom.

But Ferdinando, though he saw all these indeavourings of Leagues would prove
vain, hoping that he might obtain better conditions by Arms, then those that
were profferd him by King John, despised all Treaties: for he was already
declared in the convention of Cullen, to be the King of the Romans, and
Successor to his Brother Charles in the Empire; and he had got many aids in the
Diets held at Lins and Prague, and hopes of greater succors from his Brother.
But the Venetians continued still in their endeavors for peace; and having
sent their Ambassadors to Ferdinando, to congratulate his new dignity; they
inserted many speeches, wherein they exhorted him to embrace peace, and to make
good the hopes which were conceived of him; that as a wise and an excellent
Prince, he would above all things, study the peace and good of Christendom.
Peace was the more indeavourd and desired by those who did sincerely desire the
common good, and considered the conditions of the present times, because it was
known, that grievous Wars, and the beginnings of other calamities were
threatened elsewhere; for the Kings of France and England, finding that they had
opportunity offered them of molesting the Emperor, by reason of the necessity
he lay under of defending the Territories of his own family, and of the Empire,
from the Turks, plotted several ways how to make War against him. The former
being moved by his ancient desire of recovering the State of Milan; the other,
by a new distaste conceived against Charles, for defending his Aunt -- wife to
Henry, but who was by him repudiated, through the desire he had of another
Wife. They therefore jointly endeavored to egg on many German Princes against
Charles, who were not well satisfied with him, and they themselves prepared for
Arms: So as it was imagined that nothing was expected to the making of War, but
that the Turks should be the first who should draw the Emperors forces into
those parts, whereof greater and more certain rumor now arose; for Soliman,
who heard daily of these intentions of the Christian Princes, and thinking for
the same reasons, to find Caesar busied in several Wars at one and the same
time, seemed every day more resolute to defend, and maintain the cause of his
friend and confederate King John; and more desirous also to recover the
reputation of his Forces, which he thought, was not a little lessened by his
retreat from Vienna.

In the beginning therefore of the year 1532. he went to Andranopoli, where he
divulged what he intended to do; and having before his departure, showed both
in words and actions, a great desire of preserving friendship with the
Venetians, he had given order for the expedition of the great Galleys, which
for the aforesaid reasons had lain idle in Soria, and in Alexandria; permitted
all free commerce to the Merchants of that Nation; laying aside the thought of
reducing the business to Constantinople; readily granted the carriage of Corn
and Saltpeter, out of diverse parts of his Dominions, giving many other signs of
putting an esteem upon the Commonwealth, and of his desire to continue peace
with her. But being intent upon assembling his Army, he had sent orders to all
the Spacchi of Greece (these are a sort of men who serve on Horseback,
receiving a perpetual proportion of land, granted them by the Prince) to come
and meet him, well provided with Horse and Arms. He had likewise demanded such
Auxiliaries from the Tartarians, Wallacchi, and Transilvanians, as they were
bound by Articles to send unto his Camp; so as having taken the field, and
begun his march, he had, when he came near the confines of Hungary, about an
hundred and fifty thousand soldiers, amongst which there was twenty thousand
gallant Janissaries, all foot, bred up from their youth, perpetually and solely
to this sort of Militia. When Soliman was come with this his Army to Belgrado,
a Town lying in the lower Hungary, he made it be proclaimed, that he would give
Battle to Charles the Emperor, and assuring himself of victory, he insolently
threatened, that he would drive him out of Germany, and assume unto himself all
the Rights and Territories of the Western Empire; affirming them to appertain
unto him, as to the true Emperor, and Lord of Constantinople: But Charles had
raised a no less powerful Army to oppose these Forces, which he had gathered
out of almost all the Nations of Christendom; which was greater and gallanter,
then had been seen in many former ages; and herewith he stayed, expecting the
enemy before the Walls of Vienna. All men's minds were held in suspense touching
what would become at this so great a rumor of War, chiefly the Venetians, who
for other important reasons, were much concerned in this business, and were
very solicitous in expecting what the event would be: but in their wishes they
were for the Christians, and permitted the soldiers of their dominions, to go
to the Emperor, and did that underhand, which they were not allowed to do in
public. But truly, it was very miraculous, that so great a preparation for
War, should produce no notable effect on either side: for Soliman, without
passing any further, and sending only one of his Captains, by name Cassone, to
pillage Carinthia, and Stiria, who was afterward suppressed, and destroyed by
the Count Palatine, returned back to Constantinople: and on the other side,
Charles not having ever stirred with his Camp from before the walls of Vienna
(for his Captains thought it not safe to quit that quarter, that they might not
go far from Danubius, and go into the open champagnia, whereby they might want
the convenience of that River, and be exposed to the violence of Solimans so
numerous Cavalry) having received certain news whither the Turks were gone,
dissolved his Army suddenly, and leaving a Garrison of Soldiers with his
brother, resolved to come himself in person into Italy, and to pass from thence
to Spain; which gave the French occasion to upbraid him with this sudden
departure, when their King was at another time accused by Charles for keeping
him from advancing against the Turks, since (as they said) when he himself was
in Arms, and free as then from all other Wars, he had not used opportunity of
pursuing the enemy, but suffered him to retreat with such safety and
convenience, as that he carried away above thirty thousand Prisoners from off
his Territories. So as it seemed Caesar was to confess, either that he had not
forces sufficient, or else courage and resolution to fight the Turkish Armies.

At this very time, the Imperial and Turkish Fleets were gone forth very strong
to Sea, wherefore the Venetians thinking it became them, both for the honor
and safety of their State, to Arm, so as they might be provided for whatsoever
should happen, they resolved to add a great many Galleys to their Fleet, and to
constitute a Commander of great authority over them. Thus by order from the
Senate, twenty Galleys were suddenly armed in the Islands of Candia, Zante, and
Corfu, and in other Towns of Dalmatia, which made up the number of the Fleet
sixty, the Government whereof was given to Vicenzo Capello, who was created
Captain General at Sea: His Commission was to look carefully to the
preservation of all places, and subjects belonging to the Commonwealth, not
suffering any injury to be done unto them, but not to meddle by any means in
the aff^irs of any foreign Fleet; that both the Imperialists and Turks should
be treated as friends, that they should be allowed Havens and Victuals, but
neither Arms nor ammunition, nor any thing appertaining to War; for the Senate
was steadfastly resolved to keep peace and friendship with all. The Turkish
Fleet being then put forth into the Eastern Seas, to the number of eighty Sail,
some twenty lesser Vessels being numbered amongst the Galleys, commanded by
Immerale, and the Imperial Fleet into the Western, consisting of forty nimble
Galleys, to boot with a great number of Men of War, commanded by Andrea Doria,
and it not appearing as yet, what the commanders ends or commissions were,
General Capello kept between Zant and Corfu, endeavoring (according to his
Commission) to secure the Subjects, but to shun all occasion of encountering
with this Fleet, in case it should advance, that he might give no suspicion of
favoring one party more then the other. Immerale being come to Pevesa, Capello
tarrying at Corfu, sent one of his Galleys to make him a friendly Visit, which
he took very kindly, and promised to have a great care to the affairs of the
Commonwealth, not suffering any of her subjects to be injured; and it was a
great truth, that the Turkish Fleet having touched at Zant, and at other
places, had not injured any one. But Doria putting from Sicily, where he had
tarried long, sailed toward Greece, and hearing that the Venetian Fleet was at
Zant, he would go thither also with his Galleys, that he might speak with
General Capello, intending, as it was believed (for he had often said he would
do so) to put a necessity upon the Venetians of joining with him, by making the
Turks jealous that their Fleets would join; concerning which union, he had
written many letters to the Senate; and the Emperors Ambassador then resident
at Venice, had several times with much importunity, pressed to know, that if it
should so fall out, as his Masters and the Turks Fleet should have a conflict,
whether the Venetian General was to assist Soliman, or no: Which it being very
well known how far the Ven^tian were from doing, they knew these queries were
made, to bring them to some farther justification of themselves, by some
promise which might make them quit their Neutrality: Therefore the Senate, and
General Capello gave such answers, as might witness their forwardness, and
willingness to keep friends with Caesar, but that they would not be brought,
either out of favor to him, or out of any vain hopes of self-interest, to
break peace with so powerful an Enemy. Thus the Imperial and Turkish Fleets
being almost equally balanced in point of force, they lay idle all the Summer;
neither of them daring to fall upon any Enterprise, for fear of being worsted
by the other. At last the Turkish Fleet beginning, because it was much weakened
by the Soldiers sickness, to retire toward Negraponte, to the end, as it was
believed, that they might winter in Constantinople, Doria grew thereupon the
bolder, and having a great many Soldiers in his Fleet, after many
consultations, steered his course toward Morea, re^olving to attempt the
taking of Corone; which after some resistance made by the Turkish Garrison, he
took by force, and soon after took Patrasso by agreement. But winter being now
at hand, both the Fleets withdrew into their several Havens, not doing any
remarkable action. Wherefore the Venetians, that they might not be at so great
an expense to no purpose, disarmed their extraordinary Galleys, which had been
armed abroad, and some of the oldest also, which had formerly been in their
Fleet

This happy success of the Imperialists, encouraged the Christians to hope for
greater things; every little acquisition being highly esteemed by them, who
were always wont to come off with the loss. But others, weighing the condition
of affairs better, said, that such things were vainly undertaken, as could
produce no true, nor greatly considerable advantage to the service of
Christendom; for since the Turkish Forces remained entire both by Sea and Land,
what reason had they to nourish any hopes of maintaining those places long, to
which the Enemy might easily bring their most powerful Armies both by Land and
Sea? And certainly, the sequel made this be the better known; for the next year
Corone was re-taken by the Turks, to the great loss and shame of the
Christians. And the like not many years after befell Castle Novo, which was
first taken, and soon after lost by our men, as shall hereafter be related.

These things were done abroad; but in Italy all things were this mean while
peaceable, save that the Duke of Milan was forced to send his men against the
Commander of the castle of Muss, who desirous to better his condition by some
novelty, and hoping to be assisted by the Landsknechts, had taken some places
amongst the Grisou^s, and threatened the City of Como: which caused the Duke to
send a Servant of his, Iovan Battisto Spetiano, to crave help from the Senate.
To which the Senate answered, that they were to proceed herein with great
caution, lest they might trouble the quiet of Italy, and raise jealousies that
they had deeper designs: But that if the occasion should increase, he should
find them as ready as they had been for so many late years, to assist the Duke
and his affairs. Which was the occasion of the quenching of this little spark;
which, if the Venetians should have taken up Arms, was feared might have broken
out into a greater fire: For the Grisouns being assisted in this interim by
some of the Cantons of the Switzers, had assembled a good number of men, with
whom they made head against the aforesaid Commander, and brought him to
agreement; to the which the Duke when he understood the Venetians resolution,
did the more willingly assent, and at last had the town of Lecco, and the
Castle of Muss restored unto him, for a certain sum of money. At the same time,
the possession of the Cities of Modena and Regio was confirmed to the Duke of
Ferrara, by the Emperors favorable decree in his behalf, though the Pope
complained much thereof. To whom the Duke, being to pay for this 100000 Ducats
within a prefixed time, and the Pope requiring Pledges, the Duke gave him
fifteen Gentlemen of Venice, whom the Pope accepted of, upon the Senates word,
that they were sufficient security for such a sum. A little before this, the
Duke was returned to favor and friendship with the Common wealth; whereby he
was freely readmitted to the possession of a noble Palace in Venice, which was
formerly given to his Predecessors by the Senate, and had been taken from him
by reason of the late wars; and a greater desire of good intelligence was daily
discovered to be in them of both sides; the Senate favoring the accommodation
of his affairs with the Pope, as much as they could, with whom the Duke was yet
in contumacy; for his Holiness could not well content himself to forego those
two Cities, to which he had very much aspired, out of other designs of his own.
Wherefore Caesar finding that some grudgings did remain in the Popes mind, and
being willing to sweeten him by some good turn, he bethought himself of coming
again into Italy, and of speaking once more with the Pope in the same town of
Bullognia. He knew he might stand in so much the more need of Clements
friendship at this time, for that he understood the French began to stir again;
and he hoped to be able by his interposition and authority, to draw the other
Princes of Italy, and especially the Venetians, to a straiter confederacy; by
the which the defense of the State of Milan, and of the Kingdom of Naples might
not only be provided for, according to the capitulations made two years before,
but that the aff^irs of Genua might also thereby be secured, upon which he
understood the French had some design. But the Pope was glad to meet with Caesar
for other respects; for having bethought himself of marrying his Niece to the
King of France his second Son, and fearing lest Caesar being offended thereat,
might put some stop to the marriage formerly agreed between his Nephew
Alexander de Medici, and Margaret, Cesars natural daughter, endeavored to hold
Caesar in hand by his usual artifices, and to give him some satisfaction. He
therefore caused all the Potentates of Italy to send their Ambassadors to
Bolognia, to treat about the new confederacy, which he knew was much desired by
them all.

But the Venetians were as much troubled hereat; for as they were fully
resolved not to come to any new confederacy with Caesar, so would they not
willingly be put upon a necessity of denial, and of displeasing him thereby.
Many respects concurred in confirming their resolution of not altering their
first capitulations at Bullognia; the consideration of not raising jealousies
in the Turks, that these treaties aimed not at the affairs of Italy, but at
Leagues to be made against them: And they were to proceed the more cautiously
with them, for that they understood a very powerful Fleet was to come from
Constantinople the next Spring. Likewise the King of France his Interests, and
the opinions which he might conceive hereat, seemed not to be set at naught;
since the further incensing him, must needs redound to the disadvantage of the
Commonwealth, by entering into new obligations with the Emperor, to boot with
those which they had formerly alleged upon many occasions, in excuse of being
compelled by necessity to embrace peace; or else alienate him wholly from
thinking of the Affairs of Italy any more; with which the Venetians were not
displeased, that Cesar's aspiring thoughts might be allayed, and whereby he
might be occasioned to value their Friendship the more.

These things were the more weighed, for that they knew C^sar's chief drift in
this new League, was to defend Ge^ua, whereat the Turks and French, were very
much troubled. The Turks, because the very name of that City was odious to
them, for that the Fleet came from thence which had taken Corone from them, and
done them so many other mischeifs. And the French, because the securing of
Genua, enforced a necessity of taking up Arms against them, by reason of the
noise already spread abroad, that they were to attempt this enterprise. They
suspected likewise, lest this might be a trick of Cesar's, to raise jealousies
by these Treaties in the Turks, and King of France, against the Commonwealth;
by bringing her into a necessity, not only of joining with him, but in making
her depend upon his will, and follow his fortune, declaring themselves to be
friends to his friends and enemies to his enemies. The Venetians answered
therefore the desires made in this behalf by Cesar's Agents who were at Rome,
by deviating from the proposition, and by asserting their constant resolution
of maintaining the League which they had already made with Caesar, and the other
Colleagues, and their desire of the peace and quiet of Italy.

But this mean while, Caesar came himself in person into Italy, coming by the
way of Villacco, whither he was accompanied by his Brother Ferdinando. He was
received at Pontieba by four Venetian Ambassadors, Marco Minio, Ieronimo
Pesaro, Lorenzo Bragadine, and Marco Foscari, who were appointed to receive him
by the Commonwealth, and to wait upon him, ^s long as he tarried in their
Dom^nions. But when the meeting was had at Bull^nia, in the end o^ the year
1532. in the beginning of January the next ensuing year 1533. he began to think
upon more weighty affairs, and chiefly to renew his intercessions with the
Venetians, touching the new confederacy, for which the other Princes had sent
their Ambassadors to Bullognia. He therefore sent for Mark Antonio Veniero,
and Mark Antonio Contarini, the one of them being Ambassador from the
Commonwealth, resident with the Pope, the other with himself, whom these
Princes did jointly persuade to make them mediate strongly with the Senate, in
persuading them to embrace such things as were propounded for the greater
common security, and for the quiet of Italy, which was so advantageous and so
dear unto them. And moreover, the Pope sent his Nuntio, Roberto Maggio to
Venice, for the same end; but as it was thought, he did it more to satisfy
Caesar, then himself. But the Senate seeking several times how to deviate from
this proposal, as they had formerly done, by attesting their settled resolution,
and good will to observe the agreement made the year 29. which stood yet firm
and valid; being sti^l solicited to the same thing, resolved to discover their
reasons in part, concealing the Aff^irs of France, which peradventure, they
were not so much troubled at, as was Caesar.

They answered, That the Turks were well acquainted with the first convention
made at Bullognia for the safety of Italy, so as if they should now come to a
new Le^gue, all the affairs of Christen^om being conveyed to that Court, and
they being by many accidents increased, to foment distrust and jealousy,
certainly they would believe, that this League was made against them; therefore
as these just respects had been several times formerly allowed and admitted of,
when the very affairs of Genua were in treaty; the condition of the present
times were such, as they might now be thought to be of more importance, and to
deserve truer excuse. Moreover, it was sufficiently known, that there was no
need of any capitulation for the safety of the affairs of Italy; for that
Cesar's Fleet was sufficient of it self, against any attempt that should be
made by Sea, and that sufficient provision was had for any attempt that might
be made by Land, by the former confederacy: Even for the affairs of Genua;
against which no Forces could be brought, which were not to pass through the
State of Milan, which was comprehended within the Articles of the League, and
that experience her self did demonstrate, that sufficient provisions were had
for all things in the first agreement, since Italy had already enjoyed three
years peace, which was respected even by those that had a mind to disturb her.

The King of France, seeking how to strengthen these allegations made by the
Venetians, strove to remove all suspicions of his making War. The French
Cardinals urged this much with the Pope; and the French Ambassador as much
with the Senate; so as Caesar having no hopes to prevail with the Venetians, and
the Pope himself growing cool therein, seeing his intercessions could do no
good, and two Months being already over, since the convention met, so as
Cesar's desires and occasions called him back into Spain. The League between
the Pope, and the Emperor, and the other Princes of Italy, to wit, the Dukes
of Milan, and Ferrara, and the Cities of Genua, Sienna, Lucca, and Florence,
was concluded, and published, about the end of February.

In which it was agreed upon, That the aforenamed should deposit 110000
Ducates; that the same provision should be monthly paid, according to the
certain proportions by them all, in time of War; and in time of Peace 25000
Ducates, for the entertainment of the Commanders: And Antonio da Leva was
declared Captain General of the League. The Duke of Savoy was likewise
comprehended herein, for what concerned his Territories in Italy; and also the
Duke of Mantua; but without any particular Obligation to pay their part of this
contribution.

And it was observable, that though the Commonwealth had neither assented unto,
nor intervened by her Agents in any Treaties, yet, either to give more
reputation to the business, or to make other Princes jealous of the
Commonwealth, it was said in the contents of the draught of this agreement,
that the League made the year 1529. between the Pope, and the other
Confederates, with the Commonwealth of Venice, was confirmed and established,
adding thereunto the names of the aforesaid Italian Princes; and this was not
only proclaimed, but printed; so as copies hereof coming to Constantinople, and
to England, it gave occasion to those Princes, both of which were Cesar's
declared enemies, to complain somewhat of the Senate, and to seem jealous of
them. And to aggravate the business with Soliman, it was added, that many of
the in habitants of the Islands belonging to the Commonwealth, were in the
Fleet, when it went to Corone: and to work the like effect in Henry, that the
Doctors of Padua, publicly appointed thereunto, had determined the point of
marriage on Cesar's side, and against the King of England, whereby he lay at
this time under Ecclesiastical censure by the Pope. Yet the Senate was very
much pleased, that in this convention, wherein the Duke of Milan was present,
the match was concluded between him, and the Lady Christerna, daughter to the
King of Denmark, by Isabella, Cesars Sister; which was very much desired by the
Venetians, that they might see the succession of the State of Milan, settled in
the Family of the Sforzas, and in a Prince of that State, and an Italian: for
which the Commonwealth had undergone so long, and so sore Wars. Caesar went then
from Bullognia toward Milan, intending to take Sea (as he did) at Genua,
whither twenty five Galleys were brought by Doria, to convey him to Barcelona;
and when he came to Cremona, he writ lovingly to the Venetian Senate, in which
Letters he seemed to admit of their excuses, in not assenting to the new
League, and desired to be serviceable to the Commonwealth.

Thus fair intelligence and friendship continuing between the Commonwealth and
the House of Austria, and all parties appearing desirous, that the disputes
between the King of the Romans, and the Commonwealth, touching the restitution
of certain places possessed by Ferdinand, but belonging to the Commonwealth,
might be decided, wherein Caesar himself did also intercede, at last, by consent
of all sides, Lodovico Porro, a Senator of Milan, was chosen Umpire* and
Girolamo Bulfark, a Dutch Doctor, Arbytrator for Ferdinand, and Matheo Avogaro
Bres^iano, Doctor, and Chevalier for the Venetians: These met in the City of
Trent, whither also Secretary Andrea Rosso was sent by the Senate, that he
might be assistant at this negotiation, and might inform the Senate of all that
should pass; who hoping to have the Forts of Marano and Gradisca restored unto
them by friendly composition, upon the disbursing of a certain sum of money,
sent Iouanni Delfino, Podesta of Verona to Trent likewise, to assist in this
business; but so many difficulties were met withal in this, and in other
affairs, as the convention was dissolved, without having concluded any thing.
The Austrian Commissary would have nothing treated of, but such things, and in
such manner, as might prove advantageous to his Prince: But when it was
proposed on the Venetians behalf, that such things should also be decided,
wherein they and their subjects suffered; as the restitution of some Towns, and
chiefly those which were wrongfully possessed by the Austrian subjects, after the
capitulation of Bullognia; Bulfarch either saying he had not sufficient
commission to treat thereof, or making some other excuse, sought to delay, and
deviate such Treaties, but chiefly he would have nothing to do with the
restitution of Aqueleia, which Ferdinand was tied to return to the Patriarch,
as to the lawful owner thereof: a thing which was desired, and endeavored by
the Venetians for many respects, and without which they would not assent to
other things, though they should be agreed upon.

Whilst these things past amongst the Christian Princes, the Turks being very
intent upon the recovery of Corone, had prepared a gallant Fleet, and sent it
early to Sea* to that purpose: To give a counterpoise to which, Doria had
likewise put together many Men of War, in several places. These preparations
forced the Venetians to re-arm their Galleys, which they had in the preceding
Winter disarmed: but howsoever, continuing their former resolution, of not
intermedling in any thing between these Princes, they renewed their orders of
the former year to their General Capello, who continued still his charge in the
Fleet: wherefore he sent Francisco Dandalo, Captain of the Gulf, with a good
squadron of Galleys into this our Sea, to guard it from the Pirates, who being
very many, did much harm, and sent four other Galleys for the same end to Zant,
and the great Gallion to Cap^ Malio (a very commodious place for the Navigation
of our Ships which go unto the Levant) a very great Vessel of stupendous
building, and excellently well provided of men and artillery: and he, with the
rest of the Fleet, kept about Corfu, being contented, according to the Senates
intention, to keep their State and affairs uninjured. But all inconveniences
could not be prevented (it being always dangerous, and very scandalous, that
men of War belong^ng to several Potentates, should keep in the same Seas)
Francisco Dandalo, Captain of the Gulf, being come with 6 Galleys toward the
coasts of Dalmatia, and being gotten to the Safino, a place not far from
Vallona, he might discover twelve of the barbarian Galleys, which taking at
first to be those of the Proveditor Canale, he bare up with them: but when he
came so near them, as that he saw they were Pirates, he fell roomward, intending
(as he said afterward) to make way for them, to the end, that putting further
from land, in hope to escape the better, he might the more commodiously fall
upon them, and fight them, where they should not be able to save themselves.
But not having communicated this his intention to any of the Masters of his
reserve, they thought he fell roomward, not to fight, but to fly: so as they
tarrying behind, he was followed only by Marco Cornaro, who commanded a Bastard
Gally: being this mean while got very near the Pirates, they, finding the
advantage of our Galleys being separated and divided, and being themselves very
well provided of arms and soldiers, advanced, fell upon our Galleys which were
parted from the rest, had the better of them, and carried both them, and them
that were in them, into Barbary, and amongst the rest, Dandalo and Cornaro. The
Venetians resented this very much, both by reason of the Pirates daring and of
their Commanders negligence and indiscretion, who had been the cause of shame
to the Galleys of the Commonwealth, which were so highly esteemed at Sea, Some
of the Senators did therefore move, that a good Squadron of Galleys should be
sent to the Rivers of Africa, particularly to the Gerbi and Algiers, to burn
all the Galleys that they should find in those parts, in revenge of the injury
received from those men: But finding afterward that they should do ill to
provoke all the Inhabitants of that Country, with whom they held commerce,
whereby the Venetian Navigation might be hindered and disturbed, they abstained
from that advice. But to free the Commonwealth from any note of infamy, which
they might seem to have contracted through the cowardice or ignorance of one
Officer, Dandalo having first been carried to Constantinople, from whence,
chiefly by Gritti's means, he was set at liberty, and returned to Venice, was
banished to Zara, for having badly administered the affairs of the Commonwealth.

Another more remarkable accident fell out at the same time, Girolimo da
Canale, Commissary of the Fleet, was gone from Corfu, with twelve Galleys, to
convoy the great Galleys of Merchandise, bent for Soria and Alessandria, and to
secure their Navigation, wherein they were at that time much disturbed by
Pirates; and being all of them come in company together to Candia, when they
came near land, they were forced to cast anchor in a place where the great
Galleys rid some miles distant from the lesser. Being in this posture at
Sunsetting on all Saints day, some Vessels were discovered making toward
them, by those that were on the Topmast in the greater Galleys. The Commissary
being soon advertized hereof by Daniele Bragadine, Captain of the Galleys that
were bent for Alexandria, the Commissary thinking that they were Pirates,
generously resolved to put to Sea with his Convoy, and to fight them* This his
suspicion was increased, by the news he heard of what way the Turkish Fleet
took; which being gone from Modone, to winter at Constantinople, the Pirates
were dismissed; who at such times, go in greater numbers, and more licentiously
a Free-booting. The Comm^ssary was the more encouraged, because his Galleys
were very well provided with old Mariners, the most of them being of Dalmatia,
and well armed; but when he was gotten far out to Sea, he found he had only
seven of his Galleys with him; for the rest, were it either that the rowers
were not of equal strength and discipline, or that their Captains were not
alike courageous, tarried behind.

The Commissary not being any ways abashed hereat, playing the part of a good
Commander, and skilful Seaman, commanded that all the Galleys which were with
him should set up two Lanthorns a p^ece, to make the Enemy believe the number
of his Vessels were more. Then staying in sight of them, he resolved to let all
their Galleys pass by him, that he might have the wind of them, and fall upon
them at advantage. These were twelve Turkish Galleys commanded by a Son of the
Moor of Alexandrias, one of Solimans Captains, who when the Fleet was
dissolved, returned with those Galleys to his Guard of Barbary. The young Moor,
when he saw our Galleys, were it either that he never intended to come nearer
the Island, or to commit any pillage, or that seeing so many Lanthorns in our
Galleys, he was afraid and durst not do it, steering on his course, past by the
Commissaries Galleys; who plying his Oars followed the Turkish Galleys in the
Rear, and began to shoot at them, both on the Flank and poop, and did much
prejudice them, not receiving any harm himself by the Turks Artillery by reason
of his Station. The first of our Galleys that grapell'd was the Admiral, which
luckily light upon the Moors Admiral, between whom a close and dangerous fight
began. Many Janesaries were upon this Gally, who for a long time valiantly
with-stood the assault, but there was another Gally which kept close to the
Commissaries Admiral, from whence he was continually supplied with Soldiers,
to make good the conflict; so as the young Moor being sorely wounded, and
dispairing of being able to defend his Gally any longer, threw himself into the
Sea, and sought to save himself, in some other of his Galleys; but being taken
by our men, and with much ado making himself known, he obtained his life, but
his Gally became our prey, and was delivered by the Commissary to the Master of
the next Gally, whilst he himself with the rest pursued the victory: In fine,
four of them were taken, two sunk, and the rest hoysting all their sails, saved
themselves early from the danger. The Turkish Admiral, when he saw our Galleys
assault him on the Flank, hoysted sail, and sought to save himself, but his
sails being burnt and consumed by certain artificial fireworks shot from out
our Commissaries Gally, and his Rudder being by and by born away by a
Cannon-^hot, he was forced to stay, and to endeavor his safety by fighting.

The Soldiers and common people of Candia, were well pleased with this
success, but the Magistrates and graver sort of people, were as much
displeased, considering that the Galleys which were taken, were no Pirates
Vessels, but belonging to Soliman, a powerful Prince, who it was feared might
hold the peace made between him and the Commonwealth, violated by this act,
and might easily be provoked to make war against her Territories. Wherefore the
Magistrates of Candia, and Sea Captains meeting together, they resolved to send
the Galleys immediately back to Barbary, and took order the mean while for
curing the Turkish Captain, using him civilly, and excusing their fault by the
error of night.

When this News came to Venice, the Senators were for the same cause greatly
troubled, and the rather, for that the Harvest proving very bad this year, and
they having hoped to feed the numerous Inhabitants of the City, with corn which
they expected out of Turkey, from whence they had not only obtained
transportation of corn, but had begun to load diverse of their ships
therewithal, they feared lest this offense might be done unseasonably: For the
Turkish Officers who were upon the shore side, had already, without expecting
any farther Orders from the Court, embargode the Venetian ships, which were at
the loading places, ready to carry corn away. For this it was proposed by some,
that another Commissary should be chosen in lieu of ^anal^, who should be
deprived of that place, and sent for back, to give an account of what he had
done. But this action was by others stoutly defended, as done by military
reason, and worthy to be rewarded, not punished; for that it did not become the
dignity and honor of the Comm^nwealth, which was so highly esteemed, to
punish, or but to appear inclined to punish such servants, who behaving
themselves well and valiantly, had discharged the trust imposed in them
faithfully. Thus these proposals being laid aside, it was resolved by a joint
consent, to send Daniel de Fedirici, Secretary to the Pregadi, to
Constantinople, who was a discreet man, and well experienced in other affairs;
that he might justify what was done, viva voce, to the Bascia, and to Solimans
self; showing the necessity which had enforced our Captain, out of apprehension
of the armed Vessels which came so near him, and by the darkness of the night,
to fight their friends Galleys; and that on the other side, the sudden sending
back of those, and the good usage of their Captain, might sufficiently prove
their sincere good will toward the Grand Signior. The admittance of these
things was much furthered by the good offices done by Ebrahim and Gritti; but
especially by the new war of Persia, on which Soliman having already fixed his
mind, he would not promote any thing that might divert him from it. Thus these
commotions being honorably appeased at Constantinople, Canale reaped the more
praise and glory; who dying not long after in the same charge, the Senate in
acknowledgment of his long and faithful service, granted a certain annual
Revenue in fee, during Canales life time, to his Son Antonio, in the Island of
Corfu. Canale was certainly a gallant man in his time, and very famous for his
experience in Sea affairs, and for his noble daring, which made him easily
attempt whatsoever difficulties.

These things happened in the Venetian Fleet, but that of the Emperors, after it
had tarried long about Naples and Messina, went boldly on to relieve Corone,
though her Captains knew, that the Enemy was very strong in those Seas: And
they were successful therein, for according to their intention, they brought
relief to their men who were besieged in Corone, and were already reduced to
the utmost extremity: But conceiving some better hopes afterward of greater
success and victory against the Turkish Fleet, which leaving the way open to
its Enemies, did by its direct running away, declare the weakness, and fear
thereof, it proved by fault of the chief Commander, or by the perpetual
misfortune of Christendom, vain, and to no purpose. Nay it may be said, that
this cowardice of the Turkish Commanders proved more prejudicial to
Christendom; for Soliman, not satisfied with those to whom he had committed the
Government of his Fleet, and blaming their fear and want of experience, sent
for Cariadino, nicknamed Barbarossa, who of a Pyrate, being become a Prince,
did then command over the City of Algiers, and gave him the charge of his
maritime affairs. This man was very expert at the Mariners art, and having
roved a long time with armed ships upon the Sea, knew very particularly all the
Christian situations, and Seacoasts about Barbary; and had got a great repute,
by many prosperous successes against the Moors in the African Rivers, and
particularly by the rout which he gave the Spanish Galleys as they past four
years before under the Government of Don Hugo di Moncada, to Genua, to find out
Doria. He may be said to be the first that taught the Turks how to manage a
Fleet and all things else belonging to the maritime Militia, who had hitherto
minded the grounding, and increasing of their power only by Land Armies. By his
counsel the arming of Galleys with Slaves was first instituted, which were
formerly used to be armed with raw and unexperienced men; and by him were many
other orders made, whereby the Turkish Fleets are become more formidable to
Christian Princes. Soliman being resolved to make use of this man, gave the
Venetians quick notice thereof, to the end that they might treat with him, if
they should meet him hereafter, as with one that appertained to his Court,
knowing that he was continually pursued by their Galleys, as one who had done
them much prejudice. And truly he was afterward an Instrument of much
mischief to Christendom, and particularly to the State of Venice, as shall be
made known by what succeeded.

At this time, for all these eminent dangers that threatened Christendom, the
Pope was notwithstanding so intent, and more then ever fervent in his
accustomed desires, of exalting his Nephews, and his Family, as he had had
secret Treaties with the King of France, of a Marriage between Katharine, to
his Nephew Lorenzo de Medici, and Henry Duke of Orleans, the King's second Son,
to effect the which, he promised the King to come to Nize. The News of this
interview being noised abroad, though the business which was there to be
treated of was not certainly known, did much trouble the Venetians; chiefly,
because it was given out, that the Emperor was to meet there also. The actions
of these Princes were therefore diligently observed by the Senators, who had
learned by what had passed at the Diet at Cambrai, and by more recent affairs,
that all things ought to be apprehended, and suspected, from the ambition of
Princes. But the interview which should have been in July, being put off to
September, the true cause of this meeting was discovered; for the better
ordering whereof, the Bishop of Faenza met at Nize for the Pope, and Monsieur
Le Grand for the King, which freed the Venetians of their jealousies. The Pope
acquainted them afterward with his design, and with the cause thereof;
wherein not concealing his intention of his Neeces Marriage any longer, he
thought to disguise it in other colors; and that he did not look so much at
his own particular interest in this Treaty, as at the common good, and the
safety of Italy: Which he knew, and which the Senate had formerly well
considered, did consist in nothing more, then in keeping the Forces of these
two Princes as equally balanced as might be; so as the power of the one, might
be counterpoysed by the others; wherefore doubting lest the King of France
despairing of the Italian Princes friendship, might not give over all thoughts
of the affairs of Italy, and so Caesar might be confirmed in his grandetsa, and
be made as it were Arbitrator of all things, he had desired to tie himself in
the band of alliance with him, as he had done with Caesar; so as his authority
might be still the greater with both the one and the other of them, upon all
occasions. But though the Venetians knew these reasons, yet thinking that they
had discharged themselves sufficiently therein, by refusing the new League
proposed by Caesar, whereby the King of France might hope in time to alienate
them wholly from him; and they desiring quiet at this time, whereby the
Commonwealth might take breath, after so long and so sore molestations, and
put themselves into a better condition; all things must needs be troublesome to
them, whereby this quiet might too soon be disturbed; which they thought might
happen the more easily by this alliance between the Pope and King of France;
for that having found by many experiences, that the desire of aggrandizing his
Family, prevailed with the Pope above all other affections, they thought he
might easily be drawn by the King of France, to favor the affairs of Milan;
the King promising him to do it for the Duke of Orleans, now become his Nephew.
But though both the Interview, and the Marriage were had, the Pope not going to
Nize to meet the King, but to Marcelles, to please him the more, where the
Marriage was celebrated with a great deal of Pomp; yet these aspiring thoughts
which were suspected, succeeded not; by reason of diverse accidents which happened
both before and after the Popes death, which ensued not long after. Thus Italy
remained quiet, and the Venetians free from being bound to take up Arms. The
commotions in Germany, helped, as was thought, to keep the Pope from thinking
of Novelties; for the Lansgrave of Hesse, having (together with many other
Protestant Princes) raised many men, to reinvest Ulderick, Duke of Wittenbergh
in his State, it was said, that they meant to pass therewith into Austria,
against Ferdinand, and to come from thence into Italy; a thing which the
Germans did much desire, and by the very name whereof, their Army became the
greater. But these tumults were appeased, by the agreement made with the King
of the Romans, against whom their chiefest quarrel was, for his possessing the
Territories of the Duke of Wittenbergh.

Thus Italy enjoyd great quiet, and the Commonwealth was on this side free
from trouble. But for the matters of Sea, they were at continual expense, and
full of State jealousies; so as she could not be said to enjoy the benefit of
peace perfectly.

The next ensuing year of 1534. was not freer from the voyages of Fleets, and
from these suspicions, then were the preceding years, for a powerful Fleet was
prepared at Constantinople, which was likely to be the more formidable, in that
it was to be commanded by one so valiant and so well experienced as Cariadino
has been said to be. Great store of armed Vessels were likewise provided in
the West: for Charles, thinking that the Turks would turn their forces chiefly
against his Territories, did all he could to increase his Fleet, so as it might
be able to resist them; and the King of France, who grew daily more impatient
of being in peace, armed 30 Galleys at Marcelles, to what end it was not yet
known. Many Frigates were also rigged on the Coasts of Barbary, not only to
pillage, but to join with the Turkish Fleet, and to adhere to Cariadino; and
amongst other Pirates, Sinam Cifut, a renegado, surnamed Il Giudco, was very
famous, as being a bold man, and very well experienced at Sea affairs.

Wherefore the Pope, to secure his channels from these Incursions, and, as some
thought, out of other designs, armed ten Galleys. These so many Fleets made
the Venetians very jealous, and forced them to be at great expense in
increasing the number of their Galleys, and of their Garrisons upon the Sea
coasts. Wherefore being necessitated to use all helps, by reason of so many
extraordinary expenses, they had recourse unto the Pope again, that they might
be permitted to raise an hundred thousand Ducats, for these public, and
important necessities, out of the revenues of the Clergy of their
Commonwealth.

There were some, who having found the Pope to be very hard to be brought to
this, advised, that either the State might raise these moneys of themselves, or
that they should be a little more urgent with the Pope; alleging that great
store of wealth was appropriated to the Church in their State; which being
free, and exempt from all public contributions, the rest of the Country was
subject to insupportable grievances, and yet the charges of Fleets and
Soldiers was raised for the general freedoms and possessions: and that it
was not to be believed, that it was the intention of those pious men, who had
thus endowed the Churches, to destroy the Commonwealth thereby, by depriving
her of making use of the revenues of any particular men, whereby the public
Treasury was maintained: That they found the Pope to be ill affected to their
Commonwealth, and the affairs thereof, which had made him often deny these so
reasonable requests, by still interposing new delays, and difficulties.

Yet such was the Senators zeal to religion, and their respect such to the
Apostolic sea, as suffering these to overcome all other considerations, these
men's advice was not listened unto; but the major part of the Senators did
resolutely affirm;

That it did not become that Commonwealth, which was borne and continued
Christian, and had been perpetually obedient, and kept joined to the Church and
Pope of Rome, whereby she had purchased great and exemplary glory; to do now
any thing which might detract from her so many former meritorious actions, or
to differ from what she had been for so many preceding years, by seizing upon
the Churches revenues, or by violating therein the Pope's will: That the
Commonwealth had governed and sustained her self in harder times then these,
without any such means, or using any such scandalous courses: That they were
not to distrust, but that he who sees the hearts of men, and who is able to do
all things, would even in greater necessities, furnish them by unknown ways,
with much more prevalent means, then those weak ones, which they sought to
find out by such inhumane and dangerous counsels: That if the Pope should
continue in his wonted obdurancie, the wisdom of the Venetian Senate ought to
appear both before God and man, to be so much the more pious and mature.

This opinion prevayling, and they continuing to proceed with the Pope with all
humanity and reverence, they at last obtained a subsidy of one hundred
thousand Ducats to be raised from the Clergy; a thing not of so much esteem
in it self, as that diverse difficulties being thereby overcome, it was thought,
the like might be come by the more easily afterward; as also, that it argued
the Popes good opinion of the Commonwealth. Moneys being raised by this means,
and by many other ways, the Senate minded the increase of their Galleys,
(which were still commanded by General Capello,) and the sending of Foot into
their Islands, and Maritime Towns, that their affairs might be safe, and that
they might expect what the Issue of so many Fleets would be.

The Turks ceased not, whilst their Fleet was preparing, to attempt the
regaining of Corone by land Forces, wherewith they did besiege it so closely,
as the Spanish Soldiers growing impatient, and being almost desperate by
reason of their so great sufferings in almost all things, sallyed out to
assault the Turkish Camp: but succeeding ill therein, (for they were worsted by
the enemy) lost many of their men, and were forced to retreat back into the
Fort: They found themselves by these losses, and by the pestilence, reduced to
so small a number, as when the ships arrived which brought relief from Cicily,
the Spanish Commanders despairing to be able to maintain the Fort any longer,
got into the same ships, and left the Town in the power of the Turks. Yet it
was a common opinion, and not unlikely, that this was done by express order
from the Emperor; who knowing, that he could not maintain that place, which
was environed by the enemies forces, but by continual great expense, and with
small hopes of further progress; resolved to keep it no longer, to but little
purpose. The loss of Corone proved grievous to the Venetians in one respect,
since they saw the little hopes which they and the other Christian Princes had
of keeping the Turks under; seeing they were not able to keep what they had
got: But, on the other side, finding that Corone, though possessed by the
Christians, not to be a situation sufficient to overcome so many difficulties,
nor to attempt any thing against the Turks, with any hope of considerable
profit: and that, on the contrary, this place afforded occasion of many
scandals, and was apparently dangerous to draw them into another war, the
Imperial Fleets being upon this occasion to frequent their seas, which would
cause great jealousies in the Turks, this did a little allay their sorrow, for
the loss of that City. Cariadino being this mean while put to Sea with an
hundred sail, and come very near the mouth of our Gulf, the Venetian General,
who watched his ways, prepared according to the Senates former orders, to draw
more inward, that he might not abandon the custody, and safety of the Gulf: But
the Turkish Fleet steering its course toward the Tirrhen Sea, made for the
shore of Calavria, and landing suddenly, did not only plunder the Country, but
took two Towns on the Sea side, though of no great value; great was the fear
which possessed the minds of all that were in Naples, and in Rome, by the
Fleets coming into these parts. For had Cariadino, pleased to bend his course
toward these Cities, the inhabitants wanting soldiers, and being in great
confusion, had neither power, nor will to withstand so unexpected an assault.
But the Turks taking many prizes, went to the Island of Ponts, where taking in
water for their occasions, they went from thence to the Affrican rivers, to
effect their chief design, which was to assault Amuleasses, King of Tunis,
Cariadino was very well informed of all the affairs of that Country, of the
situations, places, the Prince his forces, and how the people stood affected
toward him. Wherefore using both force and fraud, he hoped to compass his end
easily, as he did. He gave out, that he brought along with him, Rosette the
Kings brother, whose name he knew those people would be very well pleased with;
and falling upon the Enemy, and upon the City, where he knew they were weakest,
after some variety of fortune, at last he took Tunis.

At this time the other Fleets did not any great matters; but it happened that it
behoved the Venetians Commissary to proceed with violence against some Multa
Vessels, and to rebuke their Captains, who was Phillippo Mazza, Knight of
Jerusalem; who having rashly not only passed through the Eastern Seas with
armed Vessels, but even entered into the Gulf, pillaging not only the Turkish
Bottomes, but those of the Christians also, was taken by the Captain of the
Gulf, and sent to Venice; where his cause being to be heard before the
Consiglio di quaranta criminale -- to whom the business was by the Senate
referred, he, who had his liberty upon Bail, not waiting for his sentence, fled
away with three Pinnaces, and with much arrogance, and neglect of the
Commonwealth, continued doing mischief. Wherefore the Commissary, who watched
his ways narrowly, lighting upon him at unawares, caused his head to be cut
off. The Turkish staves were set at liberty, and sent to Constantinople, the
Pinnace wherein Mazza was burnt; the other two were soon after sen^ to the
Emperor, who desired them; who seeming at first to be somewhat troubled at
this accident, because the Malteses had put themselves under his protection;
being better informed of the action and of the occasion thereof, was pacified,
and the great Master of Malta, blamed Mazza's action, as done not only without
his leave, but contrary to his orders.

Whilst these things went thus, the Pope had been troubled with long sickness,
whereof he dyed in the height of all his prosperity.

He was a Prince of high, but unsettled thoughts; addicted beyond measure to
his own affections; so as saffering himself to be mastered, sometimes by fear,
sometimes by covetousness, he appeared various and inconstant in his actions;
chiefly in his friendship with Princes, and with the Commonwealth, he preserved
peace and union a long time, more for his own interest, then out of any good
will; and because the Senate, according at the present condition of times
required, would not give him any the least cause of breaking with them, by
their being obedient to him in all things.

Alexander Fernese a Roman, and an ancient Cardinal, and one much esteemed in
the Court, succeeded him in the Popedom, who took to him the name of Paul the
Third. Diverse were the conceptions which were had of the new Pope; but most
were of opinion, that continuing to keep neutral amongst Princes, as he had
done for fifty years together, whilst he was Cardinal, and which was no small
cause of bringing him to this supreme dignity, he would only mind the common
good, without siding with my Prince, that he might the better intend the peace
and quiet of Italy. Which the Venetians did not dislike, who desired to see a
fair settlement made of all things, and persuaded themselves by reason of the
good affection which he seemed always to bear to the Commonwealth before his
being Pope, that if he should forego this his neutrality, he would rather
confirm the Leagues which they made first with his Predecessor Clement, then
think upon any new affairs. They therefore resolved to send him eight
Ambassadors; Marco Minio, Tomaso Mocenico, Nicolo Tiepoli, Ieronimo Pesaro,
Iovan Badoaro, Gasparo Contarini, Frederico Rini^ro and Lorenzo Bragadine: To
whom they gave no other employment, save according to the usual custom, to
promise obedience to the new Pope, not thinking it fit to demand any thing till
they might discover somewhat of his thoughts, since this his new fortune and
dignity. But the Emperor being more desirous to know what his designs might
be, and being still apprehensive of the French proceedings, tried the Pope
presently, touching the renewing of the League which he had made with his
Predecessor: Whereunto that he might the more easily persuade him, he used
means likewise to the Venetians, that they would re-confirm their first
capitulations with him; exhorting them thereunto out of the consideration of
the quiet of Italy, which they so much desired. And the which, if they would
join with him, they should be able to make good against any commotions of the
French, though the new Pope should dissent from it; and that nothing could
prevail more to make Paul side with them in the beginning of this his Popedom,
then to see this union and good intelligence between the Commonwealth and him;
whereby it would behove the other Potentates of Italy to depend upon them. To
the which the Venetians neither totally assenting, nor dissenting, as being far
from any innovation, they showed first that there was no neessity to re-confirm
the League, and then, that they would be very ready to do it, if it should be
needful; and thus ended the year 1534.

The next year the Pope, who diligently attended all weighty affairs, declared
himself more openly, that he would interpose in making peace between Caesar and
the King of France, to whose Courts be sent express Legates. But he seemed to be
chiefly mindful of the affairs of Italy, and particularly of the protection of
the Commonwealth; notwithstanding, (as all humane actions, especially those of
Princes, are various, and accidentally changeable) an occasion happened of
suddenly altering this good intention of the Popes, with danger of troubling
the peace of Italy.

In the time of the vacancy of the Popedom, the marriage was celebrated
between Guido Ubaldo, Son to Francisco Maria, Duke of Urbine, and Iulia sole
daughter to Iovan Maria Varano, Duke of Camerino, upon whom her fathers estate
descended. This Match was at first approved of by Paul, and it was thought that
affairs would pass peaceably on. But soon after, the Pope being either
persuaded to the contrary by others, or falling of himself (as it is often seen
in those who are got to great prosperity) into greater and higher thoughts;
began to think this a fit occasion to exalt his house, to which this fee-farm
of the Church was to be granted, as a beginning to raise it above the condition
of private men. He therefore declared openly, that he would not suffer that the
Dukedom of Camerino should be possessed (as he said) contrary to reason, by
the Duke of Urbine, since it appertained only to him to dispose thereof, as of
a Fee-farm escheated to the Church. This did much trouble the Venetians, who
had taken the Duke of Urbine into their protection, and who bare greet good
will to him, and to his family, for the good service he had done unto the
Commonwealth: For the Pope, to boot with Ecclesiastical censures, prepared to
take up temporal Arms, and had raised a good number of Foot, to hinder the
fortifying of Camerino, and the Garrison which the Duke was preparing to put
thereinto. They therefore used all the means they could to appease the Pope,
and the rather, because the Duke willingly condiscended that the business might
be decided by reason. But the Pope listening neither to entreaties nor to
reason, said, he could not govern himself herein, otherwise then reason of
State did advise him; and not dissembling his intentions, he said he would
regain that, by force of Arms, which was taken from him: A thing which was
thought by all men to be of great concernment the condition of these times
being considered, by reason of the so many troubles of Christendom, of the
Turkish Forces, and of the new Heresies, which did increase apace in many noble
Provinces. Therefore the Venetians, not leaving any thing undone, to extinguish
this small spark, which might burst forth into a greater combustion,
represented it to Caesar, entreating him to interpose his authority, in
maintaining that peace throughout all Italy, of which, to his so great praise,
he had been the chief Author. This being listened unto by Caesar, who
interceded fervently therein with the Pope, helped very much to allay his very
first heat; but it was thought he was the more pacified by other proposals made
by those that favored the Duke, and the Venetians, of greater moment for the
advancement of his house; that he might give a noble fortune in Romagna, to his
son Pietro Luigi, and restore the Cities of Ravenna and Cervi^ to the
Venetians, to the end, that the State and person of Piero Luigi, might be taken
into protection by the Venetians, whereby the new Prince might be in great
safety; for it was not to be doubted, but that the Venetians, both in gratitude
for the favor received, and for their own interests, (since it would be better
for them to have a particular person be Lord of that State, then the Church)
would upon all occasions, maintain the greatness of the Family of Farnese. This
offer being willingly listened unto by the Pope, hoping to meet with some
greater preferment for Luigi, did satisfy his ambition, till some better
opportunity might be met with all to effect his desire. He therefore began to
value the Counsel of the Venetians the better, and in particular favor to
them, was content, that the deciding of the difference concerning the state of
Camerino, should be deferred to another time. But there were many greater
things which troubled the cogitations of Princes at this time; not without some
molestation to the Venetian Senate; For Caesar prepared a great Fleet, to pass
therewith into Affri^^, to recover (...). He was eagerly bent upon this
enterprise, moved thereunto chiefly by reason of State, to secure the Kingdom
of Naples; which Cariadino did insolently threaten to assault: and also not to
suffer the Turks to grow more powerful in these parts, whereby they might
infest; and trouble the rivers of Spain: which made his Subjects much desire
this enterprise. But he was hereunto incited also by a great desire of warlike
honor; thinking it a thing becoming so great a King as himself, to assist the
forlorn King Amuleasses, and to repossess him of the State whereof he was
legitimate Lord: though others, seeking to detract from his glory said, that he
sought hereby to shun the renewing war in Hungary, and to evade the recovery of
what the Turks had taken from his brother Ferdinando, fearing to encounter the
Turkish Armies. He gave a particular account of all these his designs, to the
Venetian Senate, seeming very zealous of the common good of Christendom, but
particularly, a desire of assisting the Commonwealth, and of keeping
friendship with her. Wherefore, to satisfy him, the League was renewed in the
very self same terms, as was contained in that of Bolognia, to remove all
doubts, that it might be nulled or weakened by Pope Clement's death. And their
Ambassador Mark Antonio Contarini, the more to show the continuance of their
Amity, was commanded to follow the Emperor whithersoever he should go, as he
accordingly did: and processions were made by all the religious orders,
throughout Venice, and prayers poured out to God, for the happy success of this
business. This so great preparation begot several suspicions in the Turks,
which were augmented by the sinister Offices done by John Forreste, the French
Ambassador at Constantinople; who very falsely, but with efficacious reasons,
went about to make the Bashaws believe, that the Venetians egged the Emperor
on, to go with those so great forces into Greece, against Soliman's dominions.

And notwithstanding the King proceeded otherwise by his Ambassador at Venice,
desiring the Senators, out of great Zeal, (as he would have it believed) to
their service, to be very vigilant in observing Caesar 's ways; saying, that
they might very well be jealous of this so great preparation for a Fleet, and
that many things might be said thereof, tending to the prejudice and eminent
danger of the Commonwealth; that they might upon all occasions make use of his
Forces, and promise unto themselves all things from his kingdom; and that he
desired to witness this unto them again, to the end that they might rely upon
these his offers, as might be most useful and advantageous for them.

The Senators were not a little troubled hereat, finding clearly, that all
this tended only to make the Commonwealth mistrustful, and peradventure, to
move them to open war, either with Caesar, or Soliman* wherefore they should be
forced to have recourse to France, either for their intercession with the
Turks, or for their assistance against the Imperialists.

Yet concealing these their suspicions in part, they returned thanks to the
King, for these his friendly offers, which, though they did not think they
should now need, yet they acknowledged, that thereby the Commonwealths
obligations to that Crown were increased: But they complained much of the bad
Offices done them by his Ambassador at Constantinople, which were so contrary
to what was true, and so destructive to their affairs.

The King hearing this, sought to free himself from fault, by denying, that he
had given any such commission to his Ambassador. But it was very certain, that
the King of France had already begun to hold some secret intelligence with the
Turks, concerning things of great concernment, and very prejudicial to
Christendom. And as Soliman, being now busied in the wars of Persia, de^err'd
the conclusion of this business, and the future evils, so was it foreseen, that
he would the more easily embrace the King of France, his proposals; for, that
being become more haughty by his having victoriously overrun Persia with his
Forces, he would be the more desirous to abate Cesars greatness and glory: as
also, that finding how much his people had suffered by the length and
difficulty of their march, and how much the Persian Forces were to be vallued,
by which he had been much indammaged in his return, he would seek to turn his
war elsewhere. But the endeavors of the French could not yet prevail so much
against the Venetians, as to trouble their peace; nay, Soliman (who was got so
far with his Army into the confines of Persia, as that he had plundered the
City of Tawris, the Regal seat of those Kings, and then passing into Babylonia,
had driven the Persian garrison out of Babylon, and brought that City into his
own power,) gave a particular account to the Senate of his prosperous
successes, and of his putting the enemy to flight; which though it were in high
terms, as concerning the enemy, exaggerating their loss, and his victories,
yet was it with great show of good and continued friendship to the
Commonwealth. But it was given out, that presently upon his return to
Constantinople, he would rigg out a very great Fleet, to which purpose he had
sent for Cariadino, and given other orders, which were evident signs, that he
would not give over waging war. And in this Interim, the winter being over,
Caesar had disposed of all things for the Affrican enterprise, and had embarked
himself at Barcellona, whether his whole Fleet was come, consisting of three
hundred sail of several ships, commanded by Prince Doria, and wherein were
forty thousand fighting men, besides a multitude of Mariners, and slaves, and
he was accompanied by the chief Lords of Spain, and by the Infant of Portugal,
who brought eighty sail of ships to Barcellone.

The Fleet Sailed first to Sardignia and put in at Caglieri, where necessary
orders being given for the administration of War, it passed on to the
Carthagenian shore (this Country is called Martia, famous for the ancient and
noble seat of the Commonwealth of Carthage) where coming to Land near Goletta,
he suddenly landed his Army, and encamped before it; the taking of this place
being thought requisite toward the taking of Tunis. The Turkish Galleys in
Goletta made valient resistance; but the Fort being almost quite thrown down by
Cannon shot, the Town fell into the Spaniards hands. Which is a Citadel
consisting of many Bastions, lying almost in the mouth of the Channel, where
the Sea water makes a Lake, upon which stands the City of Tunis, about twelve
miles from the Sea. The Spaniards entering into this Lake, they took without any
manner of contest, about 50 Sail of Galleys, and Flie-boates, which were put
there by Cariadino, as a safe place. Cariadino was so discouraged at this loss,
as though coming at first out of Tunis with his Army, he showed as if he would
give the Emperor Battle, yet he soon retreated, into the Town of Bona; and not
thinking himself safe there neither, for he heard* he was pursued by Doria,
passed into Algiers. The Cities of Tunis, and Bona though they were very well
Garrisoned, when they say themselves abandoned by their chie^ Commander, fell
soon and easily into the power of the Spaniards* but Cariadino escaped all
these dangers, being reserved as a scourge to Christendom for the sins thereof;
and he went soon after to Constantinople, whether he was sent for, and meeting
Soliman, before he was come, thither with his Persian Army, he excused the loss
of the Kingdom as well as he could, and was by him received into grace again,
and made Governor of his Fleet. And Caesar parting victoriously from Africa,
gave the Kingdom of Tunis which he had won (a noble gift) to Amuleasses, upon
obligation of paying him every year as his Fuditory, 6 Barbary Mares, 12.
Falcons, and 12000 Crowns, for the pay of 1000 Spanish Foot, to be kept as an
ordinary Garrison in Goletta, and so sailed with his whole Fleet into Sicily:
Where having tarried a good while in Palermo, and Messina, he dismissed the
greatest part of his Ships and disbanded his Army, keeping only 2000 Foot for
his Guard; which things being done he wintered in Naples where he was received
with extraordinary honor, and entertained with many Solemn shows; these
demonstrations of joy being made the greater, for that never Emperor was seen
before in that Kingdom; and by reason of the marriage which was at this time
there consummated, between his natural daughter the Lady Margeret, and
Alexander de Medici Duke of Florence. Diverse Princes and Princes Ambassadors,
came to Naples to meet him; and the Commonwealth, as she had done formerly
sent four Ambassadors thither, Marco ^oscari, Iovan Delphino, Vicenzo Grimani,
and Thomaso Contarini, ^ho were to congratulate his Affrican Victory, and
acquisitions; which truly were very acceptable to the Venetians: For though the
increasing of Cesar's power, was, being considered in it self, but bad tidings,
and much to be suspected in a Prince so highly spirited, and so powerful as was
Charles, yet was it welcome, since thereby his greatness did counterpoise the
like of the Ottoman family, and made for the good of Christendom, and
especially for the Venetians, who were most exposed to the Turkish forces.

Whilst the Emperor was busied in these affairs, Francisco Sforza Duke of
Milan died, leaving no Heirs male behind him, to inherit that State; who being
dead, the Senate of Milan gave the care of that State to Antonio da Leva, who
was to administer it in the name of the Duchess Dowager, till Cesars mind
might be known: Who graciously receiving the Duchess, who went to meet him at
Naples, seemed to be much troubled at the Dukes death, either for the love he
bore him, or for fear lest this accident might trouble the peace of Italy; or
out of dissembling, seeking hereby to show that he did not aspire unto that
State. But the Venetians were much more truly grieved hereat; who having long,
and with much expense, maintained war, to the end that that State might have a
particular Lord of its own, and one who might be an Italian, saw that this
their desire grew doubtful, and dangerous by the Dukes death: and that
occasion, and peradventure, necessity might thereby arise of reassuming Arms.
Therefore when Caesar was come to Naples, they acquainted him with their
desires, and with the affairs of Italy, desiring him to find out some means of
preserving that peace which he himself had introduced, and seemed to desire so
much. To which Caesar answered, That as the care of providing for that State
which held in Fee of him, did belong to him, so he desired to do what might be
acceptable to the Italian Princes, and chiefly to the Venetians; that therefore
he would willingly hear what they could inform him of, that so he might the
better order things for the good of Italy, and according to their intentions.
But the Senate desiring exceedingly that the Dukedom of Milan might be still
governed by one particular man, and not knowing well what Cesars intentions
were therein, nor being willing (though peradventure little to their good) to
offend either him or others, were resolute in their proposal, that some one
should be invested in that State, who should be thought proper for the peace of
Italy: therefore though the four aforesaid Ambassadors went to Naples, they
committed nothing concerning that unto their charge: at which the Emperor
marvelling a little, and desiring to keep fair with the Venetians, as the
occasion required, he promoted new discourse concerning it, concluding finally,
as he had formerly said, that not being as yet resolved on whom to bestow the
Dukedom of Milan, he would willingly hear somewhat proposed herein by the
Senate, and that he would very well consider what they should advise him to
therein: and afterward growing jealous of the proceedings of the French, he
desired the Venetians, that as they had renewed their league with him upon
occasion of the Popes death, so they would do the like now upon the death of
the Duke of Milan; that he desi^^ this, for the better security of the affairs
of Italy, and to take all occasion away from any one that might have a mind to
disturb the quiet which she now enjoyed; and the Venetians desiring the same,
satisfied Caesar therein, and confirmed the League upon the former conditions,
wherein they reserved a place for the Pope, and for him who should be chosen
Duke of Milan. They thought it good to yield to Cesar's first desires, as well
to show their readiness to please him, as likewise, to shun the treating hereof
at Rome, whither Caesar was suddenly to come, which would have given some
suspicion to the Turks; by reason of the usual proposals made by all Popes
against Infidels in their Leagues, though of a long while but of little
advantage. Which reasons being either not well known, or not well considered by
the Pope, he complained of the Venetians, saying, that they had taken this
resolution too soon, and that they ought to have deferred it, till his pleasure
had been known therein, and till the Emperor had been come to Rome. By the
Duke of Milan's death, the King of France soon renewed his ardent desire of
getting that State; preparing therefore for it, he resolved first to try the
Venetians minds concerning it, whose State and Forces were of all other things
most requisite to effect his desires therein. He therefore sent Monsieur de
Biones, Gentleman of his chamber, to Venice, To know what the opinion of the
Senate was, upon this occasion, which (as he said) was now offered, of
securing, and enlarging their Commonwealth. He said, he had forces, moneys,
friends, and all things else, whereby this enterprise might be undertaken with
assured hopes, for which he promised to reward them honorably, if they would
declare themselves his Friends and Confederates: which things it not being
thought fit to listen unto at this time, answer was made in general terms, That
the Commonwealth had always desired peace, and endeavored it, and that it
ought now chiefly to do so, for that it had need of some rest, after so long,
and so sore wars; and because the present troubles of Christendom, by reason of
so many heresies risen in several parts, persuaded rather to the extinguishing
of them, then to the undertaking new Wars; yet they humbly thanked his Majesty
for these offers, and for this his confiding communication, which they would
never be unmindful of, and that a fitter time might peradventure come of making
use thereof.

But the King of France, not foregoing his thoughts of sending his armies into
Italy, to acquire the Dukedom of Milan, was very diligent in raising men, that
he might assault it as much at unawares as he could: and to force his way the
sooner, and the more easily, and that he might therewithal revenge the injuries
which he thought he had received from Charles Philibert, Duke of Savoy, he
thought to enter his State in hostile manner, and to possess himself of his
Towns. The King was ill satisfied with the Duke, for diverse reasons; because he
would not restore unto him the Towns of Nice and Villa Franca, which were
formerly pawned by the Kings of France to the Dukes his predecessors: because
he would not consent, being often desired, that the pretensions which the said
King had to the Dukedom, by his Mother, Madam Lodouica, sister to the Duke,
might be argued by Law: but chiefly, because the Duke, adhering too much to his
wife, who was sister to John King of Portugal, and Isabella, wife to Charles the
Emperor, appeared in all things too partial to his wives brother.

It was hereby seen, that the next year 1536. would prove remarkable, by reason
of the discords between these great Princes, which must prove the original of
great evils. The beginning of this year, the King made the Admiral of France,
Philip Chabotte, Captain General of his Army, and sent him to assault Piamont;
where finding the Country but badly provided for defense, he took Turin,
Fossano, and Pinniorollo, and had taken Vercelli, had not Antonio da Leva, who
was in the State of Milan, speedily advanced, with resolution to succor it,
hindered him. The Emperor was exceedingly offended at these proceedings, and
much incensed against the King of France; so as preparing diligently to raise a
powerful Army against him, he said, he would assault him in his own Kingdom of
France; and being not long after come to Rome, he complained of the King of
France publicly in the Consistory; and exaggerating this new action as much
as he could, he broke out into open rage, saying, he would challenge the King
of France to fight a single combat, that so they might once end so many
quarrels, themselves alone: which things caused much wonder amongst all men,
and destracted much from the praise of these otherwise sage and generous
Princes, since professing never to give way to any thing, yet giving themselves
over to this affect on, they suffered themselves to be led on to many unworthy
actions. The Pope labored exceedingly to reconcile them, who had formerly
treated of many things to that purpose, but in vain: the chief difficulty lay,
in finding out a means which might please them both touching the affairs of
Milan. In which Treaties, though the Venetians interposed themselves (for by
Cesar's pleasure, all things therein were communicated to them) proceedings
were had with great caution, by reason of the aforesaid respects, which were
made the greater by these new accidents; which occasioned some doubts, that the
Emperor to free himself of the troubles of War, and that he might restore the
Duke of Savoy to his State, who being gone to meet him at Naples, entreated him
continually to procure his restitution, would at last make some agreement with
the King of France, who entering Italy again, would not suffer the injuries to
pass unrevenged, which he thought he had received from other Italian Princes.
This was the rather believed, for that the King of France had at the Popes
persuasion, condiscended to send the Cardinal of Lorain to Rome, to treat of
the conditions of Agreement; by whose coming, there was also a cessation of
Arms in Piamont. And in these Treaties, Caesar was contented to yield the
Dukedom of Milan to the King of France, on condition, that Monsieur
d'Angulesme, the Kings third Son, might be thereinto invested by him. But this
business was not fully decided, because the King desired that this State might
not be conferred upon Angulesme, but upon the King's second Son, the Duke of
Orleans; which Caesar absolutely denied to do; alleging that this would not be
to confirm the peace of Italy, which was his desire, but to make way for some
other dangerous novelty, by reason of the pretensions that Orleans had by his
wife Katherin de Medici, to the States of Florence and Urbin. Thus the business
not being perfected, Caesar, who being gone from Rome, tarried some days in
diverse Towns of Tuscany, went forward to Aste; where having assembled all his
chief Commanders, of which the most famous were, Errando di Tolledo, Duke of
Alva, the Marquis Guast^, and Don Ferrante Gonsaga, he advised which might be
the best way to carry on the War; wherein following rather his own desire, then
the reasons and counsel of more experienced men, he resolved to pass with his
Army into Provence; so as mustering all his men at Nice, whither Doria came
also with fifty Galleys to back the Army with his Fleet, he himself came in
person to the same place; from whence penetrating into the confines of France,
he stayed with his Camp about the Town of Aix, not being resolved whither to
bend his course, but intending chiefly to assault either Marcelles, or Ardes;
he spent many days in these his irresolutions, and gave the King (who was come
for this purpose to Lions) time to gather together a powerful Army of Dutch
Foot, and Switzers, to oppose his Forces, and likewise, to get diverse Italian
Commanders to side with him; who having mustered a good many men about
Mirandola, prepared to attempt some novelty in Genua, and to bring it to the
devotion of France; so as Caesar being now to think of defending his own
affairs; and his Army being already much incommodated by the bad temper of the
Air, where it lay encamped, he was forced to retreat, not having done any
thing, but shown a great desire to offend the King of France. But before he
went into Provence, he had sent Rodarigo Davilas to Venice, to inform the
Senate of his preparation for War, and of his design of falling upon France;
and then to entreat them, that they would have those forces in readiness, which
they were by their articles bound to have, that they might speedily march as
occasion should require, to the defense of the State of Milan. To which the
Senate gave this answer, that as they had been ready to renew the League, so
would they be as ready to maintain those things to which they were thereby
bound; that therefore, for what appertained to them, the State of Milan should
not want for defense. So they resolved to raise 6000 foot, to be commanded by
Antonio da Castello, General of the Artillery, by Colonel Babone Naldo, and
others: To which they added 500 light Horse, armed after the Burgonian manner;
ordering, that all these should go to Asala, in the Brescian Territories; to
the end, that upon occasion, they might pass into the Cremonese: and the Duke
of Urbin was sent for from his State, that he might be ready to go in person
with the Army. But after the first Brunt of the French was over, by the Truce
made by the coming of the Cardinal of Lorain, by which it was thought they
would make way to greater Victories, it seemed that the Army, according to the
custom of the Nation, would be lazy, and idle, so as the Venetians were not
necessitated to go out of their own Confines. Yet the King of France seemed ill
satisfied with the Venetians; not that he knew he had any just occasion to be
so, because they had not exceeded the bounds of the Confederacy, but because he
hoped by these complaints, to make them be more reserved in observing those
things which they were engaged to do to Caesar; and that they might abstain from
entering into any new, and straiter capitulation with him: he therefore took
occasion to complain of all things. Cesare Fregoso, having the command of a
Troop of Light Horse, wherewith he was then in Verona, went from thence,
without leave, to Genua, that he might adhere unto the King's party; wherefore
he lost not only his pay, and command, but was banished out of all the
Commonwealths Dominions. The King complained bitterly of this, and of other
such things, because the Venetians went about (as he said) to hinder his
proceedings. And on the other side, Cesar's Agents seeming to resent that some
Foot were dismissed, who were taken into pay, more then needed, interpreted
this, as done to increase the Enemies Army, which was gathering together in
Mirandola. Thus jealous were these Princes the one of the other, in their
having the Commonwealth for their Friend and Confederate.

The Emperor being parted from Provence, came to Genua, intending to pass, (as
he did afterward) into Spain, having left the Marquis of Guasto in Italy, with
twenty thousand Dutch, Spanish, and Italian Foot, in the place of Antonio da
Leva, who was now dead. Other Ambassadors from the Commonwealth came to meet
him at Genua, as Nicolo Tiepoli, Mark Antonio Veniero, Mark Antonio Cornaro,
and Antonio Capello: and he at the same time sent Don Pietro Gonzales di
Mendoza, to Venice, to give an account of the reasons of his return, and of the
desire he had of Peace: Touching which, relating particularly the things which
he Treated of with the King of France, which Treat^es were afterward renewed,
he said, he had given the King three months space to resolve, whether or no he
would accept of the Dukedom of Milan for Monsieur d'Angulesme; who by this
Agreement was to marry the Widow Dowager of Duke Sforza: But that if the King
should not resolve within that time, he intended to give that State either to
Don Luigi, Infant of Portugal, or else, to Emanuel, Son to the Duke of Savoy;
upon which he desired the Venetians opinion. But he added, that for the
establishment of these things, it would be requisite to make a new confederacy
amongst the Italian Princes, without the which, he saw not how he of himself
alone could undergo so great a burden; therefore if they should not condescend
to this, they could not blame him, if failing of this assistance, he should be
forced to betake himself to other Ayds, which would be little to their
satisfaction.

But the Senate being constant to their first resolution, of not declaring
their minds concerning the Dukedom of Milan, unless they might be first assured
of Cesar's pleasure, nor to put themselves into new and greater Obligations,
more then those of the confederacy of Bullognia, which had been oftentimes
renewed; answered, As touching the new Duke of Milan, That Caesar should first
nominate one, and that thereupon the Senate might the better consider both
their own, and the common Interest, and put on the better resolution: and as
for the New League, they alleged the same reasons which they had formerly
done, that it was not necessary: and the same respects concerning the Turks,
which were now strengthened by the fame of the preparations of the Turkish Fleet
for the next year. The Venetians acquainted the Pope with these Treaties and
consultations, wherein they still attested their ancient desire of the peace
and safety of Italy, for which they desired the Pope to be fervent in
interposing his authority: for he having reassumed the thought of the business
of Camerino, seemed to appear somewhat cooler in this other important business:
insomuch as Ascanio Colonna being le^t at Rome, after the Emperors departure
from thence, with a particular charge of having a care of such things as might
concern the quiet of Italy: This Treaty was not pursued, so as the weight of
the business, and the present condition of times seemed to require; the Pope
pitching only on this, that amongst these Princes, he would stand neutral. But
at last, being warned both by the Venetians solicitations, by the still
increasing dangers of the Turkish Fleet, and by his being bound to celebrate
the Council, which was declared to be in Vicenza, instead of Mantua, which was
first chosen to that purpose, and whereunto the Venetians readily yielded: he
resolved to send express Legates to each of these Princes; to treat of the
universal Peace amongst Christian Princes, of the League against the Turks, and
of the celebration of the Council. Agostine Trivultio was sent to the King of
France, and Cardinal Cara^ciolo to Caesar: But these Embassies produced no
better effects then many others had done, for none of all this could be
effected, by reason of diverse difficulties which arose.

The End of the Seventh Book.
THE HISTORY OF VENICE, Written by PAULO PARUTA. BOOK VIII. THE CONTENTS.
THe King of France endeavors to part the Venetians from the Emperor, and to
incite the Turks against him. Losses received in the Commonwealth, by the
subornation of Solimans Officers. Several discourses touching the Turkish
preparations* the Venetians prepare to resist Soliman* so does the Emperor.
Soliman his Army and Flee^^ the Venetians Fleet, and several difficulties
touching the Government thereof. A speech made by Mark Antonio Cornaro,
persuading not to desert the Emperor. Leonardo Emoe, his speech to the
contrary. Soliman bears respect at Sea to the Venetians Territories* Accidents
which alter him therein, and make him declare open war against them: The
Imperial, and the Venetian Fleet, and the success of each of them. How the
Senate resents the accident fallen out with the Turks, and their resolution
thereupon. Soliman makes open war against the Venetians; and what is thereby
done. Corfu described* The Senates actions in resis^^nce of the Turks, against
whom the Christians publish a League. Orders given to the General. The
Spaniards fail therein; the Turks assault Corfu, but at ten days end quit it*
They besiege Naples, and Malvesia, but in vain. Both these places are
described. Barbarossa over-runs the Archipelagus, and takes many Islands
therein: The Venetians besiege Scardona, which yields unto them. Several
thoughts of Princes, the ye^^ 1^37. those of Soliman* of the Emperor, King of
France, Pope, and Venetians, Germany, and the condition thereof. The Senate
consult touching the making, or not making League. Caesar's Ambassador
solicits the Commonwealth to declare enmity to the Turks, but in vain.

THe fire of War being rekindled hotter than before, between the Emperor, and
the King of France, grew to such a hight, as the most barbarous and
Foe-Nations, were called in to the prejudice and ruin of Christendom; and the
very State of Venice behoved to be concerned therein: all her Art and
endeavors, whereby she had fought amidst the troubles and dangers of others,
to preserve her self Newtrall amongst Princes, and to keep friendship and
peace with all, not being able to free her. You may know, by what has already
been related, what the thoughts of Francis, King of France, were, and how he
was bent to leave nothing unessay'd, to weaken the power of Charles the
Emperor; and to revenge the so many injuries which he thought he had received
from him. Wherefore he had oft-times tried the Venetians, and endeavored by
several ways to alienate them from C^sar. And lastly he had sent Monsieur de
Rhodes to Venice, who filling the Senators with great hopes and promises,
labored to make them alter their resolution of continuing in League with the
Emperor, but all to no purpose; the Venetians being as firm in their faith to
Caesar, as they were far from desiring any thing which might disturb the quiet
of Italy. Wherefore Francis failing of this hope, and his anger against Caesar
increasing, for that he had assaulted him within his own Kingdom; and knowing
that he was not able of himself to effect the business of Millan, so long as
it should be defended both by Caesar, and by the Venetians; He thought he could
compass this his desire by nothing better, than by pursuing the friendship
which he had already begun with Soliman; whereby he hoped, either to get the
Venetians to side with him, or else to make them forbear favoring of Caesar;
the reasons being known to be very great, which made the Venetians highly value
Solimans authority: And on the other side, the Emperors forces might be
diverted, and the defense of the State of Millan weakened, by the coming of the
Turkish Fleet into Puglia, or into other Rivers belonging to the Emperors
Dominions. The King therefore turned all his endeavors toward Constantinople,
where though he had his Ambassador, John Foreste resident, he notwithstanding
sent Don Serasino da Gozi of Ragusa, with new, and more efficacious orders, and
with larger promises.

This man meeting often with the chiefest Bashaws, proposed many things to
them, which being represented to Soliman, might make him comply the more easily
with the King demands. As, the greatness of Charles the 5th, the which if not
moderated, would either become formidable, or at least suspicious to all other
Potentates, to the diminution, if not of their States, at least of their
reputation and dignity: the easiness of the attempts that might be made
against him, especially in the Kingdom of Naples, by the convenience of the
country; and since by a short cut at Sea; the Turkish Armies might pass from
Albania into Otranto and at the same time draw near those Rivers with their
Fleet. The general hatre^ which those people bore to the Spaniards Government;
nay, that the despair of some of the chiefest of that Kingdom, was such as
promised readiness to embrace any occasion which might tend to novelty and
change of Government, whereby the way would be opened to the further abatement
of Caesar's power. Agiate and Luftebei, were then of great authority in that
Government, as those who being in the first rank of Bashaws, after they had
with much praise discharged the place of Belgerbei of Asia, which purchased
them much reputation. Luftebei being the grand Signors sisters Husband, and one
of the six Bashaws della Porta, and both of them great enemies to the name of
Christianity, and who often after Ibraims death, had counseled Soliman to turn
his forces upon Christendom, making use of this occasion, and applauding the
French Ambassadors proposalls, much amplifying also the reasons promoted by
him, endeavored to set Soliman upon the Enterprise of Italy. They amongst
other things, minded him of Mahomets example, a wise and valiant Prince, who
with a prosperous beginning, had easily taken the City of Otranto, and by the
terror of his Arms, put all that Country into great confusion, and opened the
way to his acquisition of the noblest part of Christendom, had not death
interrupted his designs.

These things being represented to Soliman, prevailed much with him, who was
ambitions of Glory, excessive proud, and haughty, thinking that it made much
for his honor, that so great a King should have recourse to him for assistance
against another powerful Prince, his Enemy; and thought he had a fit occasion
offered him to forgo his enterprises in India, and Persia, wherein he saw he
consumed many of his men without any great advantage; without lessening his
honor, or the reputation of his forces. He therefore readily promised the
French Ambassador, to molest the Emperors affairs the next summer, with
powerful forces both by Sea and Land: but thinking it of great concernment
toward the effecting of these things, to take the Venetians from off their
friendship and confederacy with Caesar, He resolved to send ^anusbei, one of
the Dragomani della Porta, to Venice, to exhort the Senate, tha^ since there
was a powerful Army and Fleet to go from Constantinople, the Commonwealth
would show her self a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies,
promising that he would see great respect should be given to the affairs of the
Commonwealth, and that he would preserve peace inviolably with them. To which
the Senate did with mature deliberation return answer, That the Commonweal^h
had always fervently desired peace with all Princes, and especially with the
Ottaman Lords, with whom they had ^ad long friendship to the free and
advantageous commerce of subjects* that they did still continue so firm and
constant in the same resolution, as there needed no further declaration
thereof. Soliman seemed well enough pleased with this answer; a Prince, as much
as such qualities can have place in a Barbarian, nobly minded, and for the most
part friend to what was just and honest. But false complaints being made unto
him, by many of his people, (who for their particular respects and interests,
desired an interruption of peace) of diverse actions done by the ministers of
the Commonwealth, with little respect (as they said) to the honor and advantage
of his Empire; they persuaded him to permit, that his Officers might also be
allowed to do some novelties, which might show a mind ill affected to the
Commonwealth, and bring things at last to an open war. Thus many Venetian
Merchants being at Constantinople, and in other parts of the Turkish Dominions,
upon their private occasions; some were imprisoned upon several false
pretentions of delinquency, and had their goods forfeited into the Exchequer:
two Venetian ships were imbargode upon various pretenses, the one belonging to
Alessandro Contarini, taken in the Seas of Cyprus, by the galleys of the guard
of Rhodes, as a Pirates vessel; and another in the havens of Alexandria;
alleging, that they were to make use of it upon important occasions. There
was also a new impost of ten in the hundred laid upon such merchandises as were
wont to be brought by Venetian Merchants from Soria; the public Letters of the
Consul were several times intercepted: and now no longer cloaking their
intentions, Mustafa, one of the chief Bashaws, complaining, that the
Commonwealth was too straightly linkt to their Enemy the Emperor, said, That
she had pulled the anger, and the forces of the grand Signor, upon her.

These things gave just occasion of resentment, and were a pretense of just
war, if Soliman had a mind to take up arms against the Venetians; yet there
were other reasons and arguments, which persuaded to the contrary. It was not
at all likely, that since the Turks might make war against the Emperor only,
who was not very well provided at sea, and might beat his forces, which they
appeared very desirous to do, that they would put a necessity upon the
Venetians, of joining with the Imperialists, and of uniting their forces, which
being very strong at sea, might not only be an hindrance to them, in their
attempts upon other men's Estates, but might endanger their own affairs. That
for the space of thirty eight years, friendship and peace had been so
constantly preserved by the Turks, for these respects, with the Venetians; and
that Soliman had always showed himself most desirous thereof, both by his
words and actions: That there had not as then been any injury done, or any
occasion given on the Venetians side, that he should molest them with Arms;
since the Venetian Senate had wisely and justly, measured the forces of the
Ottaman Empire, and accommodating their thoughts and actions to the condition
of times, had proceeded with great temper and respect toward the Turkish
affairs, so long as the dignity of the Commonwealth might not be injured, and
did temporise as well as she could, with so great and formidable a Potentate;
whom not being able to quell, it would be wisely done to preserve his
friendship, and to wait for the benefit of time, or for the Commonwealth's
better fortune. At this time, Tomaso Mocenico was come Ambassador from the
Commonwealth to Constantinople, to congratulate with Soliman, according to
custom, for his prosperous success in the Persian war, and for his happy
return to that city; who having kissed Soliman's hand, and presented him with
accustomed vestures, was fairly received, and favored by the whole Court,
particularly by Agiace, the first Basshaw, who several times assured him, that
the grand Signor stood very well affected to the Commonwealth, and desired to
continue the ancient peace with the Venetians, if they would correspond with
fitting respect, and with alike good intentions toward him* That it was
Solimans inviolable custom to keep his word, and that it must not be believed,
that he could differ from himself. He therefore very modestly excused the
business concerning Contarini's ship, and the other novelties used toward the
Venetian Merchants and Merchandises, as done without any directions from the
Grand signor, and which should be suddenly remedied. It was likewise famed,
that the Sophi, King of Persia, was ready to march into the field with a
powerful Army, which would force the Turks to turn their forces upon the
confines of Persia; and that the news spread abroad, that the Turks were to
fall upon Christendom, tended rather toward the keeping up a certain
reputation and esteem amongst Christian Princes, than to any resolution he then
had of employing his forces at that time against them. It behoved the Senators
to be very jealous and doubtful, by reason of these so differing reasons, and
so discordant within themselves of the Turks proceedings, being drawn several
ways, sometimes through suspicion of War, sometimes through hopes of peace;
which various affections were very cunningly fomented by the French
Ambassador, who persuaded himself, that by this means, he might make the
Venetians yield to his Kings desire of siding with the French, and to forgo
their friendship with the Emperialists, by which means, he said, they might
secure themselves safely from the dangers threatened by the Turks. But several
were the reports which were given out by the Soldiers and people at
Constantinople, of this business; some affirmed, the grand Signor made this
warlike preparation with a firm resolut^on to pass into the Rivers of Puglia:
others said, that the Fleet was to enter the gulf of Venice, and to attempt
somewhat there against the Emperor: there were some also, who believed these
forces were to go into Barbary, which counsel was known to be given by
Ariadeno, Bashaw, surnamed Barbarossa; and there wanted not those that said, it
went against the Venetians, naming particularly the Island of Corfu. But
whatsoever the intention was, it was most certain, that great preparations were
made, and great care taken therein for men, both by Sea and Land. It was held
for certain, that what of galleys, what of other Vessels, there were above 300
sail to go to Sea, many Instruments and Engines to take Cities, great store of
Ammunition of all sorts, that the Belgerbei of Greece was already gone with
Orders from Constantinople; that very many Soldiers were raised in Scopia, and
that the grand Seigneurs quarters were to be taken up there, who was said to go
himself in person to Vallona, where provision of Biscuit, and of other things,
were providing for the Fleet.

The Venetians being much troubled at these great preparations for War; and by
diverse accidents growing jealous of the Turks fidelity, though the Articles of
peace made many years before, stood yet firm with Soliman, resolved to arm
themselves as strongly as they could; thinking they had no other way to secure
their affairs, than to bereave the Turks of all ways of molesting them, if
they should have a mind to do so. The Senate therefore immediately took 8000
foot into pay, wherewith they increased their Garrisons on the Sea coasts, and
furnished them with Ammunition, that upon occasion that might make their party
good against the Turks. They gave order, that the old galleys in the Arsenall
should be caulked, and that 50 new ones should be built; but they chiefly
minded the re-ordering of their great Galleys, or Galliouns; they stayed some
of their own ships, and some foreign vessels, which were bound for several
voyages, to make use of carrying Garrisons into their forts, and munition for
their Fleet; which being to be numerous and powerful, since the danger did
increase, they resolved to arm 100 Galleys, and to create a Captain-Generall at
Sea; whereunto, according to the custom of the Commonwealth, Giarolomo
Pesaro, a man versed in several employments of the Republic, and principally
in maritime affairs, was chosen by the Conciglio de Pegadi, and confirmed by
the Con^^glio Majore; and there were ten Governors of Galleys chosen by the
council of Ten, who were to fit in council with the General.

But amongst other things, the want of Moneys did much molest them, the public
Exchequer being much exhausted by reason of the late long Wars. Wherefore they
were forced to have recourse to extraordinary means, to raise Moneys sufficient
to serve their occasions. There were three Procurators of St. Mark created, the
supreme degree of the Commonwealth, next to the Duke, Andrea Capello, Girolimo
Bragadino, and Iacopo Cornaro, each of them having assisted at the present
necessity, by the Lone of 12000 Ducats. Great suit was made to the Pope, that,
the urgent necessities of the Commonwealth requiring it, he would give way to
the raising 200000 Ducats out of the Venetian Clergy, by the way of Tenths,
wherein the Pope made several excuses, and pleaded difficulties. Sometimes
seeming not to believe, that Soliman's forces tended to the prejudice of
Christendom, sometimes pleading the Priests poverty. And to make the expense of
arming the Galleys in several places the more supportable, all the schools of
Artificers (these are certain Congregations of men of several Trades, and
Mechanic Arts, assembled together under fraternities, and heads, instituted by
themselves) were commanded to contribute a certain number of men, for the
service of the galleys; and that the Towns under the Dogado; should be
particularly obliged to arm certain Galleys; and that the weighty businesses
which were then in hand, might be more safely, and more maturely advised upon,
to the number of the six Sav^^ of the Council (a Magistracy of great
Authority, and the chief of those whose office it is* to present the Senate
with what they are to treat upon); three others were for the time added upon
this occasion; Tomaso Mocenico, Nicolo Bernardo, and Mark Antonio Cornaro,
three of the chiefest, and best esteemed Senators. In this perplexity, the
Senate forgot not, according to the religious and pious institution of their
Ancestors, to have recourse to divine assistance; whereupon solemn prayers were
ordered throughout all the Churches, and 400 Bushels of wheat were given in
Alms to the poor Friars, that they might pray for a blessing upon their
Counsels, who did consult upon the common good; but the Imperialists were no
less afraid of the Turkish Forces, nor less careful to secure themselves
from them. They sent a great number of Spanish foot into Italy, wherewith to
furnish the Kingdoms of Sicily and Naples, and other places which lay exposed
to the Turkish Fleet. And Andrea Doria, Prince of Melfi, who was then Lord
Admiral of the Emperors Fleet, was ordered to be very diligent in seeing his
galleys put in good order; that he might join with those of Naples and Sicily,
and of the Knights of Jerusalem, which were all to be commanded by him. But
th^se provisions came far short of what was requisite; for Caesar was at the
same time to think of defending his other Dominions, against which the King of
France armed himself strongly. Being come himself in person to Lions, from
whence he forthwith dispatched away 15000 Dutch, and Guascon foot toward Italy.
To divert which designs, Caesar prepared a great Army of 20000 foot, and 8000
Horse in Flanders, to enter the confines of France: but the divulging, that the
French would fall upon Genua, was amongst other things, a great hindrance in
making provision against the Turks; for the Genueses being hereat much
terrified, said, They could not permit that Doria should abandon his Country in
so great danger, and go with his Galleys from thence, which were the very
Nerves of the Imperial Fleet; for the 22 Galleys which were at Barcellona,
were in no good posture to undertake so long a voyage.

Whilst the Christian Princes were thus ordering affairs for their own defense,
the Turks taking occasion from their discords, to trouble Christendom (as they
had often done formerly) and to increase their power and reputation, with
assured hopes of rich booty, had prepared an Army, and a Fleet, to assault the
Territories of other men. Soliman, who being gone in the beginning of March
from Constantinople, had staid some days to pass his time away in hunting at
Andrinopolis, all requisite provisions for the army being in a readiness,
began his journey, and toward the end of June, came to Scopia, a City in
Macedonia, where having staid awhile, and having taken his voyage through the
confines of Albania, he went with all his men to Vallona, by the Ancients,
called Aulo. But the Fleet being already parted from the straits of Galipoli,
was come at the same time to the Island of Cervi, being in number above 300
sail, of which there were 220 Galleys, the rest Galliouns, fly-boats, and other
lesser Vessels; and all men said, that of a long time, there had not been seen
so great a Fleet upon the Sea, nor better appointed, and provided of all
things, especially of Soldiers, there being 12 Sangiacchi aboard, each of
which commanded 800 valiant men, and moreover 4000 Janesiers. Cariadino
commanded this Fleet in chief, for what belonged to the Sea; but the Bashaw
Lufti, who represented the person of the grand Signor, and who had the
Imperial standard assigned unto him, had the supreme command over the
Soldiers, and in ordering the undertakings. What these men's Commissions were,
and what course they were to steer, was not yet known; some said, they had
orders from Soliman, if occasion should offer it self to fight the Venetian
Fleet* others affirmed the contrary, that they were straightly commanded to bear
respect to the Venetians, and their affairs; but the most common opinion was,
that the Turks were to attempt somewhat in Puglia: this mean while, Doria,
being first gone to Civita Vecchia, and not finding the Popes galleys in order
to join with him, was gone to Faro di Messina, there to gather up the galleys
of Naples, and Sicily, and other men of War, which he expected from other
parts: which when they were come, he found his Forces notwithstanding so
inferior to the Turks, as he could by no means think of giving the enemy
battle; he therefore resolved to reinforce the greatest number of Galleys that
he could, and leaving the rest of the galleys, and smaller Vessels, and six
armed ships behind him in a safe place, and one Gallioun, to advance with
those select ones toward the Levant, to molest the Turkish affairs, according
as he should find occasion, shunning to meet the Enemies Fleet, joined
altogether. But the Venetians, when they understood the Turkish Fleet was come
to Modone, not knowing whither they were to go, nor what to do, the Senate had
been very dubious in their Counsels, what the General Pesaro should do, who
was already come to Corfu, and had about 70 Galleys under his Command: the 15
that were armed in the Levant, being come unto him, to wit, ten in Candia, one
at Cefalonia, two at Zante, and two in the same Island of Corfu.

The General had not as yet received any commissions, save such as were
universal, and answerable to the Senates intention, to keep Newtral, to wit, to
endeavor to keep peace with the Imperialists, and with the Turks, and not to
meddle with any, farther then to keep the subjects, and the affairs of the
Commonwealth uninjured; to grant victuals freely to all, to shun giving
suspicion, to keep far from all the Fleets, and not any ways to disturb their
designs, nor meddle in any thing which either of the Fleets should have to do
with. He therefore required some particular order touching either his stay, or
whither he was to go. Some Senators were of opinion, that the whole Fleet
keeping still together, the General should always keep before the Turks,
leaving them behind him, alleging, that their chief care should be to
preserve the Cape, and not to leave the Gulf to the discretion of the Turks,
when being gotten well within it with so great Forces, they might be hindered
from being able to join the Galleys of Dalmatia, and others which were still
appearing in Venice, with the rest of our Fleet. Others agreeing, that the
Fleet should keep together, were of a contrary opinion touching where it should
stay, thinking it neither honorable nor advantageous, to abandon the Levant,
and to deprive themselves of the opportunity (if they should find it fit to do
so) of joining our Fleet with that of Spain; some blaming both these opinions,
as extreme, and which would produce some disorder, proposed that the Fleet
should be divided; commanding the General, that when he should understand the
Turkish Fleet did make for the Gulf, he should choose out 40 of the best
Galleys, wherewith himself, and Commissary Contarini should tarry about Corfu,
and that he should send the other Commissary Pasquillio with the rest into
Dalmatia. That he should diligently watch the proceedings of the Turks; who if
they should make for Puglia, the General should not stir from Corfu; but if,
entering into the Gulf, and seeming to go for Puglia, when they were past the
mount St. Angelo, they should bend toward Ancona and Romagna, he should follow
them, but at such a distance, as he should by no means endanger his Galleys;
and others were of opinion, that all accidents which might occur, not being to
be foreseen; and yet the Commanders being to govern themselves thereby, they
should leave all to the Generals discretion and diligence. Amongst which
diversity of opinions, theirs prevailed, who were for the Fleets keeping in an
entire body in the Levant. But it being soon after known, that the Turks
advanced into the State, so as there was no open war declared, nor was there
yet any certainty of peace, it behoved them to divide their Fleet; so they
resolved to create a new Sea-Generall in the Gulf, but who should be inferior
to Pesaro; for that when they should be together, he was to take down the
standard and Lanthorn, and yield obedience to him. And this employment was
given by almost all the votes of the Senate, to Iovan Vetturi, who by trial
given of himself in the late Wars, had got a great renown for wisdom and
valor. He putting himself speedily in order, and parting from Venice with
some armed Galleys, went to Dalmatia, whither Commissary Pasquillio came to
meet him, with some of those galleys which were at Corfu; Nicolo Bondimiero,
Captain of the Gulf, and Dominico Contarini, Captain of the fly-boats. So as
Vetturi had quickly under his charge 46 Galleys, besides six fly-boats; and 54
Galleys, one Gallioune, commanded by Battuzzi Contarini, and a Frigate under
Iacopo d' Armero, remained with General Pesaro. But the same doubt rose soon
again, which had at first divided them, in giving out these orders, which was
made the greater, by the news which increased daily, that the Turks were
coming in an hostile manner, to the Island of Corfu, and that their Fleet was
already discovered from the Island of Zantes; some being of opinion, that the
Fleet should keep divided; others, that General Pesaro should have liberty, to
make one entire body of the whole Fleet, if he should see occasion for it; and
Vetturi was ordered, that if Pesaro should require it, he should obey him,
without expecting further orders from the Senate. This opinion was much
withstood by many, who mentioned the great danger, and little advantage, which
would thereby accrue; for the Turkish Fleet being very numerous and strong, in
the Channel of Corfu, and therefore the western Point being well guarded, how
could our Galleys come near the Island? whereas I Venti di Provenza, which were
wont to be constant in that season, made the entry thereinto hard, and the
abode there unsafe. So as when they should know, that the Peace was broken,
they were to think of the safety of Corfu, and of the rest of their Dominions
by sea, by other more prevalent means. That the Emperor offered to join his
Galleys with ours. That if General Pesaro should receive orders, to keep good
intelligence with Doria, that this conjunction might speedily be made with more
honor, and greater hopes of doing good. Yet the Senate being moved, either by
fear of making the Turks jealous, and of accelerating the evil, which they
sought so much to shun, if they should hold closer intelligence with the
Imperialists; or else by the hopes of being able to do some good of themselves,
the business was carried, though but by a very few votes, for leaving it in
Pesaro's power, to join our Fleet together, if he should see occasion for it,
and therewith to defend the subjects and affairs of the Commonwealth.

The French, hoping hereby to bring the Venetians by new applications, to
consent to those things, which they would not before listen unto, sent Count
Guido Rangone speedily away to Venice, who having had audience in the College,
in presence of the Capi del Consiglio di dieci, without the Ambassador of
France his intervening, who afterward did of himself almost the same things.
Rangone delivered the Kings credentiall Letters, and began in a very effectual
manner to relate the love, which his King bore to the Commonwealth, and the
esteem he had of her, commemorating diverse things done by the Crown of France,
tending to the Venetians service. Then entering into consideration of the
particular accidents of that time, he exhorted them to forego their confederacy
with Caesar, and to join in friendship with France, making great offers, by
order from the King, and in the Kings name, of yielding up unto the
Commonwealth, when the State of Millan should by their joint forces be
recovered, the city of Cremona, with whole Giaradada; and to assist them
readily in repossessing them of Cervia and Ravenna; and also of the Towns in
Puglia, as Otranto Brandizzo, Monopoli, Puglinian, and Travi: so as the
Venetians should be made masters of all, that they possessed before the late
wars. But he insisted chiefly upon the present condition of times, which he
knew would be of great force; promising, that by the Kings intercession and
authority, they should be free from all the present dangers, which were
threatened them by the Turks, to the honor and advantage of the Commonwealth;
that the disputes which did yet remain between her and Soliman, should be
ended, the new Imposts laid upon the Merchants of Soria taken away, the
Cantarinan ship restored, and that the Merchants who were imprisoned, should,
together with their goods, be set at liberty. The Auditory was much in doubt
what to do concerning these proposalls; on the one side, they had great hopes,
and large offers promised them, but which would draw on sore wars, and much
trouble; on the other side, doubts of but small quiet, and no lesser
difficulties, continuing still in the same danger, which would be made the
worse by the King of France his indignation, if he should see his friendship
refused and neglected, after so large offers. After long consultation, it was
proposed to the Senate, by the joint opinion of the Collegio de Savii, That the
same Rangone being desired to return many thanks to the King, for his favor,
and for his so many and so loving offers, he should tell his Majesty, That as
for the Union which was proposed, the King might know, what esteem the
Commonwealth had of the Crown of France, by what she had often done formerly;
and that as she had not been hitherto wanting, so her actions should still be
such, when any occasion should be offered, as might c^^firm the King and all
others in a good opinion of her. Mark Antonio Cornaro was the only man that
opposed this, a man famous for eloquence, and of great reputation, though not
very old, and who was then Savio di Terra ferma; he would have it freely told
to Rang^ne, That to keep promise, was that which became a Prince, and was the
ancient uninterrupted custom of the Commonwealth. Wherefore being tied by a
new confederacy to Caesar, they could not think of any other agreement contrary
to it. But that they were, notwithstanding, confident, that the King, as a wise
Christian Prince, and a friend, would not give over the good offices, which he
had begun with the Turks. He therefore spoke thus.

He who will give his opinion in any weighty and important Affair, must be so
free from passion, as his reason be not contaminated. Hope and fear, as evil
consul^ors, which keep truth concealed, ought always to be banished such
resolutions. These are the affections which I desire maybe chiefly driven from
your bosoms, most worthy and grave Senators, that the resolution which shall
this day be put on, may be right and sincere, agreeing with the public good,
and with the opinion which the world has of this Senate's wisdom. The offers
made unto us by the King of France, to make us side with him, and take up arms
against our friend and confederate Caesar, are very great; and truly he ought to
mention great things, to make us by a new and detestable example, break our
public faith, without any just occasion, and undertake a no less unjust, then
weighty and dangerous war. Two things are at once propounded unto us, to make
war with the Emperor, and the keeping peace with Soliman; and this very
cunningly, to work upon us by these inventions, to the end, that some of us
moved thereunto by our own strength, and by his assistance, and out of hopes of
great acquisitions, being allured by what is very useful and desirable, may
forget what is honest and feasible, and may easily enter into troubles, which
we shall not so easily get out of. And others, blinded by the desire of
preservation from present dangers, and of freeing themselves from the fear of
war with the Turks, without finding any better security for our present
affairs. We must look upon these things with eyes, uncontaminated by these
affections, with the pure and sincere eyes of our souls, and consider, with
what intention they are proposed; for by so doing, it will easily appear what
we ought to do therein, and by what answer we may free our selves from those
snares, which are covered over with an appearance of liberty; and from that
infamy, which goes concealed under the cloak of glory. It was the generosity of
our forefathers, readily to embrace any occasion of enlarging our confines,
whilst the condition of times advised thereunto. It was the constancy of our
fathers, and has been ours, to seek to preserve things, which were got by the
worth of others, not being overcome by the tedious troubles of war. But
certainly, it was no less wisdom, nor less praiseworthy, to accommodate our
selves to the present fortune of the Commonwealth, to lay down Arms, and to
wait for better times, when we had found all experience in vain. We did then
possess the greatest part of th^se territories, which now are promised us in
reward of new troubles and dangers; and notwithstanding, because we knew, that
the keeping of them would nourish perpetual discords, we, being desirous to
purchase peace to the Commonwealth at last, did resolve to quit them. We
parted willingly, and by agreement, with Ravenna and Cervia to the Pope, and
with many Towns in Puglia to the Emperor. We should not now think of these
things, since it will be harder for us to repossesse our selves of those
cities, then it would have been to have kept them; and for that Caesar 's power
is much increased, and confirmed in Italy. So as to change the present
condition thereof, is a thing rather to be desired than to be expected; and if
this be any ways to be hoped for, past experience, and the same course which
we still keep, teaches us, that it may ^e had, not by arms, but by negotiation
and dex^erity; by insinuating our selves into Caesar 's favor, and by keeping
him in some jealousy of our friendship, which he does so highly value at this
time; by which means, he may be brought as he has been formerly, and ha^h now
promised to yield, that a particular Duke of Millan be named. But certainly, he
who thinks, there is any good grounds, of joining part of that State to our
Dominions, may be said, to take pleasure in willingly deceiving himself. It is
too apparent, that the bare news of this confederacy with France, or the
discovery of any such thoughts in us, would be sufficient, to make all the
Princes of Italy join against us; nay, the very King of France, who is now so
free of his promises, would be hardlier persuaded to grant these things, then
others would be, if there should be any occasion of doing it. Is it possible,
that we can so soon forget what is past? or if we remember them, can we with
patience give ear to these negotiations? What counsel did ever prove more
unfortunate to this Commonwealth, then the thinking of getting of Cremona, and
Giaradada? What, but this, was the first and true original cause, of making
all the Princes of Christendom conspire against us, to almost the total ruin
of our affairs? And who was the first author of this conspiracy, and of our so
many mischiefs, but that very King of France? who, assisted by our forces, in
his getting the Dukedom of Millan, was bound to keep us in the possession of
that part thereof, which was given us in reward of our so much expense and
labor. And I pray you, what was it that forced us to join at first in
confederacy with this present Emperor, whose greatness we did so fiercely
oppose, taking upon us the defense of the Dukedom of Millan, but the
French-mens so often failing in their promises? Did not we keep constant in our
friendship to the King of France to the last? but the French have often
abandoned us, we never them, unless upon great necessity. Assuredly, though we
should listen to these propositions, their actions would not correspond with
their promises, which have always been very large, I will not say so much to
abase us, as by the custom of the Nation; but their actions have always come
short of their obligations, slow, uncertain, inconstant. And, not to mention
things further off, the King has used the same importune delay, in furnishing
his Captains with men and moneys, to maintain the war in Italy, for the
advantage of the common good; and soon after, when he discovered his own
interest, and the hopes of recovering his sons, and of making peace, how easily
did he agree with Caesar, not only without including our Commonwealth, but
without making us acquainted with his counsels, leaving us in the perplexities
and dangers of war, who did so readily take up arms, first, for the freeing of
his own person, then of his sons, made a potent and victorious King our enemy,
and undergone great expense and danger. If the King ^id so easily ^orget our
interests, when he could find nothing in us but good turns, favors, and
merit; why should we think, he should prove more constant or faithful in his
friendship, now that he may have conceived hardly of us, and may think, we have
injured him? for he will always interpret our confederacy with Caesar to be
such, though it were done upon urgent necessities. The King would now flatter
us, and by so many, and by so large promises, would allure us to assent to his
desires, because he knows, he stands in great need of our friendship. He is
infinitely desirous to regain the State of Millan; he sees, he has no leaning
stock in Italy; that his Armies are stayed in Piedmont; that he must fight for
his passage longer then he had thought to have done; and when he shall have
overcome this obstacle, not having any one who will receive or assist, so as he
is to meet with no lesser difficulties, he would by all means make us forego
Caesar, and bring us to make a new confederacy with him. But say, I beseech you,
who is it that does believe, or who indeed can with reason believe, by the yet
recent example of this very Kings actions, when Caesar, seeing those forces
turned against him, by whose assistance he thought, he should have been the
better able to defend the State of Millan, when he saw his territories
assaulted at one and the same time, by the King of France, and by the Turks;
that he should resolve, as it is well known he did, to enter into a treaty of
surrendering the Dukedom of Millan, because the Kings third son should not be
invested thereinto. Who is it, I say, that can persuade himself, that the King
would not presently have laid down Arms, without any thought of our
concernments, and have made an agreement, not only without us, but it may be
against us, to assist Caesar in repairing himself upon us, and to our prejudice,
for what he had granted unto him? But I see it will be answered, These hopes,
as being far off, ought not to be much valued: And why ought we not all take in
consideration, the securing of our selves, from the so great and eminent
dangers of the Turkish forces? This is a thing certainly as much desired by me,
as by any others; but yet, though I have the same desire, I cannot be of the
same opinion concerning it, for I see no reason, to trust our security upon
these promises; nay rather on the contrary, me thinks, that the danger
remaining still the same, we shall, by waiting upon these negotiations, weaken
much our own defense. The Turks by nature, and by their prosperous successes,
are proud, imperious, as those who despise all others, and put a value only
upon themselves, and upon their own accommodations: and shall we believe, that
they will govern their thoughts according to the persuasion or desire of the
King of France, rather then according to their own particular objects? If the
ancient friendship and commerce which we have with them, yea, even to their
advantage, shall not avail to make them cease, from making war upon us; of what
authority, I beseech you, do you think, the King of France his persuasions will
be with him? Soliman requires nothing of the French in reward whereof, to grant
peace unto us upon their score; the French are they who pray assistance from
the Turks. It is more reasonable therefore, that they should accommodate
themselves to the Turks will, and not the Turks to theirs. So as the more I
know, that we ought to desire the confirmation of peace with the Turks, the
less hope I, to obtain it by this means. But I am afraid it may so fall out,
as being unable of our selves, long to hold out against the Turks, we shall
unseasonably deprive our selves of those aids which are ready, and wherein
only we can promise any good unto our selves; I speak of our Fleets joining
with the Imperialists. And it is this, believe me, that both the Turks and
French, do look upon; the Turks are jealous of this uniting of our Fleets, they
fear nothing but this, as being that alone which can disturb their designs;
and perhaps it is to hinder this, that they use this means with the French, who
will willingly serve them, as well for their own interests, as to requite them
for the good which they receive by their ^leet. This therefore may sufficiently
teach us, what we ought to do in this point, and what our answer ought to be,
since it is a clear case, that we ought to shun and abhor that which is
desired, and endeavored by our enemies: The more therefore they desire to
severe us from Caesar, the closer ought we to cleave to him, and to avoid all
occasions, which may make him suspect we intend otherwise. And certainly, when
we shall have duly considered all things, we shall be of this opinion, that we
cannot look for greater, nor for more certain help, for these our threatening
dangers, from any where else, then from this our joining with the Imperialists;
or at least, from nourishing an opinion in the Turks at the present, that very
good intelligence is held between Caesar and us; and such a union may easily be
had, if we have a mind to it. But let us take it for granted, that Soliman
does not at all intend to trouble us now, but aims only upon the Emperors
Dominions; is it a good, is it a wise, is it a useful or Christian-like
counsel, to give him occasion of increasing the good will he has already, of
making enterprises upon Christendom, of getting his foot into Italy, of
weakening that Prince his forces, who may counterpoise the Turks power? If
Otranto, Brandizzo, or any other such place, should fall into the Turks hands,
(which God forbid) what would become of Cor^u, and the rest of our territories?
To part from the confederacy which we have with Caesar, what is it, but to draw
on those evils, which we ought chiefly to shun? For who knows not, that more
forces being to be employed in defense of the State of Millan, our Garrisons
will be the weaker, to defend our maritine places from the Turks? Since the
condition of our Commonwealth does not permit, that we declare our selves
enemies to the Turks, unless we be enforced so to do, since the discords and
weakness of the Christian Princes necessitates us, to stand idle spectators of
the evils of Christendom, let us endeavor at least, to cloak this our
r^solution as much as we can; if we cannot otherwise assist the common cause,
let us not be wanting in the favor it may receive, by the reputation of our
forces, by keeping still, as we now are, in Arms, and by keeping the Turks
still jealous, that we may, and will assist our friend and Confederate the
Emperor. We see, that the course taken by the French is blamed by all men, and
shall we be guilty of the same fault? The miserable cries of those unfortunate
people, who shall be enslaved by these Barbarians, will call aloud for
vengeance from God upon us, if we should be any occasion of their calamity. And
this appearing safety which is offered us, will be a means to deprive us both
of human and divine help. But as these are powerful reasons, to keep us from
agreeing to th^se things, which are proposed unto us, so do they persuade us
totally to break off this negotiation, not to nourish suspici^ns in the
Imperialists, and hopes in the Turks, that we are to forego Cesar's friendship,
which would at the last incense the King of France more against us, when he
should find himself cheated and deluded by vain words and Treaties; and
following the counsel proposed unto us by the College of the Savij, we shall,
without any advantage to our selves, purchase disgrace, and ill will from all
men.

Cornaro was with great attention listened to by all, and his speech commended;
after whom Leonardo Emo, a Salvio del Consiglio, a grave man, and who had had
the management of many weighty affairs both at home and abroad, stood up, and
spoke thus.

I have observed in the long and learned Oration, made by Mark Antonio Cornaro,
that to find matter wherewith to opugne that opinion which he understands not;
he has endeavored to interpret it, or to make it be understood, if not clean
contrary, at least very far from the intention of the propounder. I will not
therefore oblige my self to answer particularly to every thing that he has
alleged, because I think it not necessary, and I hope, that by that little
which I shall say, it may be clearly enough seen, what might be further said,
by one who would discourse more thereupon. But I have ever thought, that to
urge more considerations, than the business that is treated of requires, is to
confound, not to inligthen the judgment in point of resolution. His intention
then, who proposes the giving a more modest and reserved answer to so
affectionate an offer made in the King of France, is not to give himself
totally up unto him, nor quite to abandon Caesar's amity, and to make a new
confederacy with the King of France: but not to move him to greater indignation
against us, to keep him from precipitating into any pernicious resolution,
which may be prejudicial to our affairs. What greater injury can be done to a
mighty Prince, than to seem not to regard him, not to value his friendship, or
care for his enmity? if we cannot satisfy this Kings desire, or accept the
offers made by him, for some respects of our own, we ought not notwithstanding
to procceed so, as he may have reason to believe we have refused his
friendship, rather out of being disaffected to him, than out of any obligation
we have to Ceasar, or out of other respects concerning our selves. If we will
not satisfy his desires in our actions, let us not be so sparing of words, as
that the injury of our denial may be increased without any advantage to us. We
may know by a notable and late example, what good is got by this too open and
too sincere dealing, if not severe. The Emperor Maximilian being always
refused and neglected by us, when he desired friendship and peace with our
Commonwealth, upon advantageous terms for us, joined at last with the same King
of France against us, in whose behalf, and that we might not forgo his
friendship, we, out of peradventure a generous, but certainly no ways useful,
resolution for our affairs, would not listen to any thing that Maximilian could
offer. I am afraid, Gentlemen, that the same may now befall us; and so much
the rather, for that we know there are several endeavors at this time of
agreement between these two Princes; which though it be to be desired for the
good of Christendom, yet we must be careful and wary, that it be not done to
our disadvantage; and that it be not only done without our knowledge, but
against us. The way to secure us from this, is that which is now offered us; to
wit, by nourishing the King of France, in some hopes of our friendship and
assistance, who will never condescend to any agreement with Caesar, whom he
hates to death, unless out of high necessity, when he sees no hopes of
purchasing his desires by force. And as the benefit is great, which we may reap
by this way of proceeding, so many other effects may follow, which will be very
useful for the present condition of times and affairs. W shall retard the
coming of the King into Italy: for putting an high esteem, as it seems he
does, upon the advantage he may receive by our friendship and assistance; it is
very likely, that he will defer the enterprise of Millan, when he may hope to
attempt it with greater likelihood of prosperous success, being therein
assisted by us: and who knows not, how many conveniences we may receive by
this delay? we shall free our selves from the expense, which will be at this
time very troublesome and unseasonable, of sending our men to defend the State
of Millan, as we are tide to do by our confederacy with Caesar; and we shall
procure better security against the Turkish Forces, and the present danger
thereof, whilst the Imperial forces being free from the fear of the French,
will grow greater, be better united, and more able to defend their Dominions,
and ours also, if there be occasion of joining our Fleet with theirs. But say
all these particular considerations were laid aside; tell me, I beseech you, is
it not certain, and a thing confirmed both by reason, and by experience in us
all, that the keeping of these two Princes powers, as equally balanced as may
be, does much concern the safety and liberty of all Italy, and particularly the
reputation and grandeur of this Commonwealth? not to secure the one
altogether, nor to make the other totally despair of our friendship, which is
the only means of keeping the one from overmuch exceeding the other, and from
securing their affairs in Italy: which most weighty consideration, has made us
not s^ick to side sometimes with the one, sometimes with the other, as has
stood most with the times, and with our interests. It is now 13 years since,
that being then in League with the King of France, and seeing the Emperors
forces increase so fast in Italy, and the French succors come on so slowly, as
it was thought impossible to uphold them any longer; we followed Cesar's
fortune, did what our own safety and service advised us to do, and adhering
unto Caesar, did help him to drive the residue of the French Army out of Italy:
but soon after, the French faction growing powerful, by King Francis, passing
over the mountains with a strong Army, we forewent our new Confederacy made
with the Emperor, and did re-establish our ancient League with the King of
France; whose affairs proving afterward unfortunate, and contrary to the first
hopes, his Army being routed, and himself taken prisoner; we, to preserve our
selves early from being injured by the Conqueror did side again with Caesar;
whose greatness growing suspicious, and seeing our selves then free from the
former danger of his forces, as soon as we found the King of France, who was
now set at liberty, minded to make war with Caesar; we took up Arms with him, to
drive the Imperialists out of the Dukedom of Millan. All these things happened
within less than two years space; and I my self was present in many of them,
as Commissary of your Armies; and certainly it was wisely done to suit our
selves to the various conditions of times; by doing which, we have preserved
the Commonwealth, and reduced her at last to peace. Then, since the same
respects continue, shall we proceed otherwise? Why shall we, by seeming
inseparably united to Caesar, force the King of France to give over his thoughts
of Italy, and leave the Emperor sole Arbitrator thereof? by doing thus, we
shall at one and the same time purchase hatred from the French, neglect from
the Imperialists, lessen the reputation of our Commonwealth, and make the way
easy for Caesar to inthrale whole Italy. To what purpose is the unconstancy,
and uncertainty of the King of France urged, if we do not at all now treat of
relying upon his word? And say we should treat thereof, such a conferacy could
not occasion us so much trouble or danger, but that our appearing to continue
so constant to Caesar, might be cause of more. Nor do I say, that we ought to
treat with some reservation with the King of France, for any respect of the
King himself, for any service that we have received by him, or out of hope of
what we may receive; though if I should say so, it is not so long since we
recovered Verona, by the assistance of his forces, but that it might procure me
some belief. It is our own service and good which makes me advise thus, which
should persuade us to take this course. Therefore as I shall not easily advise
(since the present times do not permit it) that we should enter into assured
and present troubles of a new War; so shall I not counsel quite to forgo the
thought of the Emperor's too immoderate greatness, which has cost us so much
labor in the hardest times, pre^erring the security of our Commonwealth, and
our posterity (for which the Senate is much to be praised) before any
accommodation we could receive by peace. We may by this time know what Cesar's
intentions are, and that it is now more to be feared than ever, that he will
subjugate all Italy: He has drawn us into confederacy with him, by giving us
good words, and by promising to put a Duke into the State of Millan: But do not
his actions show, how careful he is to make good this his promise? If then we
do desire to bring him to this, since we cannot now use open violence, let us
at least make him somewhat jealous of our friendship and assistance; for it may
very well fall out, that fearing lest by our alienation, he may shamefully lose
that State, he may resolve to leave it with honor and praise, by some fair way
of accommodation, as he lately did, when he was contented that Francisco
Sforzza should be repossessed thereof. The respect of our present troubles and
dangers of the Turkish Forces, being added to these considerations, I think we
ought not to forgo the gravity and maturity, with which the Senate is wont to
proceed in matters of much less moment: for it is evident, that the too much
hastening of this our resolution, and the two soon declaring of our selves, will
increase the Turks jealousies, that we are joined with Caesar to their
prejudice, and cannot but much injure our affairs, and bring us upon some
precipice: Moreover, I know not why we ought to value the intercession of a
puissant Prince, and one so highly esteemed by the Turks, as is the King of
France, so little. I am not persuaded, that a treaty of Peace and Agreement,
propounded by a personage of great power, would be displeasing to us, if we
were in open War with Soliman. And now that our business is depending, in my
opinion more inclinable to peace than war; shall we not believe, that the
French may by their endeavors the more easily divert it, be it but by
acquainting them with the easiness of the enterprise, wherein their intentions
and designs against the Imperialists, and us, will be assisted? Much more may
be said upon this occasion, so as my discourse thereupon must be long, though
contrary to my custom; but I forbear to say many things, purposely that I may
not seem to distrust the wonted wisdom of this Senate, to which it may seem
very conformable to keep the more certain determination of our will therein
undetermined; as also the opinion that the King of France; or any others may
have thereof, who may Comment upon this our answer, we shall have time for a
better grounded, and more mature resolution; the waiting for which in
difficulties, has always been thought to become a wise and prudent Prince.
According to this man's opinion, the Senate took time to deliberate upon an
answer, and upon dismissing Count Rongone.

This mean while, certain news came to Venice, that Soliman was come with his
Army to Vallona, and that his Fleet passing by Corfu, had saluted the Fort by
shooting off their Guns, according to the military fashion, in token of
friendship, and were with like shot, amicably answered by our men; and that
they had committed no hostile act, neither in that Island, nor elsewhere; but
that some of his men having taken away certain goods from some of our men by
violence, the Captain, to terrify others, had made them be hanged at the main
mast of his gallie. Wherefore to correspond with some sign of friendship, and
peace, and to discover somewhat of his intentions; some of the Senators were of
opinion, that General Pesaro should be ordered to send some Governor of his
galleys to this end, to Soliman. But this resolution was suspended, lest the
Turks might interpret this, as a sign of fear, and might consequently lessen
the opinion of our forces in them, or peradventure afford matter of new
dislikes amongst them, and of making some immoderate or insolent demand. But
this thought was totally laid aside afterward, by reason of news that Iocopo
Canale, who going to be resident at Constantinople, in the place of Nicolo
Iustiniano, as Minister of the Commonwealth for the public affairs, and for
our Countries occasions, (which employment is commonly called Bailo) when he
came to Novobazer, was ordered by the grand Signor to turn back, and come to
him to the Camp, so as he might do there whatsoever was to be done.

Thus stood the affairs of the Venetians at this time, having neither open War,
nor secure peace; all things full of jealousy, great preparation of Fleets and
Soldiers, but no open injury yet done, nor occasion given of making use of
those forces: but lo some sudden and unexpected accidents afforded matter to
the Barbarians, of venting that fury against the Venetians, which they intended
against others; the constant and resolute will of the Senators, to keep peace
with the Turks, not being able to avoid this misfortune of war, nor yet the
diligence which they had at first used, in charging their Sea-Captains, and
which orders they had often reiterated, to shun all occasions whereby they
might come to open war with the Turks, but to behave themselves so, as that
they might give them no occasion of jealousy. Simione Nassi Zaratino,
commanded one of the galleys of Dalmatia, who unfortunately meeting with a
small Turkish Vessel loaded with Victuals, bent for Vallona, which not striking
sail unto him, according to the maritime custom, Nassi shot at the Vessel, and
sunk it. Though Soliman and his Bashaws were much troubled at this, yet bearing
with it, that it might not impede their other designs, they resolved to send
Ianusli Dragomano to Corfu; the same man who had been the year before at
Venice, with order to acquaint General Pesaro, how that the peace between them
and the Commonwealth, was violated by the insolence of one of his Captains,
and to crave that the delinquent might be punished and reparation made for the
damage done, which he said came to 30000 Ducats. Four galleys of the Fleet lay
in the Channel of Cor^u, to guard the same, commanded by Giusto Gradenico,
Michiele Grimani, Giacono di Mezzo, and Ierolomo Michiele: These men when they
saw armed ships draw near them (which were two galleys, and one fly-boat, which
conducted the Ambassador) not taking any notice who they were, they fell so
furiously upon them, as the Turks fled, and not thinking themselves thereby
safe, they put to land at Cimera, where they were ill dealt with by those
fierce people, who were naturally Enemies to the Turks, many of them taken
Prisoners, amongst which, Ianusby's self. General Pesaro was exceedingly
displeased hereat, so as to make satisfaction in part, and to mitigate the
anger which this might beget amongst the Turks, he presently sent Captain
Francisco Zeno to Cimera, to ransom Ianusbye, which he obtained gratis
immediately from those people, who though they be otherwise rude and savage,
bear a particular affection to the Venetians.

When Soliman heard this news, he was advised by some of his men to take
sudden revenge; but he not being willing for the present to make any other
resentment, sent for the Bailo Canale, and complained bitterly of what the
Commonwealth's Ministers had done, contrary to that so great desire of peace
which the said Bailo had affirmed the Commonwealth studied to have, and keep
with him; and at last he was content, that the Bailo should send one of purpose
to Corfu, to be truly and particularly informed of the fact, to which purpose
the Bailo did immediately dispatch away Alessandro Orsino to Corfu. But Soliman
continuing his intention of assaulting the Rivers of Puglia, had landed good
store of Horse in flat-bottom'd boats about Otranto, which overrunning the
whole Country, and ceazing on both men and beasts, and all things else, infused
terror into all; and at the same time Luftebeio, and Barbarossa, past by with
80 galleys, who being informed that the chief Cities in Otranto and Brandizzo,
were well furnished with Soldiers, and with all things else, bending his
course from the head of Otranto, to the gulf of Taranto, had unexpectedly
assaulted the Town of Castro, in the possessions of Mercurio Gattinara, a petty
Lord, and took it upon Articles; which were but ill kept; for the soldiers,
desirous of prey, not obeying their Captains commands, did miserably plunder
it. Brabarossa thought it good, to flesh his soldiers at first, and to win
them reputation with slight enterprises, and to affrighten the Enemy, but
hastened notwithstanding to greater things.

Doria having in this interim reinforced 28 galleys, as well as he could with
soldiers and mariners, whereby his galleys were very fleet, and fit for
action, went with them toward the Islands of Zante, and Saffalonia, took
diverse Turkish ships, which being loaded with Victuals, went for Vallona,
whereby he much incommodiated the Army; and then steering his course toward
the gulf, came into the waters of Corfu, almost at the same time, that
Ianusbei being chased by the Venetians, (as has been said) went on land upon
the shore of Cimera, where he took, and brought away the Turkish Vessels empty
of men, which did much increase the Turks hatred against the Venetians, and the
suspicion that they held intelligence with the Imperialists: and certainly it
so fell out, as those things through misfortune happened at that time, which were
desired to be shunned; so as occasion of injuries being given, open war was to
ensue thereupon. General Pesaro, hearing that Barbarossa was gone from the
waters of Zante, to secure the Victuals which were sent from Constantinople to
the Camp, and that he came toward Corfu, thought it fit to make use of the
liberty the Senate had given him, of uniting the galleys all together:
wherefore he resolved to enter the gulf, and to join with General Vetturi,
intending, above all things, to shun meeting with the Turkish galleys. But
whilst he was upon his way, he was carried by a cross wind Lee-ward, where he
met with those dangers which he had strove to avoid. For the whole Fleet being
now so near land, and part of the night past, the Mariners advised to cast
anchor, to the end that the Rowers might have some rest; and not being able by
reason of a sudden storm, and of the darkness of the night, to discover afar
off, from the Topmast, for the securing of their voyage; it happened that the
Van, which consisted of 15 galleys, and was commanded by Commissary Alexander
Contarini, fell at unawares upon a Turkish gallie, (which was the Imperial
gallie, prepared for the grand Signor, if he himself should come to Sea, and
which was then commanded by Bustan Raise) and those of that gallie asking our
men what ship theirs was, answer was made, it belonged to the Venetians; and
they being asked by those of Contarini's gallie, who they were, they made no
answer, but seeking to fall Room-ward, did presently let fly their greatest
Guns at her. Then Contarini, moved either by anger, or by the zeal he bore to
the honor of that Fleet, set upon the Turkish gallie, which had declared her
self to be an Enemy; and after a long dispute, having received some harm, for
there were above 300 soldiers in her, he took her, and put all the Turks to
death, except some few, who being underneath the deck, were not found till the
business was over. Contarini was much blamed for this by some, as if swayed
out of a desire of particular revenge, he had done what he knew was contrary to
the public service, by doing an hostile act upon the Turks, by whom he had
been much injured, his ship having been before fraudulently detained by them.
Yet others excusing him, said, That he had foreseen these disorders more than
any other, and had endeavored to remove the occasion, by going with the whole
Fleet into Candia: since the Turks being past as friends through the channel
of Corfu, there was no necessity of staying there, which was nothing else but
to give occasion of real dangers, so to keep free from vain suspicions. After
this, the General pursuing his course, and being come very near the coast of
Puglia, they discovered many fires on land, and hearing many guns go off at the
same time, they at first thought it was, that those of the Country spying our
Fleet, and not knowing what Vessels they were, had given signs to the
Inhabitants, to betake themselves to strong holds; but they knew afterward,
that they were signs given by the Turks, to call those that were Landed back to
their galleys, with which putting to Sea, they came to encounter us; for they
had been advertised of our coming, by the convoy of the gallie which was
taken, who had tarried somewhat behind. Our men were greatly confused by the
unexpected coming of the Turkish galleys. On one side the danger was very nigh
at hand, and the doubt very great, whether they should seek to secure
themselves from it, by flight, or by preparing for combat: to fly away, seemed
dishonorable, and not very safe. The Senates express orders forbad them
fighting, and reason ought to keep them from it, lest they upon disadvantagious
terms might hazard those galleys upon the uncertain event of battle, on which
the defense and safety of their Estate by Sea, did in a great part depend. No
good order being taken, by reason of these uncertain Counsels, neither for
staying nor for retyring: it happened, that when the General gave order to the
other Sea-Captains to turn back to Corfu, it was done disorderly; so as all of
them hasting as fast as they could, to free themselves from danger, five of our
galleys, either being too late in tacking about, or else not so swift of sail
as the rest, tarryed far behind; four of which fell into the Turks hands, whose
Captains hands were afterward barbarously stricken off, and open war declared.
But the fifth, which was commanded by Iovan Baptista Mirchouich* da Pago,
though it were behind the rest, had the good fortune to escape. For bearing
the half Moon for its flagge, it was taken to be a Turkish gallie, and was not
molested by the enemy, but past safely on to Otranto, and went from thence to
join with General Vetturi. This last business, though it was we that was
injured, was notwithstanding a great occasion of the Turks breaking into war
with the Venetians; for Soliman having conceived an ill opinion of the
Commonwealth, by reason of the other accidents which you have heard of, was
the easilier persuaded by others, that our Galleys lay there, to hinder the
design of his Fleet, by falling at unawares upon them, or to set his Fleet on
fire. This suspicion was much increased by a Letter of Doria's, (as was
afterward known by certain slaves) which came to Soliman's hands, wherein he
advertised General Pesaro, of the Turks voyage, putting him in mind, that
this was an opportune time, to suppress the Turkish Fleet, which was divided,
and feared no such thing. This Letter was thought to be artificially written by
Doria, and that it was sent in a little Frigate, such a way, as it might fall
into the jaws of the enemy, as it did, to the end it might nourish jealousy
in them, that he held some secret intelligence with the Venetians, and so
necessitate them to join their Fleet with his, for the common safety. To which
purpose it was likewise believed, that passing much about that time near Corfu,
he met with General Pesaro and had often long discourse with him.

The Venetians were generally very much displeased at these proceedings,
thinking it a hard and grievious thing, that the imprudency and rashness of a
few, should trouble the tranquillity of all, by giving occasion of a dangerous
war, contrary to the intention and resolution of the Senate; which troubled
them the more, and made them be the more blamed by others, because they might
be said, to have been themselves the cause of their own mischief. Yet there
wanted not some, who both abroad, and in the Senate, approved what was done,
and defended the authors of it; they said, It was fit to have respect to their
honor, to maritime discipline, and to the reputation of the Fleet. To what
purpose was it to be at such expense, in setting forth so many armed vessels,
if every one might be permitted to do what they please? If all injuries, all
insultings were to be suffered, what credit, what obedience would be given to
the sea-Captains? What hopes would the subjects have, of being protected and
defended by those forces, which would prove nothing but a vain appearance, if
they should suffer, that unarmed vessels, should not give obedience to such as
were armed; and that our Galleys should be shot at, and suffer other such like
indignities, without any resentment? Would not the Turks conster this done, not
out of friendship, but out of fear? which at last would be no better, than
instead of appeasing them, to make them more bold and insolent. What would it
be to punish these men ^or what they had done, but to confess, it was done
unjustly, and against the Articles of peace, and consequently to oblige our
selves to make reparation, and to pay the Turks 30000 Ducats, that they might
employ it against us? But, which is worse, if we shall grant, that the peace is
broken by our Ministers, how shall we ever hope to do any thing, which may
satisfy the haughty Turks, but by doing something of great shame and
indignity? That it was usual ^or Princes, to lay their own faults upon their
Officers. And that if Soliman should not be herewith satisfied, but should
continue to make war, how would the depriving our selves of the service of
these valient men redound to the disservice of the public? and, which is
worse, would it not make all others be poorly spirited and cowards? so as when
they should have occasion to confront the enemy, they should be more troubled,
in thinking, how to defend their honors at home before our Magistrates, then
their own and the common safety, against the eminent danger of war made by the
enemy. And that if these were to be proceeded against by the way of justice,
they must have more certain and particular information of the fact, by way of
process. That they were likewise to tarry for advertisment from the Bailo, to
know how these things were understood by the Turks, in what condition our
affairs were, either for war or peace; without which considerations, all
resolutions that could be taken hereupon, would be unseasonable, unjust, and
injurious, both to the private, and to the public. The earnest disputing of
these things, was the occasion, why the business oft-times proposed to the
Senate, of committing the Commissary, and Masters of the ships, to the office
of the Avogaria, to give an account of the actions whereof they stood accused,
was for many days deferred. But the news of the Turks complaints increased
still, and how they prepared to revenge themselves; which was more clearly
known by the coming of Allessandro Orsino, who was sent by the Bailo to
Venice, he being commanded so to do by Soliman, that he might let the Senate
know, that these men were to be severely punished, who had violated the peace;
and that they were to acknowledge, that what had been done, was done without
their consent or good will. This being done by A^ace, the first Bashaw, made
the Senate hope well in the continuance of peace; wherefore they resolved at
last to send orders to the General, that he should send Giusto Gradenico, who
was chief of those Galleys that chased Ianusbi, and such others as he should
find guilty of the same fact, in Irons to Venice; but Commissary Contarini was
ordered, to go with his Gally to Zara, and that leaving it at the disposal of
General Vetturi, he himself should come to Venice, and present himself before
the Magistracy of the Avogaria. There were some likewise that were of opinion,
that General Pesaro should give up his Commission, alleging, that all other
things would be but in vain, and give no satisfaction to the Turks; it being to
be supposed, that all the disorders of the Militia must arise from him, who had
the supreme authority; and that the General, by leaving Gradenico unpunished,
had been the occasion of the other inconveniences which ensued, and
consequently, that he partook of the same fault. That peace with the Turks was
of such concernment to the Commonwealth, as nothing was to be considered in
comparison thereof. Moreover, that the Fleet being to keep united, there was no
need of so many Generals, which in important affairs, and chiefly in the
Militia, do rather breed disorder, then do any good. But notwithstanding, the
Senate, having an eye to the preservation of the public dignity, did not only
not consent to the recalling of the General, but sending Orsino back to the
Bailo, would not that any account should as then be given to Soliman, by any
public order, of their resolution taken concerning the Commissary, and the
others, that they might not seem to have done it, rather to please the Turks,
than to do justice. The Bailo was therefore ordered, that he should assure
Soliman of the Senates good will in general, and of their desire of preserving
friendship and peace; for the better assurance whereof, they would speedily
send an express messenger, with particular instructions of all that had been
done, and to assure him of the Senate's good will; to which effect, Commissary
Vicenzo Grimani was afterward chosen.

But before Orsino could come to Vallona with these orders, Soliman being
highly incensed, and being chiefly provoked thereunto by Barbarossa, though he
had promised the Bailo not to attempt any novelty, till Orsino should be
returned, gave command, that his Fleet, which lay then in the waters of Puglia,
and which, after the sacking of Castro, was gone to besiege Otranto, should
return to Vallona, with steadfast resolution, to bend all his forces both by sea
and land, against the Venetian territories, and particularly to assault the
Island and the Fort of Corfu, which at this time made most for his purpose. It
is said, that Aiace used many reasons, to dissuade Soliman from declaring
enmity against the Venetians, saying, That it was nothing else, but
unseasonably to increase the Imperialists forces, who were perpetual enemies
to the Ottaman family, by necessitating the Venetians to join with them, for
their own defense. Besides, that the year was already so far spent, August
being now almost over, as it would not permit any long and difficult
enterprises, wherein the Fleet was to be made use of; and that there began to
be some want of victuals in the Camp, by reason of the so many ships which
Doria had taken. But Barbarossa being much enraged, because twelve of his
Galleys falling at this time upon Doria's Fleet at the Merlere, had been but
hardly dealt with by him, part of them being taken, part sunk; that he might
work some revenge, and much more to save himself, went about to lay the fault
upon the Venetians, saying, That by their assistance and advertisment, the
Imperialists had found the opportunity, to fall upon his Galleys at unawares,
almost in the Channel of Corfu, and in the face of the Venetian Fleet; who, if
they had been true friends, ought not to have suffered so great an outrage to
be done, to a Prince in amity with them, almost at their own homes, they having
forces sufficient to have hindered it. That the dignity of that Empire, ought
not to be so injured and scorned; nor that the Venetians, holding close
intelligence with their enemies the Imperialists, receiving them into their
havens, giving them advertisment, and all other accommodations, should be
to^lerated to make war by this means underhand with the Musselmans, without
being injured. Thus the resolution was taken, of making war with the
Commonwealth, and orders were forthwith sent to all parts of the Ottaman
Empire, where great store of Venetian Merchants were wont to frequent for
traffic, that they should be detained, together with their goods; and
particularly, three great Galleys were arrested in Alexandria, who had the
public faith for their surety in those Havens. Soliman marched with his Army
to Butrintro, just over against Corfu, that he might the more commodiously
convey his men over into the Island, whither Barbarossa was gone on the 28th of
August, with his Fleet, and with certain Shallops, wherein were about a
thousand Horse, to overrun and pillage the country at unawares, as he did.
When the news hereof came first to Venice, all men's minds were very much
molested, especially theirs who sat at the helm of government, though they did
very much suspect it before: For though it was thought, the Fort of Corfu was
able to withstand the Turks assault, without any danger, they judged, it would
be very hard for them long to withstand the forces of so potent enemies, and to
defend their Dominions, exposed in so many several parts to their injuries.
That therefore this was likely to be the beginning of great troubles to the
Commonwealth, which began but then to repair her self, from the so many evils
she had suffered in the late wars in Terra ferma.

The Island of Corfu is seated on the utmost part of the Venetian Gulf,
between the Ionick and the Adriatic sea: It has on the north side the Rivers
of Albania, from whence it is not above two miles divided; but it is distant by
land from the head of Otranto sixty miles on the East. The Island extends it
self from the East to the West, in almost a Lunary form; except that the Rock
whereon the Fort is placed, makes as it were two semi-circles on the inside.
The waters between the Island, and the Terra ferma, are commonly called the
Channel of Corfu, which though it be not above two miles over on the East end
of the Island, where the Port Casopo is, yet the Island enlarging it self more
from landward on the other side, called Levidimo, it is above ten miles over.
The Island is of an excellent air, as is witnessed by the Orange Trees and
Cedars, which grow there in great quantity, and very beautiful; which
peradventure afforded the Poets occasion, of so highly celebrating the Gardens
of King Alcinous, who kept his Court there. The ground is fruitful, very fit
for corn, having on the North side many pleasant plains. The city is placed
almost in the midst of the Island, upon the root of a mountain, which is almost
surrounded by it. The suburbs are sufficiently great and capacious, and were at
this time inhabited by above 8000 persons. The Fort was but of a very small
circuit, and capable of not many men; but so seated, as it was secure from
being injured by any enemy, having two Castles situated very high, upon steep
Rocks, which are not only a defense to the walls of the Fort on all sides, but
discovering the sea, valleys, and neighboring mountains, afford means of
keeping the enemies Fleets and Armies afar off, which cannot approach near it
without much damage. One, and the antientest of these Castles, is wholly
environed by the Fort; the other of later structure, stands part within the
Fort, the greater part serving for a wall or rampire thereunto. There are no
other cities nor forts in the Island, but only many straggling villages; and on
the South Side stands the castle of St. Angelo, stronger by situation, then by
art. The whole Island is about 120 miles in compass, and it was anciently much
more inhabited, and the inhabitants esteemed for sea-affairs, which they did so
industriously study, as it may be gathered from what Thucidides relates, in the
war of Morea. They had many maritine forces, and were well esteemed by the
other Grecians. This Island had been under the Venetians dominion for 150 years
last past, and was kept by them with great expense and care, being thought to
be very fitly situated, to preserve the Empire of the Sea; for there being in
it good and capacious havens, their Fleets may with great safety keep about it,
and be ready to defend other eastern Islands and Dominions, and also keep in
any enemies, from entering with their Fleets into the Gulf, which could not
safely advance, leaving an enemies Fleet behind them, in a strong situation.
This Island is therefore with reason held to be the bulwark of Italy, against
the Barbarians forces. So as the danger being increased of later years, by
reason of the Turks power, the Venetian Senate taking into consideration,
together with their own safety, the common service of Christendom, have by
stupendous art, and much cost, brought this Fort into such a condition, as it
may truly be thought impregnable. It was at this time governed by several
Magistrates, sent thither by the Commonwealth, Simone Lione was Consul, Luigi
da Riva Commissary, and Andrea Falliero Commander of the old Castle; but Iacopo
di Novello was chief Governor of the Militia, a man well experienced in matters
of war, who falling sick just at this time, dyed, and Babone di Naldo was
chosen to succeed him, who had purchased the repute of great valor and
fidelity, in the last wars on Terra ferma, and who at this time was a
Collonell. The Senate being willing to gratify him, for his ready acceptance
of this employment, allowed twenty Ducats a month in his lifetime to his son
Paul. Naldo carried with him Letters from the Senate, to the Governors of the
Island, wherein they were ordered to exhort the Commanders and Citisens, in the
name of the Commonwealth, to behave themselves valiantly and faithfully,
promising them rewards, and speedy succors; to which purpose, they were
preparing great store of Galleys and Soldiers, and that the Senate had a great
care of their safeties, and of preserving the Island. In the Fort there was a
Garrison of about 2000 Italians, and as many Islanders, many whereof being
trained up to be Cannoniers, did excellent service. There was great store of
Artillery, and sufficient Ammunition for them. The charge of the Militia was
particularly given to diverse, according as need should require; the keeping of
the Haven was committed to the care of Nicolo Semitecolo, Zaccheria Barbaro had
the charge of the Victuals, and Luigi Sanuto of the Artillery; all these three
being Governors of the Galleys of that Guard: So as the Governors and
Captains did undauntedly expect the enemy. Yet the Venetians being jealous, by
reason of the importancy of the place, that some evil accident might befall it,
or at least, that the enemy, if they were not disturbed, might lay a long siege
to it, set all their thoughts upon freeing Cor^u from danger, by fighting the
Turkish Fleet: There were many things which advised thereunto; the knowledge,
that as long as the Turkish Fleet remained entire, whereby the Camp might
easily be furnished with men, which they abounded in, the Island of Corfu, and
the other Islands also, must be exposed to many dangers; and that the
Commonwealths forces being wasted, though with nothing else, by the length of
war, some of her Dominions must at last fall into the Turks hands. Moreover,
that the Commonwealth had then a great and strong Fleet ready, consisting of
100 Galleys, and convenience to increase it, and make it greater, by arming
good store of great Vessels. That they had a fit occasion to try the fortune of
a Battle, not suffering the expense of so great a a preparation for war, to be
consumed with certain loss. But they were hereunto chiefly incited, by their
hopes of being assisted by the forces of other Christian Princes, in whatsoever
enterprise they should undertake against the Turks, according to the so many
offers made by the Pope and Emperor; which if they should not accept of, they
might seem, not without some infamy, and apparent prejudice to the
Commonwealth, to have abandoned both themselves, and the cause of Christendom.
There were then about 50 nimble Galleys, and as many great Vessels of the
Emperors upon the sea; the Pope had armed four, and the Knights of Jerusalem
some; which forces being all united, they hoped to be not only able to beat
the Turkish Fleet, and to free Corfu from siege; but to do some egregious act,
by way of noble conquest. News being therefore brought, of the Armies being
gone to the Island of Corfu, and war being openly made, Mark Antonio Contarini,
Ambassador at Rome, was ordered to acquaint the Pope therewith, and with the
Senates resolution; to let him see, in how great danger the common cause of
Christendom was, and how ready they were to employ all their forces, to defend
it and themselves, against the potent common enemy. They thought it fittest to
do this first with the Pope, not only because this care did chiefly belong
unto him, as to the head of Christianity, but for that he having been very
desirous, that the Christian Princes should join against the Infidells, had
often offered the Churches Treasury, and all his forces, and authority, toward
so pious and necessary a work. It was also very fit, in respect of the present
business, to treat thereof at Rome rather then in Spain; it being then
thought, by what themselves had given out, that the Emperor's Ministers in
Italy had commission given them, to join his Fleet with the Venetians, if
occasion should so require. As soon as the Pope heard this the Senates
resolution, he seemed to be very much joyed thereat, saying, That he had never
desired any thing more fervently since he was Pope, then this; that God could
not be more gracious unto him, then to suffer him to see the minds and forces
of Christian Princes, joined together against those enemies, who, through the
so much increased discords of Christendom, did now threaten them ruin. He did
not therefore only confirm, but increase his promises made to the Venetians,
when he persuaded them to make this union. And truly the Pope's exhortations
were of no small moment, to excite in them these thoughts, and hopes of a
League, he being esteemed a wise man, very zealous of the common good, and very
well affected toward the Commonwealth. A beginning being thus given to a
treaty of League, it was concluded by all, that mighty forces at sea were to be
put together, since they had to do with an enemy, whose power, nay, whose very
name, was become so formidable to all men. They discoursed therefore of arming
200 Galleys, and as many Ships, and other great Vessels, as they could,
wherein 50000 Foot were to be embarcked, and 4000 Horse. But because there
arose some difficulty about the distribution of this expense, and the time and
necessity pressing very much, to go with that Fleet which was already ready, to
the relief of Corfu. The Pope confirming the preparation and union of these
forces, as a thing already certainly agreed upon, would have the League to be
presently published, for the greater reputation thereof, and to invite the
Christian Princes to embrace it, reserving the conclusion of the particular
Articles to a better convenience, and till some orders were come from Spain.
This publication was made with great solemnity in St. Peter's Church, Gaspero
Contarini, a Venetian Cardinal, singing the Mass, wherein he was assisted by
the Pope, and by the whole College of Cardinals; which being done, the Pope
entertained the Emperor's Ambassador, the Ambassador of Venice, and the
Venetian Cardinals, and Cardinal Santa Croce, a Spaniard, at dinner with him
in his Palace. The like publication was also solemnly made in Venice, thanks
being given to God by Orisons, and Processions in all the Churches, for this
union of the Christian Princes against the Infidells.

To do somewhat in relation to this, the Senate writ to their Generals, that
they should leave the Captain of the Gulf to guard the places of Dalmatia with
four Galleys, and that they should go with the whole Fleet to Brandizzi. They
afterward took many soldiers into pay, to make good the promised number; they
created the Governors of the greater, and of the bastard Galleys, which were
with all diligence put in order; and it was resolved, that when these should be
out at sea, they, and all the other armed ships, should be under the command of
Bondumiero, Captain of the Gallioune. So in a short time, all things were
disposed of, on the Venetians side, so as the Fleet might go find out the
enemy. But Andrea Doria having received orders, and being desired both from
Rome and Venice, whilst he was yet at Naples, to go to Brandizzo, and join
with the Venetian Fleet, finding out many excuses; sometimes, that he must go
to Marcelles, against the French Fleet; sometimes to Genua, to recruit his
Galleys with men, and to provide for many things which he wanted, would not
tarry, no not the least while there, though Gasparo Basalu, Consul for the
Venetians at Naples, did all he could to persuade him: He oft-times told Doria,
of the importancy of the Island of Corfu, which was now to be freed from
danger, and would make for the Emperor's service; how great the glory and
reputation was, which he might hereby purchase. He moreover minded him of his
own particular obligation, by his word so often given, and promise made so often
to the Venetians, which had made the Senate put such confidence in him, as much
to his honor, they had consented, that the Commonwealth's Fleet, which was so
potent, and whereon the safety of her Dominions by sea did depend, should be
guided and commanded by him as supreme Captain. But Doria being nothing at all
moved herewith, said, They should have accepted of his offer, whilst there was
an opportunity of suppressing Barbarossa, when he passed with but part of his
Fleet through the Channel of Corfu. And presently after, going with all his
Galleys from Naples, he steered his course toward Genua, where when he should
have given an account of all that had past to the Emperor, he said, He would
expect new orders from Spain. So as neither Letters from the Pope, written by
his own hand, wherein he pressed the same desires more fervently then before; nor
the Emperor's Ambassador, who went in person to this purpose to Naples from
Rome, came time enough to do any good; for he hoisted sail with such speed and
resolution, as if it had been to have escaped some great danger. The Venetians
were hereat very much troubled, not only for that they saw, they had lost
their hopes of beating the Turkish Fleet, but because they thought themselves
deluded by the Imperialists vain promises. Yet, though Doria's departure, and
the news, that Barbarossa was about to enter the Gulf with 100 Galleys, might
have counseled them to revoke their order, which they had given their
Generals, of going with their Fleet to Brandizzo; the Senate, to show their
constancy in what they had once resolved, and to preserve the reputation of
their Fleet, which they thought might be lessened very much, if they should
seem to depend so much upon Doria's counsels and actions; after the business
had been long and diversely discussed, they resolved, not to alter any part of
their former orders, but renewed their desires to the Pope, to give orders to
the Count d' Anguilara, of going with his Galleys belonging to the Church, to
Brandizzo, according to the first design.

Whilst these things were in treaty amongst the Christian Princes, the Turks
having conveyed 25000 men, and 30 pieces of Artillery, over into the Island of
Corfu, had built four Cavalliers about the Forts, to equal those within, and
obviate their defense. And the mean while, they with barbarous cruelty
destroyed the country, cut up the Cedar and Olive plants, burnt houses, took
cattle away, and carried the men away prisoners. Many of the inhabitants of the
subburbs had withdrawn themselves into the Mandracchio, to save themselves;
but not having wherewithal to be nourished, nor to defend themselves from the
rain, which fell in great abundance at that time, the most of them perished
most miserably there; Some few of them got into the Fort, being drawn in with
ropes. The Castle of St. Angelo preserved many of the villages, it being able
by the situation thereof, to defend them from the enemy. But the Turks having
begun their battery, were aware, that by reason of the great distance of place,
wherein they were bound to build their Cavalliers, that they might fit
themselves to the situation, and keep themselves safe from the Cannon within,
their shot did little hurt, or none; and the Fleet being approached near the
southside of the Fort, where la Purporella wanting, and the walls were lower,
so as they hoped they might come nearer, and do most good. Barbarossa was with
much loss beaten back, and amongst other things, had the Stem and Rudder of
his own Gally shot off. The first Bashaw went twice from Butrinto to the
Island, and coming even to the ditch of the Fort, that he might the better
discover the place, at his return, he told Soliman, That the Fort was so
seated, and so defended, as it would hardly be taken in a long time. Wherefore
he counseled Soliman to raise his Army, and remove his Fleet, whereinto a
grievious sickness was got, and great scarcity began to be in the Camp. He
told him, how that winter drew on, a very unseasonable time for that
enterprise, whereon the longer his men staid, the more reputation would they
lose, if they must afterward rise without effecting their desire. That by
reason of this enterprise, and rash accidents, his forces and thoughts had been
diverted, from more easy undertakings against the Emperor, for which that
warlick preparation was intended. That therefore it being a thing
inconsiderately undertaken, he met not with that prosperous success therein,
as was wont to wait upon the wise and generous counsels of the Ottaman Lords.
That therefore both the Army and the Fleet were best to return to
Constantinople, to refresh both the one and the other, much weakened by
several inconveniences, to the end that they might prepare greater forces,
whereby to atchieve more certain glory the next year. This was the first Bashaw
Ajace's counsel; yet to keep up reputation, and feigning to have other ends,
and it may be out of envy to Barbarossa's glory, desirous to keep him idle, he
sent for the Venetian Consul, who was yet in the Camp, and told him, That if
his Masters would make reparation for losses and injuries done to Soliman, and
behave themselves so, as it might be made known, that these things had not been
done by any public order or consent, he would work it so, that the Army and
Fleet should rise from before Corfu, and return to their former friendship and
peace with his Masters. Which words, Ianusby, the chief Interpreter, affirmed,
to have been spoken by the knowledge and consent of Soliman, as was soon seen.
The Consul being suffered to send a man of his to this purpose, to Venice, who
was accompanied by two Chiausi, and secured as far as Castle Nuovo. And at the
same time almost, without expecting an answer, Soliman and his Camp removed
toward Constantinople, and the Artillery and Soldiers being embarcked, the
whole Fleet removed from Corfu, where they had not staid above ten days. The
whole country was destroyed, the villages ruined and deserted, the Turks having
carried away 15000 men, and made them slaves. Pacsu, an Island lying on the
East of Corfu, and not far distant from thence, to which, as it is said, it was
anciently joined, did undergo the like calamity; as also Butrinto, a maritime
country of Albania, (just over against the Island. of Corfu) wherein was a
Castle, which fell into the Turks hands, at the very first appearance of the
Army, Corfiatto, who was Captain thereof, having carried the keys to Soliman's
self, from whom he received a golden garment, and his liberty. Barbarossa being
gone with all the Fleet from Corfu, made toward la Perevesa, (not being able
to obtain leave of Soliman, to tarry in those seas) with 100 Galleys, to commit
piracy in the waters of Puglia, and Sicily, as was earnestly endeavored by
Brancardo, Captain of 12 French Galleys, who being just then come to the
Turkish Fleet, hoped by the favor of Barbarossa, to accompany him, to the
prejudice of the Emperor. It was thought, that advertisment, come to Soliman,
of no slight commotions raised in the confines of Persia, was the cause of his
so sudden raising his Army; for two days before, two Olachi came to the Camp,
with great diligence from thence; and no occasion of their coming being
divulged, it was held for certain, that they brought bad news; it being the
custom of that Nation, to publish and enlarge all things, which may win them
reputation, and to conceal such things, as may produce a contrary effect. But
really, the great difficulties that were discovered in the enterprise, and the
reasons alleged by Aiace, was the true cause of this change of resolution. The
Venetians were mightily rejoiced at the news, of Corfu's being freed from
danger at that time, when being abandoned by Doria, and consequently deprived
of all means of succouring it by their own Fleet, the hopes of its defense lay
only in the strength of the situation, and in the defendants valor: Nay, it
appeared, that the Commonwealth, and that Fort in particular, would in the
future win no little reputation, by this the Turks so sudden departure, who
are not wont to give over any enterprise, without the victory. To so sad an age
are we grown, as not to lose by such enemies, is reputed a kind of victory. The
Venetians therefore paid their thanks to God, singing Masses and Psalms
throughout all their Churches, making solemn processions, and giving much alms
both in public and in private, to poor Monastaries, and other religious places.

But Soliman seeking to molest the Venetians in several places, had commanded
Cassin, Sanghiacco of Morea, that assembling the soldiers of the neighboring
parts together, he should besiege Napoli di Romania, and Malvesia. The
Commonwealth had long had the Government of the chief Towns in Morea, a
fruitful Country, and more famous than any other part of Greece, for the number
and worth of her Inhabitants, and which was very convenient for the Venetians,
by reason of her many Havens wherein her ships have safe receptacle. But having
lost Modene and Corone in the last Turkish Wars made against Bajazet Ottaman,
Grandfather to this Soliman, she kept yet those two Towns, strongly seated and
inhabited by people who were very affectionate to the Venetians. Napoli stands
upon the head of a little Promontory, which thrusting it self out from the
land, makes a large and safe Haven, and is environed on three sides by the Sea,
and has a steep and difficult ascent by the Mountain called Palamide, on the
side toward the Land, so as there is only a very strait way which leads to
the City, lying between the side of the mountain and the Sea; and on the
outside, the banks are so high and steep, as no galleys can come to batter the
walls, or land men. The entrance into the Haven, is likewise so strait, as the
Galleys cannot enter thereinto but by one and one, so as they may easily be
kept from entering by the Artillery, especially by those of a little Castle,
seated upon a Rock, about some 300 paces in the Sea, just over against the
mouth of the Haven, so as it may play on all sides upon any Vessel that shall
approach. It cannot be assaulted by landforces, being it lies in midst of the
Sea, nor by galleys, as having so many shelves about it, as none but very small
Vessels can come unto it.

Malvasia is likewise seated in the same place, nearer Cape Malio, upon a
mountain or Rock, divided for the space of 80 paces from a point of land, which
in a long and very narrow shape, thrusts it self into the Sea: so as this City
being seated very high, is wholly environed by the Sea, having no passage to
land but by a bridge, nor can it be waded to on any part, so deep are the
waters round about. And as it is strong and secure by natural situation, so
has nature furnished it with fountains of spring water, and with good and
fruitful land* for there is a fair plain upon the top of the Mountain, bearing
Corn sufficient for 50 or 60 men, which are enough to defend this strongly
seated City against any whatsoever forces. Vittore de Garzoni, had the
Government of Napoli, with the title of Bailo, a man very aged, and well
experienced, by reason of his employments both by Sea and Land. This man did
not only defend the Fort free from all danger by his wisdom, valor, and by
the fidelity of those men; but making his Cavalry make out many sallies, he
secured the Country, and did much indamage the Enemy; therefore Cassin, who in
obedience to Soliman, was come thither with his men, having tried the
Inhabitants of Malvasia both by promises and threats, and finding the
difficulty of the enterprise, and not being sufficiently furnished with any
thing to use violence, or to besiege the Town, after having staid some few
days about Naples, went from thence, disbanding some of his Army, and carried
the rest into the neighboring Country, about six miles from the City.

But Barbarossa, Luftebei, being entered with the rest of the Fleet into the
Streit of Galipoli to disarm, staid abroad with 70 Galleys, and 30 Galliotte,
and other Fly-boats, ran over the Islands of the Archipelagus, which belonged
to the Commonwealth: some whereof having no means, neither by situation nor
Garrison, to defend themselves; othersome through fear, yielded at the first
appearance of the Fleet. As Sciro, a great Island, but little inhabited as
then, which looks upon the Pegasean Gulf. Pathmos, a place of no great note in
it self, but rendered famous by St. John's devotions, one of Christ's Disciples,
who being confined to that Island, writ the Apocalypse there. Legina, of small
circuit, but so well inhabited, as the Turks were said to have carried above
6000 prisoners from thence: it was likewise of better esteem, by reason of the
Haven; wherefore there remained usually a Venetian Magistrate there, who at
this time was Francisco Suriano. There were also some Islands which belonged to
the particular jurisdiction of diverse Gentlemen of Venice; Nio, appertaining to
the P^san family, an Island of about 40 miles about, noted for the admirable
quality of the soil thereof, which whithersoever it be carried, it drives away
all venomous creatures. Stampalia, an Island of greater circuit, and well
inhabited, which belonged to the House of Quirina. Paro, one of the Cyclades,
much spoken of by Poets, and famous for the excellent Marble which is fetched
from thence; it is about fifty miles about, extending from the West to the
East; and the remainders of many noble buildings, show how much it has been
anciently inhabited; and on the North side, it has a little Castle, with a
Haven and Wharfe; this belonged then to the family of Veniero, but being by
sucession to come to Bernardo Segredo, he was gone thither himself to keep it.
Wherefore this alone, of all the rest, made some resistance, and chiefly by his
valor; but the defendants wanting powder, they were forced to surrender
themselves to the discretion of the Enemy, who gave them all their lives, but
made many of them prisoners, amongst whom Segredo himself, who by great good
fortune was afterward freed by the means of one of Ragusa, a Renegado, who had
been long in his gallie, and remembering how well he had been used by him, made
him this return at his great need; and the Island of Tine, although it had a
Fort, and was both by natural situation, and art, able enough to have held
out, took example of the rest, and followed the Victors fortune: but soon
after, the Inhabitants repenting that they had so soon yielded, and desirous to
continue under the Government of the Venetians, free from the Turkish Tyranny;
they rebelled, and of themselves sent into Candia, to desire a Garrison of
soldiers, and a Venetian Magistrate; and this Island does till this day, keep
in loyalty and obedience to the Commonwealth, though it lies in the very jaws
of so potent Enemies. The Island of Nicsia, or rather Nasso, with some other
Neighboring Islands, whereof Iovanni Grispo was Lord, kept still under his
Dominion, for he yielding to the Turks, at the very first appearance of their
Fleet, agreed to pay 5000 Ducats yearly, by way of tribute to Soliman, which
he for the first year sent speedily to Barbarossa: but yet he could not keep
his people from being plundered, wherein the soldiers behaved themselves so
insolently, as they carried booty from thence, worth more than 25000 Ducats.
This is the chief Island of the Cyclades, amongst which it is numbered for one;
and the ground thereof is so fruitful, as it was formerly called, Little
Sicily. Thus did Barbarossa strive to win the love of his soldiers, by the
ruins of these miserable people, and provided great presents for the chief men
of the Court, hoping thereby to win their good will, that he might go to Sea
the next year with greater forces and authority. Some of our Captains were of
opinion, to have followed the Enemy with their whole Fleet, when they went from
Corfu, to hinder these mischiefs which were foreseen by every one, and to keep
possession of those Islands, from whence they reaped great convenience, and
especially, great store of men for their Galleys: yet considering the season,
and the enemies strength, whence some bad accident might befall them; but
chiefly minding the Senates order, and intention of uniting the forces of the
Colleagues, which they could not do, and go so far off with their Fleet; they
laid aside the thought thereof, and resolved that General Pesaro, drawing a
good many men out of the Garrisons of Dalmatia, should go with some galleys to
the taking in of Scardona,; and that Vetturi should go with some other galleys
to Obrovazzo, but he not being able to go thither himself, by reason of his
indisposition of health, sent some Governors of the galleys thither, and
Colonel Gabriele dalla Riva, who was then in Zara; and these were afterward
accompanied by Nicolo Buondelmiero, Captain of the gulf, with some other
galleys, and fly-boats, to assist the enterprise. The Town of Scardona is near
Sebenico, and therefore of great esteem, for the safety of that Fort, and for
the inconveniency which the neighboring parts may receive from thence, it
being in the Enemies hands. The Town was walled round about, but weakly, and
had in it two small Castles. As soon as the Venetians drew near it, after some
small resistance, the Turks surrendered upon discretion, to General Pesaro, who
though he had a good will to save the lives and goods of the Inhabitants; yet
his commands being neither hard, nor obeyed amidst the fury, the first that
entered the Town fell to sacking; and the Turks, who retired to within their
confines to save themselves, meeting with a number of people in Arms, belonging
to the Territory of Sebenico, they were all cut in pieces by them. Francisco
Salmone, was left Governor of the Town by the General, who thought then to
have secured it by a new Fort; but better considering the difficulty, and the
expense of maintaining that place, seated in the midst of the Enemies forces,
and the damage which they might receive, if it should fall back again into the
Turks hands; it was thought better to slight the Castles, and to content
themselves with having deprived the Enemy of such a receptacle. The Turks, who
were in Obrovazzo, though they were but a few, did for a while defend the Town
valiantly, but being forced at last to yield, they retreated into the Castle,
which whilst they were ordering their affairs how to take it, the galleys were
sent for back by the General, by reason of new orders sent from Venice, to go
with the Fleet toward Corfu. Touching the preservation whereof, the Senate had
had very great care, being awakened by the past dangers, and by those eminent
ones which were yet threatened. They therefore sent Captains, Ingineers, Moneys,
and Men, to reduce the Fort to greater security. They likewise desired to
comfort the people that were there, by the presence of the chief
Sea-commanders, and by restoring their losses as much as they could, by
furnishing them with wood, and other Materials, to re-build their houses, which
were destroyed by the enemy. Thus (the winter coming on) ended the war for
this year, the effects whereof were no ways answerable to the so great
preparations; and men's minds were quieted, who stood expecting to what side the
fortune of War would lean.

The Princes bethought themselves in this interim, what was to be done the next
year 1537, wherein their ends were various, and not well known. Soliman seemed
to desire peace with the Venetians, whereof the first Bashaw had, by Solimans
consent, some discourse with Consul Canale, desiring him, that the Ambassador
might come to Constantinople, who was already chosen to that purpose, promising
he should have a safe conduct, and all fair entertainment. But the greater the
unaccustomed civility of these haughty men was, the more were their proceedings
suspected; fearing that they did not intend peace by this Treaty, but to take
the Commonwealth from off friendship with Caesar, and to break the Treaty of
League. Charles the Emperor seemed to be wholly bent upon making war with the
Turks, saying sometimes, that he had a great desire to go himself in person to
that enterprise, and that he very much covered so great glory, which was all
the reward which he desired: and that what Territories soever should be taken
from these Enemies, should by his consent be added to the commonwealth of
Venice, calling her the true Out-bulwork against the Turks, and that therefore
it was a great service to Christendom to increase their power. Caesar made these
outward appearances, and his Officers in Italy, that they might agree with
their Princes outwardly appearing sense, and to make it be believed that he did
really intend it, seemed to be very solicitous in preparing for War. Doria
promised to have his galleys ready to put to Sea very early, and that he would
join with the Venetian Fleet; saying, that he very much desired to do some
signal service in this War to Christendom, and particularly to the
Commonwealth. And Marquis Guasto, Governor of Millan, seemed as ready to lend
his helping hand to the business in all things that were requisite; he sought,
upon all occasions of discourse, especially when he met with the Secretary of
the Commonwealth, to advance any thing whereby Caesar might be believed to be
well-minded to the League, and zealous of the good of Christendom; yet there
were those that doubted, lest Caesar by these outward shows might seek to
conceal his other more secret thoughts; and that he either had other ends, or
was not well resolved either upon War, or Peace, but would observe what others
did, and pitch upon what might be best for himself; but in the interim, by
seeming so desirous of War, he made the Venetians listen more eagerly after the
League, and reposing their trust therein, to break off the Treaty of Peace
which was propounded to them by Soliman; so as necessitating them to adhere to
him, and to continue War with the Turks, he thought to reap some advantage to
himself, by making the Commonwealth his Bulwork, and so with safety to
himself, prolong time for other resolutions. His chief intentions being to
mind his war against the French, and to settle his possession in the State of
Millan. There were many signs that these were Cesar's aim; his delay in giving
answer to the Letters written unto him many months before from the Senate
touching the League; whence it was conceived, that he would neither be bound to
any thing, nor yet declare himself so fully, as that his own handwriting
might be a witness; likewise his not coming with the King of France to a
general Truce; his continual raising of new difficulties, and impediments in
the treaty of Peace, wherein the Pope and Venetians had often interposed
themselves, though to little purpose, he still laying the fault upon the
French, but not being able to conceal his ill will toward them, and his being
ill satisfied with their actions; to which was likewise added a certain common
report, that he endeavored to make Barbarossa his friend, by the means of a
Spaniard, who was Nephew to the Viceroy of Cicily, then prisoner amongst the
Turks: and that he held other intelligences in Constantinople, to secure his
Dominions from being invaded by the Turks. And it was well known, that
Barbarossa (passing through the narrow Seas of Messina, when there was none to
withstand him, if he had had a mind to have attempted any thing) had not done
any prejudice to Cesars affairs. The King of F. appeared to be really more
desirous of Peace, for he might expect more advantage thereby: he desired to
see the affairs accommodated between the Turks and the Commonwealth, to free
her from being enforced to join with Caesar, and to fence himself by the common
Arms, from the danger of the Turkish war, and because having ashare in the
business, he hoped, if war were to ensue between him and Caesar, he should the
more easily draw the Venetians to side with him, when they should be free from
other suspicions and impediments, knowing that they were troubled at Cesars too
much greatness. He likewise desired peace with the Emperor, hoping by that
means to obtain his desire, that the Dukedom of Millan might be released by
Caesar, to his second Son, the Duke of Orleans, which he saw he was every day
less likely to get by force of Arms. He had always listened therefore to all
proposalls of peace; and Francisco Iustiniano, being sent to that Court by the
Senate, not as an Ambassador, but as Gentleman of Venice, to that purpose; he
was very well received by the King, who thanked the Senate, and entreated them
to continue their endeavors of mediating an accord with Caesar, to whom Luigi
Badoaro was sent at the same time in name of the public. Nor did the Pope
cease to do the like; who, though he had oft-times interessed himself in this
business, and done no good; had lastly sent the Cardinal de Carpi, to the
Emperor, and Cardinal Iacobaccio, to the King of France, to use his
Holinesses Authority and entreaties to both of them, in making peace between
them, so as they might afterward unite their Forces against the common Enemy
of Christendom. To which the King of France answered, that he was very willing
to make peace, as he would witness to the world by his actions. Wherefore
understanding that the Emperor had propounded a meeting of Commissioners on
both sides at Narbonne, he forthwith sent the Cardinal of Lorein thither, and
Monsieur Legrande Maistre, with power to conclude the Peace: to assist the
which, and for the quicker and more easy resolution of such doubts as might
arise; his Brother in law, the King of Navar, his wife, the Queen of France,
and his sister, the Queen of Navar; were by his direction come very near
Narbone, with larger Commissions, and greater power to confirm the Agreement.
But as none doubted, but that the King of France was well inclined to peace, so
all men believed, that he would govern his actions and counsels only according
to his own ends and particular Interests; so as it was likely he might alter
his mind, if he should discover any thing which might make for his advantage,
though it were to the prejudice of the rest, as he had lately done; nothing
else being able to keep him, from making the Turks make War against Caesar, from
whence arose another War against the Commonwealth. For these reasons, it was
thought that the other Princes could not build any firm foundation upon the
resolution of the French, especially not the Venetians, whose actions did admit
of no delay, nor irresolution. But the Pope and Venetians proceeded very
heartily in this business, having an eye not only to their own peculiar
interest, and present advantage, but to the common service of Christendom, and
to the present threatening dangers, which if they were not remedied, would daily
grow greater. The first thing that Paul the 3d did, after he had assumed the
Popedom, was, to endeavor the uniting of the Christian Princes against the
Infidels; wherefore appearing always neutral in the discords which happened
between Charles the Emperor, and the King of France, he had studied very much
to make them friends. But being in better hope to effect this his desire, now
since the Venetians waged war with the Turks, their forces by Sea being held to
be of very great moment in such an enterprise, though they could not be drawn
to do so before, for many good respects, nor now, without this urgent
necessity, he used his utmost endeavors to unite the Christian Princes in a
League against the Turks; and knowing by the late experience of Doria's
unseasonable departure, that no good could be done without a certain limitation
and firm tie; as also hoping, that a firm union being made between these three
prime Princes, the rest would be the more easily persuaded to embrace the
League: he readily offered all that the Apostolic sea was able to do,
remitting himself therein, to the Venetian Senate. But the Venetians finding
that they were at open war with the Turks, and those respects ceasing which had
formerly made them be very cautious, though they had always been very desirous
to oppose the Ottaman greatness, began now to forego their former fear, and to
have better hopes, and were confident not only to maintain their own
Dominions, but to suppress the Turkish forces, if the Christian Princes would
join with them. There was a certain necessity likewise, which made them think
of continuing the war, and of embracing the League, since the danger of so
potent Neighbors did increase so fast, as to delay opposing them, was rather a
seeming, than a true security to the affairs of the Commonwealth. But they
were chiefly persuaded to believe well, out of a firm opinion, that whole
Germany would move jointly against the Turks; for being awakened by Solimans
last attempts, they might know that the danger of the Turkish forces were
greater and nearer hand, than they were before held to be by many. So as it was
not likely that they would let slip so good an occasion of revenging the
injuries which they had received, of recovering the honor of military glory,
so much valued by that warlike Nation, and of securing themselves from greater
dangers, but that the Princes and Hauns-Towns would readily wage war with the
Turks, with powerful forces, whilst being busied at Sea, they could make but
small resistance, on that side: nor would they want a head, who would incite
them thereunto, since Ferdinand of Austria, brother to Charles the Emperor,
and who was to succeed him in the Empire, having been much molested by Soliman,
seemed greatly to desire such an occasion, as was now offered, promising to
adhere unto the League; and Caesar named him, to be one of the chief
contractors, whereat the Venetians were very well pleased. They therefore
willingly gave way, that it should be referred to the Pope and Emperor, to
nominate what share of expense he should be at, with the other Colleagues, and
did earnestly endeavor to confirm him in this resolution, by their Ambassador
Marin Iustiniano, who was then resident with him. Ferdinand had often had
occasion, and much to his prejudice, to sustain the fury of the Turkish forces,
who having possessed themselves of that part of Hungary, which lies between the
Rivers Sava and Drava, were become his very formidable neighbors, and had
thereby free and open ingresse into Ferdinando's territories, whose subjects
were vexed by the continual inroads and pillagings of the Turkish Garrisons,
upon those confines, even in time of Truce. Therefore Ferdinando and his
subjects appeared very desirous and willing, both for their honor and safety,
to suppress the Turkish forces, and to drive them out of that Province. Great,
and very convenient were the forces of Germany, a country abounding in men,
horses, moneys, and victuals, and in all things belonging to war; but being
perpetually troubled with domestical discords, by reason of so many
diversities in Religion, and Government, she was but weak, and unfit for great
enterprises. Bearing the rather with the injuries of the Turks, and with some
dishonor suffering her dangers to increase, because she hated the too much
greatness of the House of Austria. It being therefore thought most requisite,
for the doing of any thing against the Turks, that Germany should jointly
resolve to take up Arms, without which, the Turkish Armies, and those forces,
which are the true foundation, of the power and grandeur of their Empire, would
remain safe and entire, or but little prejudiced. The Venetian Senate, that
they might leave nothing unattempted, resolved to send express Ambassadors to
the Electors of the Empire, and to other Princes, and Hauns-towns in Germany,
to persuade them to make war, holding out unto them the opportunity which was
then offered, of regaining the ancient honor, and military glory of the German
Nation; and promising, that the Commonwealth would and should make use of all
her forces, to keep the common enemy busied elsewhere; so as being assaulted
both by sea and land, the way would be made plain for famous victories for
Christendom. Iovan Veniero, and Luigi Badoaro, who being gone (as has been
said) to that Court, upon occasion of the peace of France, had received orders
to stay there, till he should receive new orders from the Senate; treated often
with the Emperor, touching the conclusion of the League, exhorting him to send
free and sufficient Commissions, to his Agents at Rome, and witnessing the firm
and constant resolution of the Senate, to join with him, and willingly to
undergo the charge and danger of the war. They excited him likewise, to
solicit provisions for the Fleet, for the effecting of what was resolved upon,
and concluded at Rome. Caesar listened very well to these things, and seemed very
desirous to bend all his forces against the Turks, in the Eastern parts;
affirming, as he had often done before, that he would go thither himself in
person, and that he should be exceeding glad, that the Commonwealth, which he
did much love and esteem, might increase her greatness and reputation, by the
recovery of the Towns, which the Turks had usurped from her. The Senate
therefore sent forthwith to their Ambassador, Mark Antonio Contarini, who was
at Rome, particular information of their good will to the League, with orders,
to endeavor the speedy conclusion thereof, though he might give way unto some
things.

Thus was the time protracted, without making any answer to the Consuls
Letters, the Senate not being resolved what to do, touching the propositions of
peace made by the Turks, and to the particular discourse, which the Bashaw had
had with the Consul; which many of the Senate being displeased at, they
oft-times opposed it, when any new commissions or orders were spoken of, to be
sent to the Ambassador at Rome, concerning the League. They considered, That
it was not expedient, the Commonwealth should bind her self so fast upon this
Treaty of the League, as they should debar themselves all negotiations of
peace. That they were first to examine well the present state and condition of
affairs, and see how they could make war; with what forces, what moneys, with
what helps it was to be maintained; whether they would be so constant, in
persevering in trouble and danger, as they appeared ready to undertake it,
whilst yet afar off. That the public Exchequer was much exhausted, by the so
long wars on Terra ferma, their subjects weak and poor. That their cities did
rather require rest, then to enter into a more dangerous war then the former
were. That the former successes might show, how uncertain and ill-grounded the
hopes were, which were reposed in assistance from foreign Princes, since
unless the strong situation of Corfu, and the inconveniences, or
dis-accommodations of the enemy, had not preserved that Fort, and freed the
Commonwealth from so great a loss, Doria had suffered it to fall into the
hands of the enemy, deluding all the Commonwealth's hopes and designs. Nor
were the weighty interests of so many citisens to be despised, who being to
sustain the heavy burden of public taxes,, had their estates in the hands of
the Turks, which they might hope to recover by treaty. That not to listen to
any proposition of peace or concord, was to contend with the Barbarians
themselves in Barbarism, to exceed them in those things, whereof they were most
to be blamed. That it would be a great disadvantage, if things succeeding
unprosperously in the progress of war, we be forced to seek for that peace
from the Turks, which is now voluntarily offered by them. That if no other good
might be got by such a treaty, it would not be amiss to delay those dangers,
which were threatened by such an enemy, that they might prepare the better to
defend themselves. That if these things were well weighed, as they ought to be,
why should the occasion of any good be let slip? Wherefore should the answer,
expected by the Bashaw, so long be deferred? Wherefore should not the Bailo be
made acquainted with the Senate's will? That delay could produce nothing but
mischief. That Soliman 's anger would not be a little increased, by the
refusing his offers, who held himself scandalized by what the Fleet had done,
and (as was said by the Grandees of that Court) by the small account that was
made of his person, no Ambassador being sent to him, when he came so near the
States dominions, as was usually done upon like occasions to other Princes.
Moreover, this silence would make the Turks more diligent, in making the
greater preparation for war, since they must needs find, we had no mind to
have peace. In fine, that to advance so far in the treaty of League, without
proposing any thing of peace, had no other aspect, but of enforcing the Senate
to embrace the resolution, of continuing in war; which, if well weighed, was of
all things most to be abhorred. But these things were thus answered by those,
who thought it the safer safer way to treat of League, then of Peace: That they
were not alienated from the thought of peace* but did endeavor to provide so
for the emergencies of the present times, as they might be able to sustain war.
That therefore they did not without just cause, forbear writing at the present
to Constantinople, lest they might make the Christian Princes jealous, whereby
they might slacken their providing for war. That there remained many things yet
to be considered, before the League could be concluded, wherein time might be
protracted; and when things should be drawn nearer to a head, they might have
better occasion to know the Turks minds, and so bear both the League and Peace
in hand at once, and pitch upon what might be thought best for the
Commonwealth. That too much haste could only discover their weakness the
more unto the Turks, and make them more insolent in their Articles of
Agreement; the which the more they should seem to desire, it would be had upon
the harder terms. That no matter of expense was to be had in consideration,
since howsoever, they were to arm themselves, and to treat of peace with their
weapons in their hands; not to prejudice the conditions of peace, and not to
commit themselves too rashly, to the discretion and faith of their perfidious
enemies. These reasons were alleged for the League, and the business at
Constantinople was deferred. But at last, many being desirous that somewhat
should be written, and that the business should not be totally given over, it
was proposed unto the Senate, That the Consul might tell the Bashaw Aiace, That
the Commonwealth had great reason to complain of Soliman, who, unprovoked by
any public injury, had broke the peace, and sent his men in hostile manner to
Corfu, without expecting Orsino's return, sent by his consent, nay, by his
order, to Venice, and with promise, not to attempt any novelty, till by his
return it might be known, what the truth of those passages was, which the Turks
took ill, and who was really in the fault. That it had always been the
steadfast intention of the Senate* to preserve peace and amity with that Empire;
and that upon occasion of so many wars made by Soliman, they had never
disturbed his enterprises, but had always kept their word inviolably, and kept
constant to their neutrality. That at this very time, General Pesaro dreamt of
nothing less, then of impeding his Captains designs, no not of giving them
any suspicion; but that he was come into the Gulf, to join with the other
sea-Captains, and shun such accidents; but that being driven by the winds, he
was forced to pass into the Rivers of Puglia, where the Turkish Fleet lay.
That they did believe, Soliman stood well affected to the Commonwealth, (as he
was affirmed to do) and well inclined to peace, since being a just and a wise
Prince, he knew it became him, to preserve friendship with the Venetians, who
had given him no occasion to the contrary. Nor was it fitting, that good
intelligence between Princes should be broken, by the inconsiderate actions of
any particular Officers. That therefore they were confident, he would restore
the goods of private Merchants, which were detained, who, upon the faith of so
great a Prince, were persuaded to trade in his Dominions. Their intention
hereby was, that the Consul seeking by such discourse as this, to fifth somewhat
more particularly into the Turks thoughts, should begin, if he should find any
good hopes, to commence the Treaty of peace. This proposal being made in the
Senate, three days were spent about it, which being over, there wanted two
votes to make the business be resolved upon; so as there was nothing decided
in the point, though it had been long disputed by personages of great dignity
and authority. The promises of these Princes had made so great an impression in
the minds of all men, as confiding very much therein, and being therefore
desirous to shun any the least suspicion, that the League was not really
intended by them, they would listen to nothing which might persuade to the
contrary.

Don Lopes, the Cesarian Ambassador, hearing of this irresolution, he hoped,
that the Commonwealth might be brought to a nearer conjunction with Caesar: He
therefore renewed the motion of uniting the Fleets, which had formerly been made
by him and Doria. He appeared in the College, and labored much to persuade,
that for the common service, no longer delay should be made, in giving order to
our Generals, to go to Messina, and join with Doria's Galleys, who, he said,
had sufficient commission from the Emperor in that point; and that he should
not be wanting in any thing, which concerned the good and safety of
Christendom, and in particular, that of the Commonwealth. He showed, That the
Emperor stood very well affected to the common good, and that his forces
should be answerable to this his affection; for besides the Fleet now in being,
other ships of all sorts were arming in the Spanish Havens, and great
provisions of men and moneys were raising, throughout all his dominions. That
the Emperor Charles desired to justify himself always, before both God and
man, that he had discharged his part gallantly, not having spared either
expense or labor, to quell the pride of the enemies of Christendom. That he
had therefore at all times solicited other Princes, whose interest was
concerned in this common cause, to know the dangers which grew daily greater,
tending to the ruin of Christianity, which he, by reason of his greatness,
might live freer from, then any other; but that he did more value the common
good, then his own particular concernment. That there needed no new examples to
show, that the weakness of Christian Princes, and the exaltation of their
enemies, proceeded from their own luke warmness. That the last unfortunate
success of Rhodes might be considered, which being assaulted by this very
Soliman, and not succored by any Christian Prince, fell miserably into the
power of the Turks, to the so much loss, prejudice, and shame of all
Christendom. But that there was some excuse for those successes then, since
those Princes, from whom they might expect best assistance, were disarmed;
which would not prove so now, when the Emperor and Commonwealth had two
powerful Fleets at sea, to fall upon the enemy. What was there more to be
expected? That forces were to be made use of whilst they were en^ire, and
losses obviated before they happened, and not to suffer the one and the other
Fleet, to run peradventure some hasard, become weaker, (since men's designs do
oft-times miscarry, by several unthought-of accidents) or that the Turks
should begin to get footing in Italy, and so these mischiefs prove too late to
be remedied. By these and the like reasons, the Ambassador strove to make the
Senators leave their Neutrality, and declare enmity to the Turks. But they
being grave and considerate men, would not be moved by these majesticall words,
and ill-grounded promises, continuing their resolution of not taking up arms,
unless enforced by necessity, against so powerful an enemy, and who might
prejudice the dominions of the Commonwealth in so many several parts, she not
having forces of her self sufficient to defend them, nor having reason to
confide much in others. It was therefore resolved to answer in general terms,
That they returned thanks to Caesar; but could do no more at this time, out of
many weighty and well known respects, especially, since their friendship and
nearer conjunction being desired, by the French, and by the Turks, they had
answered them, they could not give them satisfaction; for that it was the
steadfast resolution of the Venetian Senate, to keep their plighted faith to all
men, as it became all Princes to do. That they would notwithstanding keep in
arms, for any chance that might occur, having always, together with their own
safety, an eye to the common good of Christendom. The Ambassador seemed
satisfied with this answer, replying nothing as then; but returning some few
days after to the College, he made an other demand, which was, That since the
French threatened danger to the State of Millan, they would raise 6000 Foot for
the defense thereof, and send their Gens d' Arms thither, according to the
Articles of the last Agreement. Wherein showing themselves to be very ready,
necessary orders were fortwith given out for it. But the Commanders being come
with their Horse and many Foot, to those Confines, the Duke of Urbin, who
commanded the Venetian Militia in chief, put them in mind, that they were to
pass no farther, they being only to defend the State of Millan, whereof there
appeared no need at the present, since the French were held play as yet in
Piemont. That if they should pass the River Sesia, and enter the Dukedom of
Millan, that then their tie of confederacy would take place; and that upon such
an occasion, the people of the Commonwealth should be ready.

ALl treaty of Peace being laid aside, and the hopes of the safety and defense
of the States Dominions by Sea resting in Arms, the Venetians are very diligent
in providing all things necessary for War. They prepare a great Fleet,
Soldiers, Ammunition, and Victuals for the service of the Islands, and other
Maritine places. Those of Napoli and Malvasia, desired that their Garrisons
might be increased; but especially to be furnished with Victuals, for want
whereof Napoli had been in danger of falling into the Enemies hands; they
promised, (if assisted and succored,) to undergo the greatest dangers of War,
and to continue constant to the Commonwealth, even to the last extremity. The
Island of Candia made the same request; wherein there having been some
commotions and scandalous speeches given out, that they would surrender unto
the Enemy, when their Army should approach, by reason of the terror which the
sacking of the Islands in the Archipelagus, had infused into the generality of
the chiefest cities in the Kingdom, they had sent Ambassadors to Venice to
purge themselves of that fault, which they said was occasioned by the error of
some few, of mean condition, rather out of their indiscretion and
cowardlinesse, than out of ill will. They therefore offered to serve the
Commonwealth with their lives and livelihoods, promising to give good
testimony of their Loyalty, and humbly desiring that they might not be
abandond; for that they were ready to defend themselves to the last, and would
never go less in their affection to the Commonwealth, whereof many of them
were members by an ancient Colony, and therefore the more interessed in this
cause. The Senate listened very attentively to these things, and dismissed the
Ambassadors with gracious words and promises; and ordered the General to send
forthwith 25 galleys toward Candia, under the command of Commissary
Pasqualigo, who was likewise to send soldiers and victuals to Napoli, and to
leave four galleys to guard it. The Island and Fort of Cor^u, were likewise
furnished with necessaries, and had 1000 foot sent from Venice to add unto the
Garrison, conducted by Valerio Orsino, who was to be the chief head of that
Militia, the Senate not being well satisfied with Naldo's actions. Dalmatia was
furnished with several Troops of light Horse, chosen out of stout men of Greece
and Crovatia, to defend the Country from the inrodes of the Enemy; but the
uncertainty of what the Enemy would undertake, did increase the expense and
difficulty, whereof the discourse was very various, so as they were
necessitated to secure all their Territories by Sea, which were exposed to the
sudden assaults of the Enemy. Nor was the defense of Friuli to be neglected;
for it being said, that Soliman would march with his Army himself in person;
there was no slight suspicion, that he would approach on that side, and enter
on those confines. There were at this time 50 galleys in the Fleet, which was
in the East, whereof General Capello being come to Corfu, had taken the
Government, and Governors were already chosen to arm two and twenty more, and
all other fitting things were taken order for: three bastard galleys were
likewise prepared, and six great ones, which were to be commanded by one
particular Captain, so as they amounted in all, to the number of 80 galleys.
But the General finding many of the galleys in ill condition, in point of men,
by reason of a great mortality which had happened in the whole Fleet: he was
ordered to go to Zantes, and to Cefalonia, where he was to use all means
possible to reinforce them, that they might be ready and well provided at all
points against the time: that it was thought the joining of the Fleets would be
determined by the Articles of the League, wherein the greater diligence was
used, that it might be an instigation to the slownesse of the rest. This mean
while, the firm and final conclusion of the League, was solicited of the
forces, whereof there was so generally a great opinion conceived, as it hushed
the Treaty of Peace, though in the progress of the Treaties, diverse
difficulties were discovered to be greater then were at first imagined; so as
this endeavor was a while laid aside, and undetermined. The Venetians had
pleased the Emperor, in the choice of the Captain General, giving way that
that high dignity should be conferred upon Andrea Doria, and the Pope, to
gratify the Venetians, had chosen Marco Grimani, Patriark of Aqualegia, for
his Commander; a Venetian, of a noble and rich Family, and one in whom the
Commonwealth did therefore much confide; but the proportion of expense, which
every one of the Colleagues were to be at in the common enterprise, was not yet
determined: for it being known, that the third part of the whole, would be an
insupportable burden for the Apostolic Sea, the Venetians were content to
bear a part therein, Caesar being to supply the rest. But his Agents, though
they acknowledged the Pope should be assisted, would not notwithstanding give
way that his proportion therein should exceed the Venetians. But at last, Caesar
doubting lest, that the longer the conclusion of the League should be delayed,
their minds who were set most hotly upon the war, might grow cool, and that
thereby the Senate might at last listen to a treaty of Peace, whereby he
himself were to sustain the whole force of the Turks: he gave leave to his
Ministers in Rome, to stipulate all things agreed upon, and particularly to
consent, for matter of expense, that the Pope should not be charged with above
a sixth part, and that for the remainder of the Popes share, Caesar should pay
three six parts, and the Venetians two.

Whilst these things were in treaty at Rome, Genesino, one of Pera, who served
as interpreter for the Commonwealth at Constantinople, came unexpectedly to
Venice, and brought Letters form the Consul, a message from the first Bashaw,
and Captain of the Sea: Which propounded, advised, and invited to a treaty of
Peace, and then gave a particular account of the great preparations of the
Fleet, and soldiers, which were a making in several parts of the Turkish
Empire: he told them in the name of Aiace, the chief Bashaw, that he did much
wonder, he had not all this while, received any answer to his first proposalls:
that notwithstanding he did still continue the same good wishes for the
Commonwealth, and that the way to peace was not yet altogether shut up, if
they would endeavor to pacify Solimans anger, by sending an Ambassador to
that Court, who might justify their late actions, and make reparation for the
losses that had been had, which otherwise was not to be allayed, but would
thunder out to the great prejudice of the Commonwealth.

These Propositions of Peace were the rather believed, by reason of a speech
which was given out at Constantinople, and which grew still hotter and hotter,
that Soliman would bend his forces either against Persia or Hungary: either of
which, proving always sharp to the O^tamans; and that, he having thereby
greater designs to penetrate into Germany, he must give over all other
Enterprises, which was thought to be the reason of Genesino, his being treated
so civilly, and of his being extraordinarily favored by the attendance of two
Olacchi, to Castel-Nuovo, and from thence to Cattaro, by the servants of one of
those Sangiacchi, to the end that his passage might be the more speedy and
safe. His coming, and these new offers, wrought much with some of the
Senators, who were before hottest for the prosecution of war, and confirmed
others in their opinion, who were first inclined to a treaty of peace.
Wherefore the Senate meeting oftentimes, to resolve something hereupon, Mark
Antonio Cornaro, who had formerly opposed this opinion, spoke thus in
opposition to the proposal.

I confess, I know not why we should now be of another opinion, than we have
hitherto been, since the state of affairs, or the reasons which prevailed with
us then, are either the same, or if any new accidents ought to be had in
consideration, they are such as ought to confirm us more in our former mind.
It was not out of free will, nor election, not out of hopes of enlarging the
confines of our Empire, that we took up Arms, or declared war against the
Turks: but we were compelled thereunto to defend our state and liberty. When at
the raising of the Camp from before Corfu, propositions of peace were offered
us by Bashaw Aiace, we, having reason to suspect this his proposition, and
being persuaded that the Authors of the war could not at the same time desire
peace, did not value such an invitation, but continued in our providing for
war, and in a treaty of League. Soon after we received Letters from our
Consul, which told us of a new endeavor of Agreement, which was promised him
after the coming of the Grand Signeur to Constantinople. The Senate was
herewith acquainted again, it was argued and discust maturely by the chief
Senators; and it was concluded, that we should continue our resolution of not
giving ear to any such discourse, fearing that this proposal was nothing else,
but to lull us asleep by these vain hopes of peace, and to make us negligent in
providing for so weighty and dangerous a war as we are entered into, and must of
necessity continue, unless we abandon our selves. Wherefore to witness this
our constant resolution, of making league with the Christians, and no peace
with the Turks, and to put a necessity upon us of keeping to this resolution,
we communicated our Consuls advertisements, and the things which were held out
unto us therein, to the Pope and Emperor, inciting them by our offers, and by
our example, to provide for all things necessary, not only to defend
themselves, but stoutly to make war upon the Turks. Shall we now, four months
after the first proposal, after having permitted our Fleet and soldiers, to
assault and take the Turks towns, when we have reason to believe, that Soliman
is more incenst against us, for the scorn which he may think is put upon him,
by our so long delay, in returning an answer, after having so constantly
affirmed, that we would secure our dangers only by war, after having refused
the Popes and Emperors advice, who were first inclined to peace, and did
modestly persuade us to embrace it. After, I say, having thus blocked up all
ways, of coming to any agreement by these our proceedings, and quite cut off
the thread of this treaty, shall we reassume this discourse, as if it lay in
us to make peace, and that by altering our opinion, we could easily secure our
selves from danger, and return to our former condition of peace and
tranquillity? Such thoughts might peradventure prevail, when we might appear
driven to make this treaty of Agreement, by the powerful reasons of Doria 's
unseasonable departure, by the Pope's haesitation, of assisting us with
subsidies from the Clergy, by the heat of the war in Piemont, wherein the
forces of the two greatest Princes of Christendom were employed; and by having
many of our Towns unprovided of sufficient Garrisons. Then such an action would
have been praised, and justified by all men. But to dream of any such thing
now, whereunto all these contrary reasons were not able to persuade us, when
the state and condition of affairs is altered, when the Emperor is willing to
sustain the war together with us, when the Pope has condescended to all our
desires, when the League is brought to so near a conclusion; now, when Truce is
made between the Emperor and King of France, with hopes that peace may ensue;
when (God be praised) our sea-Forts are well provided of men and ammunition,
would certainly be too unseasonable an advice, too mean, and too mis-becomming
the constancy and gravity, when with this Senate is wont to proceed. But I
beseech you, say there should be no such respects as these, which do
notwithstanding really concur in this our resolution, and are very weighty, and
of great concernment; let us consider what hope there is, of bringing this
treaty to a good end; and grant it might be had, what security, what true quiet
can such a peace bring with it? On the contrary, what prejudice may our affairs
suffer, by this vain undertaking? We see how ill the Turks are minded toward
us, they having taken occasion to bereave us by war, of some part of our
dominions; they have without any occasion detained our ships, our Merchants,
and contrary to the Law of Nations, usurped their goods, violating thereby the
public faith. Are not the immoderate taxes increased upon the Merchandise,
which are brought from their countries to this city, their detaining two of our
Consuls, who were secured by the Articles of peace; their imprisoning them
amongst the meaner sort of men, their having so barbarously cut off the heads
of the Masters of our Galleys, taken in the disorder of that night, no open nor
public breach of peace having preceded that act, evident signs, that they
despise our Nation, and our Commerce? But why do I instance in these things?
did not Soliman promise to expect Orsino 's return, who was sent unto us by his
consent, nay, by his order, to know, how we could justify our Officers
actions, and what the Senate's mind was, concerning war or peace? yet not
staying for an answer from us, he sent his Fleet against Corfu, making open war
against us, and exercising his arms against our poor su^jects, in a scornful
and e^raged manner; and shall we now think, that we may trust the security of
our affairs, upon the faith of these barbarous Infidells? shall we believe,
that they propound peace unto us, with a desire of being our friends, and with
a sincere mind to observe it? Certainly, their designs are otherwise, and
much otherwise their thoughts: They have set their mind upon this our S^ate,
they would suppress this Commonwealth, which they think does somewhat
counterpoise their forces at sea, and does not a little hinder their d^signes,
of being Monarchs of the world. But to humble us the more easily, they seek by
all means possible to separate us from the friendship of other Christian
Princes, that they may afterward assault us, when we shall be destitute of all
help. They therefore leave nothing unattempted, which may cause jealousy and
^istrust in those Princes, with whom they very well know, we are ^reating of a
confederacy against them, and to hinder those unions, which is the only thing
they dread: For there is no Prince in Christendom able of himself to
counterp^ise their forces. We hear, that great preparations of an Army and
Fleet, are making at Constantinople; that Barbarossa is ready to put to sea, as
soon as the season will suffer him; that the whole public discourse is of
nothing but war, of assaulting Candia, and of returning to besiege Corfu; and
shall we esteem these to be actions becoming one, who propounds peace in
sincerity, and that they are not rather true signs of abuse and ill will? And
if the Turks (as it is clearly seen) do not intend peace, but war, what fruit
can we persuade our selves, that this our Treaty can produce? wherein, if what
we say shall be believed, our enemies will think we are very weak, which will
encourage them the more to oppress us; and if they shall suspect us, they will
be the more i^^^nsed against us, thinking themselves deluded by a vain Treaty,
which intends no conclusion. When Mahomet, when Bajazet, waged war with our
Commonwealth, they conceiving some suspicion and ^ear, that the Christian
Princes would join, had recourse to this very remedy, to disturb their union;
they were the first that proffered us discourse of agreement, and seemed
desirous of friendship and peace; but at last, the cheat was too late
discovered, and without having reaped any security to our affairs, by listening
to such a treaty, nor yet kept off offenses, we were left our selves alone to
sustain the violence of the Turkish forces, with alike misfortune, but not with
alike forces; in the one war, we l^st the Island of Negraponte, and in the
other, most of what we possessed in Morea. But suppose (which for my part I
cannot bring my self to believe) that we might now have peace, what peace, I
beseech you, would it prove? what security, what quiet should we get thereby?
We must be still at the trouble, and at the expense of war, for fear of the
Turkish forces at sea, and for their doubtful fidelity. We must have Fleets
every year, Garrisons, Fortifications, be still in jealousies. And say, they
should for a while keep their words to us, shall we believe, that these
perpetual enemies to peace will sheath up their swords, and not make use of
them elsewhere, to the prejudice of Christendom? They will keep peace with us,
that they may the better make war upon the Emperor, whilst he is busied in
other wars with the King of France, and shall want our assistance, that so they
may assault Puglia; and meeting with no resistance, possess themselves of some
strong hold, and get sure footing in Italy. So as by deferring war for a while,
we shall only increase the Turks power, and draw greater and more certain
ruin upon our selves. Since then the League is so far proceeded in, since it
is hoped, that there may be a firm and sincere union, of the minds and forces
of Christian Princes; since we find such willingness in our own subjects, and
in forrainers, to make this war; and that powerful and warlike Transalpine
Nations, the Polacks and Bohemians, (as we are now given to understand) offer
to assist us both with men and money; Why are we still doubtful? why seem we to
be afeard of our own shadows? Shall we not once put the valor and fortune of
this Commonwealth to the trial? We may already know, that our standing idle
spectators of other men's dangers, as we have done for these many years, may for
a while have prolonged our dangers, but has after made them greater. And
certainly, till this enemy be weakened, and bereft of his maritine forces, we
shall never have true peace and safety. The Turkish power, and their victories
obtained in Christendom, ought not to affrighten us so much, but that we may
rouse up our selves, and hope for good; since we know, it has not been done by
true warlick valor, but by the numbers of their soldiers, wherewith, to their
great good fortune, having to do but with one sole Potentate, they have gotten
to a great height; and that it is therefore, that this otherwise base and vile
people, have proved victorious and formidable. But when they shall be fought
withal by equal, nay, I may say, by much greater forces; when they shall be
enforced to defend themselves at home in several places, their weakness and
our error will be discovered. And say, these happy successes shall not
correspond with our hopes; we may treat of peace at another time, with more
advantage and honor, when we shall be armed by our own forces, and by those of
others. And if the friendship of other Princes cannot sufficiently avail us to
make war, it will give us credit to make peace; and if by misfortune we prove
not victorious, we shall at least have shown our generosity; so as our country
and Senate may be wished, to have had been more successful, but not more wise
nor valiant; wherein having answered the opinion, which the world has of our
wisdom and generosity, the honor and dignity of the public will be sustained,
as far as the condition of these times will permit.

This Cornaro's discourse wrought very much upon the minds of those, that were
already that ways inclined; but when he had done, Marco Foscari, one of the
Savii, who propounded the business, a man of great authority, both for his
learning, and for his worthy carriage in many employments, which he had past
through, replied thus.

I cannot say, I have altered my opinion, for I was always minded, that the
Consuls Letters should be answered, and that the treaty of peace should not be
neglected. But I may truly say, that though I had thought otherwise before, I
now find such new accidents, if we shall consider them according to truth, and
not according to our own desires, as would make me embrace those offers, which
I had formerly refused; but being already settled in my opinion, they do confirm
me the more therein. I believe it fares thus with the most of this Senate,
since the business having been often brought to the question, it has been
carried but by two voices only. Nor can I see, from whence this so great and
so extraordinary confidence, in our selves, and in our own forces, can arise;
whence this great belief, which is given to the words and promises of Princes,
who usually say rather that, the belief whereof makes more for their advantage,
then what they do really intend. And yet the business is of so great
concernment, as if we commit an error therein, we may repent too late, with
loss and shame. I fear, Gentlemen, that we are by a certain evil fate drawn
to our ruin. We know, that our Fleet is visited with sore sickness, and
brought to a weak condition; that, if we will recruite it, we must draw
soldiers out of our Garrisons, and thereby weaken the defense of our chief
Forts by sea: And yet they may be all said, to be in danger at once, and that
they all stand in need of many men to defend them, since we do not know, to
what part the Turkish Fleet will betake it self. We have but too few soldiers
to resist the enemy in so many places; and yet we can scarcely give them their
pay, which enforces us against our wills, to suffer our Captains to give
injurious speeches against the Commonwealth. Do not you remember, what Camillo
Orsino writ unto us, too boldly the other day to this purpose, complaining of
the delay of pay to his soldiers? That if we cannot maintain war, we may do
well to make peace. We must every day lay on more taxes, which we see will
quickly be not to be gotten, let us use what rigor we please. It is too great
an error to believe, that a War, which costs above 200000 Ducats a month, can
be maintained out of the purses of private men. And yet we are pleased so to
flatter our selves, as not to appear to want power; we believe we shall do
impossibilities. But let us go a little further, how can we ground our selves
upon the assistance of other Princes, who are of several opinions, and who
govern themselves by reasons, contrary to ours? I believe, the Pope means well;
yet, be it either for his great age, or out of any other reason, he is so
irresolute in all his proceedings, as we find no good by his good will. Many
months have been spent in desires, that the Commonwealth may make use of (what
I may call their own) the Tenths of our Clergy, to employ those moneys in so
pious an use, and in time of such necessity. Yet, though we have good words
given us, we can find no dispatch, nor do I yet know what will become thereof.
And if I must confess the truth, I fear, he appears to be more forward in this
business of the League in speech, that he may seem to do what becomes the
place he holds, than be really is in his heart. And we ought to call to mind,
that it is very usual of late for Popes, to propound Leagues and Crusado's
against Infidells, and to seem very desirous thereof; yet how many of them have
we seen made, since the Turks power is grown so great? So likewise, I
perceive, we measure the Emperor's intentions more according to our desires,
and to what may make for us, then to what they are. But why should we not also
consider many other actions, which do plainly show, that either his thoughts do
differ from ours, and from our interests; or at least, that he has not so
great a desire for the exaltation of our Commonwealth, nor such a zeal to the
good of Christendom, as some believe; trusting too much to the zeal, which some
persuade themselves he bears to Christendom, when they would flatter themselves
with a confederacy, which turns to his advantage, forgetting such things as may
make them believe the contrary. For being overcome by the force of truth, he
has oft-times confessed, he can only make a defensive League this year; but
that notwithstanding, the Commonwealth shall suffer less prejudice thereby.
Has not he himself told our Ambassador, when he heard of Doria's
proceedings, and how he parted quickly from Naples, that Doria was no friend to
the Commonwealth; yet he proposes him now to be the head of a League, which
he says he makes chiefly for her sake. I will not now trouble you with
mentioning his vast and ambitious thoughts, wherein, as it has been plainly
discovered, he aims at the Empire of whole Italy; since all men know, how much
the greatness and prosperity of our Dominions is, contrary to these his
machinations; and how many ways he may receive advantage, by keeping us
employed in this war, to save his own expense, and that by our weakness he may
increase his power, and finally, make himself the sole Arbitrator of all the
affairs of Italy. And how stands Ferdinando King of the Romans affected now,
think we, who seemed so fierce at first in taking up Arms, to revenge the so
many injuries he had received from the Turks? What hopes has he, of making his
people fall upon such an enterprise, after having received such a rout in
Hungary, wherein he lost the flower of his people, and (which is of no less
importance) his own reputation, and his soldiers courage? Which may make it
easily be believed, that he may rather think it a happiness for him at this
time, to repose a while, and to mind the repairing of his losses, whilst his
enemies forces shall be employed against us, then to be bound to continue a new
war. And, I beseech you, whence is it that we suppose, peace may so easily
ensue between the Emperor and the King of France? The meeting was had with
great hopes of Agreement; but all endeavors proving vain, we see it now at an
end; and the short Truce for the affairs of Piemont, arose rather out of
necessity and weariness, then out of a desire of quiet and reconciliation. And
certainly, if we will weigh the importancy of this business considerately, we
must think this the chief ground of that our resolution. For as it has been
always confessed by all men, the greatest, and most assured hopes of any good
success of this League, lay in the agreement which was to be amongst Princes;
it was this that made us advance so much in the Treaty of the League: So now,
the state and condition of affairs being altered, we have just reason to alter
our minds, and to keep from concluding the League. Shall we forget what the
Pope said upon the like purpose, that the League would be but of a pale
complexion, unless peace were made between Caesar and the King of France? And
do not Caesar 's chief Ministers say the same? Did not Count Agilar at Rome, and
Don Lopes here with us, take it for granted, that peace amongst Christian
Princes was requisite, to the making of war against the Turks? Nay, Caesar
himself has confessed as much, letting us know, that he had not forces
sufficient, to contest with the King of France, and with the Turks at the same
time; and therefore it was that he propounded, the League might now be only
defensive. If then it be lawful for these Princes to nourish discord, for
their own ambitious ends, not caring for what we suffer, nor for the ruin of
whole Christendom; why should it misbecome us to think, upon preserving our
Commonwealth, and how to stave off greatest dangers, by such means as we may?
But if it be said, It is necessity which makes us have recourse to foreign
help, to maintain war, because such a peace as were to be wished for, is not to
be had. I cannot deny, but that on what side soever we turn, we are to meet
with many difficulties; but I will boldly affirm, that the having of peace is
not so hard, as that it is to be dispaired of, nor that it is likely to bring
so small security, but that it may be very well compared with our present
dangers. We know, that the chief Bashaw, on whose advice the Grand Signeur does
much rely, has been always well affected to this business, and we ought to
believe very much in what he says, because of his own interest; peace making
for his advantage, who cannot by war accumulate more riches nor honors. And we
now hear, that Barbarossa, not being in too great favor with Soliman, desires
rather to return to Algiers, where he may enjoy his own state, then to be at
any further trouble, since he sees the face of fortune alters. I will say
further, that I know not how we can so absolutely affirm, that Soliman does so
much despise us and our Commonwealth, since we see how constantly he has
observed the capitulations of peace with us, for these thirty five years; and
now also, if we will consider all things aright, we must confess, that he has
not turned his ^orces against us, till he was first provoked by us; so as
peradventure we have more reason to complain of our selves, and of our
Officers, than of him and his actions. If the Turks (as it has been said) did
aim so much at our ruin, when could they have had any fitter occasion to have
expressed it, then in these late years of our so great calamities, when all the
Princes of Christendom had conspired against us, when we wanted both forces,
assistance, and counsel, by reason of so many adverse fortunes? And yet they
did not only not trouble us, but supplied us with victuals and ammunition, in
our greatest necessities, suffering us to carry all sorts of grain out of their
Countries, and freely sending us whole ships loaded with Saltpeter. Whence then
do we imagine this so great fear, this so dubious peace, and these supposed
suspicions? which say they be true, how can we think it wisely done, how does
it agree together, that to shun war, we should make war; that to avoid an
uncertain and far-distant danger, we should choose a danger that is present and
certain? Who is there amongst us that does not know, the many conveniences we
reap by peace, and the as many inconveniences which arise from war? It may
suffice to say, that in time of our so long troubles, we were able to maintain
war in Terra ferma, for the space of almost twenty years, because we had the
sea open, which supplied this city both with public and private wealth; but
that being now shut up, our traffic is hindered, our taxes lessened, every one
of whatsoever condition suffers, and there is want of all things. And what is
there to be said of the Turks power? a great Empire, numerous Armies, store of
gold, abundance of all things requisite for war, and that which I am sorry I
can so truly say, such obedience and military discipline, as is rather desired,
then observed amongst Christians. What have we therefore to do in the condition
we are in? but to temporise, and wait for better fortune, against so powerful
an enemy. Great is the vicissitude of human affairs, which hardly keep in the
same posture any while at all. And it is the part of a wise man, to know his
advantages, and his disadvantages, and to wait the friendship of time. If we
call to mind past things, we shall find, that war with the Turks, has
always been a business of too great weight for us to bear. We would not have
peace with Mahomet, after the loss of Nigroponte, hoping to regain it; yet at
last, we were forced to agree with him, upon the yielding up of Scutari and
Brazzo di Maina to the Turks. After the Commonwealth was almost wasted by long
war with Bajazet, we came at last to peace with him, upon his own conditions,
and upon harder terms than those we had refused; by which, to boot with the
places which he had taken, we yielded up the Fort St. Maura unto him, which we
had recovered but a little before. I could produce many more such unfortunate
examples, and yet the Turks were not then so strong, especially at sea, as now
they are. Let us not then be so far born away by appearances, as to foregoe
better counsels. To make war with the Turks, appears to be a pious and
generous thing; yet he who shall weigh things aright, will find, that in the
con^ition that Christendom is in at the present, it is impious and unwise, the
nature thereof being changed by many various accidents. What greater impiety
can be used, then by continuing war, to expose the people commended to our care
to so many sufferings, and such certain rain? We have the spectacle of Corfu
before our eyes, from whence fifteen thousand persons were carried into bondage
by the Turks. To make gallant and generous attempts, becomes a magnanimous and
generous Prince, when reason and hope persuade him thereunto; but otherwise, it
is rashness and imprudency. To expose our selves to certain dangers, when they
may be avoided, what is it, but to tempt divine Providence? And the Parable
which we read in the Gospel, that he who is to go against a potent Enemy,
ought first to consider well, whether he can withstand him with ten thousand
men, who comes to assault him with twenty thousand. Does it not teach us to be
wary and mature in all our actions, and not to leave any place for repentance
to our selves, nor for blame to others?

Foscari's wisdom and eloquence was much commended, yet could it not convince a
certain fatal inclination, which was already grounded in the minds of many,
to continue the war. So as the number of votes falling short, to make this
proposal pass, the business remained undecided as before; and yet the not
resolving to write to Constantinople, was in effect to resolve, to prosecute
the war, and to be bound to stipulate the League as soon as might be. Soon
after therefore, larger Commissions were sent to the Ambassador at Rome,
touching the concluding it, wherein they yielded to such Articles, as had
suffered a long debate; each of which was first distinctly readd, and approved
of by the Senate. The Articles were these.

That a League and confederacy, Offensive and Defensive, was made by Pope Paul
the 3d. the Emperor Charles the 5th. and the Commonwealth and Senate of
Venice, against Soliman, grand Signior of the Turks; whereby the Confederates
obliged themselves, to make war against the Turks, with two hundred Galleys,
one hundred Frigates, fifty thousand Foot, whereof twenty thousand were to be
Italians, ten thousand Spaniards, and twenty thousand Germans, and four
thousand five hundred Burgonian Horse: Which forces were to be accompanied with
a sufficient train of Artillery, Ammunition, and other necessaries. And all
these forces were every year to be ready by the midst of March. Of these
Galleys, the Pope was to arm thirty six, the Emperor eighty two, and the State
of Venice eighty two, that the Emperor should be particularly obliged to find
all the ships, and the Venetians to give the Galleys to the Pope furnished; but
upon condition, that every part of the other expenses were to be proportionably
made good, in what they should exceed the rest; and particularly, that the
Venetians should be paid for as many armed galleys, as they should lend above
their just proportion of eighty two, that of all the expense which should go to
the maintaining of these forces, the Pope should contribute the sixth part, the
Emperor three, and the Commonwealth two. Moreover, that the taking of Corn
from every place, should be open for the common benefit, which was to be sold
to such of the Colleagues as had need thereof, at reasonable rates. That
Ferdinand, King of the Romans, should be understood to be included in this
confederacy, for whom Caesar obliged himself, that he should raise an Army
apart by himself, to assault the Turks on the side of Hungaria: and that the
King of France should be likewise understood to be therein concluded, when he
should declare, that he would accept of that primary, and most honorable place
which was reserved for him; which if he should do, the Pope should determine
what forces he should bring to join in the common enterprises, which were
understood were to be for the increase of those which were already agreed upon,
and divided amongst the Colleagues; and if any other Italian Princes should
join in the League, the expenses of the three chief confederates, should be
lessened as much as their contribution should come unto. That the Pope should
likewise endeavor to draw the King of Poland, and the other Christian Princes
into the League: and that if any difference touching the League should arise
amongst the Christian confederates, it should be determined by the Pope, that
Andrea Doria should be General of all the forces at Sea, and the Duke of Urbin
of those at Laxd. Concerning the acquisitions which should be made by the
common Arms, it was thus ordered by a writing apart: That every one of the
confederates should have whatsoever should be recovered, and which had formerly
been his own, restored unto him; with a particular declaration, that the Empire
of Constantinople should belong unto the Emperor, without prejudice to the
Commonwealth, for what belonged to her; to which likewise La Vallone, and
Castel-Nuovo, should be reserved as things appertaining to her: and that a
fitting proportion of what should be gotten, should be reserved by way of
pre-eminency, for the Apostolic Sea. That in other things whereunto none of
them pretended, every one of the confederates should partake thereof, according
to the proportion of his expense in the war; that if the Island of Rhodes
should be recovered, it should be restored to the Knights of Jerusalem.

There was no mention made of the King of England in these Capitulations: but
the Venetians thinking they might receive no little aid from this King, who was
master of many Forces, and of great Authority, sought by their Secretary
Girollimo Zuccato, then resident with him, to make him favor the League; and
desired the Pope to do the like, which he did. But he, thinking himself
scandalized, for not being particularly named in the Capitulations, would not
give ear thereunto, but complained that he and his Kingdom were not taken into
such consideration, by the Colleagues, as they ought to have been. And for the
King of France, there appeared new signs every day, that he had no mind to
enter into the League, wherein the increase of his Rival, and perpetual
Enemy's forces, and reputation, the Emperor was treated on.

The League being concluded and established in manner aforesaid, the Venetians
ordered their General Capello, that if the Turkish Fleet should come into the
gulf, he would tarry behind in the Levant, so as he might the easlier pass
into Sicily, or whithersoever he were to join with the Confederates Fleets.
This course was judged good, to encourage those of the Levant, and to indammage
the Enemy, according as occasion should serve: and that they might not lessen
the Garrisons, 2000 foot were raised, and forthwith sent to reinforce the
Fleet. Some were of opinion, that the General should have free leave given
him, to do upon all occasions whatsoever he should think would be best for the
Commonwealth. They urged, that since all accidents which might occur could not
be foreseen, and according to which the General was to order his designs, and
to steer his course: it was a dangerous thing to bind him up by Commissions,
and to force him to do what peradventure might be contrary to reason: they
instanced in the successes of the last year, wherein the having given limited
orders to General Pesaro, had been the cause of great disorders, which proved
at last the breaking out into war. Yet the consideration of not retarding the
joining of the Fleets, prevailed; as also a certain indignity, which as it was
thought it would prove, if the General should think of retreating, as if he
shunned the Enemy, and should therefore withdraw himself with his Galleys into
the waters about the City, whereby so great a preparation should prove vain:
But above all things, they were very solicitous in providing moneys whereby to
supply their expenses. A Bank was therefore erected in the Exchequer, wherein
as many as would bring in any Moneys into the public Treasury, were promised
to be paid fourteen per cent. during their life: Much severity was used in
calling in such Moneys as were due to the Commonwealth. Three other
Commissaries were chosen, for what should be borrowed, Girollimo Marcello,
Bernardo Moro, and Giulio Contarini: but no use could as yet be made of the
Clergies goods; for though the Pope had transmuted the favor, whereof he had
before given so favorable an intention to the Senate; to wit, That he would
permit them to alienate ten per cent. of the Clergies Revenue, till it should
amount to a million of Gold, or that they should raise it in five years space,
by so many Tenths of the same goods; yet he had never given out his Briefs for
either of these, finding out several excuses and delays at such a pinch. Many
propositions were made for the raising of moneys; but the Senate proceeded with
great respect and caution, not to do any thing at this time, which might
peradventure lessen the peoples affection to the Commonwealth: they would not
therefore accept of the proposal of selling the Commons, though much money
might have been made thereby, there being great store of them throughout the
whole Terra ferma. But for all this scarcity of money, they spared not for any
thing that was necessary for War; victuals were provided from all parts, and
ammunition, Ordnance were cast, such Ladders, Pick-axes, Spades, and other
tools, as the Duke of Urbine gave order for, for Land-service, were made in
great abundance. The Duke seemed very desirous to do great things in service to
the Commonwealth, and aspired to the obtaining immortal glory by war; and
truly, the Senate confided very much in his worth and Loyalty: in so much as
the Pope threatening to make war upon his State, by reason of his pretense to
the Dukedom of Camerino, as being held in fee-farm of the Church, and which was
then fallen to the Duke by the right of his wife: the Senate dispatched away one
of their Secretaries speedily to Rome, and obtained that the Duke should not be
molested therein as long as he was employed in the common service of the
League, or particularly by the Commonwealth. He therefore caused two galleys
to be prepared, the one for himself to go in person, to the Fleet; the other
for his Son to go in; and chose his very good friend, Barnard Sagredo, one much
esteemed of him, by reason of his great experience at Sea, to govern them; the
Senate being desirous to show how acceptable this the Dukes good will was to
them, who had said, he would bring his wife and family to live in Venice,
freely gave him one of the noblest Palaces of the City; but whilst he was
carefully ordering all these affairs, going to Pesaro, to take order for his
own particular business, he fell into a great sickness, which kept him from
going to the Fleet.

At the same time, several Negotiations were had of Peace, between Caesar and
the King of France, both of them seeming to be desirous thereof, to which
purpose their Agents were forthwith sent to Canus, a place between Parpignon
and Narbonne; but the whole time being spent in contentions, no good came
thereof: For both these Princes Commissions were bounded and limited in that
very thing, whereon all other resolutions did depend: Caesar not giving way by
any means, to the restoring of the Dukedom of Millan; not the King of France,
that any thing should be treated of, the prime Article whereof should not be
the restitution of that State.

Many things were propounded, to bring these Princes to an Agreement; chiefly
the marriage between Mary, Daughter to the King of Portugal, lately dead, and
to the Queen, then wife to Francis King of France, and Niece to Caesar; and the
Duke of Orleans, the Kings Son, with a Million of Gold for her portion, which
was to be given to the Emperor, in recompense for the State of Millan,
whereinto the Duke of Orleans was to be invested; but many difficulties being
found herein, the one not being willing to trust the other; and the Bride not
being of fitting years for marriage, the business was broken off, the
convention dissolved, to the great displeasure of the Venetians in particular,
who by reason of this disagreement, were likely to bear a greater burden in
this war with the Turks, as by many signs did already appear. For the Marquess
of Guasto, who had formerly been sent for to the Court by the Emperor, to make
use of his advice and actions, touching the enterprise in the Levant, was by
new orders appointed to stay in Italy, and to be diligent in increasing the
Garrisons in the State of Millan. And Caesar, when the hopes of this Agreement
failed, had oft-times said, that his forces being elsewhere diverted by the
King of France, he could not for the present do any thing for the service of
Christendom, but stand upon his defense, and keep his Dominions from being
prejudiced by the Turkish Fleets; these respects had made the Venetians more
diligent in endeavoring the conclusion of the League; believing that the King
of France, whilst he should see this union suspended, whereby the heavier
weight would lie upon Caesar, being only of himself to resist the Turkish
forces, would be the hardlier brought to a reconcilement with Caesar, building
his hope of the recovery of the State of Millan, upon the weakness of the
Emperors forces: the Pope was likewise much troubled hereat; to whom, as being
the chief head of Christendom, the care of making peace between Christian
Princes, and of opposing the eminent danger of the Turks, did principally
belong. Therefore seeing all his endeavors, by Letters and Embassies, proved
vain, he bethought himself of bringing these two Princes to speak together
face to face in his presence; hoping that by his authority, entreaties, and
reasons, he might bring them to an Agreement. Wherefore, though he was very
aged, yet not being willing to spare any painse, after he had thus exhorted and
invited these two Princes, he offered to give them a meeting himself in
person, at Neice, as an opportune place where they might all meet together.
This meeting proved in one respect pleasing to the Venetians; for if the peace
should be effected, the hopes and forces of the League would be greatly
increased, which would be but weak and lame without it: but in another respect,
they were troubled at it, by reason of the loss of time which it would
occasion, in making provision for the War, and in the uniting of the Fleets.
For the Emperor being to come by Galleys from Barcellona to Niece, Doria must
be unseasonably employed in this voyage, when he should have put his Fleet in
order, and have advanced against the Enemy, who were already put forth very
strong to Sea. This their fear was the greater, because it was not
counterpoysed by equal hopes of advantage; since it appeared almost
impossible, that these two Princes should be reconciled, as it was thought by
those who were best versed in such affairs, and who could penetrate the
furthest into the secret designs of Princes. For what hopes were there of
making true friendship between Caesar and the King of France? their natures
were beyond measure contrary; they differed in fashions, ends, and thoughts;
grievous injuries had past between them on both sides, which they kept in
memory with desire of revenge. On the Kings behalf; his Imprisonment, and his
severe usuage therein, his being enforced to purchase his liberty, by assenting
to unjust conditions, and by giving his Sons in hostage for the performance of
his word, and the War lately made by the Emperor, in the bowels of his own
Country. The Emperor held himself as much offended by the King, not only for
the falsifying of his word, and breach of the Articles at Madrid; but for his
having made the Turks make war against him, whereby to keep him and his
Dominions perpetually molested. What reason was there then to believe, that
those who bore such bitter hatred to each other, were to yield to an Agreement,
whereby the ones power would be greatly augmented to the as great inconveniency
of the other? to yield up the State of Millan, to the King of France, to boot
with the opening the way thereby unto him, how to molest the Kingdom of Naples,
and of disputing Cesars power in Italy, bore with it greater consequences. For
by giving the State of Millan to the Duke of Orleans, France, would become the
more formidable, since all the States would be united in the Crown, whereinto
not only Britany would fall, which belonged to the Kings second Son, as in
right of his Mothers Dowry, but the Dukedom of Orleans, and of Angoulesme. On
the other side, the King knew, that the releasing of the Cities, and Forts
which he had taken in Savoy, would secure Cesars affairs in Italy, and confirm
him in the possession of the State of Millan; it was therefore thought, that
nothing had made Caesar, and the King of France, yield to the Pope's proposal,
but a desire of justifying themselves to the World, and to show that they would
not be back-wards in making peace, knowing that the maintaining so long and
bitter discord at this time, would denote their immoderate Ambition. Moreover,
they were thereunto invited by a certain jealousy, they had of the Popes
favor, which made them endeavor to persuade him, that they valued all his
advices: for the one fearing to be exceeded by the other, they would not suffer
that either of them should become greater by the forces and authority of
Apostolic Sea, especially in Italy. Some did also add, that the Pope himself
did not aim so much at the general good by this meeting, as at his particular
convenience; hoping that by his presence, and by the concurrency of these
Princes, he might get far into favor with them, and obtain something of much
moment from them, which might establish the greatness of his House, which was
now discovered to be his chiefest aim, as was afterward more clearly seen at
this meeting, wherein the marriage between the Lady Margaret, Cesars natural
Daughter, who had been wife to Alexander, Duke of Medecis, with Octavio
Fernese, the Popes Nephew, was concluded; who was likewise invested in the
State of Novara. Though the Venetians began quickly to suspect these things;
yet did not the Senate forbear to do what occasion required, but to show all
due respect to these Princes, and chiefly to the Pope, and not to leave any
thing undone, whereby they might be ayding and forward to the making of peace,
as they had always been; they chose two Ambassadors, Nicolo ^iepolo, and Mark
Antonio Cornaro, to assist at that meeting, and to declare the Senates desire
of friendship between Christian Princes, and their readiness to make War upon
the Turks.

The Pope being gone from Rome in May, went to Parma, where he gave the solemn
Benediction della Palma, in the Cathedral Church, to which he gave La Rosa,
worth 500 Crowns, and staid there, and in Piacensa some time; expecting more
certain information from the Duke of Savoy, of the Convention at Nice, wherein
there were some difficulties interposed, not without suspicion, that the
Emperor had a hand therein, who was desirous to spin out the time, that he
might see what the Turks did, and advance the greater charge that year, to
which he was obliged by the League. But at last the Pope, not being desirous to
prolong his journey any longer, came to Nice, where he was not suffered to
enter the City, by the Garrison; who said, they held that Fort in the name of
the Prince, which the Duke his Father could not dispose of; so as he was forced
to stay a while in a neighboring Monastery, till not long after, the Keys of
the City were sent him. But the Emperor, and the King of France, came speedily
to him, to the same place, who were first come to that shore; the first
tarrying at Villa Franca, formerly called Moneco, the other at villa Nova, on
the other side of the River Varro. But the Pope could not possibly prevail with
them, to meet both together in his presence; they not being willing to comply
with the Pope, in what was to be treated on at this enterview, which was Peace
and Agreement. Yet the Truce which was between them, was prolonged by the Popes
means, but both of them continuing to use simulation, cheating both themselves
and others, by an outward appearance; they met together at Aqua Morta, in the
waters of Marcelles; whither Caesar being come in his Galleys, the King came
likewise (as it was ordered) to meet him aboard his Galleys; and then landing,
the Emperor tarried two days with the King, spending the time in feasting,
and jollity, treating together very familiarly, and giving out, that Peace
should be suddenly made between them; to which effect, other Agents should be
deputed, with plenary power to accommodate all differences between them. Yet
this enterview produced no better effect, then the former with the Pope, had
done; for Caesar finding that he was not of himself alone, to make head against
those powerful Enemies, now that the Venetians had confirmed the League
against the Turks, and consequently thinking the Kings friendship less
necessary, began to demand greater things than he had done at the convention in
Flanders, to wit, the observance of the Agreement at Madrid, wherein the
restitution of Burgony, superiority in Artois, and in his pretenses to the
State of Millan, which was the chief thing now controverted, were contained;
and many other things very prejudicial to the Crown of France, and
consequently abhorred by the King: who on the contrary, finding himself very
powerful, by reason of several States that were fallen to the Crown, for want
of Heirs to their particular Lords; so as at this time, he was Master of whole
France, from the Ocean toward the North, to low Britany, and from the Pirenean
Mountains, to the Mediteranean Sea; he hoped he might make War with the
Emperor, and recover those States which were possessed by him, so far was he
from foregoing any thing that he himself had in his hands, or whereunto he
made any pretenses. He therefore desired peace only so far, as might consist
with his honor and convenience, and chiefly with the conclusion of his Sons
marriage, which had been so often proposed: wherein the chief difficulty
consisting, in whose hands the Forts of the State of Millan were to be trusted
for the space of three years, which time was necessary to run out before the
marriage could be consummated; the King not thinking it either safe or
honorable for him, to trust Caesar, who would not trust him, proposed, that the
strong holds of that State, should for that time be deposited in the Popes
hands, or in the Venetian Senate. But Caesar, who was resolved not to accept of
any motion which did any ways comprehend the surrender of the Dukedom of
Millan, refused the proposal, alleading that he could not assent thereunto, by
reason of the Popes very great age, and by reason of the Venetians too great
power: whence, if he should give way thereunto, both his private, and the
common affairs, might through various accidents incur loss and danger. Yet the
King held on the Treaty, not so much out of any hopes of Agreement, as for his
own justification to the world, and to lay all the fault of their not.
According upon Cesars obdurancy, to which purpose he sent one of his Gentlemen
to Venice, to give a particular account of these his actions, showing that the
fault lay not in him, if the peace should not ensue, which was so much desired
by Christendom.

Whilst the Christian Princes proceeded thus slowly, and irresolutely, in
preparing to sustain the War, the Turks, every one striving who should best
discharge his office, had in the winter prepared all things requisite for the
summer-War; and not forgetting amidst the fury of War, what appertained to
Religion, (so naturally is a certain inclination to divine worship, engraven in
the souls even of Barbarians) did first solemnly celebrate the feast of
Baierano; which are certain days celebrated, and reverenced by that Nation, as
Easter is by us Christians; and frequent Orisons were made throughout all their
Mosche, for the Grand Signors prosperity, and the like of his Army. Afterward,
March being already begun, the soldiers and galleys began to part from
Constantinople, with great preparations both of Land and Sea-forces. Soliman
went himself in person with the Army, and Barbarossa with the Fleet, who held
the place which was formerly held by Lufti, he being deprived of the degree of
Bashaw, and confined to Macedonia. The Fleet not being yet wholly in order,
Barbarossa went with 120 sail, which he had got together into the Archipelagus,
as to a secure prey, where those Islands which had not been ruined the
preceding year, but kept still under the Commonwealths Dominion, had not
sufficient Garrisons to defend them. Thus Schiros, Schia^ock, Schiati and some
other lesser places, after being miserably plundered, fell into the power of the
Turks. There happened a memorable accident in the taking of Schiati^ where the
Islanders, and those few Soldiers who were there, having valiantly withstood
the Turks first assault, trusting in the strength of the situation, and in a
Castle eminently seated upon a Rock; some of the chief men of the Town, either
out of fear, or fraud, bethought themselves of surrendering the Town to the
Turks; and fearing they might be punished for their base wickedness, if the
business should not succeed; they went to the Palace, where the Governor
Girolimo Memo lay wounded, (who by his courage and example, standing with the
other soldiers upon the walls, had made good their labors, and hopes of the
rest) and cruelly slew him; by whose death all things being in a confusion,
they drew in the Turks by Ropes into the Fort. Barbarossa's self was so
displeased with this barbarous and cruel act, as in lieu of a reward, which
these Rascals hoped for, he put them to death. Barbarossa, whose number of
Vessels was much increased, went afterward to the Island of Candia to get
prey, and to attempt those Forts. This was much suspected before, it being
generally bruited in Constantinople, that they would this year attempt that
Island: wherefore the Senate had been very careful in providing it with all
things necessary, that it might be able to withand so powerful an Enemy: They
had sent many Soldiers, Ammunition, Victuals, thither; and to boot with the
particular Magistrates, had given the Government of all those Forts, and of the
Militia to Iohanni Moro, whose valor and wisdom was highly esteemed. He was
made Commissary General, and endowed with extraordinary Authority. The
preservation of this Island, was held by all men to be of great importance, by
reason of the nobleness and riches thereof, as having been the ancient seat of
Kings, producing plenty of choice Wines, of Oils, and other things, for the
convenience which it afforded of furnishing many Galleys speedily with men fit
for Sea-affairs; for many fair and safe Havens, wherein the ships that
traffic in the Levant are received, and the Fleets which guard those Seas: and
moreover, because there is therein a Colony of many noble Venetian Families,
who had habitations, and large possessions given them in that Kingdom 330 years
before. Amongst other things, the Commissary General was willed to encourage
those Gentlemen in the name of the Commonwealth, and the Cavaliers (which are
those who hold any thing in fee of the Signory of Venice,) to defend the Island
and themselves, promising them on the faith of the Senate, that they should not
want any possible aid: He therefore assembling one day the Council, in the
City of Candia, which consists of all the Nobility of the Colony, prepared them
by an efficacious exhortation, valiantly to expect the coming of the enemy.

If you (said he) will well consider the peacefulnesse of your present condition,
wherein you with quiet and honor enjoy so wealthy possessions, the gracious
aspect of the heavens, which affords you such abundance and convenience of all
good things, which grow here, and which are brought hither from adjacent parts,
I am assured, the consideration thereof would persuade you more, then I by my
words can do, to use your utmost endeavors, and not to spare any thing,
neither expense, pains, no, not life it self, to keep your selves and children
from changing conditions, from falling from the height of such prosperity,
into the depth of misery, as it will happen, if this Island, falling into the
Turks power, (the very thought or mentioning whereof does astonish me) you be
enforced either to live elsewhere, and be deprived of this your country,
wherein you enjoy such wealth, such conveniences; or else tarrying here, to be
subject to the tyranny of barbarous Infidells. If you had no other tie to
defend this Island, (a noble and prime member of the Commonwealth) then what
by these advantages you are obliged unto, you neither could nor would refuse to
do what you are bound to, in respect both of your Ancestors and selves, and
what the service of our country does challenge; from the love whereof, I do not
believe, this distance has been able to divide you, not being members cut off,
but true sharers in her honor, and in all her fortune. But since hereunto,
your own particular interest is inseparably joined, wherein you know the total
of all you have, nay, of your very being is concerned, I shall not need to show
you the importancy of the cause in hand, or incite you to make such provisions,
and seek for such remedies, as may preserve you from such a danger. I will
only therefore put you in mind, that you suffer not your selves to be removed
from that good resolution, which I see is grounded in you, by any fear, which
may make you lose your courage, and abandon your selves. I do not deny, but
that the enemies power is very great, and so to be esteemed; but I affirm, it
is not such as we ought to ^istrust, being able to resist it, and we may hope,
that we may reap praise and honor by their coming. We hear for certain, that
though there be many soldiers in the enemies Fleets, yet they want a
sufficient train of artillery, and many other things requisite for the taking
in of cities; so as we may believe, that if they shall approach this our
Island, it is rather with an intention of pillage, if they shall find us so
negligent, as to afford them occasion so to do, then of making war; and say,
they did intend it, and were provided for it, why should we believe, that they
would undertake a business, which will require time, when they shall see such
Fleets of Christian confederate Princes upon the seas, by which, either their
Fleet, or some of their cities, may be assaulted, and fought with. They have as
much reason to think, upon their own defense and preservation, as of offending
others. I know, and am commanded by the Senate to assure you, that the
preservation of this Kingdom, and your safeties, is had in very great
consideration by them, for which they will readily expose their Fleet, and all
their forces; whereof the provisions already made for the good of this Island,
may be a sufficient testimony; in the speed and expense whereof, the
Commonwealth has not only exceeded the opinion of others, but has gone
beyond her self. You then, whose dangers and safties are most concerned, and
whose advantage is immediately treated of, are so much the more bound, not to
leave any thing undone, wherein your loyalty, diligence, and charity toward
both these your countries may appear. Let every one vuy who shall help the
common cause most with moneys, authority, and with their persons, and I assure
my self, we shall not only avoid the greatest calamities, but we shall
preserve our country from the inroads and plunder of the enemy, to our
immortal glory, and to our merit with the Commonwealth.

The Commissary had not fully ended his discourse, when many of the Gentlemen
rising up, attested what he had said, promised loyalty; and some engaged
themselves in generalities, some in particular offers, to employ all their
power and industry, in defending the Kingdom. The Commissioner said the same
things afterward, to the Cretensian Gentry and Commonalty, encouraging all men
to defend themselves. So as with great cheerfulness, and confidence of good
success, they fell to make all necessary provisions. Some Galleys were armed
at the charge of particular men, many men were sent for from their
country-farms, who having arms given them, some of them were brought into the
city, to increase the garrison of Italian Foot, some placed in Corpse de Guard,
upon passes, and places of concernment, to hinder the enemie's advancing;
wherein the Nobles and Feudatories, did so industriously and so fervently
behave themselves, that the particular family of the Calergi, a family of great
wealth and authority in this Island, raised and armed above 25000 men.

Barbarossa continuing his course, drew near the Island on the North side,
between Standia and the city of Candia; but, without touching land, sailed
along the coast till he came to Rettimo, where staying but a while, because he
was much damnified by the artillery from the city, he went to Suda, where
finding better convenience of abode, by reason of the Haven, which was very
safe, and capacious, the entrance whereunto was then free for any enemies
ships, (the Rock which lies in the mouth of the Haven not being reduced then,
as it is now, into a safe and impregnable Fort) and by the nearness of the
city of Canea, which he designed to assault, he landed many men, wherewith he
fell to plunder the adjacent country, coming even to underneath the city. This
was anciently called Cidonia, and was always numbered amongst the chief cities
of the Kingdom, for the convenience and beauty it receives from the Campania,
and by reason of the Haven which is very near it, and for the number of
inhabitants. But the Fort was not yet fully finished, the two Bulwarks which
were a building on the South Side were not perfected, nor was it any ways
fenced on the West, but by old weak Walls, and the Ditch was hardly dig'd in
any place, by reason of the condition of the earth, which was very stiff, and
in some parts rocky; but the industry of these times, has overcome these and
all other difficulties. Andrea Gritti was Governor of the city, it had about a
1000 Italian Foot for the Guard, and many Grecians of the city and country.
Therefore when they saw the Turks approach the Fort, without either trenches or
works, and in disorder, they boldly sallied out; and disordering the enemy by
shot from the city, they put them to flight, and slew many of them. Nor had
those who roved about, pillaging and wasting the country, any better success;
for many of the Islanders were assembled together, with several sorts of
weapons, and being encouraged by the Masters of families, whose authority is
very great over the inhabitants, and incited by the chief Governors, by hopes
of reward, who, for their better enheartning, had promised to take off all
taxes, and to release them of many debts, due unto the public; they behaved
themselves so, as the Turks meeting with stout resistance every where, and with
greater difficulty then they had at first believed, they were forced soon to
give over the enterprise; and having lost many of their soldiers, who were cut
in pieces, as they went up and down pillaging the country, they retreated to
their Galleys. Yet Barbarossa, desirous to try some better fortune in some
other part, or at least, repair his loss, leaving some calamitous marks
behind him of his having bin there, sent one hundred Galleys to Sithi^. This
place is seated on the head of the Island, very weak, and but badly guarded,
though a particular Venetian Magistrate makes his residence there. The enemie's
Fleet had convenience of going to Scarpanto, an Island not above forty miles
off, and then in the Turks possession; who finding Sithia abandoned, took away
some pieces of artillery, and a little ammunition, ruinating the neighboring
country as much as they could: But being forced to be gone, for fear lest the
Venetian Fleet coming to relieve Candia, might force them to fight, they
embarckt their soldiers, and went with all their forces toward Negraponte.

He, at the same time returned to besiege Napoli and Malvasia, whither the
Sangiacco della Morea was gone, by order from Soliman; who sitting down before
both these towns, and besieging them writ Letters to the Governors, and to the
people, exhorting them to yield unto him, promising them large rewards; but
speedy and severe punishment, if they should obstinately persevere to make
resistance: Saying, That he was sent thither by Soliman, with direction, not to
rise from before them, upon any whatsoever accident, till he had reduced those
two Towns under his Empire. That all relief was far off, and that it was vain
for them to hope to make long resistance. That therefore they were to make use
of that good, nay necessary, advice, of complying with the times, and with the
Conquerours fortune. But the Governors and people were resolved to defend
themselves, trusting much to the strength of their situation, and that they
should speedily receive victuals and ammunition from the Venetian Fleet,
sufficient to hold out a long siege. They therefore gave no answer to these
Letters, but they betook themselves the more diligently to defend the city; and
because there was great want of water in Napoli, the Stradiotti, a bold and
warlick people, sallying oftentimes forth, accompanied with Italian
Harchebugiers, provided the Town therewith. But of all others, Agostino
Clasone's diligence and worth, who was head of that Militia, appeared most in
all those actions. And General Capello, not suffering these valiant and
faithful men to want help, seasonably sent them all such things as they needed
most, in six Galleys. But the sufferings of those in Dalmatia by the Turkish
forces, were great; for the enemy landing in great numbers upon those confines,
destroyed whole countries, carried away both men and beasts, infusing terror
and confusion into all men; insomuch as Camillo Or^ino, who was chief Governor
in that Province, advised, that abandoning all the other towns, all the
soldiers should with draw into the town of Zara, to secure that, as being the
chief town, and fittest to be maintained; fearing, that to defend them all,
against so many forces of the enemy, would be the indangering of them all. But
the Senate did not approve of this advice, valuing very much, to boot with the
loss of so many towns, the note of infamy, which the Commonwealth might seem
to attract, if they should willingly, and all at once, without making any
trial of their forces, yield up so great and so gallant a territory, to the
insolent enemy. Therefore betaking themselves diligently to make all possible
provision, for the defense and maintaining of them, they resolved to raise more
Foot and Horse, to the number of 12000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, whereby they hoped
they might be able to secure that Province, and to increase the peoples
affection toward the Venetians, and to encourage them to defend themselves.
They chose fifteen Gentlemen, who were to go forthwith to the custody of Zara;
Sebenico and Cattaro, with thirty foot with each of them; Luigi Badoaro was
likewise sent to Zara, with title of Commissary General of Dalmatia, with
obligation not to part from that city, without leave from the Senate. All the
inhabitants of Dalmatia were permitted, to send their wives and children to
Venice, to be preserved from being injured by the enemy. Upon this occasion,
the Doge spoke in the Senate, exhorting them to assist their country at such a
time of need: He urged the example of what was done in the late wars by Terra
ferma, wherein, he said, the citisens charity toward their country, their
union and alacrity toward the public service, was so gallant, and so
available, as overcomming the perverseness of fortune, they had at last freed
the Commonwealth from calamity, and had returned her to that dignity of
Empire, wherein she now was. That the present dangers were not less, than the
former had been, though all things were as yet safe and entire, being to resist
an enemy, who though he were but one alone, had powerful forces; and the more
to be esteemed, for that they were governed by one sole respect, and by one
sole and severe command. Which if they should prosper in this their beginning,
they would grow so bold, that not any thing would at any time be secure from
their injuries. That hopes of assistance from others grew daily weaker, the
Confederates proceeding so slowly, and so uncertainly, as that they might learn
thereby, their truest and most assured defense lay in themselves. Wherefore
every one ought to outdo himself, to supply the Commonwealth readily with his
advice, life, and livelihood. That the public Exchequer was charged with
almost an insufferable burden, unless it should be assisted by the citisens
readiness; for these new provisions for Dalmatia would cost above 25000 Crowns
a month. That the peoples minds were low, and full of fears; that they were to
be cheered and comforted by their presence, for whom the Empire was to be
preserved; to show, that they would accompany them in their pains and peril;
and that they are such, as for their worth and constancy, deserve to be
faithfully, served, and to have all labor and danger undergone, to be
preserved in their dominion. Let them therefore, said he, go speedily, who are
chosen, to execute their charges; and let all others, upon whom any public
office shall be imposed, cheerfully accept it; whom duty does not move, let him
value glory; and who shall not esteem that, let obedience prevail with him; but
if nothing else, let necessity and the present dangers persuade them, to be
diligent and ready in all things. The Prince his authority, and the efficacy of
these persuasions, did with a certain noble bashfulnesse, settle the minds and
thoughts of some, who at first sought to be excused, for executing those
charges which were imposed on them. But the Turks, the greater provision they
understood were made to prevent them, the more they did hasten to assault
Dalmatia; and to make the defense weaker, they resolved to assault several
chief Towns, at one and the same time, to the end, that one might not relieve
the other. Having raised a mass of men at Cluina, a place in the Turkish
Dominions, and entered with about 4000 Horse, and as many Foot, into the
territories of Zara, they assaulted Nadino, the first Castle which belongs to
the Venetians upon those confines, whereof Sebastiano Sagredo was Governor.
The Castle was guarded by 150 Italian Foot, who being terrified at the very
sight of the enemy, they, without making any trial, either of the Castle, or
of themselves, surrendered basely, with leave to be gone; so, forsaking the
Town, they went to Zara, whither they brought more fear then help, magnifying
the enemies forces, to excuse in part their own cowardice. The like happened soon
after at the Castle of Laurana, wherein was Vittori Zoranzo, with the like
garrison that was at Nadino; and after having suffered one days battery, the
Governor fled, and the Castle fell into the enemies hands. But Zemonico being
abandoned by the Italian Foot, was maintained by certain Slavonians, who were
brought thither by some Gentlemen of Venice, of the family of Veniero, to whom
the Castle did particularly belong; and Nona being then abandoned by our men,
and not valued by the enemy, who not being able to get the Fort so soon, which
was possessed by one of Zara, and some of his companions, they would tarry no
longer in the Town, so as it was soon afterward provided of a new Garrison,
and kept under the Venetians Dominions.

The Turks, having placed a good Garrison in Nadino, and in Laurana, kept with
their Army in those confines, making inrodes daily even to the gates of Zara,
so as our Soldiers were fain to keep within the walls, though the Enemies Camp
was not very near. Antiveri Dolcigno, and Sebenico, were in the like danger.
The Saniacco Discutari, came himself in person to Antiveri, with a number of
foot and horse, and was already encamped between the shore and the walls; and
had sent some of his men to besiege Dolcigno. But Bandelmiero, who was Captain
of the Gulf, hearing thereof, brought relief speedily to the Antiverini; as
also General Capello did soon after, sending Men and Ammunition thither; so as
the Bashaw dispairing of any speedy good success, resolved to rise from before
Antiveri, and made those that were before Dolcigno do the like. But part of
those men, who went at first toward Sebenico, and who were assembled at
Cluino; and, after the taking of Nadino and Laurana, many of the Soldiers who
were upon the confines of Zara, went thither. Yet not making up a full body of
an Army, they came not near the Town, but only pillaged the Confines. The
Sebenicans hearing of the Enemies approach, resolutely prepared for defense,
and the people meeting upon the Piazza, took a solemn oath not to yield to the
Enemy, but to undergo the worst of evils in preserving that City for the
Commonwealth. But the attempts upon the other Towns, not going on so fast as
it was hoped, the Turks would meddle no more therewith, having their thoughts
sets upon Hungary. Therefore mustering all their men, and leaving 3000 men to
guard the confines, they went toward Bossina, to pass into Hungary.

The Venetians were much rejoiced at the Turks departure from Dalmatia, and
those miserable people were freed from many calamities: but men's thoughts
easily altering with the change of affairs, the Governors and Commanders of
the soldiers in that Province, who had been greatly injured by the Enemies,
the rather for that they had received notice of the loss of some Towns, and of
the pillaging of the whole Country, they resolved to attempt the recovery of
the Towns which the Turks had taken. Wherefore acquainting the Consiglio di
Dieci, with their intention; they said there were forces in Dalmatia sufficient
to make some attempt: that it was fit to keep those soldiers in exercise, who
through long idleness, not being able to stir out whilst the Enemy was so
near, and powerful, grew daily more abject; and having no hopes of booty,
their pay coming likewise slowly in, could not be kept in their duties, and in
the exercise of the Militia; They considered, that without possession of those
neighboring places, Zara must be in continual danger, having so potent
Enemies so near at hand, who keeping at home, might in a manner besiege them.
The Senate listened willingly hereunto, being the more desirous thereof, that
they might make the Enemy feel their forces, which had hitherto been only
cause of great expense to the Commonwealth. They were not a little herein
encouraged by the Duke of Urbin, who being made acquainted therewith, did not
only commend it, but entering into more exalted thoughts, proposed greater
matters. He said, that if 5000 Dutch-foot were added to those Italians, who
were in Dalmatia, and some Italian Horse to the Grecians, and Stradiotti, they
might with these forces enter Bossina, and make themselves Masters of some good
Town, which might make way for greater acquisitions: that it was always good
counsel, to carry the war home to the Enemies; that there was only a weak
Garrison of 3000 horse in Bossina; that if such occasions were let slip, to
what end did they continue war, why such expense, why all this ado, if they
meant only to defend themselves; and that, not without difficulty and danger?
that the fortune of war was always doubtful; but he who will not hazard any
thing, undergoes a certain and voluntary prejudice.

This advice looked handsomely, showing generosity, and hopes of Victory. It
was therefore resolved to raise the Dutch foot immediately, to which purpose
Constantino Cavazza was sent into Bavaria, who was Secretary to the Consiglio
di Pregadi, who by the assistance of Duke Lodowick, who was very affectionate
to the Commonwealth, quickly effected what he had in charge; so as the
soldiers having immediately received one-pay, fell down into Friuli; the mean
while Camillo Orsino, having assembled 4000 foot, and 500 Horse out of the
Garrisons of Dalmatia, and some pieces of Artillery went into Obraazzo; the
taking whereof was of great consideration, for thereby they bereaved the Turks
of a place where they used to raise numbers of men to assault our Confines; and
for the advantage which might be made of many Woods in the neighboring
Country. The Castle was neither very strong, nor very well provided to make
defense; wherefore the enterprise was thought as easy as useful: It being
therefore continually played upon for two days, the third day the soldiers
were led on to the assault, where after some contest they entered; but Orsino
finding that it could not be fortified, nor kept without much difficulty, gave
order for the demolishing thereof: But the Turks being hereof advertised, came
upon our men so suddenly, before they had quite slighted the Castle, as giving
the work over, they left the place in the Enemies hands, who suddenly repairing
the ruins, placed therein a strong Garrison. Our men were so terrified at the
unexpected coming of the Turks, as retreating to the shore to imbarke
themselves, they were pursued by the Enemy, and had been totally routed, had
not Camillo da Monte Napolitano, making head against them, entertained the
Enemy, and afforded our men opportunity of imbarking themselves: this success,
as at first it gave great encouragement and hopes; so the condition of affairs
soon altering, they thought not of prosecuting any other designs upon Nadino,
Laurana, Clissa, or Os^ravizza, wherein greater difficulties were daily found.
Hereby those began to cool, who had been forwardest in falling upon other
enterprises in the Turkish Territories, and the Duke of Urbin's self, made
many difficulties; alleging that those men which he had first demanded, were
not enough to take Towns, and to guard the Country from the Enemy: and that a
greater number would require so much victuals, as would not easily be come by;
they being to be brought by Land, and through an Enemies Country. They were
therefore much troubled what to do: the thing of it self was very
advantageous, and much to be desired, but met every where with many
difficulties. The Dutch foot were already come very near; many other things
provided, not without expense, whereby the soldiers might be encouraged, the
Fleet lay idle; if the Enemy were suffered to rest secure every where, to what
end should they still waste themselves in War? but they that weighed the
business more maturely, alleged; That these ill grounded hopes, were not
answerable to the certain danger of drawing upon them the whole Turkish Army,
and to bring them once more to the ruin of Dalmatia, now that, to our good
fortune, they were turned sel^ewhere: That it Would be better to employ this
time, and these moneys, in fortifying the most important Towns, and in securing
them from those dangers which they were known to have been in formerly; they
not being sure, but that the Enemy, who were not gone far off, might quickly
return to assault them. Besides, would they give over thinking of their Fleet?
upon which since their greatest concernments did depend, their chiefest care
should be thereof, and increasing the forces and reputation thereof as much as
possibly they could. And that since the slow proceedings in uniting the the
Flee^s, showed how little they were to trust to the help of others, they were
to learn that by experience, which reason could not persuade them to: to wit,
That not being able solely of themselves to maintain the war, and not being
assisted by others as need required, it would become them to treat of Peace; to
the procuring whereof, how could the provoking the Turks by new injuries, and
the further incensing of Soliman, with little or no hope of advantage, conduce
very much? That the War proceeded so little prosperously, as it was not to be
doubted, but that it was better to think of quenching this fire, than of
feeding it with fresh fuel.

These reasons prevailing with all men, made them at last resolve to dismiss
the Dutch foot, giving them half a pay more, and giving the Commanders better
presents, as well to keep fair with that Nation, as also to avoid the danger of
having the country plundered by military insolence; now that they were within
the confines of the Commonwealth. This occasion being removed, the Turks
continued their way toward Hungary, and those that were in the neighboring
Garrisons were quiet, now that all the Towns were well munited, so as Dalmatia
might for a while hope for repose.

All men's eyes were now upon the success of the several Fleets; Barbarossa
being gone from Candia, kept about the Rivers of Nigrapont, and the adjacent
parts, not attempting any thing, having some jealousy of the Christian Fleets.
But General Capello, having assembled a great many Galleys, one Gallioun, and
several ships, the Patriark Grimani being joined with him, with the Popes
Galleys; all things being now in readiness, waited the arrival of the Spanish
Fleet, great hopes being daily given out of its speedy coming: but no such
effect was seen, the best season for action at Sea, to the grief of all men,
and blame of many being lost. The Emperor said, he would forthwith send the
thirty Neapolitan Galleys to Corfu, which were at Messina, and fifty ships,
with 3000 Spaniards, with Don Ferrante Gonsaga aboard them, who was then
Viceroy of Sicily, who since the the Duke of Urbin could not by reason of his
indisposition of health, come to the Fleet, was to supply the place, which was
before destined to the said Duke. He promised also, that as soon as he should
be come to Barcellona, he would dispatch Doria away, with orders to come and
join with the other Fleet at Corfu, with 32 Galleys more. Yet there were many
reasons to doubt what the issue would be: That Caesar had often said, before he
went to Nice, it was impossible for him to make offensive war at one and the
same time against the Turks, and French; that there was small hopes of his
having peace with France, the meeting at Nice being now dissolved, and nothing
concluded. That his Officers in Napolls, had not only hindered the Captains
sent by Camillo Orsino, from raising men in that Kingdom, to relieve Dalmatia
in her greatest necessities; but by several feigned excuses, and contrary to
the Articles of the League, had denied General Capello the transporting of
Corn, for the service of the Fleet. And such were many other both his words and
actions, as gave just occasion of belief, that Caesar desired to spin out the
time, being either not willing, or not able to make war against the Turks; nor
to suffer, for as much as in them lay, that the Venetians should make peace,
whereby his share of the war should be the heavier. Therefore desiring to
secure himself as much as he might, by putting a new obligation upon the
Venetians, he desired that the Articles of the League might be renewed and
established; which though it seemed to be superfluous, the agreement being so
lately made, and stipulated in Rome; yet they would please him therein, (that
they might not leave any thing undone, which might make for the uniting of the
Fleets) to show that they did clearly intend to prosecute the War. The
Capitulation being confirmed, Caesar commanded Gonsaga, who was not yet gone, to
go to Corfu, but to carry the Galleys only along with him, leaving the ships,
to the end, as he affirmed, that the foot, which were not yet all come, might
be embarked therein. But his long looked-for arrival produced no good effect;
for the Venetian and Popes Generals propounding a voyage into the Levant, that
they might attempt somewhat against the Enemy; Gonsaga would not assent
thereunto, saying, that it was not safe for the Confederates, and particularly,
that it stood not with Cesars honor, to fall upon any enterprises with so
small forces; desiring therefore that they would tarry at least till the ships
came, which could not be long in ariving. The Fleets lying thus idle at Corfu,
the Patriark Grimani, impatient of so long delay, and desirous at least to
exercise his Gally-slaves, he went with thirty six Galleys toward St. Nicolo
di Civita, where understanding by those of the country, that the Castle of
Prevesa was but weakly guarded, he thought it not fit to let slip the occasion,
of assaulting it at unawares, it being a very commodious receptacle for the
Turks, to disturb the affairs of Christendom. The Castle of Prevesa is seated
upon the Promontory of Actium, a little within the mouth of the Gulf of Larta,
called of old, the Creek Ambraico, which is about sixty miles about; the mouth
thereof is very narrow and shallow, being choked up by many shelfes of sand,
of the neighboring River Larta, from whence both the City and the Gulf take
name: So as those that would assault the Castle, being to pass thereby, it was
not meanly safe; for no great ships could enter thereinto, nor no slight
Galleys, but one by one, and not without incurring danger. This Castle was
built by Octavius Augustus, in memory of the Navall victory, which he got near
this place, and was called Nicopoli. It is built after the ancient form, and is
not very strong; but much esteemed for situation, and guarded by an ordinary
Garrison of Turks. The Patriarck entering by this mouth into the Channel of
Prevesa, Paolo Giustiniano's Gally, having first made way for the rest, he
landed his men and artillery in open Campagnia, about a mile from the Castle;
and because his greatest hopes of good success lay, in making haste, not
spending time in making Trenches, he began presently to play upon the walls
with his Artillery, wherein Alessandro da Termi, who had the charge thereof,
proceeding somewhat slowly, the Patriark himself would land, the more to hasten
the planting of the Artillery, and to fall immediately upon battery: Which was
not well begun, when many Turks began to appear from the neighboring parts,
where we were quartered, whose numbers increased so fast, as they grew
formidable: And our men, who were not sheltered by any works, remaining exposed
to manifest danger by the enemies Horse, it was resolved, to re-imbarck the
soldiers and artillery, and without any further attempt, to return to Corfu.
Grimani's boldness and diligence was praised, and if his purpose had been
seconded by good success, he would have purchased plenary praise. But there
were many who wished, that more maturity had gone to this advice, considering
the great danger whereunto he did expose himself, as well of being assaulted by
the enemies Horse in open campagnia, having nothing to secure his men, nor his
artillery, from sudden assaults; as of having the Gulph's mouth blocked up,
and so himself hindered from getting out; he not having possessed himself, as he
ought to have done, of the other side of the mouth, which lay over against the
Castle. Some add, that the Patriarck meeting with Commissary Pasqueligo on the
way, who was sailing with 25 Galleys toward Z^ntes, to listen after the
Turkish Fleet, and who offered to follow him, and to be aiding to him in his
designs, he did not discover what his intention was to do, but refused his
company. Yet this his journey helped to discover that situation, and
whatsoever else was requisite, to the making of that enterprise; and was the
cause of our men's meeting with a fair occasion not long after, of getting a
notable victory, if they had known how to have used it: For Barbarossa hearing,
that the Patriarck was entered into the Gulf of Larta, made thither immediately
with his whole Fleet, hoping to meet with him, and to suppress him; but when
news came to Corfu, whither Barbarossa was gone, and that he tarried at
Prevesa, the Captains of the League differed in their opinions, touching what
was to be done; some were for going to Messina, to meet with Doria, who being
come from Spain, kept about those havens, to prepare diverse things needful for
the Fleet, excusing his delay, and laying the fault upon others. Others were
b^tter pleased to tarry at Corfu, and wait for Doria's coming, who had given
notice, that he would be with them ere long; for they thought it neither good
nor safe, especially for the Venetians, to abandon Corfu, and the guardianship
of the whole Gulf. At last, Doria came thither on the 7th. of September, but
not with all his Galleys, for he had left some in Spain, to guard those seas
from the incursion of Pirates; and some others were gone into Africa, to
succor Tunis and Goletta, from suspicion of new commotions of the Turks and
Moors, of those parts. The former consultations were then renu'd, but with
greater necessity of coming to a resolution, and of falling upon some
enterprise. At last, it was resolved by common consent, to go with the whole
Fleet to Prevesa, and to fight the enemy. Our Commanders intention was, to land
their men, as soon as they should be come to Prevesa, and to use all their
might to possess themselves of that Castle, and to build a Fort over against
it, that so they might master the Gulphs mouth, so as they might afterward put
on what resolution they should like best, either of entering to fight the
enemies Fleet, or else of keeping it from coming out, and ruin it by its own
sufferings. This advice was listened unto by the great applause of all,
accounting the place where they were to have the conflict, as a good Omen, as
being favorable to the Western Princes, for the signal victory which Augustus
got over Mark Antonio, and Cleop^^ra Queen of Egypt, in that sea. The League's
Fleet consisted of 136 Galleys, 2 Galleouns, and of 30 Frigates: These were
divided into five Squadrons; in the first was placed the greater Vessels,
governed by Francesco Doria; and the lesser was divided into four other
Squadrons, Patriarch Grimane led the Van with the first Squadron, General
Capello brought up the Rear, Doria and Gonsaga kept in the two middlemost,
Doria next the Patriark, and Gonsaga next Capello. The Fleet stayed a while at
the Gominizze, waiting for the other Imperial ships; which being long a
coming, finding the season good, it sailed toward Santa Maura. The Turks,
when they heard that the Christian Fleet was parted from Corfu, and was making
toward them, wondered very much, thinking they had been safe in that Haven, and
free from suspicion; they could not persuade themselves, that the Fleets could
meet together that year, nor, if they should meet, that they would draw so near
them, and hasard a Battle. The unexpected case made them differ the more in
their opinions, what was to be done; some were of opinion, that they should
have done enough, if, after having kept possession of the sea almost all that
Summer, and done much prejudice to the Venetian Towns, the Fleet should return
safe into the strait of Galipoli, and be able (as they said) to waste the
Venetians, by prolonging the war, and separate the Colleagues forces, and
intelligence, getting the victory by a more secure way. They therefore told
Barbarossa, that it would be best for them to keep in that Haven, where, by the
means of the Castle of Pevesa, and by the straitness of that Channel, they
might tarry without danger, and have all conveniences, (the country being their
friend, and abounding in all things) till such time as the Christian Fleet
quitting those seas, as they would quickly be forced to do, by reason of the
season of the year, and of many other incommodities, should leave navigation
free and safe for them. Others not being able to suffer, that the Christians,
who were wont to retreat, and yield unto their power and forces, should keep
them shut up for fear, in that haven, propounded, their sudden putting forth
to sea with their whole Fleet, to fight; by which generous resolution, all fear
would be transported from their soldiers, into those of the enemy, and also
all danger. They considered, that to keep there shut up, as it was a badge of
infamy, so it did not promise any safety to them, since they might be kept from
coming forth, longer then they imagined, and their Fleet incommodiated, and
peradventure assaulted within the haven, where the hopes of being able to save
themselves, by getting soon to land, and the seeing themselves fought withal
at their own doors; would discourage their soldiers from fighting; and so it
might fall out, that without hasarding Battle, and without making trial of
their military valor and discipline, which had always been dreaded by the
Christians, they should by a new and detestable example, reap a certain and
ignominious loss. That, come what would come, Soliman would assuredly commend
such a generous resolution, who having undergone the troubles of so many wars,
and exposed his person to many dangers, merely out of a desire of glory, would
not endure, that the reputation of his forces should be so much lessened, and
his happy fortune, and that of the Ottaman Empire, should be distrusted, by
refusing to fight with those enemies, who came to defy his Commanders, in his
own Havens, and underneath his own Forts. Barbarossa was bold, and wonted to
hasard himself upon fortune, and to find her favorable. He knew, that there
were many at Court, who envied his glory and greatness; and that his retreat
from Corfu, and the bad success of that enterprise, whereof he had been the
first author, had given them occasion of spreading abroad many rumors, which
he thought might detract from his reputation, and from the favor he was in
with Soliman. Moreover, he had some hopes, that though the Christian Commanders
should come very near him with their Fleet, yet they were not absolutely
resolved to fight him. He was herein confirmed by the treaties of Agreement,
held formerly with him by Doria; so as the same resolution, which would
purchase him the praise of a noble daring, by coming with his Fleet out of the
Gulf, seemed to be accompanied with safety. He had a Fleet of 150 vessels
with oars, besides some with sails, wherein, though many Galleasses,
Fly-boats, and other lesser vessels were comprehended; yet his smaller
Bottoms, exceeding those of the Christians in number, he doubted not the
victory, if they should fight without their gross Body, the use whereof
depended much upon the uncertainty of fortune, and of the winds. He resolved
therefore to carry his Fleet out of the Gulf, and to present himself in sight
of the Christian Fleet, neither seeking nor eschewing Battle; but, like a wise
Commander, endeavor to learn the enemies intentions and ways, that he might
govern himself accordingly. Before he drew forth his whole Fleet, he sent out a
Squadron of 50 Galleys to discover the minds of the Christian Commanders, and
to discry their goings, whether they did really intend to fight or no, and in
what order they guided their Squadrons. The Leagues Fleet steered its course
then toward St. Mauro, but being informed by those that stood on the topmast,
that the enemy was come forth, they presently tacked about, and made toward
them: Their voyage being altered, they altered the ordering of the Fleet;
General Capello led on the Van, who coming within ken of the Turks, made the
Galleys of his Squadron give more way, and playing upon them with his great
Guns, made them retreat to that place from whence they were parted; which they
did in such haste, (being come to discover, not to fight) as they were put in
some disorder, every Gally striving, which should get first into the Gulf, and
escape danger; which notwithstanding became the greater, by their disorderly
flight: for their Galleys having their poops turned toward ours, were exposed
to the shot which was made against them, not being able either to defend
themselves, nor to be assisted by their Galleys which remained in the Gulf,
keeping the mouth thereof shut, as they entered in: Which when Doria saw, who
was in the Bataglia, he likewise advanced so far on the other side, as it was
thought he meant to block up the mouth of the Haven, and to hinder the enemy
from entering; so as being assaulted both on the Flanck, and on the Poop, they
must needs be beaten: yet soon after, when he was come nearer up unto them, he,
by unexpected, and uncommunicated counsel, sent orders to the Fleet, that all
the Galleys under pain of severe punishment, should forthwith retreat; and
being quickly assembled, he made them go to Cape Ducato, in the Island of Santa
Maura, to the great wonder and dislike of all, the whole Fleet complaining, and
speaking freely against Doria, that they had lost a great opportunity of
suppressing a good part of the Enemies Fleet, without any loss at all unto
themselves. The Generals fell then to treat again, concerning what was to be
done, wherein they were the more doubtful, because they were altogether
ignorant of the Enemies intention, who might be said to have showed both
courage and fear at the same time, as desiring, and shunning battle. Some were
of opinion, that a squadron of Galleys should be sent to batter the Castle of
Lepanto, saying, that Barbarossa would not send any of his Galleys out of the
Gulf again, without urgent occasion: and that if the Enemy should come forth
into open Sea, it would be in their power to fight upon any whatsoever
advantage. Others were for returning presently to Pevesa; for if the Turkish
Fleet would not stir from their station, they might attempt the taking of the
Castle; and if it should advance, they should give opportunity of being fought
with upon disadvantage, for they might be assaulted before they could put
themselves in order. This advice was commended, as that which brought with it
more reputation to our Fleet, and more certainty of suppressing the enemy. The
confederates Fleet went then on the 28 of Sept. from the Island of St. Maura,
in the same order as formerly, and made toward the Enemy: but the wind which
was favorable unto them at their first putting forth, failing them as they
sailed, they were forced with great inconveniency and slowness, to make their
ships be towed, to keep them from being separated from their Galleys, whereby
the Turks had time and opportunity afforded them, not only of coming out of
the Gulf, but of being able, contrary to opinion, to order their squadrons at
Sea as they listed. So as before the League's Fleet could come near the gulphs
mouth; they discovered, that the Enemies Fleet being come forth in good order,
came with a prosperous wind toward them. Then said Doria We have ^nkenneld
our Enemy, as it was our intention to do; we may now fight if we please, but
the business must be well considered: it is of great importance, and
repentance will come too late. We must think, that by joining battle now, we
do not only hazard this Fleet to the fortune of a few hours, but also the
reputation of the Confederate Princes; nay, I may say, the welfare of
Christendom. For if these forces shall be lost, what means is there to raise
another Fleet, to oppose the Enemy, and stop the course of their Victory? What
hopes is there, to defend the Maritime parts without forces at Sea, or to keep
them from falling irrecoverably into the Turks hands; and then turning to the
Venetian General, be added, That it was he who was most to weigh these
respects, since it was his Commonwealth, which upon any sinister accident,
would run most hazard. To which Capello answered; That he had commission from
the Senate, to fight the Enemies Fleet, when he should meet with an
opportunity: that upon such an occasion, he could not but obey these orders;
that he did humbly thank God for it, and that he was very confident, that the
goodness of their cause, and their generous resolution would be accompanied
with happy success, to the great good service of Christendom, and to their own
particular praise. He therefore desired that the most dangerous place in the
battle might be allotted to him, and he would willingly accept it.

The Patriark Grimani, showed the same ready desire* to come presently to the
Conflict; and though he had first advised to go to Lepanto, yet seeing the
Enemy was come forth, he was as forward for fighting as any of the rest. When
Doria saw that all were for fighting, So be it then, said he, and good be our
speed. He presently caused the standard to be set up, giving requisite orders
for it, and said, he would be the first who should assault the Enemy with his
squadron. All were overjoyed at this resolution of giving battle, so great
hopes had the terrible aspect of the confederates Fleet begot in them, together
with the advertisement they had of the Turks weakness: which made them believe
they would not accept of battle, but that having made this show for their
reputation, they would fall back again into the Gulf. Every one with joyful
countenance made themselves, and their arms ready, and diligently discharged
the several duties which were deputed unto them. The Captains were not wanting
in exhorting, and in encouraging the rest to fight manfully. They laid before
them ^he weightinesse, and the easiness of the Victory, the rich booty which
they should have, the military honor, the immortal glory which was prepared
for them in all ages: and after these assured present rewards, the hopes of
greater things in the future. That the Enemy was sufficiently inferior to them
for number of ships, but much more in their goodness, A^ms, and in their
souldier^ valor; so as the greatest difficulty of Victory, seemed to lie in
beginning the conflict, which the Turks would not be able to resist: but that
as their greatest hopes of safety, lay in being able to get safe into their
friends country, so would it make them the more remiss in fighting, and would
be the cause that their galleys and goods would be the assalliants secure prey.
They wished them not to fear, no, not though they should have reason to do so,
^ince fear adds not to security; but, weakening men's forces, and bereaving them
of counsel, makes their danger the greater. That they needed nothing but
courage and speed, so to cut off the way by Sea from the Enemy, as they might
not, by ^^ight, bereave them of the almost assured victory.

Doria would lead the way with his Galleys, keeping on the right hand of the
Sea; he assigned the Battle to Capello, and appointed Gremani to keep in the
reere, to the end that he might be able with his squadron to relieve those who
should be in most need. He ordered Antonio Doria, who commanded the greater
Vessels, that going before the smaller galleys, he should endeavor to get the
wind of the Enemy, to the end that he might fall upon them with a fore-wind,
and disordering them by his Artillery, might weaken them, and discourage them
before they should come up to fight with our Galleys. But the Turks on the
other side, endeavoring the same advantage, labored by all means possible, to
get before the Christian Fleet, and by advantage of the wind, to be the first
that should fall on: which Doria being early aware of, made his Fleet bend
toward land, endeavoring to keep the enemy from getting that hand; but the
wind, which had begun to blow, soon failing, it was very hard to observe these
orders. The smaller Galleys were employed, and much pestred in haling the
greater Vessels: yet they were all so fervent upon fighting, as over coming all
difficulties by their industry and labor, the two greater Venetian Vessels
(the Gallioun, commanded by Alessandro Bondulmiero; and the Barza, commanded by
Nicolo Trivisavo) were already got to the designed place, which being
excellently well provived of Artillery, stood before all the squadrons, like
two strong Towers, to sustain and break the first violence of the Enemy.
Barbarossa, when he saw the ships make toward him before the wind, slackned,
fearing lest he might be forced to fight with the great ships,, which was the
thing he most desired to shun; began (as it is said) to repent his being come
out of the Gulf of Prevesa* and there was so great a fear generally throughout
the whole Turkish Fleet, as many of the Turks began already to recommend
themselves to the Christian slaves who were aboard their galleys: Yet
Barbarossa reassuming courage, did whatsoever became a good Commander to do;
and thinking of nothing but battle, sought to make what advantage he could both
of time and place: he labored chiefly to get to the head of the Island Santa
Maura, whereby shunning the encounter both of the ships and Galliouns, he might
wheel about, and assault our Fleet on the back, which being desirous to keep
their greater and lesser Vessels joined together, had much ado to change
situation, without disorder: He therefore ceased not to encourage his men,
both by persuasions and threats, not to be afraid: he laid before them the
reward and punishment of their good and bad behaviors; he told them there was
no cause of fear, that they were the same Musselmans, who had ever been
victorious in all Wars under the happy conduct of Soliman the Great, and
fortunate Prince, against the Christians; a people more wonted to wantonness
than wars, and to save themselves more by flight, than by military valor: that
every man's last day of life was prefixed, but the acquitting themselves thereof,
either with praise or dispraise, depended upon their own wills: that for his
part, he would not be wanting in any thing that belonged to a good Commander,
that the battle might be fought upon all advantage. And truly, all men thought
that Barbarossa did that day whatsoever could be expected from a wise and
valiant Commander, and showed himself greatly experienced in the Militia, and
at Sea. For he did so dispose and order his Galleys, as every one of their
Captains knowing, and observing his place, as though the Fleet did many times
wheel about in several manners; yet was it still well ordered and fitted for
battles, and ready to put on any whatsoever resolution. The Turkish Fleet was
divided into three parts, Traba^che commanded the right wing, and Selecco the
left, both of them experienced, and well reputed Commanders, and who had
carried themselves well in the late Wars: in the middle was Barbarossa with the
body of the Battle, wherein were the greatest number of Galleys. Traguti, a
famous Commander of the Pirates, went before all the rest with a squadron of
fly-boats, and some more nimble Galleys, as it were to chalk out the way to the
others, and to begin first to molest the Enemy with his fleeter Vessels, and
therefore freeer from danger. The Turks, were it either by reason of the slow,
or irresolute advancing of our men, or by their own diligence and good fortune,
the Sea being calm, so as the greater Vessels could not make use of the wind,
did first possess the Landshore, which the Commanders of the League had first
designed to do: and being gotten into a very convenient station, a good way off
from our ships, they stood a-front the Christian Fleet, to observe her motions,
thinking themselves already safe, since they saw the Confederates would not
hazard a battle, without the greater Vessels; and to tow them further on, being
within sight of the Enemy, was not without danger, and required time and
difficulty, so as it seemed to be in their choice whether they would fight or
no: But Doria wheeling this mean while about the ships, and being followed by
all the fleeter Galleys, kept not only the Enemy, but even his own men long
in doubt, what he would do. Every one, with their Provv turned upon the
Enemy, stood expecting when they should advance and begin the battle: But
through their so long delay, and vvasting of time, the Turks had leisure to
retreat to an advantageous place, and to avoid the battle. Doria's design (as
he afterward affirmed) was to deceive the Enemy, who being doubtful what he
meant to do, he thought they would keep fast in that part of the Sea where
they were, and close together; so as he having disposed of his Galleys in a
long rank, might take a larger bout, and assault the Turkish Fleet on several
parts, at one and the same time. But Barbarossa, being aware of his intention,
made more haste (as has been said) to the Land-shore, keeping the Prow, or
fore-Castle of his Galleys still turned upon our Fleet, and still getting
Rome-ward as far as he could from our greater ships. During which time, the
Confederates Fleet, to the wonder of all men, standing as it were immovable,
idly looking upon the insulting Enemy, and letting the opportunity slip;
General Capello, and Grimani, cried aloud, Let us lose no more time, let us
not lose the hopes of a certain victory. And Capello going about in a little
Vessel, encouraged to battle; his words and courage were applauded by all: and
being come to the gallie where Doria was, he said, Sirs, Let us charge the
flying Enemies; time, occasion, and the soldiers votes, invite us thereunto:
the Victory is ours, I will be the first that will fall on, I expect nothing
but command, to begin the conflict.

Capello was an old man 73 years of age, of a good aspect, and comely personage,
stout minded, and reverenced for his age, and held to be very wise, and well
experienced in Sea-affairs, which gave the greater authority to his advice and
encouragement. And truly, all men were so very desirous to fight, as nothing
was heard, but Fall on, fall on, Victory, victory; by which Doria being at last
wrought upon, and overcome with a certain shame, he commanded the rest to
advance, and he himself began likewise to move with his squadron. So as the
ships being past on, our Fleet drew somewhat nearer the enemy, who being come
to the designed place, stood with their Poops to the land, and their Prows to
seaward Many shot were made, though afar off from both sides, so as the battle
seemed to be already begun; yet the galleys advanced no farther on either side.
Doria hoped, that the Turks being terrified by this encounter, would quit their
Galleys without fighting, and seeking to save themselves by land, would leave
them the Victory void of danger. Barbarossa, seeing the yarer galleys backed by
the Gallioun, and by the Venetian Barza, durst come no nearer, fearing lest his
squadrons might be disordered, and his Galleys but badly treated by the
Artillery of these stronger ships. But, Doria, seeing his thoughts proved vain,
and being resolved, (as his actions showed) not to commit himself to the
hazard of a battle, began plainly to retreat; whereat the Turks being
encouraged, advanced so far; as many of their Galleys were come near the Barza,
and the Gallioun; which being before the rest, and by reason of their bulk,
could not so soon retreat; and a barrel of powder which was above hatches in
the Gallioun, being set on fire by a Cannon bullet, the Mariners and Soldiers
were terrified and much disordered. But the Captain commanding courageously,
and taking order for all things, saved them from that danger, and would not
suffer that any more shot should be made as then against the enemy. The like
did the Captain of the Barza: But when he saw the Turkish Galleys come somewhat
nearer, they gave them all their Guns at once, and made them soon retire. But
our ships, and some of our galleys remained in the like; nay, in greater
danger, not being able so unexpectedly to make away so soon as did the rest.
The Turks seeing them separated, fell upon them, as upon certain prey. Two of
the Venetians ships falling on fire in the fight, were miserably sunk, with all
the men in them; and two Spanish Vessels having made long and valiant
resistance, were taken: the rest, by reason of a favorable wind which arose,
escaped safe away. Two smaller galleys ran the same misfortune, the one
belonging to the Venetians, the other to the Pope; the first being commanded by
Francisco Capello, the other by Abbate Bibiena, which having most of their men
slain, fell into the power of the Turks: Others, which were in some danger
escaped, by reason of the darkness of the night; and the whole Fleet of the
Confederates, save the aforesaid few, got safe to the Island of Corfu. Doria
would be the last that should retreat, thinking to show either greater bravery
thereby, or his greater care of the Fleets safety. But all men knew, that this
his confidence proceeded not from any courage, nor from any good will to the
service; but for that he knew his Gally to be so yare, as that he might easily
escape danger. But General Capello being aware thereof, would not move but at
the same time together with him. The Turks growing confident upon this retreat
of the confederates Fleet, were not content to have escaped shame and danger,
but thought to carry it home to others. Wherefore they went with their whole
Fleet not long after to the Island of Paru, within twelve miles of Corfu, where
they tarried a good while, as if they did defy the Confederates to come out of
the Haven, and fight, and expecting an opportunity to damnifie them. But the
Confederates Fleet was full of disorder and fear. Doria's Stars were thought
unfortunate, and his Loyalty was suspected, and all that he advised. There was
not any one who durst offer at any generous action; if any business were
propounded, it soon begot doubts and difficulties even in the propounders. Thus
all the Galleys keeping in the Haven, and no occasion of Action being given,
the Turks after having insulted over the Christian Fleet, fearing some stormy
tempestuous weather, for now the first week of October was over, retired to the
gulf of Larta.

This was the success of this present year, this the end of such preparations
for war. Great expectation of mighty matters, great movings, hopes, and fears,
of notable events; but no effects answerable, either to the mightiness of the
Princes, or to the expectation of such forces. Yet this age not being
accustomed to see such warlick preparations at sea, this encounter of the
Fleets at Prevesa was very famous; but certainly, to the little honor, and
great grief of Christians, and to the particular blemish of Andrea Doria's
reputation, who was then, and afterward, generally ill spoken of every where,
some accusing him of perfidiousnesse, others of cowardice, and of bad affection
to Christendom, particularly toward the welfare of the Venetians. And
certainly, there were many things which might make his loyalty suspected; the
friendship which he was known to hold with Barbarossa, contracted, whilst the
one was in the King of France his pay at Marcelles, and the other in Algiers;
the treaties which were known by all men, to have been formerly held between
them, and for that two Galleotte were seen to come from Prevesa, the night
before the Turkish Fleet appeared, the one whereof went into Sicily, the other,
after having accosted Doria's Gally, was said to have returned into the Gulf
of Prevesa. Moreover, it was observed, that Doria had caused all the
main-sail-yards of his Galleys, to be blackt over, which was suspected might be
a sign, whereby they might be known from the rest. But those who spoke more
particularly, blamed him, for having many immoderate affections, as, ambition
of being great, fear of danger to his own person, and avarice; by which being
blinded, and not knowing nor valluing any interests but his own, he would not
hazard himself, nor his own particular Gally, to the danger of Battle, upon the
preservation whereof, his glory and reputation did depend, in regard of the
need the Emperor stood in of his service. Nay, the Spaniards spared not to
blame him; the Marquis d' Aglier, Ambassador from the Emperor at Rome, did
publicly detest Doria's actions, showing peradventure more fervency therein,
to free the Emperor from suspicion, that this might be done by his order. Yet
the Venetian Senate wisely considering, that it made not for them, to alienate
this man's mind from them, who had the government of that Fleet, seemed not to
be any ways ill satisfied, with him, writ civilly unto him, saying, That they
believed, he like a wise Commander, had done what appeared best to him, for the
good and safety of Christendom. Doria hearing of these complaints, which were
generally made against him, was much afflicted, insomuch as after his return to
Corfu, he seldom suffered himself to be seen abroad; and when any discourse was
had of this business in his presence, he showed much passion, and was hardly
able to forbear tears. After this retreat, the Confederates Fleet lay some
days idle at Corfu. But it being thought, to be too base and ignominious a
thing for Christendom, to tarry any longer in that Haven, the season being
favorable for action at sea, though it were now Autumn, and the enemy being
gone far off, diverse things were proposed. General Capello was for the Fleets
going into the Archipelagus, where, he said, it was likely, they might light
upon some new occasion of fighting the enemy; but if they should fail thereof,
some other certain and notable advantage might be made by this voyage; for many
ships which were bound for Constantinople, would fell into their hands, and
prove secure prey. Napoli and Malvesia might be ^u^coured and secured, and many
Islands in the Archipelagus might as easily be recovered, as they had been lost
but a little before; from whence they might receive great advantage, especially
by furnishing the Fleet with men for the Oa^s; and not only so, but deprive
the enemy of them. That in those Islands there were many Havens, wherein the
Fleet might keep securely, and that thereby they might infuse such jealousy
into Barbarossa, as it might be, he would not dare to carry his Fleet back to
Constantinople, which wanting many things, must tarry in a weak condition in
that Gulf, and in a condition, of not putting out at all to sea the next year,
or at least very late. That the honor and reputation which they had lost, by
what had past at Prevesa, could no ways else be redeemed, nor was there any
other means, to make their assertion credited; to wit, that it was the wind
and fortune, not counsel in the Commanders, nor courage in the soldiers,
which kept them from fighting, That whatsoever acquisitions should be made on
Terra ferma, would be in vain, and to no purpose, by reason of the difficulty
and impossibility which would be found, in maintaining what they should get,
from the numerous Turkish Armies. Others, and chiefly Doria, were rather, for
going to batter Dorazzo, thinking it a very dangerous thing to put to sea at
that season, in the Archipelagus; and that whatsoever labor they should take
in regaining those Islands, would be but lost, since, there not being any
secure Fort there, they must again fall into the Turks hands, at the first
appearance of any Turkish Fleet. On the contrary, if the enterprise of Dorazzo
should prove lucky, many advantages might be thereby made, by reason of the
condition of the place, which was very convenient and fit, to make way for
further progress in Albania. That this was held and known to be such a place by
the Romans, who were resolved not to pass into Greece, before they had made
themselves masters thereof; which when they had gotten, they advanced notably in
Albania, and in Macedonia. But this proposition met likewise with many
difficulties; it was said, There were no Havens there able to receive the
Fleet, especially the great ships, which must lie out at sea, not without great
danger. That ^he neighboring country was full of Turkish Horse, whereby the
enterprise might easily be disturbed: That it might also be disturbed by
Barbarossa, if he should come to Vallona, it not being safe for them to land
their men, and to leave the Fleet unfurnished, having so powerful an enemy so
near at hand. That they were to keep the war as far off as they could, and
molest the enemy there, where he could not make use of his chiefest forces,
which consisted in foot soldiers, and in horse, not in their Fleet, which
certainly was much inferior to that of the Christians. By reason of these
difficulties, which appeared the greater to those, whose minds were daunted,
by reason of the late successes, and were not apt to hope well; the thoughts of
making any further enterprises were quite laid aside, and they resolved to
enter the Gulf, and to attempt somewhat, which might easily and safely be
effected. The Fleet went then to the mouth of the Channel of Cattaro, to
besiege Castel-Nuovo, a Town seated on the seashore, a little within that
Gulf, which some years before was taken from Chersego by Mahomet. This was a
place sufficiently esteemed, nor for it self, for it was neither very great,
nor very strong, but for the situation thereof, which was very commodious in
many respects, especially for the Venetians, in respect of the safety of
Cattaro, seated almost in the uttermost parts of the same Gulf, by which,
garrisons and victuals were to pass unto that City. The town and buildings of
Castel-Nuovo stand upon certain little hills, along the seashore; and in the
highest part thereof there is a Castle, guared by a Turkish Garrison; the other
inhabitants being for the most part Dalmatians and Slavonians. The whole Fleet
being entered into the gulf, Doria caused the foot and the Artillery to be
landed a little way from the Castle, to batter it, Don Ferran^^ Gonsaga having
the particular charge thereof; but in the interim, whilst the Spanish foot were
putting in order, and preparing the Battery, General Capello accosting the
walls with his Galleys, which by reason of their being so very near, might lie
there safe from the shot of the Castle; for being made from a higher place,
they were carried further off, began to give the assault; wherein those that
rowed the galleys, mounting the walls upon Ladders made of their Oars, (for the
defendants being assaulted on several parts, could make no resistance) entered
the Town, and opened the Gates to the soldiers, so as the Turks soon quitted
the Town, and retreated to the Castle; but not long after, not being able to
defend it, they yielded upon discretion: The Town was plundered by the Spanish
foot, Don Ferrante's command to the contrary, not being sufficient to detain
them; for he knowing that the booty belonged to the Venetians, had forbad it:
nay, they were so insolent, as not content with the booty which they had got in
the Town, they took what the Mariners had got of prey from them, as they
returned to the Galleys, enjoying the fruit of other men's labors, and dangers.
Barbarossa hearing that the Christian Fleet was gone to besiege Castel-Nuovo,
went from Pevesa thither-ward, intending to relieve it, or hoping at least,
that the news of his coming would disturb the enterprise. Wherefore our men
being informed that the enemies Fleet was past the channel of Corfu, with a
prosperous South-east wind, they were not a little troubled; but it lasted but
a while: for they soon after heard, that meeting with foul weather at Sea, by
reason of a sudden furious South-west wind, the Turks had lost about 30 of
their galleys, which were overborn by the waves, and were returned with the
rest very much shattered and torn to Vallona. This success affording
opportunity to fight the nemy, whilst both their minds and forces were
dejected, seemed to invite the Commanders of the League to change their
resolution, as was heard by general votes throughout the Fleet, where many had
reassumed their former vigor: And the Venetian General did very efficaciously
exhort Doria, not to let slip this occasion also, since there was but a short
cut to Vallona, where they might assault the Turkish Fleet, which was not in a
condition to fight, being much weakened by reason of the fortune which they had
run, nor yet in a condition of running away, for want of Oars, the most of
which were broken; nor were they in a place of safety, the Castle of Vallona
being so far from the Haven, as it could well defend it. But Doria was resolved
to be gone without doing any thing; wherefore pleading sometime the
unseasonablenesse of the time, sometimes other things, he prolonged the time so
long, till Barbarossa had time to carry his Fleet safe back to Constantinople,
leaving Dragute with 25 Galleys, and with a good squadron of bigger bottoms,
and Pirates Vessels, in the gulf of Lepanto, to molest the Christians in their
Navigation. Quickly after, Doria, alleging other reasons for his departure,
and chiefly want of bread, he resolved to be gone, and to go with his Fleet
into Sicily, though he was entreated and counseled by his own men, and by Don
Ferrante's self, to keep the Fleets united that winter at Corfu, or in some
other fitting place, where they might put early to Sea the next spring, and
prevent the Enemy. 4000 Spanish foot, commanded by Captain Iovanni Sermento,
were left to guard Castel-Nuovo, though the Venetian General had often desired,
that according to the Articles of the League, the Town might be assigned over
to him, to be guarded by his Men. But Doria said, he could not do it of
himself, without order from the Emperor: and moreover, he placed 6000 other
Spanish foot in Garrison, in Buedn^, Anteviri, and Dolcigno, pretending to do
it for the good of the Venetians, that thereby those Towns might be the more
secure, and might be as it were a Storehouse of soldiers, which might be in
readiness to be made use of the next spring. These things gave occasion of
great suspicion, some beginning already to affirm, that the Garrisons of the
Commonwealth being to be increased by these foot, it belonged to the
Commonwealth to pay them. Doria being gone, the Patriark Grimani went not long
after to Ancona; whither being come, he disarmed his galleys, and sent them to
Venice, going himself to Rome, to give the Pope an account of what was past.
General Capello tarrying in the gulf of Cattaro, went to Risano, a little Town
not far from Cattaro, in the Turkish jurisdiction, but weakly guarded, which
soon surrendering, he placed a Garrison there, under the command of Luigi Zane,
a Gentleman of his gally. Capello fell here very sick, by reason of the much
pains he had taken; but much more out of trouble of mind, seeing things had
been carried so contrary to his desire, which forced him to crave leave of the
Senate to disarm, that he might return home to be cured. At this time the Duke
of Urbine, wasted with a long and grievous sickness, dyed, not without
suspicion of poison, to the great and universal grief of the Venetians, who
confessed all of them, that the Commonwealth had seldom met with a personage so
proper for the Government of their Militia, as he was, wherein he had given
great satisfaction for the space of 15 years; his obsequies were solemnly made
in S. Paul's Church in Venice; Lorenzo Contarini, famous for Eloquence,
pronouncing the Funeral Oration. He was much experienced in the Militia,
particularly well acquainted with the State, and all things therein: He was
very vigilant in weighty affairs, very dexterous in all his actions; his mind
was real, sincere, and well affected to the honor of Italy, and particularly
to the Grandezza of Venice. Yet many were jealous, that he had not proceeded
too sincerely in the succouring of Rome, out of his own particular Interests
and designs, not being over-well affected to the House of Medeci, as says
Guicchardine, a modern Historian.

THe occasion several times sadly let slip of fighting the Turkish Fleet, with
hope of Victory; and the putting of a Spanish Garrison into Castle Nuovo, being
answerable to the actions of the preceding year; did not only, upon mature
consideration, increase the jealousies which were generally conceived of the
unsincere and pusillanimous proceedings of Doria, but produced the like of
Caesar, and his intentions. The Venetian Senate, were hereby exposed to great
trouble and danger; they had undertaken a heavy War against a powerful Enemy.
Their having refused many invitations to Peace, would make the future agreement
the harder. They had used many endeavors to move Caesar to observe the
Capitulations of confederacy; that he would grant the things treated of at
Naples, and Sicily; that he would cause Castle Nuovo, to be assigned over into
the hands of such as should be thereunto deputed by the Commonwealth; that he
should give such orders to his Officers, as that his Galleys might be ready to
join with the Fleets in March: But Caesar had given no full satisfaction to any
of all these things: finding out many occasions of excuse, and delays touching
the thing Treated of, that the Officers to whom the care thereof belonged,
would first make their own Declarations, touching the restoring of Castle
Nuovo; He alleged, that the Commonwealth was to disburse the pay which was
behind hand to the Spanish Foot, for having guarded the Fort: And touching the
speedy dispatch of the Fleet, that he intending to go in it himself in person,
there was was need of greater Forces, and preparations, and consequently longer
time would be required. But in some of these things, reason; and in othersome,
both reason and actions, showed that he aimed not at equity, nor at the common
good. His words were very magnificent, and his promises great; but not without
great suspicion, that his only end was to keep the Venetians tied by the
league, to the end that he might make use of their Forces and friendship, as
far as might concern his own service, not the common good: for it was
understood, that Protestations were made in several Courts which were held in
the Kingdom, wherein he was advised by the chief men of the Provinces, not to
depart the Kingdom. Moreover, he was so bare of money, as, if he had really
intended to go himself in person with the Fleet, he would not be able to
maintain the expenses which his coming would occasion: out of these reasons it
was conceived, that the Venetians had not only cause, but were necessitated to
think more of Peace then of War, they were the more encouraged to attend this
treaty of Peace, out of hopes that they might obtain it of the Turks upon
reasonable conditions: For the Turks, proceeding with more respect, had made
the Bailo be removed from the Tower, del mare Magiore, to Constantinople, and
likewise gave notice that they would quickly set all the Venetian Merchants at
liberty, which they accordingly did, giving them time to negotiate their
business, being bound one for another not to go themselves in person, nor to
send their merchandise out of the confines of the Ottoman Empire: There was
likewise one Antonio da Modone come to Venice, who lived then at Zante, and
brought Letters with him, written to him upon his own private occasions, by
Gianusbei, wherein he affirmed the Grand Seigneur, and the Bascia, were well
inclined to peace, so as if an Ambassador should be sent to that purpose to
Constantinople, some conclusion might soon be had in the point, wherein
Gianusbei willingly offered his best endeavors; provided he were desired so to
do. Out of these respects, the Council often, thought it fit to begin a
Treaty of Peace. But to the end, that the business might be carried with more
secrecy and reputation; they would not send at that time any public person to
Constantinople, but gave commission to Lorenza Gritti, natural Son to the Doge,
to go to Constantinople, under pretense of following his own private affairs,
and particularly the recovery of certain merchandise belonging to a Brother of
his, lately dead at Constantinople. His Commission was, first, to treat of a
general Truce, and to insist thereupon as much he could, that he might bring
it to some conclusion. But if the Turks should not assent thereunto, he was
then to advance the treaty of Peace for the Commonwealth, wherein the former
Capitulations were to be observed; and all places taken by either party in that
War, were to be restored.

The King of France had likewise interposed himself in this Treaty of Truce,
who to this purpose had sent a servant of his to Constantinople; but it was
soon seen, there was small hopes of bringing this Treaty to a good end; for the
Turks seemed to be very far from coming to any agreement with Caesar, having
propounded and procured peace with the Venetians, purposely that they might
turn their Armies the more commodiously, and with the greater force against
him. As soon as Gritti's going to Constantinople was divulged, though the true
occasion thereof was concealed, it was soon suspected that he went to treat of
Peace; wherefore Don Diego Hurtado di Mendosa, who was then Ambassador from the
Emperor at Venice, discovered this his suspicion in a private Audience in the
College; modestly complaining, that they should think of making an agreement
with the common enemy, and not comprehend the Emperor therein, who was a
friend and confederate of the Commonwealth; and afterward he in a long
Oration, dissuaded them from treating of peace with the Turks.

What assurance, said he, what security can you have, that these Barbarians
will stand to the Agreement, whereunto they shall assent not out of any desire
of peace, which they use naturally to abborre, nor out of any good will to the
Commonwealth, since they hate the very name of Christian to death; but only
out of some particular end, or accommodation of their own, that they may
dissolve this league, weaken the chiefest Potentates of Christendom, and
oppress the rest: If it be the matter of expense which makes you alter your
mind from continuing War; you ought to consider, that Peace does not free you
from it, but renders it vain and useless: for the Emperor will by no means
be brought to an agreement with the Turks: and whilst these shall be in Arms,
and shall have two great Fleets at Sea; will you, wise Seigneurs, be unarmed?
will you trust the safety of your State, to the uncertain faith of others?
Surely no body will believe it. It would be a thing certainly to be desired,
that your State had not so formidable* Neighbors, as are the Turks, and that
you might enjoy quiet, and tranquillity, free from so many jealousies, and
disaccommodations. But since the present condition of times and affairs, is
such, as that expense, danger, and labor must be undergone: it should be
thought a great good fortune, that in this age, and upon this occasion, there
is so powerful a Prince in Christendom, as may by his Forces counterpoise the
Turkish power; and who out of his desires and well-wishings to the common good,
is ready to expose, not only his Forces, but his very Person, to the hazard of
War, so to abate the pride of these common Enemies. To this, answer was made;
That the Commonwealth had been already two years in league; yet she might
truly affirm, that it was she alone that had hitherto withstood the brunt of
the Turkish Forces; that the reasons were well known, which had hindered the
requisite speedy assistance, and did therefore believe they might light upon
the like misfortunes again. Yet they had always born, and still did bear great
respect to the Confederates: That the King of France had endeavored a general
truce at Constantinople; that by accepting and favoring this Treaty, he
thought he did what concerned the common service, and that whereby the
Commonwealth might reap many advantages; and if nothing else, the benefit of
time, which the Emperor himself thought very necessary, for the well ordering
of all things touching his voyage to the Eastern parts. The like passages were
had at the Court, between Caesar himself, and the Venetian Ambassador: But
they produced no effects, neither of spurring up Caesar to prepare for War, nor
of making the Venetians retard the already resolved Treaty of Peace.

Thus ended the year 1538, in the end whereof, upon the 27 day of December, the
Doge Gritti dyed, being 84 years old; a good part whereof he had spent in
managing important affairs, and in the Commonwealth's most difficult times, as
may be known by what you have heard: He was Prince 15 years and 7 months, and
his death was bewailed by all men. His Funeral Oration was made by Barnardo
Navagiero, a youth who was then of great hopes, and who proved afterward a
Cardinal; he was buried in S. Francis his Church.

The year 1539 insued, wherein there passed no action of War on the
Commonwealths behalf, though great preparations were made for it, it being
almost wholly spent in the negotiation of peace, in the beginning thereof; the
Venetians thinking that they were to trust to none but to themselves, and their
own Forces, for the safety of their State; though they had endeavored peace
with the Turks, and the continuation of the League, to the end that (if need
should be) they might be able to maintain the War of themselves* without the
help of the Confederates; they did all they could to increase their Garrisons,
and to reinforce their Fleet. They took many Soldiers into pay, and armed
more slight, and greater Galleys in Venice, and gave commission likewise to
Commissary Contarini, who was then in Candia, to endeavor the speedy arming of
25 Galleys in that Kingdom: At this time the Senate made an institution, that
out of all the Artificers of the City, 4000 men should be chosen, who were four
times a year to go aboard certain Galleys thereunto appointed, to row: This is
commonly called Regattare, or vuying for the Mastery; and several rewards were
appointed for the first three that should row best. By this means, there were
always men ready and prepared, to arm a certain number of Galleys upon a
sudden; and Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbin, was taken into pay by the
Commonwealth, to be head of the Militia; who in the life time of his Father,
Duke Francisco Maria, had always been in this service: and he had a hundred
Curassieres, a hundred light Horse, and ten paid Captains, added to his
Conduct, and four thousand Ducats, for his boord-wages.

The Duke was held to be very fit for the service of the Commonwealth, as well
in respect of his own condition, being bred up under his Father's excellent
discipline, and being attended by the best Soldiers that were then in Italy,
who had served under his Father; as also for the condition of his Dukedom,
which did abound in good Soldiers, and in places commodiously situated, from
whence to be sent to the Garrisons of the Sea-Forts. Wherefore the Senate sent
Francisco Somito, Ambassador to him, with great demonstrations of love and
honor, to condole his Father's death, and to assure him, that they would not
forget the good service he had done the Commonwealth: But some months past
before they came to this confirmation, for fear lest the Pope should be
offended, if the Duke, who was Feudatory to the Church, should be honored and
embraced by the Commonwealth, whilst he was in contumacy with the Pope. The
State of Camerino, had, as you have heard, been the occasion of these dislikes;
for Duke Guido being possessed of the Dukedom of Camerino, in the right of his
wife Iulia, daughter to Iovan Maria Varrano, the last Duke of that Family: The
Pope pretended, that that State was illegally possessed, which for want of
Heirs-male, should have reverted to the Apostolic Sea, as being held in fee of
him. The Senate was very fervent in this business, endeavoring to appease the
Pope, being thereunto moved by the recent memory of Francisco Maria, who had
deserved so well of the Commonwealth; and out of their good affection to the
present Duke, who was in much trouble and danger; and they were no less
excited thereunto, for fear lest thereby some important War might be raised
in Italy. For the Duke of Mantua, whose sisters Son Duke Guido was, gave out,
that he would not only defend the Duke his Nephew, with his State and Forces,
but would call in foreign aid into Italy. At last, when all proved vain that
could be done, to make the Pope alter his mind, the Duke was forced by the
interposition of the Senators authority and mediation, to yield up the Dukedom
of Camerino to the Pope, who was resolved to recover it by force of arms, if it
were not willingly surrendered, receiving in recompense a good sum of Money, as
in dowry with his wife Iulia. This difference being accommodated, and this
respect ceasing, which was the only thing that stuck with some men, Duke Guido
was taken into pay by the Commonwealth, as has been said. And that the Fleet
might not likewise be without a Commander in chief, since Capello, who had
permission from the Senate, to leave his Armed Gally at Chioggia, and
(retaining still the name and degree of General) to return to Venice for the
recovery of his health, was not in a condition of returning soon to that
service; Iovanni Moro was chosen to supply his place, who was then Commissary
General in Candia: but news of his death coming not long after, the place was
conferred on Tomaso Mocenico, a man verst in many important businesses both at
home and abroad. Moro's death was thus occasioned: A great dispute fell out
between the Grecian and the Italian Foot, and great numbers of men flockt to
each side; Moro fearing some great disorder, went thither himself in person,
with his Halbardiers, and other armed men, to appease the tumult, and being
wounded in the head with a stone, dyed soon after. But this his action was not
able to appease the fury of those people, for many more were slain, and the
business grew more dangerous: When Duke Antonio da Mula, putting on his Ducall
crimson Robes, and environed by his Courtiers, went to-where the uproare was;
and such was the respect they bore to his person, by reason of his years, by
reason of his degree, and reverend habit, as it appeased their rage and
insolences, which the Commissary with his armed men could not do. Iovanni
Vitturi, was chosen to succeed Moro, who severely punishing the heads of this
uproar, quieted all the rest, so as no tumults nor injuries arose between the
Soldiers and Islanders a long time after.

Whilst the Venetians proceeded thus, the Turks were no less diligent in
preparing their Fleet and Army, being the more sensible of their loss of
Castle Nuovo, by reason of their being always accustomed to overcome.
Therefore being resolved to recover this place, and thereby the reputation
which they had lost in losing it; they made preparation both of men, and all
things else, sufficient for a far greater enterprise: and in the mean while
Dragute, who (as it has been said) tarryed in the gulf of Lepanto, went from
thence with 30 Vessels very well armed; and coming to the Island of Paxu, did
much infest the Navigation: for keeping secret, and retired in St. Nicholas
Haven, about some four miles from Corfu, and sending some of his yarest Galleys
oftentimes from thence, even to the Channel of Corfu, to pillage ships which
came to that Island. Commissary Pasquillio, was not able longer to endure such
indignity: wherefore he resolved to go out with twelve of his best Galleys, and
to fall upon some Turkish Galleys which lay very near land; but the Enemy not
standing the encounter, fled toward the Gulf of Larta, to abuse the
Commissary, as it appeared afterward, making him believe that they had no more
ships at Paxu: but when our Galleys were advanced somewhat further in pursuit
of the enemy, they discovered Dragute, who being come from Paxu with the rest
of his Galleys and fly-Boats, was gone room-ward, to get the advantage of the
wind, and so fall upon our Galleys on the flanck. The Commissary, finding his
danger, if he should advance any further, hoysted all his sayls forthwith, and
made toward Corsu, being pursued by the Enemy, who getting ground upon us,
three of our Galleys fearing they should not save themselves by flight, gave
against Land in the shelfes of Messangi, twelve miles from the Fort of Corfu,
where they lost their Galleys, but saved their Men and Goods. But Antonio
Canale's Galley, having broken her anchor, whereby she could not steer the
same course as the rest did, was taken by the Enemy. The Turks growing bolder
hereupon, they went with the same shipping into the Island of Candia, where
they landed some of their men in the parts about Canea, burning and pillaging
the farme-Houses. But a good number of Carabines, and Fewdatories of the
Kingdom being got together, they slew many of them, and sent the rest soon back
to the Fleet; wherein Antonio Calbo, a Councellor, was much commended, it being
confessed by all men, that the Country was preserved from much prejudice chiefly
by his means.

This mean while, Gritti returned from Constantinople, the month of April not
being yet over, for he had made very great haste. He related, how that by
Gianusbei's means, he was brought to the chief Bassha, who, though he received
him very graciously, yet made many grievous complaints of many hostile acts,
committed by several of the Commonwealth's Officers upon the Mussulmans,
complaining that the Commonwealth had not punished them; but he seemed chiefly
to resent very much, the disrespect which had been shown and used to the Grand
Seigneur, and that whole Court, in not having given any answer to the so many
proposalls made by them of peace and agreement. Wherefore Gritti not finding
the Turks so disposed, as that he might take an opportunity to treat then of
peace; he procured that Arms should be laid down on all sides for three months
space, in which interim the peace might be treated of; which as soon as he had
obtained, he caused it to be published upon the confines, as he past by; so as
the Turkish Forces which were incampt before Salona, with intention, as was
given out, of going to besiege Spala^o, when Salona should be taken, hearing
this, arose, and went from those confines.

This Truce was not over-welcome to the Venetians, many being not a little
jealous, that this suspension of Arms, tended more to the putting of
diffidence, between the confederate Princes, and to gain time for making
greater preparations for War, then to any real desire of Peace. There were
therefore several opinions touching the prosecution of this Agreement, and how
it might be handled. The treaty of things in general, and made by a private
person, did not secure from danger, and kept the Commonwealth still with
uncertain hopes, in the expense of War. To make any particular application by
an Ambassador, showing a desire and need of Peace, would make the Turks more
insolent, and the agreement more disadvantageous, or more difficult. But at
last, after many disputes, the Senate, to whom this business was referred,
resolved (though it was carried but by two voices) to send an Ambassador to
Soliman, to treat of Peace; and Pietro Zeno was chosen to go the Embassy. But
the Ambassadors going, requiring some time, in respect of preparing accust^med
presents; and it being also thought requisite, that ^e should find things on
foot toward some certainty, or better hopes of conclusion; Gri^ti was sent
back to Constantinople, to the end that carrying news of the Ambassadors
coming, he might endeavor the prolong^tion of the Truce; and might begin,
according (...) should see (...), to make way for the Treaty of Peace, wherein
he was (...) to make use of Monsieur di Roencone's assistance, and advice, who
was then Ambassador at the Court, from the King of France; and who had
oftentimes willingly offered to interp^^e himself in that T^^aty, but it was
after known, that his endeavors tended to the contrary, and that they made the
business more difficult, intending, that the business being intricated, his
King might become Arbitrator of the differences; and, by thus obliging the
Venetians, might totally sever them from Caesar's friendship and confederacy.
When Gritti came to Venice, the new General had already taken the standard, to
go to his Government; but not being yet parted from the shore, his going was
put off, left it might have begotten jealousies in the Turks, that these
endeavors of Peace were out feigned, and that they might return to molest the
confines of the Commonwealth, where they began to be in quiet: But this mean
while, that the Fleet might not be without a Commander in General; the same
Authority was given to Commissary Contarini, as is usually enjoyed by the
Generals at Sea. Soon after the Ambassador Zeno began his journey with
Commission, That upon the conclusion of Peace, all things should return to the
same condition as they were before the War; that he should justify all past
passages, promise friendship, and peace for the future, and particularly the
restitution of Castle Nuovo, if the general Truce should be concluded, and
that the Turks should do the like, concerning the places taken by them in
Dalmatia, and in the Archi-pelagus. But Zeno being come to Bossina, fell sick
and dyed; the Senate was adverised of his death, by Letters from his Secretary
Pietro di Franceschi; and there-withal, how that a great desire of peace was
discovered in all the Turkish Officers, insomuch that they had solicited him to
write to Venice, that a new Ambassador might be chosen, which Thomaso Contarini
soon was, an old man of 84 years of Age, but much esteemed for his mature
wisdom, and for his particular knowledge in the Turkish affairs, with whom he
had had long conversation upon several occasions. He had but four days allowed
him for his departure, and in the interim, speedy news of his election was
dispatched away to Secretary Franceschi, who kept still at Bossina; as also
Gritti, who returned suddenly to Constantinople.

But nothing that Gritti could do, could prevail as to the general Truce, the
Turks still continuing the preparations for their Fleet, as being desirous to
recover Castle Nuo^o rather by force, then agreement. Barbarossa, was already
gone forth with 150 sail of several sorts of shipping, and with a great train
of Artillery; and Begl^rbeg of Greece, at the same time marched with a great
many Horse to the taking of Castle Nuovo: So the Turks not dissenting from
agreement with the Venetians, easily consented, that the Truce should be
prolonged with them alone, for the month of September; and set some of their
ships that were deteyn'd, at liberty; and allowed more freedom to their
Consulls and Merchants. This Treaty being noysed abroad, it was severally
discourst of, every where, according to the diversity of men's judgments, or
rather of their affections. Most men commended the Venetians, for accommodating
themselves to the times, and to necessity, endeavoring the safety of their
state and affairs by agreement, since they had tried the way of Arms two years
in vain, with great expense and danger, whereby their sincerity, faith, and
real intentions to the common good, did sufficiently appear; particularly the
Pope said, the Senate had done according to their ancient renown and wisdom,
proceeding according as the present condition of affairs did dictate, and
providing for the preservation of their State, by such means as were permitted
them: He therefore would not arm his Galleys, confessing, that the joining of
the Fleets would do more harm then good, disturbing on one side the Treaty of
Peace, and then doing no prejudice to the Enemy. But because he intended to
keep two Galleys armed for the defense of his maritime Coasts, he desired them
of the Senate, who willing granted them. Barbarossa this mean while steering on
his course, and being to enter into the Gulf, the wonted difficulties arose,
Where the Commonwealths Fleet should keep. To retreat, would be dishonorable,
would infuse fear into their subjects, and make them despair, would show their
weakness to the Turks, and make them more insolent, and stand upon harder terms
of agreement. On the other side, to keep at Corfu, might afford occasion of
meeting with the Turkish Fleet, and raise new scandalls; and might also make
the Turks jealous, that they would join with the Imperialists, a thing which
would be very unseasonable at this time, and contrary to the intention of the
already begun Treaty of Peace. They had not as then above 65 Galleys in their
Fleet, which if they should keep all without the Gulf, Dalmatia, and the Gulf
it self would be abandoned; and if they should divide them, all parts would be
weak and in danger. It was resolved notwithstanding, that one of the
Commissaries should come with 25 Galleys into the Gulf, and that the other
should tarry with the rest at Corfu, hoping that if Barbarossa should advance,
the doubt of incountring him would cease, and the Galleys from Candia would
quickly arrive, which being fifty in number, and already on their way, hoping
to find the Navigation safe, by reason of the news, that the plague was fallen
into the Turkish Fleet, so as it could not get from Nigraponte, did afterward
return back, hearing that Barbarossa was with his whole Fleet in the waters of
Zante. The Turks did no injury to the Venetians in this their voyage.
Barbarossa affirming, that he would keep Truce with them, but that the Emperor
not being therein comprehended, he was not bound to keep from besieging Castle
Nuovo, which was possessed, and kept by the Imperialists: but meeting with an
armed Vessel, which brought Soldiers and Victuals to Napoli di Romagna, and
Lorenzo Sanuto's person, who went Consul to Napoli; they did not any ways
molest them, yet Commissay Contarini, tarrying at Corfu with some few Galleys,
did for their greater security, cause some Cable Ropes with their Anchors, to
be fastened to some Rafters; wherewith securing so much of an Arm of the Sea as
might receive his Galleys, he provided against any sudden violence of the
Enemy. The Spaniards being affrighted at the coming of the Fleet, and at the
Turks great preparations, began to consent to the putting of Castle Nuovo into
the Venetians hands, which they had formerly upon various pretenses denied to
do; which Proposition being made to the Senate, they answered, That the offer
was now made out of season; that they had oftentimes been earnest with them, to
observe their Capitulations, whereby that Town was to have been delivered up to
them: that now when they had been enforced by great necessity, and had
proceeded so far in the treaty of Peace, it became them not to do any thing
that might disturb it. Barbarossa this mean while pursuing his way, came in
the beginning of August, with 90 Galleys, and 30 fly-Boats, to the Gulf of
Catarro, where casting Anchor so far off the Fort of Castle Nuovo, as that he
might not be offended by the Artillery thereof; he landed his men safely, and
80 pieces of Artillery of several sorts; and Ulmana, Sangiacco of that
Province, came thither almost at the same time, with great store of Foot and
Horse, which incampt themselves about the Town: the Enemy not being long able
to hinder them, though at first they sallyed boldly forth to disturb their
Works. The Turks began to play upon the Town on three sides. Barbarossa took
the care of that battery which was on the North-side, Ulamane ordered an other,
and Salecco attended on that which was toward the Sea, so as by perpetual
shot, they beat down the walls even to the ground: and the Fort, not being
environed with a ditch, and therefore the Town which stands somewhat high,
being exposed to the shot of Cannon, when the walls were beaten down, and
wanting earth to make new Trenches; the Houses were battered and beaten down,
so as no place in the Town being safe, many Soldiers were slain, and the Enemy
meeting with but little opposition, drew nearer the wall, and possessed
themselves of a Bastion, under which the Spaniards dispairing of all other
means, had made a mine; but when they set fire unto this their last remedy, it
was so late in playing, as the Turks had opportunity of escaping the danger,
and the ruins falling inwards, slew many of the defendants. The Spaniards had
also made a mine in another part, where they thought the assault would be most
dangerous; but the Turks being advertised thereof by a fugitive Soldier,
forbore approaching the place of danger: wherefore the Soldiers being
discouraged, seeing all their labor and industry prove vain, resolved to give
over defending the Town, and to retreat into the Castle: the Captain Ario
Maceno, entering thereinto, with some other Captains, and with about 800
Soldiers: But Captain Sarmento preferring a glorious, though an assured death,
before a dishonorable uncertain hope of safety, kept in the Town with some
select companies of Soldiers; where having for a while valiantly withstood the
Enemy, being at last overborn by their numbers, he and all his soldiers were
cut in pieces: and those who were within the Fort, considering they could not
make long resistance against so many men, yielded not long after upon
discretion. Barbarossa having given them his word, that their lives and
liberties should be saved: Yet as soon as they surrendered, he made them all be
put to the Oar, alleging that their persons belonging as prey to the
Ianisaries, he could not dispose of them otherwise; so as of the 4000
Spaniards, who had the custody of that place, not one of them escaped away
free, some of them being slain, some made slaves, paying finally for the so
many wickednesses which they had committed in their many years fighting in
Italy, and particularly when Rome was sacked. Castle Nuovo being regained, the
Army marched toward Risano, which was presently surrendered by the Keeper
thereof, Luigi Zane, the Fort nor Garrison not being able to defend it.
Barbarossa had first demanded the restitution of that place from Iovan Matteo
Bembo, Governor of Cattaro, with whom he had sought many occasions to turn his
Forces upon Cattaro; and after many complaints, as that his fugitive slaves
were therein received, and other feigned things, he laid aside all
consideration of Truth, and sent shamelesly to the Governor, to deliver up
Cattaro unto him, or that otherwise he would take it by force, having
commission from Soliman to take that Fort, and whatsoever else the Seignory
possessed upon those confines; that therefore to avoid utter ruin, he should by
time provide for the safety of himself, and of those people; for he would give
free leave to all that would, to go from thence, and would deal civilly with
them who would continue and live under the Empire of the most happy Grand
Seigneur. But Bembo, not at all terrified at this unexpected demand, betook
himself diligently to prepare for defense, and to encourage the Citizens and
Soldiers, and returned answer to Barbarossa, that he himself did, and all the
world would wonder at this his demand, which being contrary to reason, must be
believed to be contrary to Solimans mind, who was wont to observe his word;
that therefore he deserved not to be listened unto, and that therefore he did so
much the more confide in the justice of his cause; and that he should be able
to defend that City which was committed to his charge by his Commonwealth: To
which Barbarossa returning no answer, he made a squadron of his Galleys
advance, who rashly accosting the Fort, wereby the Artillery beaten off with
much prejudice. Barbarossa coming on the second day with the rest of his Fleet,
was likewise beaten off; and having landed many of his Foot at some distance
from the Fort, they who kept on the Mountains side, being got very near the
walls, were so damnified, and disordered by some pieces of Artillery from the
Castle, as they soon retreated to their Galleys: And some of the Stradiotti and
Harchabusiers on horseback, went out against the rest, who marched toward
that part of the Town where the Church and the Monastery of S. Francis stands,
and with whom Barbarossa's self came to discover the situation, slew many of
them, and forced the rest to fly, and save themselves in the neighboring
mountains, where the Horse could not pursue them. Barbarossa having well viewed
and considered the Fort, and the defendants readiness, and therefore
dispairing to gain it, after having tarryed one day longer there, without
attempting any thing, resolved to be gone, and to return to the Gulphs mouth:
And before his departure, being thereunto desired by Bembo, he spoke with
Ierollim^ Cocco, Master of a Ship, sent to him to that purpose, whom he civilly
treated, though contrary to the custom of that Nation, he refused the Presents
which he brought him. At this meeting, Barbarossa appeared to be
friendly-minded, saying, that he was satisfied with having recovered the places
which had been taken from the Grand Seigneur; and that he intended to observe
the Truce, unless he should receive some order to the contrary from
Constantinople, whither he had sent an Olacco, to give an account of what he
had done: things tending to the preservation of the honor of his Fleet, and of
the Army, as if he had willingly quitted that enterprise, and not out of
despair of success. Thus the Soldiers, and the Artillery being embarked, and
a good Garrison left in Castle Nuovo, the Turkish Fleet departed from the Gulf
of Cattaro on the 17th of August; and it was believed, that they were to go to
Puglia, to pillage those maritime parts, being solicited so to do by Cantelmi;
one who was sent from the King of France to Constantinople, and by the French
Ambassador, who was aboard those Galleys: yet Barbarossa being come to Vallona,
went straight from thence to Corfu, where passing through the Channel, he was
by way of friendship saluted by Cannon-shot from the Fort, and diverse were sent
to him from the Governors of the Town with refreshments, and some vestures,
which he gratefully accepted, and returned thanks for the present. And
Barbarossa often assured them, that as he for certain accidents which had
happened, had advised the undertaking of that War; so now he would use his
endeavors in procuring peace, to which end he would go to Constantinople as
soon as he could. The Venetians were much troubled to hear of the taking of
Castle Nuovo, and of Barbarossa's attempt upon the Fort of Cattaro; their Fleet
being divided, and fearing lest the Enemy growing more bold, might make some
other attempt upon their State.

When the Turks played upon Castle Nuovo, Andrea Doria, who was parted from
Sicily, went to Catopo; from whence he sent word to Commissary Cont^rini, who
was at Corfu; that it was now a very fit time to fall upon the Enemy, whilst
having abandoned their Galleys, they were busied in besieging Castle Nuovo,
wherefore he invited him to join their Fleets together: To the which the
Commissary, that he might sift into his mind, answering, that he would be ready
to relieve Castle Nuovo, or to do any thing else, if all their Forces might
join safely, with assured hopes of advantage: Doria returned no answer at all,
nor did offer to attempt any thing of himself, but stood retired in the Haven
of Brandizzi, in which time the Ambassador Contarino came to Constantinople,
where he had Audience given him by the Grand Seigneur: and whilst he was
declaring his commission, Soliman held still his hand upon his breast, (a sign,
as his men said, of his being troubled); but howsoever, having given full
hearing, he told him, He was welcome; but as for the business, said nothing,
but that (according to custom) he referred him to his Basshaws: with whom when
he met, and began more particularly to unfold his Commission, as soon as they
heard any mention made of restoring the places which had been taken in this
War: they presently answered, That not any mention must be made thereof; that
Soliman was mightily troubled for many accidents which had happened, but
especially for the League made by the Commonwealth with the Emperor against
him; that therefore it would not only be impossible to work him to such a
restitution, but that there was no hopes of obtaining peace, without the
surrender of Napoli, and Malves^a, together with all that was possessed by the
Commonwealth on the Seacoast of Constantinople, even to Castle Nuovo; whereby
all occasion of scandal would be taken away for the time to come, and a good
and steadfast Peace would be established. That they did also demand satisfaction
for the great expenses which Soliman had been at in that War, since he had been
enforced thereunto by many injuries; wherein his end was not avarice, but his
honor, the Commonwealth having done the like in their agreement with the
Emperor, a more petty and less powerful Prince then Soliman. The Ambassador
being far from complying with them in any of these demands, answered, That then
the business was a^ an end; that the Commonwealth would be so far glad of
peace, and no further then she might have it consistent with her dignity, the
which she would always with her Forces maintain and defend: yet that he being
but a servant of the State, neither could, nor would say any more, but that he
would give an account of all to the Senate; and therefore desired that any
further treaty might be suspended, till he might receive further commission
from the Senate. The Basshaws wished him to hope well of the business, some of
them saying, that the Grand Seigneur would be content with less then he
demanded; and that it was the custom of the Country to make large demands:
they therefore advised him to return back to Venice himself in person, where
he might inform his Masters of every particular, and then return to a new
Treaty, the rather, for that his return would be just at the time of solemnity
of the Grand Seigneur's Daughters marriage, and of the circumcising of his
Sons. Contarini hearing this, though so long a voyage, and such delay might
seem unseasonable for his so great Age, and for the importancy of the business
in hand; yet thinking that to tarry longer at the Court, after this dismission,
would be to make the Turks believe, that all their desires should be granted,
he resolved to be gone, having first been very diligent in giving the Senate an
account of every particular that had past. It was observed that at his
departure, he had not received the usual banquet, nor had been treated either
in words or actions, with any signs of honor and good will, as was shown unto
him at first.

The Senate was very much troubled at the news of their Embassador's departure
from Constantinople, and at the discovery of greater difficulties in the
Agreement then they expected: it was too fore a thing for them to maintain War
of themselves alone, against so powerful an Enemy: their hopes grounded upon
assistance from others, had always proved weak, and to little purpose, and
were now by these treaties fallen almost away to nothing, to accept of peace
upon such unreasonable terms, would detract too much from the dignity of the
Commonwealth, and to part willingly with Towns and Moneys, would be but to
invite the Enemy who were naturally insolent, to make yet further demands.
Whilst they were yet unresolved what to do, new accidents happened, which made
them still more irresolute: for in this interim, Caesare Cantelmi came to
Venice, who being formerly sent, as has been said from the King of France to
Soliman, to treat of Truce, after having been in France to inform the King,
returned by his order to Constantinople, about the same business. The French
Ambassador being in the College, said, How that this man was sent to
Constantinople, chiefly for the Commonwealths service, to interpose himself
in the Treaty of peace, wherefore he was come to Venice, to see what commission
they would give him concerning it, he being commanded by his King to carry
himself therein, as he would do in any thing which might particularly concern
the Crown of France. Iovan Francesco Valerio, a Gentleman of Venice, used
afterward the same endeavors, who having been long in France, held
intelligence with many chief men of the Court, who did many times impart many
important businesses to him; he witnessed the King's good will, and his
readiness to send other Agents to Soliman, if this man should not give
satisfaction to the Senate; he exhorted them to confide in the King's word, and
in the affection he seemed to bear the Commonwealth in this business; that
they had no better way then this, to agree with the Turks with more dignity,
and less danger. It was known also, that at the same time the Emperor, and
the King of France, were to have a meeting, which might be the better had by
the Emperor's journey, who being to pass into Flanders, to suppress the
insurrection of those of Guant, and to oppose some commotions in that Province,
occasioned by the daily grievances laid by Caesar upon those Inhabitants for
maintenance of the War, had sent unto the King, that he would come by France,
and speak with him touching some agreement between them, whereby they might
afterward wage War jointly against the Turks. This meeting of these Princes,
occasioned variety of discourse, and administered many reasons to maintain
several opinions. Some argued from hence* That the War was to be maintained
with better hopes, that all thoughts of peace which was treacherously proposed
by the Turks, were to be laid aside, since peace was not to be had but upon
hard conditions. That it was peace between these two Princes, which was always
thought would give life to the League, and would be the chief groundwork of
all good success: that they were not to abandon themselves and all their
hopes, and make themselves a prey to the persidious Enemies, now that a thing
so much desired was coming on. Others were jealous that at this meeting,
somewhat prejudicial to the liberty of Italy, and in particular of the
Commonwealth, might be treated of: which suspicion having been formerly had,
when these Princes parting from Nice, without meeting together in the Popes
presence, did afterward parley together in France; it was, though this
jealousy proved vain, only because that Caesar would not trust the King of
France, and deliver the state of Millan first up to him, upon his promise of
being assisted by him, in getting the Cities belonging to the Venetians
Dominion. That it was now sufficiently known, neither of these Princes would
part with anything that was theirs, so as they could not be brought to
Agreement by any other means, then by thinking how to make recompense, which
should fall unto them by the usurpation of other men's estates. It was therefore
judged for these important respects, that the Agreement with the Turks was the
more to be hastened, for that the deferring thereof, and the divulging of the
consultations of the Christian Princes, whereby they should be the more
necessitated to listen to peace, would make the conditions of the Treaty prove
the harder afterward. But herein likewise there was a difference of Opinion:
some persuaded to make use of Cantelmi 's voyage, and of the Kings offer,
alleging, that he being full of various thoughts, it was to be hoped that his
desire of regaining the ancient friendship of the Commonwealth, so to separate
her from Caesar, might be predominant with him: And that as on the one side,
the interposition and authority of so great a Prince, might advantage them much
in their making Agreement with the Turks: so on the other side, they might
secure the affairs of the State by Land from other dangers, since by this
confidence his desire of convening with Caesar, would be cooled. That they
ought not totally to alienate the minds of Christian Princes, there not
appearing as yet, any certain hopes of renewing capitulation, and commerce with
the Turks: That it was certain, the Emperor was much offended for their having
negotiated peace apart for the Commonwealth, when they had given out, that
they would not treat of any thing but of the general Truce: and that if they
should now refuse the King of France his offer, the King of France would be as
much offended, since they should thereby seem to value him but a little, and to
be totally alienated from his friendship; which bad satisfaction to both, might
make them join the more easily together against the Commonwealth; that they
ought at least to desire the Kings messenger to treat of Truce in general;
which if it should succeed, the convenience of time, and of some rest, would be
of no small consideration: and as touching the particular affairs of the
Commonwealth, to authorize him to say unto the Turks, that the Senate would
not be backward in making agreement, if it might be had upon fair conditions;
by this means the business would be kept on foot, with the service and honor
of the public; and that if any jealousies should arise of the Kings keeping
his word, and of these new Agreements with the Emperor, we might then resume
the business into our own hands, and that all way of Treaty for us was now
shut up, since their sending away of our Ambassador. Others notwithstanding
proposed, That a dispatch might be forthwith made to the Ambassador Contarini,
willing him to tarry wheresoever the messenger should meet him, and expect new
orders from the Senate, which should be sent according as affairs went. Others
were better pleased, that a new Ambassador should be sent; and some were for
referring the managing of the whole business to Consul Canale, since he was
now at liberty and might negotiate. But all these joined in protesting against,
making use of Canetlmi, or communicating any thing to him in this business,
who was a banished: Neopolitan, and who, to boot with his Kings interests and
ends, which peradventure might not stand with the service of the Commonwealth,
had his own particular designs, which might rather retard then further the
business; that it became neither the public safety nor honor, to discover
the Senate's intention, to one who, as might justly be suspected, would rather
hinder, then help the effecting of it: That Caesar would not leave anything
unattempted to break this treaty of Peace, which was so prejudicial to him,
and that the King of France would be glad to please him in all other things,
out of hopes of having the State of Millan restored: That it stood not well
together, that the King of France (as he affirmed) should make peace with the
Emperor, to make war against the Turks, and be a means of making peace between
the Venetians, and the same Enemies. What faith could be adhibited to the words
or endeavors of a King, that was ill satisfied with the Commonwealth, for
having secured the state of Millan to Caesar, by their last confederacy, and
hindered him from what he so much desired? That they had been in vain brought by
the promises of other Princes, to undertake and continue this War, wherein they
had to no purpose spent 3 millions of Gold. That they might now be clearly
aware of those counsels which sprung from passion, and were bent upon peculiar
interests; and not to put themselves into away which might bring the
Commonwealth to ruin, by continuing involved in so great and insupportable
expenses. An other accident of no less concernment was hereunto added, which
increased the doubts and difficulties. The Harvest was this year very bad every
where, and chiefly in Italy; so as the City of Venice, which wanting sufficient
Territories of her own, was to feed a great number of people with Corn fetched
from other Countries, was chiefly incommodiated hereby. The people who were
wont to feed deliciously, and to eat no bread but what was made of wheat, were
glad of any sort of Corn, and in danger to want that too, if they were not
furnished from foreign parts; a thing which gave the Senators much trouble, so
as to supply so great a necessity, some thought it necessary to make friendship
with the Turks: Others, to have recourse to the Spaniards, to have Corn
transported either from the one or from the other: the same thing susteyning
contrary opinions. Thus the time ran on without any certain resolution, so as
the Ambassador Contarini receiving no new instructions, came to Venice, and
Cantelmi departed without any Commission.

These irresolute Counsels made Caesar, who watched all occasions, hope he
should be able to break this Treaty of Peace, and to draw the Venetians to
confirm the League once more: wherefore thinking that nothing could more
further his intentions, then to make it be believed that he held good
intelligence with the King of France, whereby being free from so many
impediments, he might employ all his Forces in the Levant, and make the King of
France at last favor the design; he resolved to send a principal personage to
Venice, and persuaded the King of France to do the like, who might give an
account of the speech which they should have together, and discover somewhat of
the Venetians mind: therefore on the 10th of December the Marquis of Guasto,
who was then Governor of Millan, went to Venice, on the Emperor's behalf; and
Monsieur Anibao, who was Marshall General in Piemont, on the behalf of the
King of France. These were received with such honor, as became the greatness
of the Princes that sent them, and their own eminent quality. They were met by
a great many Senators, in the Butcentauro, and in other 7 Galleys; were lodged
in a noble Palace, and defrayed at the public charge. Their first audience was
in the great Hall, whither the great Council came, and a great concourse of
people, wherein nothing past but complements: But afterward, at a private
audience in the College, the Marquis of Guasto told them, That he was come in
the name of Charles the Emperor, to acquaint them, as good and well esteemed
friends, of the meeting which the Emperor was to have in France, with the most
Christian King, and in Flaunders, with King Ferdinando his brother, and the
Queen his sister, who were the Governors of those States. He told them, that
at the meeting of these Princes, businesses were to be treated of, which
concerned the joint service of Christendom, and the particular convenience of
that Commonwealth, which he would always value, as that of his own proper
Dominions. That Caesar, being now to go with great Forces against the Turks, did
desire to know, what the Senate's pleasure and opinion was therein, what
preparations they thought would be necessary, and what they would do on their
behalfs, to the end that he might the better know, how to govern his affairs.
That though the Peace with France was not yet fully established, it might be
accounted as good as done; so well were these Princes inclined thereunto, and
so good intelligence was there held between them; so as it was firmly to be
believed, that being free from all other impediments, they would go with their
joint Forces to ruin the Infidells. But because the weightinesse of the
business required length of time, and the season was now far spent, for making
so great preparations, Caesar thought it would for the present be better, to
provide for defense, then for offense; wherein he would be as careful of his
neighbors Dominions, as of his own. Monsieur d' Anibao spoke afterward to the
same purpose, attesting the King's good will and desire to the peace and good
of Christendom. It was not hard to know, whither these endeavors tended, and
what was Caesar's true designs; to wit, to hold the French in hand with vain
hopes, of yielding up the Dukedom of Millan unto them; and the Venetians, by
proposing Treaties, and great preparations for War against the Turks, meaning
nothing less; that so he might spin out the time, secure himself from the
French Forces, by deviating the King from the thought of War; and from the
Turks, by placing the Commonwealth's Territories, and their Fleet, at his
out-Bulwarks. This answer was therefore made to the Marquis, and to Anibao,
That their coming was very acceptable, in respect of the Princes, in whose
names they came, as also in respect of themselves. Wherefore they desired, that
many thanks might be returned to their Princes, for the honor and esteem they
bore to the Commonwealth. That the news of good intelligence, and of certain
hopes of peace between so great Princes, was the more acceptable to all, for
the great benefit that all Christendom was likely to receive thereby. For what
concerned the declaring of their intentions, upon the present occasions, it
might be sufficiently known by their actions, since they had so readily taken
up Arms at first, had often since refused all proposalls of Agreement, never
spared for any expense, or re^used to expose themselves to any danger; and had
already, for their parts, constantly and stoutly sustained the weight of so
great a War, these three years last past. That being now invited by these
hopes, they would outdo what they had done. That it ought notwithstanding to
be considered, that they should not be able long of themselves, to withstand so
potent an Enemy. Therefore what could they say more? the necessity was
sufficiently known. That it was known, Barbarossa was with 80 Sail in the Gulf
of Lepanto, intending (as it was said) to Winter there: So as if the Fleets
were not in readiness to hinder his designs, by February next, it might
easily be seen, in what danger the Dominions of the Commonwealth would be, and
consequently, what evils threatened Christendom. To all which things,
convenient regard was to be had, and fitting remedies prepared. This no-direct
answer was thought to suite best with the quality of the proposal, and the
condition of time: So as without tying themselves to any particular Treaty,
Caesar's, and the King's Agents, were thus dismissed.

But the jealousy, which the meeting of these two Princes had begot in the
Pope, who complained, that it was made without his participation, was much
increased, by these men's coming to Venice; not that he did any ways doubt the
Commonwealth's loyalty, she being to run the same fortune with the Apostolic
Sea: But fearing, le^t under these seeming shows of honor and esteem, some
important plot might be hidden (as had been formerly) against the liberty of
Italy. He therefore often minded the Venetians, that a good understanding
between the Church and the Commonwealth, was now more necessary then ever; and
that for his part, he would do what was possible to keep all danger off. Caesar
being aware of these the Pope's suspicions, and fearing, lest his being
unsatisfied might disturb his designs, sent speedily Luigi Davila to Rome, and
got the King of France to send Monsieur di Gue, to acquaint the Pope with the
meeting which was to be had in France, and to justify their proceedings:
Wherewith the Pope being either really satisfied, or thinking it made for him
to appear to be so, resolved to send his nephew, Cardinal Fernese into France,
that, as his Legate, he might be assistant at this Convention, might further
the conclusion of Peace, and might proffer the Pontifical Authority, and all
the Treasure of the Church, for any enterprise against the Infidells. The
Venetian Senate likewise, to correspond with like love and respect, toward so
great Princes, resolved to send Antonio Capello, and Vicenzo Grimani, both of
them being Procurators of St. Mark, as their Ambassadors, to where the meeting
was to be, whose Commission was, To thank Caesar, and the most Christian King,
for their love and esteem showed to the Commonwealth, for communicating their
intentions by such honorable personages. That they should signify their
approbation thereof, and excite them to provide against the dangers of
Christendom. And that they should excuse their having sent an Ambassador to
Constantinople, as done out of necessity, since they had not sufficient Forces,
to resist so potent Enemies; nor time (as was confessed by Caesar's self) to
prepare sufficiently for War; and that they had done it, to hold the enemy in
hand, and to gain time the better, to effect what they should undertake. There
came likewise at this time, an Ambassador from the King of Hungary to Venice,
to propound a straiter intelligence with the Commonwealth, and a particular
obligation for the common defense of their State. He exhorted them likewise, to
continue their Treaty of Peace with the Turks; for that Caesar would never come
to agreement with the King of France, as long as he might have the States of
the Commonwealth, and of the King of Hungary, for his out-Bulworks against the
Turks. They returned thanks to the King for this advice, without proceeding as
then to any Treaty. But the Pope, though he offered his Forces to maintain the
War; and exhorted the Senate not to be wanting, in making all possible
provision for the preservation of his State, and for the defense of
Christendom: Yet did he not totally conceal his jealousy of the Imperialists,
and the little hope he had of their assistance. He often affirmed, that, as he
was certain, that wise Senate would never make agreement with the Turks,
unless enforced by necessity; so if that should happen, he could not but
commend them, for complying with time and necessity. This afforded occasion for
such as desired peace, to fortify their reasons, which the transporting of
Corn from many of the Turkish Dominions, did much more, whereby the City was
supplied in her great need; and this was much amplified by the popularity,
comparing it with the actions of their friends, who contrary to the express
Articles of confederacy, forbad any portage of corn out of Sicely, and did
afterward mightily enhaunse the price, when the Fleets and City was in great
want. At the same time, information was given by Letters, from the Consul at
Constantinople, that great Festivalls were preparing there, upon occasion of
the grand Signieurs daughters marriage, to Rusten, and of the circumcision of
two of his sons: Wherefore it was expected by all, and much desired by many of
the Basshaes, that according to custom, an Ambassador might be sent to that
Court, whereby the Treaty of Peace might be reassumed.

Out of all these respects, and for that they, who at first were hottest for
War, grew less fervent in those desires, their inconveniences increasing, and
their hopes decreasing; the choosing of an Ambassador to send to Solomon, was
again proposed in Senate, and Luigi Badoaro was chosen to that purpose, a
Senator of great authority, and one who had still persuaded the Senate
thereunto, offering to take that employment upon himself. His Commission was,
That procuring and assisting the Treaty of Truce in general, which was at
first begun by the Ambassador Contarini, and continued by the King of France
his Agent, he should endeavor for the particular service of the Commonwealth,
to procure the restitution of all such places, as had been taken by the Turks
in that War; which if he could not obtain, he should notwithstanding proceed
on, to conclude the Agreement, upon the renewing of the ancient Articles, as
Contarini had formerly been ordered to do. And he had leave given him, to
charge the Towns of Napoli, and Malvesia, with five or six thousand Ducats,
and to promise thirty thousand Ducats, to re-imburse the expenses, which the
Turks had been at in the War. This was the Senate's order. But the Council of
Ten, which at this time had the supreme Authority, in treating of the
weightiest, and most important affairs of State, without communicating it to
the Senate, to the end that the business might be carried more secretly, and
with less contention amongst a few, added a larger Commission; to wit, That if
he should see the conclusion of Peace grow otherwise desperate, he might
totally yield up the Cities of Napoli and Malvesia. For these, who were the
antientest, and most experienced Senators, knew how grievous and insupportable,
the expense of the War grew daily. That Napoli and Malvesia were seated far
off, and therefore hard to be relieved, and that they lay very fit to be taken
by the Turks; that they had several times already been in much danger, for
want of many things, and had already fallen into the enemies hands, had not the
Truce preserved them. That the Commonwealth was at this time badly besteaded
by Fortune; that therefore it would be wisely done, to throw somewhat
overboard, though never so dear, to bring the rest safe into the Haven, free
from the storms of this most dangerous War. That it was an assured rule,
confirmed by long experience, that Treaties had with the Turks, were much
prejudiced by length of time, and that the protracting of business, made the
conclusion more difficult.

These things were the products of the end of this year. In the beginning of
the next, 1540. the Emperor came to Paris, on the sixth of January, where he
was received with all demonstrations of honor and humanity by the King,
whereunto the Emperor corresponding in all things, labored to make all men
believe, that he had cancelled the memory of all things past; that he had no
thoughts, but of honor and peace; and that he was much joyed, to be with the
King. He bestowed the Order of the Golden Fleece upon the Dolphin, and upon the
Duke of Orleance, the Kings sons and his nephews. Here Christophoro Capello,
who was then Ambassador from the Commonwealth at Paris, acquainted both these
Princes with the Senate's answer to the Marquis of Guasto, and to the Marshall
Anibao. The Emperor's reply was: That though he was very well minded, and
resolved to make War upon the Turks, yet he was so straightened in time, as he
knew not how to do, what the Senate desired, and what he himself knew
requisite, to put a Fleet in order so soon, and so numerous, as might confront
the enemy. That therefore it would be better as then, to intend the ending of
the general Truce, already begun by the most Christian King. That they might
have opportunity to raise Forces, convenient for great enterprises, with better
hopes of good effect. But that in the mean while, according to his promise, he
would do all he could for the safety of their States by Sea. The King of
France, having made new attestation of his good will, said: That he would make
it be known to all the world, that he never had any intention to disturb the
common good of Christendom, but that he was ready to embrace all love and
friendship with Caesar, that so a more useful and necessary War might be
undertaken: But that none of these things were now to be treated of, to keep
from mixing weightier matters, wherein diversity of opinions, and difficulties
might arise, amongst the present festivalls and mirth. Therefore all business
was put off, till the meeting at Flanders. These words of the Emperor, and of
the King of France, being by Letters from the Ambassador Capello, related to
the Senate, were thought to consist much upon generalities, and that no
foundation could thereout be made, neither of peace amongst themselves, nor of
war against the Turks. Wherefore they all resolved to mind the Treaty of
Peace; and the Ambassador Badoaro, whilst he was on his journey, was desired
by Letters, to execute what he had in commission, as soon as he should be
arrived, and to obtain some firm conclusion, whereby the affairs of the
Commonwealth might be secured. It being thought, that when the news of union
between these two Princes, should come to Constantinople, as it might
facilitate the agreement with the Turks, so when it should soon prove vain, it
would detract from the reputation of the affairs of Christendom, and make
those Barbarians more haughty and insolent. Badoaro having soon dispatched his
journey, came about the midst of April to Constantinople, and began to treat
according as he was commanded, with the Bashaws, making use of the French
Ambassadour's advice. Great difficulties arose at the first beginning of the
Treaty; not that the Turks were averse to peace, but for that having notice of
Badoaro's more secret Commissions, growing more insolent, by reason of the
fear, and the desire of peace which they found to be in the Venetians, and out
of the certainty of obtaining whatsoever they should desire, they soon
protested, that they would not hear any thing, till such time as the Islands,
in the Archipelagus, and Padino, and Lawrana, which were formerly possessed by
them, should be freely restored unto them; as also the Cities of Napoli and
Malvesia, and that they should be re-imburst for their expense in the War. At
which so sudden and pertinacious demands, the Ambassador being struck with
consternation, and beginning to suspect what he found to be true, he delayed
the business a while, not being resolved what to do. On the one side, he was
spurred on by his Commissions, and reiterated desires, to conclude the Peace;
on the other side, he was withheld, by thinking, that by continuing the Treaty,
the Turks might be encouraged with hopes, of obtaining all they desired. Having
by reason of these doubts, past over some days in silence, Barbarossa, who was
desirous that the Peace should be made, and was willing to further it,
persuaded him not to give over the Treaty, whereunto though he saw some more
hopeful way was opened, yet found he not the Basha's minds any whit mollified:
So as he was brought by degrees to assent to all those things, which were
reserved for the last and most desperate remedy; to wit, To yield up together,
with the Towns already possessed, the Cities of Napoli and Malvesia, and to pay
300000 Ducats in the space of three years, for the expenses of War. For what
remained, the former Capitulations were renewed and confirmed, with many
particulars, which concerned the good establishment of the Peace, the removing
all occasions of injuries on all sides, the maintaining of free and safe
commerce between the subjects on all parts, and the securing of Navigation in
all Seas. When the news of this Agreement came to Venice, though the thing it
self was much desired by all, the City being reduced to a very low condition,
by reason of the War and dearth, and in a condition of being restored by Peace;
yet when the particulars were understood, it was not so very welcome: many
blamed the purchasing of peace at so dear a rate, others blamed the
Embassador's too great fear, who had suffered himself to be brought at the
Turks first demands, to the ultimate terms reserved for the last and desperate
remedy. But these first commotions ceasing, and the state of affairs being more
maturely considered, and the true reasons, which had moved those wise Senators,
who do always watch over the welfare of the Commonwealth, to pitch upon this
resolution, all were satisfied, and their wisdom praised. And the treachery of
some perfidious men coming afterward to light, Badoaro's reputation was
salved. The business went thus.

Amongst others, Constantino, and Nicolo Cavazi, the one as Secretary to the
Consiglio di Dieci; the other, the like to that of the Pegadi, were admitted
into the secret Counsels; as also Ma^teo Leone, as one of the College, being
a Savio di Terra ferma; (he who held this place, was then admitted into both
these Councels). These men receiving an annual stipend from the King of
France, communicated all the important affairs of the Commonwealth unto him.
Agostino Abondio, had likewise a hand in this business, and Iovan Francisco
Valerio, mentioned before, born of a noble Family, but not in lawful wedlock,
who held somewhat of Church-living in France, both which the King had corrupted
with many gifts, that they might serve him upon such an occasion: it so fell
out, as Ierolimo Martelosso, who kept Libidenus commerce with Abondio's unchaste
wife, found some of Nicolo Cavaza's Notes in his house; and finding that they
contained some stare-affairs in them, he carried them to the Council of Ten,
wherein many things being searched into, the whole treason was at last
discovered. Whereupon Nicolo Cavaza, Abondio, and Valerio, betook themselves
for sanctuary to the French Embassador's house, but it being soon known,
Officers were sent to apprehend them, and after long resistance made, two
pieces of Cannon being brought in a Bark, to beat down the house, the Traitors
were delivered up into the hands of Justice, and were hanged on a Gallows in
St. Marks Piatsa. Constantino, Cavazza, and Matteo Leone, got away into some
place of safety, and a sum of Money was set upon their heads in what Country
soever they should be found. No news was ever heard of Cavaza; but Leone went
to live in France, where meeting with no favor at Court, and failing of all
assistance, he taught a Grammer-School, that he might have whereby to live, and
his posterity was for ever deprived of Nobility. The King seemed to rescent the
violence which was used to his Embassador's house, which made him that for some
months he would not give audience to the Venetian Ambassador: but being one
day in the Camp before Perpegnano, giving place at last to reason, and desirous
to know news from Constantinople, he sent for him; he complained modestly, and
with a seeming mind to be reconciled of the violation used to his Embassado'rs
house, saying, What would you think, if I should deal so with you? To which the
Ambassador Veniero readily answered, I wish it were Gods will, that I had any
of your Majesty's Rebels in my house, or in my power, I would seize on them my
self, and bring them to your Majesty; which should I not do, I should be
severely reprehended by the Signory.

Whilst these Treaties of Peace were in hand, though the General Mocenico was
abroad with a good many Galleys, yet was there nothing done which might
unseasonably disturb the hopes of Agreement. But the General understanding
that Dragute was about the Islands of Zante, committing Piracy with many sail,
he went thitherward to meet with him, and to fight him; who having a good wind,
and kenning our ships, steered another course to save himself, and not daring
to return any more into those Seas, went westward, where he and eight of his
ships were taken by Gioanetino Doria. When the peace was concluded, he went to
Napoli, and to Romania, before he went to Dalmatia to disarm, to acquaint,
those pople with what had past at Constantinople, and with the States
resolution to deliver up those Cities to the Turks. The news was very unwelcome
to them; they were equally afflicted with tarrying, and with going away: to
tarry and live under the tyranny of the Turks, was the more grievous to them,
for their having lived so long under the moderate Jurisdiction of the
Commonwealth; and for ever to abandon their Country, their Goods, Houses, and
their ancestors Bones, was a sorrow insufferable: wherefore the General, when
those of Napoli were assembled together in the Piazza, somewhat to comfort
them, spoke thus unto them.

You may clearly enough conceive by that paternall love, with which our
Commonwealth did at first receive you into her protection, and has thus long
graciously governed you, what I have now by public order to say unto you, and
which has already come unto your ear; which is, That the assignment of this
City, and of the neighbor City Malvesia, over to Soliman, by the agreement
made at Constantinople, was a resolution put on by necessity, not by choice.
You may have known, upon many occasions, but chiefly in these your last
troubles, wherein to assist you, the Commonwealth readily exposed a great part
of her Forces to great dangers, what love she has always born unto you: She
has furnished you with Moneys, Soldiers, and Victuals, to keep you from
falling into the hands of the Enemy, who threatened to put you all unto the
sword, and to lay your City desolate. Nothing has been left undone to keep
you, her dear and well beloved subjects, from falling into the power of others:
very great Fleets have been prepared, immeasurable expenses: In fine, for this
cause, the weight of an insupportable War has been the longer sustained: And
what greater sign can the Commonwealth show of the affection she bears you in
the present condition of affairs, and in this your afflicted Fortune, then that
which she now does, by promising to give other convenient habitations, where
she might best, to those who shall desire to go from hence, to keep them in her
protection, to assist, savor, and nourish them: It has been said by wise men,
that that place ought to be truly thought a man's owns Country, where a man can
enjoy any good. And what is better, and more to be desired, than to live under
the Go^vernment of a moderte and just Prince? Fortune, though never so averse,
has not been able to bereave you of this: You shall continue under the
Dominion of the Commonwealth; you shall have abodes allotted you in another
Country, where you may live, though not so commodiously as here, yet freer from
the perpetual fear and danger of the Turks; to which it may be said, you were
continually exposed. Many men being too numerous at home, have of their own
choice parted from thence; and committing themselves to fortune, have quitted
their native Country, to get new and uncertain habitations by force of Arms: To
have a safe and certain place of refuge in times of misery, has wont to be so
great a consolation, as greater prosperity has often made men forget what was
past. It Is true, it had been more to be desired, to have still lived in peace,
that the Enemy had never besieged this City, that they had not set their minds
upon subduing it, or in such a case, to have had Forces sufficient to repulse
them, and to revenge injuries: But since neither of these has been either in
our power; or, in yours, in the condition wherein we are; what is there more to
be done, than for us to play the part of a good Prince and Pastor by keeping
your persons in our protection, since we are not able to carry away the walls
and houses of this City; and for you to rejoice at this your Prince his
affection, and to accommodate your selves to Time and Necessity: your persons
shall be preserved, your posterity educated, and you valiant Fathers, shall be
get generous Children. Who knows but that they may work your revenge? Great is
the vicissitude of worldly affairs, and the greatest Empires are as well
subject thereunto as other things. Our Commonwealth will assuredly be always
ready to take up Arms against these Enemies, when there shall be such an union
amongst Christian Princes, as it may behoped Christendom may reap good thereby.
Therefore as it is necessary, so is it wisely and safely done, to seek to
live, and to hope for better things.

Whilst the General spoke, tears fell from all the Auditors eyes, occasioned no
less through tenderness of affection, then through grief. The General used
afterward the like words, with those of Malvesia, whereupon the Inhabitants
being a little comforted, after the sorrow they suffered for so sad news; most
of them prepared to be gone, taking what they had of best along with them, and
soon after, in November, the Articles of Peace being confirmed, Commissary
Contarini went to those shores with 20 Galleys, and many other ships of
several sorts whereinto having taken all the Artillery, Ammunition, Goods,
Soldiers, and persons of those Inhabitants who would depart; He, by Orders
from Constantinople, delivered up the keys of those two Cities to Cassin
Basshaw of Morea, who with some few entered the Towns, and after our men were
gone, the Gates were opened, and free entrance was given to the Soudliers who
were there abouts. Things being thus brought to a peaceful condition, the
General, and the Commissary disarmed, leaving out only the usual number of
Galleys to guard the Gulf, and for the safety of Navigation. But when
Commissary Contarini came to Venice, he was commanded by Pietro Mocenico,
Advocate for the Commons, to come into the Advocate's Court, and give an
account, according to the Senate's Order three years before, of what ^ad happened
at Puglia, when he sunk the Turkish Galley; but the business being argued in
the Senate, and Contarini's cause defended by many of the Senators; the
Advocates command was taken off, and he freed of all fault, the occasions being
ceased, which had made his fault appear the greater, his worth remaining in
him, which had always been commended by all men, and his deserts increased by
the service he had done during all this War. Nicolo da Ponte, pleaded amongst
others in his defense, who speaking often in the Senate, began to be highly
esteemed for his Eloquence, and growing to greater dignity, after many years
employment in the highest concerns of the Commonwealth, is arrived at the
Principality, which he now worthily possesses. The year 1540. brought forth
no other more noble accidents, being memorable enough for the Peace made with
the Turks, wherein the Commonwealth prosperously continued for the space of
thirty years; her affairs in Terra forma, being likewise quiet at the same
time, by her friendship with the Christian Princes, so as I shall have but
little to write of these times; yet because the Senate being made acquainted
with the chief businesses which past between the Christian Princes, interposed
her Counsel and Authority, either in respect of her self or others, I will
relate in this my History such passages of these Times as do appear to me most
memorable, and for some concernments of the Commonwealth, which I have
undertook to write of.

THE Peace being in manner aforesaid established, between Soliman and the
Venetians, all men hoped, that Forces were to cease in all parts amongst
Princes, and that there should be a happy and peaceable time, after so sore
wars. For Soliman seemed very well inclined, to make a long and general Truce
with all Christian Princes, wherein the French Ambassador having labored
much, he said, it was now as good as concluded; and these his speeches were the
rather believed, for that though the Fleet was ready to go forth, yet
Barbarossa's departure was delayed; nor was there any preparation of an Army,
which might occasion jealousy of land-enterprises. Truce was already confirmed
in Paris, between Caesar and the King of France, upon the same terms, as it had
been by the Pope's means, made formerly at Nece, and all demonstrations of
confidence and reconciliation past between them; whilst Caesar taking France in
his way to Flanders, stayed some days with the King, which made men hope, that
these Princes laying aside their ancient enmities, were to join in a good and
secure peace. But new accidents happened, which (as human affairs are subject to
easy alterations) did soon change the face of affairs, and did totally
confound these formerly conceived hopes of quiet. For John King of Hungary
dying, and leaving an infant-son of his, newly born, by his wife Issabella,
daughter to Sigismund King of Polonia; Ferdinando King of the Romans pretended,
that according to the last agreement made with that King, which was, That the
succession of that Kingdom should appertain to him, and not to the son of King
John, raised suddenly a great many Soldiers, wherewith he quickly assailed
the Kingdom, took Alba Regale, Visgrado, Pesto, and some other Towns of
Hungary: And at the same time sent Ierolimo Lasco to Constantinople, to treat
with Soliman, that he might hold that Kingdom upon the same terms, as it was
held by King John. The Queen Dowager, widow to King John, had likewise recourse
to Constantinople, endeavoring by a solemn Embassy, of the prime Barons of
that Kingdom, that the Turks would aid her, in maintaining her son in the
possession of that Kingdom, which was by them preserved unto his father.
Soliman thought himself hereby doubly injured by Ferdinando: First, for having
assaulted a Kingdom recommended to him, and which he had taken into his
protection. And then, that he should demand those things by his Ambassador,
which he howsoever endeavored to get by force. Whereat being much incensed, he
did not only lay aside his former thoughts, and good inclination, which he
seemed to have to peace and quiet, but prepared great forces both by Land and
Sea, to assault the Territories of the House of Austria, that so he might
revenge this injury upon Ferdinando, and keep Charles so busied, as he might
not assist his brother. Wherefore retracting what had been negotiated, with
Antonio Rincone, the French Ambassador, touching the Truce, he resolved to
send him back to his King, that he might acquaint him, how he had changed his
mind, and that his thoughts were now bent upon War.

The Tumults in Flanders were already appeased, which was the sooner effected
by the severe punishment of the rebellion of Guant, to the terror of other
Cities, which being insued, sooner then peradventure suited with the occasion of
Times, and hopes of greater good, was the cause why Caesar, the peace not being
yet fully established, between him and the King of France, finding himself
free of that disturbance, began to fall off from the agreement, and to resolve
not to forgo the Dukedom of Millan upon any terms. And on the other side,
Soliman's being incenst against the House of Austria, made the King o^ France
the bolder, hoping that by those prevalent means he might the better resent the
injury which he thought Caesar did him, in dispising to have peace and
friendship with him. Rincone therefore being returned to Venice, gave a
particular account of all these things to the Senate, highly exaggerating the
Turks preparation for War, hoping thereby to draw them over to side with his
King; and affirming moreover, that when these Forces should move, they should
be disposed of according to his Kings pleasure: He then desired a Convoy of
armed men, that he might return the more safely to France, and accordingly
Mercurio Bua, was ordered to wait upon him with his Troop of light Horse, to
the utmost confines of the Commonwealth: and having only three months
allowed him for his return to Constantinople, he suddenly dispatched his
business with the King, who listened very diligently to the business; and took
his journey again to return by Venice for Constantinople; but being come to
Pavia, as he passed along the Poe, he was slain by some Spanish foot, by order,
as it was conceived, from the Marquess of Guasto, as was also Caesare Fregoso,
who was sent by the King to accompany him. The King of France was more
scandalized hereat then can be imagined, that whilst he was yet in Truce with
the Emperor, his servants should be treacherously slain; and that Caesar not
being contented to have deceived him in his speeches, (for he seemed to be well
minded to peace, and to restore the state of Millan, which he flew daily
further from, when he had appeased the Tumults in Flanders) should, contrary to
reason, and the Law of Nations, do him so great a scorn, and show such a desire
to offend him. He forbore not to mention this his resentment publicly, but
complained grievously thereof by his Ambassadors at all Princes Courts, and in
particular sent Antonio Polino to Soliman, with commission to go first to
Venice, to make known his intentions toward Caesar, and the reasons he had to
study a just revenge, making offer of all his endeavors and authority in such
things wherein he might be serviceable to the Commonwealth, at Constantinople,
whither he was sent Ambassador, and demanding a safe Convoy for that Journey,
he had a Gallie allotted him, to wait upon him to Ragugi. But Caesar, when the
great preparations of the Turks was given out for certain; nay when their men
were already upon their March toward Hungary, after he had long entertained
himself in the Diet at Ratisbone, in treating of diverse things about Religion,
wherein nothing was concluded, prepared to go himself in person into Italy:
his end therein not being known, and being much wondered at by all men: It not
being thought reasonable, (though it were so ^^ven out) that he was to fall
upon Algiers, in the waters of Africa; that whilst his brothers danger, the
honor of his family, and of the German Nation, ought to have recalled him back
unto Germany, he should go to attempt an enterprise, which though it might be
of some convenience to his Kingdom of Spain, to bereave the Pirates, who
invested those Seas of that receptacle, was not notwithstanding to be compared
to the purchasing of a noble Kingdom at home, and to the safety which his other
States and Empire might receive, by keeping the Turkish Forces from off those
confines: yet he persisting in his intention, sent a great number of Foot into
Italy, and made great preparation of shipping of all sorts, in diverse shores of
his Dominions.

Thus stood the condition of affairs at this time; these were the designs of
Princes concerning Peace and War. Wherefore in these great Commotions, the
Venetians thought it became them, to proceed with great vigilance and
circumspection, keeping the Commonwealth in her neutrality, and free from all
offense. They knew that the hazards of Hungary, was the more to be thought of
by them, for that by the eminent loss of that Kingdom, the Forces of the
Turks, who were the common and perpetual enemy, would be much increased, which
were already so potent and so near to the Commonwealths Dominions. And what
hopes were there of any good success? King Ferdinando was too weak of himself,
to oppose the Turkish Armies; The Emperor was not over-ready to try his
fortune against the Turks, in the behalf of his Brother; Germany would be far
from favoring any enterprise, whereby the Authority and power of the House of
Austria might be increased, a thing which she did very much detest, and
apprehend. And on the other side, Queen Isabella was a woman, a widow, the King
her Son an Infant, ill provided to defend that Kingdom, and in necessity not
only to make use of the Turks aid, but of depending totally upon them; and yet
though the Venetians knew these things, and thought seriously on them, they
were necessitated, much to their grief and sorrow, by reason of their late
trial of the Christian Princes weakness, and discords, not only to stand
idly looking upon all these mischiefs, but to shun giving the Turks any
occasion of taking up Arms against the Commonwealth, or of thinking that they
stood not well-affected toward them. Wherefore being desired by the Pope, that
the Council (as was formerly agreed upon at the Convention at Luca, between him
and the Emperor, and by the assent of the Venetians) might be held in Vicenza
the next ensuing year, which was the year 1542. they thought that to give way
thereunto, at a time when Leagues and Agreements were in agitation, would not
suit well with their convenience and quiet; and therefore they excused
themselves in that point, since the face of affairs was altered by their new
Agreement made with the Turks; and their condition become different from what
it was when they first promised it, and were at open War with the Turks; for it
was clear, that the meeting of the Council, not only in their State, but so
near Venice, would beget an assured and unexcusable jealousy in Soliman, that
they had endeavored to make the Chri^^^an Princes conspire against him, which
would be to draw great ruin upon themselves, out of an uncertain hope of good;
and that many of the prime Prelates knew, that it was a very unseasonable time
to assemble the Council now, when they should first intend the reconciling
of the Princes, and of repairing Christendoms prejudice received by the Turkish
Forces. But these respects were added unto, by other accidents; for many
things had been said at Constantinople, to make it be believed that the
Venetians would not keep peace longer then some opportunity of breaking it
should be offered: And it having happened, that two Turkish Galleys, as they past
from Barbary to Constantinople, being suspected by their flying away at the
sight of our Galleys, to be Pirates, were taken by the Commissary at Sea, most
of the Turks slain, and the Christian slaves that were in them set at liberty,
which was taken to be a bad sign of good will to Solimans proceedings; and
Barbarossa, to whom those Galleys did belong, seemed to be very much offended,
and threatened revenge: wherefore the Senate to justify this action as much as
they could, had made the accommodation thereof be taken in hand, whereby time
being gotten, and Barbarossa's anger mitigated, and the Turks repaired,
according to Articles for the loss they had suffered, by the taking of their
Galleys, the affairs of the Commonwealth would be preserved from greater
dangers. Thus all parties being well minded to keep peace and friendship,
Gianusby sent to Venice, to have those Articles confirmed by the Duke himself,
and by the Senators, which were formerly made by Ambassador Badoaro; by which
means, the French obtained Commission for Gianusby, to endeavor the uniting of
the Venetians in straiter friendship with their King. The Turkish Ambassador
was very honorably received, and his demands listened unto; for what concerned
the confirmation of peace, It was according to custom, readily sworn unto by
the Duke: but for what concerned the favoring of the French affairs, answer
was made, that the Commonwealth was in peace and friendship with the King of
France, and were resolved to keep so: Money they could not yield, to do any
thing now, which might put a necessity upon them of taking up Arms against
others; and that Soliman was so wise, and so just a Prince, as they believed he
would easily admit of these their just and well known considerations. This
answer being brought back to Soliman by Gianusby, was commended by him as being
wisely done; and the same man making great attestations to him of the Venetians
constant resolution in observing what they had promised and sworn, he appeared
to believe it, and to be desirous to correspond with them in like faith and
friendship.

Thus affairs passed at this time between Soliman and the Venetians; but other
no less important passages, were treated of between them and Christian Princes,
still aiming at the same end of neither ayding, nor offending any one, nor of
doing any thing which might draw them from their neutrality. The Venetians were
not a little troubled at the new disagreements between Caesar and the King of
France; and that out of many reasons. They were sorry that there was no more
place left for treaty, of putting a new Duke into the State of Millan, a thing
which had often been promised them, and which had been lately treated of more
hopefully with the King of France, at the meeting at Paris; and to leave the
Emperor in peaceful possession of the state of Millan, was no other, as had
been long before foreseen by the wisest Senators, then to tolerate an
immoderate greatness in the Emperor, to the prejudice of the liberty of Italy,
and the present condition of times, the Commonwealth being much exhausted and
afflicted, by the late Turkish Wars; as also the various and fickle proceedings
of the French, on whose Counsels, they knew by so many late and former proofs,
there was no relying, did dissuade them from foregoing his confederacy, and
from engaging themselves in new Wars. They were likewise troubled, that the
Turks being solicited by the French to Caesar's prejudice, were to send forth
their Fleets, to the certain present harm of Christendom, and to the greater
future danger; for they would be the better informed in our Seas, and Havens,
and their designs would be fomented by the discord of Christian Princes. Yet
minding only such things whereby they might be safe, through their own Forces
and vigilance, without relying upon the friendship of others, furnishing their
Sea-Towns with good Garrisons, Munition, Victuals, and all other necessaries,
and re-inforcing their Fleet; the Venetians stood observing other men's actions,
not at all intermedling therein; both these Princes labored to make the Senate
quit their Neutrality, propounding several Agreements and Leagues by several
ways unto them. Caesar was already come into Italy with a steadfast resolution
of going into Africa, not being to be dissuaded neither by the Popes
persuasions, who laid before him his Brothers danger, and the occasion offered
him of greater and truer glory; nor yet by his Captains counsels, who wished
him to weigh well the dubious succe^s of the Algier business, the attempt being
to be made in Autumn, a season subject to various changes, and in places full
of inconveniences and difficulties: yet considering the power of the Turkish
Forces, and how far they might advance; he propounded a new confederacy to the
Venetians, to secure Italy from the incursion of these miscreants; saying, that
his Brother King Ferdinande, the Pope, and other Princes would join therein:
but the Senate, not willing to run into certain danger, for avoiding that which
was farther off, excused themselves as not being able to do it by reason of
their late misfortunes, and of their present weakness, in which condition they
were afterward the more confirmed, and did openly refuse to listen to any such
propositions, when they understood that the Pope was but meanly inclined
thereunto: for which though it were at first wondered at, there were afterward
many reasons found: it was alleged that Paul, being a very wise Prince,
would not embrace the Treaty of so important a business, without rational
hopes of bringing it to a good end; and that he having bereaft Ascanio Colonna
of his state, for his contumacy, and disobedience to the Apostolic Sea, would
shun all occasions of restoring him to his former possessions, as he foresaw he
should be enforced to do, if he should make a new confederacy with Caesar, who
could not in honor abandon one that had deserved so well at his hands, and who
had been the head of his faction in Italy; But chiefly, that being more intent
upon an other business, he might first endeavor whilst he was in his
neutrality, that the State of Milla^ might be put into the hands of Octavio
Fernese, as in custody for Caesar and the King of France, and to whom he might
pay a certain homage, till a better accommodation might be found out; and
herein he assured himself, that the Venetians would interpose their authority.
But they perceiving, that this business proceeded but coldly on, and that
there was but little hopes of good therein, and being desirous not to give the
Turks any vain suspicions, forbore to send their Ambassadors to Luca, (though
they were often solicited by Caesar so to do) where the Pope and Caesar were to
meet: But they were not wanting in showing all demonstrations of love and
honor to Caesar's person, they readily gave way for the Dutch Foot, who were
destined to go for Africa, to pass through their Country: And hearing of his
coming by the way of Trent into Italy, they quickly sent four Ambassadors to
him, Iovan Antonio Veniero, Nicolo Tiepolo, Mark Antonio Contarini, and Vicenzo
Grimani; who going to meet him upon the confines of Verona, received him with
much honor, and waited upon him whilst he passed through the State, which was
but only for two days; for going to Peschiera, he entered into the Mantuan
Territories, from whence he went to Millan, from thence to Genua, and then to
Luca, to meet the Pope; with whom having tarried a while, he pursued his
journey toward Algiers. But his advice proved bad, as was foreseen; for having
landed his men on the shore of Algiers, and meeting with more resolution and
worth in the Inhabitants of that City, then he expected; but chiefly, receiving
very great loss by the Arabian Horse, raised by the Turks of the neighboring
Country, who with great speed, and with a new and unknown way of fighting to
our Soldiers, disturbed their works. The time was so spun on, as way was made
to great ruin; for a horrible tempest arising at Sea, which made the Ships
Anchors come home; some were driven upon the shore, others carried into the
high and boisterous seas. Insomuch as having lost many of his ships; and the
rest being much torn, the Emperor was forced to quit the enterprise, having
only purchased this praise, That he was never in the least dismayed, amidst so
many adversities and dangers. Many chief personages who followed the Court,
perished, by the distemper of the air, and sufferings; amongst the rest,
Marino Iustiniano, Ambassador from the Commonwealth, who by orders from the
Senate, had always accompanied the Emperor; and Nicolo da Ponte, who was then
Lieutenant at Udine, was chosen in his steed. This so great loss was
interpreted by some, to redound much to the advantages of the Italian Princes,
since thereby Caesar's forces were weakened, and his mind began to droop; who
having always promised unto himself prosperous success in all things, was
thought, did aspire at the sovereignty of all Italy. Notwithstanding others,
out of serious considerations, were of another (...), thinking this to be a
common loss, and inconvenience to Christians in general, and particularly to
the Commonwealth of Venice: For the Turkish Fleet being counterpoised by his
Forces at sea, that ceasing, these more formidable Enemies grew almost
insuperable, and all things were exposed to their discretion and fury.

Whilst these things were done by Caesar, the King of France his thoughts were
not quiet, who being highly incensed against Caesar, studied by all means
possible, to revenge the injuries he had received; therefore he had by his
Ambassadors, whom he had sent before to Luca, to meet the Pope, pressed hard,
that his Holiness would declare, that the Truce made formerly at Niece, by his
procurement and authority, the more to honest his cause, was broken, by
Fregoso's and Rincone's death. But resolving howsoever to use Force, and hoping
to outdo Caesar, by the friendship and assistance of the Turks and Venetians,
he resolved to send Paulino Ambassador to Constantinople, to treat of the
particulars touching the Fleet's putting forth to prejudice Caesar, and tried
again to get the Venetians to join with him. On which Paulino having
discoursed much, before he parted from Constantinople, he had obtained as has
been said, that Ianusby should be commissioned, to enterpose Soliman's
authority with the Venetians, to incline them to listen to his proposalls,
touching making War with Caesar. Paulino being then come to Venice, as he
returned to Constantinople; he, together with the Bishop of Monpelliers, who
was there Ambassador in ordinary for the King, had private audience in the
College, before the chief of the Council of Ten, where he delivered what they
were ordered to do by the King.

Paulino in a long Oration, persuaded the Senators to a new confederacy with
the King: What the ends were (said he) of the King my Master, and what those of
the Emperor, may now be so plainly discerned by their actions, as their ends
and designs are no longer concealed. The King of France, at the Popes
persuasion, laid down his Arms in Piemont, and stopped the course of his almost
assured victories, out of a good inclination which he always had to concord,
so far as his honor might not be thereby prejudiced. And the Emperor, who
first seemed so desirous of peace, refusing Articles of a fair Agreement,
entered himself in person with an Army into France. That the King was contented
to accept of the Dukedom of Millan, not to unite it to the Crown of France,
that so the Princes of Italy might not, by reason of his greatness, grow
jealous of him; but to make one of his sons Lord thereof. And the Emperor,
being resolved to keep that Dukedom in himself, had often deluded his King, and
the Princes of Italy, with vain hopes, especially the Venetians, who desired
always more then others, to have a new Duke, and particular Lord in that
State. That the King had of late nobly refused the offers of those of Guant,
who rebelling against Caesar, had recourse to him for protection. Nay, he had
readily given way to Caesar 's men, and for himself, to pass through France for
Flanders, to appease the tumults of that Province, from whence, if he had been
so minded, he might have reaped advantage. That he had, several other ways,
witnessed his goodwill to Caesar, having received him with incomparable honor
throughout his (...) ^ingdome, in the very City of Paris, and in his own
Palace* treating with him still with singular civility. That on the other side,
as soo^ ^s his business was done, the Emperor had not only, not corresponded
any ways with him, openly denying what he had promised; but being full of
implacable anger against the King, had treacherously and spitefully caused his
servants to be slain, when by the Truce renewed at Paris, all his affairs should
have been secure. That these, and many other things, which lay open to the eyes
of all men, might witness, what the endeavors, ends, and natures, of these
two Princes were, by which might be well considered, whether of these ought to
be chosen for a friend, and confederate to the Commonwealth; in whether she
might repose more faith, friendship, gratitude, equity, and modesty in all
proceedings. That it ought also to be particularly considered, how great Caesar
's power would be, when he should, together with the Kingdom of Naples,
securely possess the State of Millan; the French being excluded Italy, and all
allayes ceasing, which might curb his desires, bent undoubtedly to be Lord of
all Italy, That it was to be had in consideration, what good might be got by
keeping friendship with Caesar, and what they could promise unto themselves from
the King of France. That Caesar promised only in gratification to the
Commonwealth, to put a Duke into the State of Millan, not intending, as might
be seen by his actions, to do as he said. That what his King's gratitude would
be, and the fruits of this new conjunction, might be argumented, by what he
himself, and his Predecessors, had done for the Commonwealth, the state and
dignity whereof he much desired should be increased. That the King did not sue
for this friendship when he was in a low condition, but in a time, when his
Forces were greater, then they had been for many years before, and when they
might be accompanied by those of the Turks; since the things done unto Soliman
by Caesar, had so incenst him, as that he offered him all assistance to work
revenge. That it might be guessed by Janusby 's Embassy, how the grand Signieur
stood affected toward these two Princes. And that now it belonged to the
wisdom of their Lordships, to consider, how much it imported the Commonwealth
to be friend to his friends, and enemy to his enemies.

These fair and magnificent words, could not make the grave and experienced
Senators, alter their opinion, nor draw them into new obligations and wars.
Wherefore the business being reported to the Senate, they did almost
unanimously vote, that the same answer should be made to the French
Ambassadors, as had been given to Ianusby, by the Collegio de Savii: That the
Commonwealth put a great value upon the King of France his friendship, wherein
they would always faithfully and sincerely correspond with him; but that they
must likewise keep peace with other Princes, and not do any thing that might
tend to the contrary. After this, Paulino continued his journey toward
Constantinople, and was conducted by the Venetian Galleys in Albania, hoping
assuredly to get, that the Fleet might put to Sea that year. But were it
either, that the season was too far spent, to rig out so great a Fleet; or that
Soliman's mind was wholly set upon the affairs of Hungary, whether he said he
would return himself in person, with greater Forces, the French could not as
then be befriended by the Turks. The King of France was not this mean while
idle, but having raised a great many Soldiers, and thereout made three Armies,
and sent his eldest son the Dolphin in the head of one of them, to the Pirenean
Mountains, to recover Perpignan, which belonged formerly to the Crown of
France, and was yielded to Ferdinando of Aragon, when he intended to pass into
Italy: With an other Army commanded by his second son, the Duke of Orleans, he
assaulted Burgony and Lucemburg. The third Army, whereunto was added the Duke
of Cleve's forces, and was led on by the Duke of Vandome, a Prince of the
blood, entering into Flanders through Artois, assaulted several Towns of that
Province. But the noise of all these Armies proved greater, then any harm they
did the Emperor; for the Dolphin finding the Fort of Perpignan well
Garrisoned, and soon succored, by the Duke of Alva's Forces, was forced to
retreat, not having done any thing: And the Duke of Orleans did nothing but
plunder and pillage the Country* and the Towns taken by the Duke of Cleves,
were kept but a very little while. Wherefore the King of France failing in all
his designs, and thinking upon the assistance which he had conceived from
others, complained of Soliman, and of the Venetians, for not having taken up
Arms to assist him in a seasonable time, whilst he had molested Caesar in so
many several parts. Wherefore the ill offices done to the Venetians, by his
Ambassador Monsieur de Monpelliere, made the greater impression in him. And
Poli^o, who was still at Constantinople, openly discovering this
dis-satisfaction, did oppose himself to the proceedings of the Venetians, both
in private meetings, and in the public Divano, seeking to detract from the
person of their Consul, and from the dignity of the Commonwealth; and hoping
still to have the Fleet the next year, he said, That he himself would go in it,
and would make the Venetians know, how prejudicial his endeavors, and his
King's authority would prove to them. A new accident had given occasion to
these things; for their Treason being at this time discovered, who revealed the
aforesaid secrets of the Commonwealth to the French; Agostino Abondio, who was
the chief delinquent, (for by his means, the things were discovered to Cesare
Fregoso, and by him communicated to the Court of France) had for his
preservation gotten into the French Ambassadour's house* to the which Bernardo
Georgio, one of the Auvogadori del Commune, a Magistrate of great authority,
being gone, with Commanders and the chief-heads of the Council of Ten, and
other Officers, to have the guilty party delivered into their hands; the
Auvogadori with great respect desired to speak with the Ambassador. When those
of his family, laying violent hands upon those who were at the gate, and upon
the stairs, and wounding some of them, would give no answer, nor would suffer
any one of them to go any further. Whereupon by order from the Council of Ten,
Guards of armed Boats, and many people, were presently placed about the
Embassadour's house, as well to keep the Traitor from escaping, as for
preserving the house, and the Embassadour's person from the peoples fury, who
being in a tumult by reason of this accident, were very like to grow more
insolent, and give occasion of greater scandal. At last, Abondio was by the
Ambassador delivered into the hands of Justice, who being found guilty, was
condemned and hanged. And the goods of Cesare Fregoso, he being already dead,
were confiscated, and his brother Alexander had his Pension taken from him, and
his command of Gers d'Armes; their offense being thought the greater, by reason
of the great obligations which their father Ianus, and their whole family had
received from the Commonwealth. The King was wrongfully informed of these
things, as if they had been done only to despise him, and not out of safety
for the Commonwealth, and out of justice. Wherefore he spoke loud, and was
grievously offended against the Commonwealth: But afterward his passion being
over, he sent the Pronotory of Monduck to Venice, to plead his excuse, if
grounding his judgment upon false information, he had conceived a worser
opinion of the Commonwealth, then she had deserved at his hands; saying, that
he would blot out the Memory thereof, and would be always a true and constant
friend to her: and soon after, he sent the same Monduck back to Venice, to be
his Ambassador in ordinary there, in the place of the Bishop of Monpellier,
who, to gratify the Senate, was at their request removed from that charge.

There happened an other accident at the same time, which did a little trouble
the Senate, both in respect of themselves and others, which was the taking of
Marano from Ferdinando, King of the Romans, (in whose power it was by virtue
of the last Capitulations) by Beltrame Sacchia, a Venetian subject, who did it
first of his own head, but afterward by the interessing of great Princes; for
calling in Pietro Strozzi to his aid, a banished Florentine, who entered in with
a certain number of men, tumultuously raised in the State of Venice; they
declared that they held that Town, in the name of the King of France; but they
threatened at the same time, that if they should be abandoned by other helps, so
as the Town should be in danger of falling back into the power of Ferdinando,
they would deliver up that Fort to the Turks. This was hainously resented by
the Venetians, as the beginning of greater Commotions, and as the seed of War
and Discord. They knew that Ferdinando might very well think they had a hand in
it, since the first Author was one of their subjects, and the people that he
made use of, taken out of their State, and then they knew not what the King of
France his intentions might be, since his name, who was desirous of Novelties,
was used therein: but they chiefly feared lest the Turks might be hereby
incited to prejudice the Commonwealth. Marano not being above 80 miles from
Venice, where by reason of the Lake, their ships might safely ride. Therefore
being resolved to provide as well as they could against so many inconveniences;
the Senate made proclamation, that upon pain of severe punishment, none of
their subjects should enter into Marano, nor convey victuals thither, or any
other sort of help. They also made Sacchia's Father and Wife, who were in
Udine, be deteyned, that they might have a pledge in their hands, whereby to
curb his rash courses: and yet at the same time, they gave fair words both to
him, and the rest that were in Marano, and gave them hopes of good
accommodation, lest when Ferdinando should come against them, and they not be
of themselves able to defend themselves, they should resolve to take a Turkish
Garrison. In this variety of affairs, being resolved not to intermeddle more
then of necessity they must, they kept as much as they could from giving
offense to the interessed Princes. Thus when Ferdinando sent the Bishop of
Trent to Venice, to desire assistance of Men and Ships from the Senate, for the
recovery of Marano, they said nothing of their not being able to satisfy him,
without offending the King of France; but answered, That the Senate which
always loved what was just and honest, desired that Ferdinando might recover
Marano, which was fraudulently ken from him, and by violence; that therefore
they were ready to allow passage for his men, and to assist them with Victuals,
but that they hoped things might be fairly accorded. And likewise the King of
France, his Ambassador affirming to them in his Master's name, that the King
would not do any thing concerning Marano, without satisfaction to the Senate,
and that he desired their advice therein; the Senate returned answer, That the
King was so wise a Prince, as he needed no advice; and that for as much as
concernd their desire, they should wish best to that resolution, by which peace
and concord might be preserved. Whilst the time was spent in these affairs,
those who remained in Marano, (for Sacchia, who was gone out of the Town to
accompany the wife of a German Governor, who went to provide Moneys to pay the
Tax that was laid upon them, was not permitted to come in again) growing more
bold and insolent, began to build a Fort at the Haven of Liguano, five miles
distant from Marano, that they might have a safe place of refuge, when they
should go forth with their armed Vessels, to pillage such ships as should sail
by those shores, which they continually did: This being thought to be a thing
of greater consequence, and not to be suffered, the Venetians to destroy this
Work, and Bernardo Sagredo being therein employed, he soon effected it. For
coming thither suddenly with his Gallie, and another belonging to Philippo
Bragadino, both of which were ready armed, as being formerly destined to an
other voyage, and having a good many Soldiers aboard, commanded by Iulio da
Monte Vecchio; those that built the Work, fled away at the first appearance,
and he with his Artillery beat down the Fort, which was already raised to a
good height, and carried away all the materials, to take away the means of
easily re-making it. This resolution helped likewise to keep some Imperial
Galleys from coming into the Gulf, which were destined to assist the recovery
of Marano, which the King of France having notice of, he had likewise prepared
some other to send to the same place, to assist those of Marano: So as it was
foreseen, that both these Fleets were to have entered the Gulf, to the
prejudice of the ancient Jurisdict^on of the Commonwealth, and that the seat
of War would be made so near hand: but both these Princes, at the Senates
request, forbear doing this. Thus the affairs of Marano were suspended, the
agreement concerning this Town, being before begun to be treated of between the
King of France, and the King of the Romans, wherein there being many
difficulties still found, Strozzi and the rest seeming desirous to deliver up
that Fort, rather to the Commonwealth then to any other Princes; they
protested, that if they did not quickly agree, they would treat with the Turks,
and agree with them. But in the mean while, Ferdinando, (were it that he did
truly know the Venetians sincerity, or that he would conceal whatsoever
jealousy he had thereof, and knowing that their friendship might be of great
moment) chose two Commissioners to end the differences which had often been
treated of, touching the meaning and observation of the Capitulations of Trent.
These came to Venice, and Francesco Contarini, and Francesco Sanuto were
chiefly employed in the business, being formerly chosen Commissioners for this
Treaty, wherein Caesar's Ambassador interposed himself as a friendly composer;
and the business was drawn to a near conclusion, if there could have been any
means found out to accord the differences touching the Town of Belgrado and
Castle Nuovo, which were formerly mortgaged, together with some other Castles,
by Emperors of the House of Austria, to the Dukes of Saxony. Touching which,
and the condition of the Engagement, and the proportion of Moneys which
belonged to these two places, there arose many difficulties, which kept the
business undecided.

But these businesses were diverted by much greater affairs: for at the
beginning of the year 1543. such rumors of Wars were heard in all parts, as no
Country seemed to be secure, nor any Prince free from the troubles thereof. For
in Constantinople, a great Army was prepared to assault Hungary and Austria,
and a Fleet to pass into the Mediterranean Seas, to the prejudice of the
Emperors Dominions. And the King of France, hoping, by the coming out of the
Fleet at his desire, and in favor to him, that he should the more easily
prevail over Caesar, being more desirous of war then ever, had raised a great
many Soldiers, not only of his own Kingdom, but of the warlike Nation of the
Swizzers, inviting them with new rewards and gifts, to follow his ensigns: he
endeavored very much to maintain the Duke of Cleve's rebellion, troubling the
Emperor in several parts, but especially in Flanders: who being no less
willing to revenge himself for the injuries he had received from the French,
and chiefly to chastise the Duke of Cleve's daring, as he termed it, (who was a
Feudatary of the Empire) for having taken up Arms with his Enemies against him,
assembled the Diet of Princes, and Hans-towns, according to the custom of
Germany, and had gotten all the Forces of Germany to join with him in making
War against the King of France, and the Duke of Cleve; and to the end that his
Forces might be the more formidable, laying aside (to the wonder of all men)
the memory of the heinous and great injuries received from Henry King of
England, for having repudiated his Aunt* Queen Katherine, and not regarding
that this Prince had declared himself a Schismatic, and was become
contumacious to the Church of Rome, he resolved to join in league with him, and
to make War upon France. Thus it seems that all other Reasons, both Humane and
Divine, give way to the Reason of State; though Princes oftentimes term their
mere Appetites, Reason. And Caesar found Henry the more inclined to this
Invitation, by reason of his not being satisfied with the King of France, for
having adhered unto his enemy, James King of Scotland, in a difference between
them concerning Confines. In these great Commotions, the Pope. and the
Venetians, continued in their Neutrality, being desirous to maintain the peace
of Italy, as much as might be. But the Venetians were herein much more resolute
and constant; for the Pope, being troubled with several jealousies, was
sometimes otherwise minded. Many things made him apprehend Caesar's greatness;
he considered how much more powerful Caesar was likely to prove, being assisted
by the forces of Germany, and of England; and that the power of Emperors had
ever been formidable to Popes; and that he was the more particularly concerned,
in that Caesar had satisfied the German Protestants in many points, and now of
late in procuring the Council to be celebrated within the confines of Germany,
whither the Ambassadors being gone very early, they gave out that matters of
Reformation were to be treated on, which is not usually very acceptable to
Popes; and chiefly then, by reason of the freedom of their speech, who being
alienated from the obedience of the Church of Rome, sought to cover their own
faults by the errors of others. Nor was it of any small moment, to make him
think the worse of the Emperor, that he had contracted friendship with a
Prince who had thrown off his obedience to the Apostolic Sea, and that he
seemed not willing to gratify Him in the affairs of Millan. The Pope being
moved out of these respects, proposed a streighter conjunction, and
intelligence with the Venetians for the common safety; a thing proposed then
only, as looking at Peace and Quiet, and not of forgoing their Neutrality,
unless upon utmost necessity; but with intention, as was discovered by many
signs, to bring the Commonwealth to join with the King of France. But the
Senate continuing their accustomed answer, showed the Pope, that there was no
Occasion, much less any Necessity, to make any such Innovation, whereby
mischiefs afar off might be rather hastened then kept back, by making Princes
jealous. Herein the Senators did maturely consider, that the forces of the
Emperor, and of the King of France, were so equally balanced, each of them
being very strong of himself, and assisted by other great Princes, as it was
not to be feared that one of them should so exceed the other, as that his power
might prove prejudicial to the affairs of Italy, and that Time often produces
notable and un-thought of advantages, which they ought most to attend, who
propose unto themselves the safety and preservation of what is their own,
rather then the getting of what appertains to another. That the Commonwealth
could not confederate with any other, without offending Caesar, who having so
ofen desired new Leagues, they could never be brought to alter any part of
their old Capitulations; that at the present, the King of France was excluded
all Italy, but that it was more to be desired, then likely, that he might at
this time have a share therein, the better to counterpoise Caesar, now when he
must be necessitated to employ his forces in defense of his own Kingdom, it
being set upon both by English and Imperialists. The Venetians were much more
troubled at the coming forth of the Turkish Fleet, which was now much talked
of, and whereof great preparations were seen; though the Turks promised, that
all fair respects should be had to what appertained to the Commonwealth, and
that Paulino affirmed the same constantly, who was to be in it, and had wholly
changed his mind, by reason of new instructions which he had received from his
King. It was foreseen, that Italy would be disfurnished of soldiers, since the
flower of her Militia was to go serve Caesar and Ferdinand in Hungary and
Flanders. That Doria's Fleet consisted but of a few Galleys, and those employed
in bringing Cesar's person into Italy. That the Commonwealth had not as then
above thirty Galleys at Sea, so as all Seas were open and free for the Turks,
all Shoars exposed to their assaults. Nor was it to be comprehended, nor much
to be credited, what their present intentions were, nor what they would
hereafter be; according as occasions should fall out. Therefore the Venetians
thought good to increase their Fleet, to the number of 70 Galleys, arming some
in Dalmatia, some in Candia, and in other places; and making Stephano Tiepolo
Captain General at Sea, (a man famous for his own worth, and more famous
afterward, for being father of Paolo Tiepolo, Procurator of St. Mark; a famous
Senator of our times, both for his eloquence, and wisdom in the Senate) who
gave an account of this to all the Princes Courts, to the end, that the news
hereof might not make her designs to be thought greater then they were, to
tell them, That the Commonwealth had armed some Galleys, for the safety of
their Subjects, and for the guard of the Sea, and of her Shoars; and had made a
supreme Commander over them, to the end, that the public Officers and
Subjects, might be kept within the bounds of obedience, and all occasions
removed, whereby the public quiet might be disturbed. And accordingly, the
General was enjoined to keep within the Gulf, and visit the Shoars and
Islands of their Dominions, ordering and taking course for all things that were
necessary; where he was to be met by Iustiniano, one of the Sea-Commissaries;
the other Commissary, which was Alessandro Bondomiero, being to tarry in the
waters of Corfu, with 15 of the best Galleys, wherewith, upon the approach of
any Fleet, he might be safe in the Mandracchio. And he was also ordered to shun
all such things, as might cause suspicions in the Turks, of the insincerity of
their intentions toward them, which it was very well known, was often
cunningly endeavored by Doria.

This mean while, the Turkish Fleet put to sea, consisting of 120 Galleys,
commanded by Cariadana Barbarossa, Polino being aboard them; and having put
himself in very good order, as to soldiers, and all things necessary, those
few days that he tarried at Negroponte, he went to Porto Figaro; and then
steering Westward, he passed Faro di Messina, and came to the Rivers of
Calabria, where landing his men near Regio, he took much booty, and sacked the
City of Regio, the Castle having much ado to hold out. Then re-imbarking his
men, and pursuing his course toward the French shore, he stayed to take in
fresh water, first, at the Island of Ponzo, and afterward at the River of
Terrezzina, where landing some men near Ostia, at the mouth of the River Tiber,
all those of Rome were struck into such a terror at the news thereof, as the
people began tumultuously to run out of the City, that they might save
themselves in some neighboring parts. But the fear and danger soon ceased; for
Polino did by Letters assure the Governor of Rome, that those shoars should
receive no prejudice; and as soon as they had made provision of water, the
whole Fleet went away, not having done any injury: And coasting along the
Rivers of To^cany and Ge^^a, put into the Haven of Tolone, where meeting with
two French Galleys, they guided the Fleet toward Marcelles, and by the way
they were met with twenty four more French Galleys. Barbarossa landed, and was
received in great pomp into the City, with many Janisaries. But Polino went in
all haste to find the King out, to receive particular orders from him, (which
Barbarossa was by his commission to obey) and returned suddenly to the Fleet,
which at his coming back was increased by sixteen French Galleys, and some few
Ships, wherein were 6000 Foot, who were ready to that purpose on those shoars.
So he went from Marcelles, and passed into the Haven of Villa Franca, lying in
the River of Genua, to fall upon Nice, a Town which was then in the Duke of
Savoy's possession, but which was said to have belonged formerly to the Crown
of France: He landed his men and Artillery, and for some few days played
furiously upon the Town; so as the defendants dispairing of being able to
defend themselves, yielded the Town unto the King, and the City was preserved
from plunder; but the Castle being relieved by the Marquis of Guasto, and the
season being too far spent to ^arry any longer there, Barbarossa returned with
his whole Fleet into the Haven as Marcell^s, to the end, that wintering in some
parts thereabouts, he might be the readier to make some attempts in those seas,
and to keep the Imperialists the mean while, much to their inconvenience, from
that Navigation; wherefore the French and Turks did very diligently observe,
which way the enemies Vessels went, and laid snares for them: And Ianatino
Doria being gone with some Galleys into the Levant, to commit piracy in the
Archipelagus, Barbarossa sent ^orty Galleys toward the Island of Major^a, to
fight him at his return; and Doria escaped them very narrowly, whose prey he
must have been, being far inferior to them in forces. The Venetian Fleet in
this interim, not knowing what way the Turkish Fleet would take, and because
Doria's Galleys were gone into the Levant, kept still in the Gulf, thinking it
their safest course to provide for their own affairs, to shun all occasions of
meeting the Frigates of any great Princes* or to make them believe, that they
would any ways either assist, or hinder them, in any of their enterprises. Yet
was not the Venetian General idle, but viewing the Forts and the Militia's,
and giving many good directions in all places, his service proved very
advantageous and honorable to the Commonwealth.

Caesar being at the same time resolved to go in person into Germany, that he
might make as fierce war as he could upon the King of France; he thought he
might the safelier go from Spain, because he had made the States swear, to
receive his son Prince Phillip for their King. So he, with his whole Court,
went to Barcellona, leaving Don Ernando di Toledo, Duke of Alva, in charge with
the affairs of the Kingdom, and of his son. And meeting Prince Doria, who
waited for him there with forty Galleys, he went with them, and with certain
ships, which carried the Spanish Foot to Genua. Upon the news of his arrival
in Italy, the Senate chose four Ambassadors, Carlo Morosini, Gabriele Veniero,
Lodovico Faliero, and Vettore Gremani; who as he was to pass through the
Dominions of the Commonwealth, were to meet him, to witness their love and
friendship to him. But the Pope, betaking himself to new thoughts, since he had
no hopes of the confederacy which he had endeavored with the Venetians,
resolved to speak with Caesar, intending first to secure his own affairs the
better, as well concerning the condition of his Temporal Arms, as Religion,
and the Pontificiall authority in the Council, which was about to meet in
Trent, a City in Germany, and whereof there wanted not some jealousies;
resolving afterward to try Caesar once more, touching the concession of the
Dukedom of Millan, to Ottavio Fernese, with disbursing a sum of money to him,
which he saw Caesar stood in need of, in other the like important affairs of
war. But cloaking these his more secret designs, with another fair pretense,
he expressed his necessity of speaking with Caesar, with whom, since he was to
pass by, so near him, it became him, the Pope, as head of Christendom, and
common Father and Pastor, in a time of such great disorders and troubles,
amongst Christians, and of such eminent danger of the Turks, to meet him, and
to exhort him to peace with Christians, and to wars with the Turks; and to see,
whether he could do any more good by his presence, then he had done in his
absence by his authority, or by his advice given by Cardinal Gaspero
Contarino, a learned holy man, whom he had sent as his Legate not long before to
Caesar in Germany; as he had sent at the same time, and to the same end,
Cardinal Iacopo Sadeletto, to France; but all to no purpose. Thus the Pope
acquainting the Venetians with his departure from Rome, and his going to
Bullognia, alleged this for his chiefest reason, but did neither totally
conceal, nor yet confess his intention, touching the affairs of Millan, to see
whether he could discover their intentions therein; for he knew, that this
would be very acceptable to them, but that they were to proceed with great
caution, for the aforesaid reasons. But the Senate continuing their resolution,
of not meddling at all in these negotiations, did only praise the Pope's pious
good will, and the resolution he had taken in so important a business for the
common good, not proceeding any further to the consideration of any business.
Yet did not the Pope cool, in this his desire of interview, neither for his
being sole in this business, nor yet for any lets or difficulties, promoted by
Caesar, who little to his honor, appeared to be otherwise minded, either, for
that he was not well pleased with the Pope, for not having openly declared for
him, as the esteem which he and his House had put upon him, seemed to require,
(he having preferred him before many honorable Allies, in the marriage of his
daughter) as also the actions of his enemy the King of France, who had joined
in league and friendship with the Turks, to the prejudice of Christendom; or
else, for that suspecting that the Pope would renew the Treaty, of yielding up
the Dukedom of Millan to Ottavio Fernese, he being already resolved not to
part with it upon any conditions, he would shun the occasion of increasing his
ill will to him, by not giving him satisfaction, and thrust him as it were upon
the friendship of the King of France. But the Pope esteeming his dignity
injured, if being gone from Rome to speak with Caesar, he should suffer him to
go out of Italy, and not see him; for nothing he could do was able to persuade
the Emperor, to come to Bullognia, though he had sent his son Pier Luigi first
to him to Genua, with this his desire; and afterward his nephew Alexander
Fernese, who although very young, was already made Cardinal; he was content to
go further to meet him, Caesar having alleged for his excuse, That he could not
retard his journey, by going out of his way. The Town of Busetto, belonging to
the jurisdiction of the Palavisini, was then appointed for this convention, an
incommodious and ignoble place; but the issue of this interview was such, as it
was foreseen it would be; for nothing was therein concluded, neither for the
public service of Christendom, nor for the particular advantage of the House
of Fernese; for Caesar was still resolute, to pursue the war against the King of
France, and the Duke of Cleves. And as for the business of Millan, he would
give no absolute negative to the Pope, alleging, that he could not of himself
dispose of that State, without the participation and consent of the Princes of
the Empire. By which answer, his resolution of not parting with it, was
notwithstanding discovered. The convention being dissolved, which lasted but
only three days, Caesar pursuing his journey, entered the State of Venice,
where he was met upon the confines by the four forenamed* Ambassadors, and
received and accompanied with the usual demonstrations of honor. As he
without any delay went to Trent, to go for Germany, the State furnished him
with all things necessary for his person, and for his attendance, and many
offers were made unto him in the name of the public, but in general terms,
not touching upon any business, save only, that he would be a means to his
brother, for expedition in the affairs, belonging to the resolution of Trent,
wherein they had already interessed themselves as friendly compositors. Caesar
past from Trent to ^lmes, and from thence to Spire, that he might be nearer the
business he went about; being followed wheresoever he went by Secretary Daniel
Buonriccio, Agent for the Commonwealth; for the Ambassador Ponte falling
desperately sick, was forced to tarry at Trent, and to return from thence to
Venice; and Bernardo Navagiero, who was afterward made a Cardinal by Pope
Pius the fourth, succeeded in his place. Cesar's first attempts against the
Duke of Cleves, succeeded well; for he took the City of Dura from him at the
very first; but soon after, by the intercession and entreaties of the Duke of
Brunswick, and of the Elector of Collen, and out of Cesar's own inclination,
that he might the more freely, without any hinderance, proceed on against the
Kingdom of France, he was by him received into favor, and suffered to enjoy
his whole Dukedom of Cleves, upon the restitution of the Dukedom of Guelders,
which he had possessed himself of.

At the same time the War was begun again in the Kingdom of Hungary, whither
Soliman being come with a powerful Army, making all the Country be ransackt
and ruined by his Cavalry; he sat down before Strigonia, and whilst he was
busied there, he sent an Ambassador to Venice, to acquaint the Senate with his
voyage, and his designs; and also to learn news of his Fleet, which was busied
at this time in the Haven of Villa Franca, about the enterprise of Niece; and
he accordingly was advertised, and thanked for his friendship to the
commonwealth, and for his acquainting her with his actions and counsels. It
behooved them to appear pleased with this demonstration of the Turks, to
preserve peace with them, and better reputation with others, by their
friendship, which was at this time of better esteem, by reason of the Turks
joining with the French, who were not wanting in making often mention of the
terror of the Turk's enmity, that they might make the Venetians be governed by
them. Wherefore Soliman having sent an other Ambassador to Venice, with new
advertisements of his proceedings in Hungary, the Senate thought they must not
be wanting in correspondence, with demonstration of like honor, and love
toward so great a Prince; Stephano Tiepolo, was therefore chosen for this
Embassy, who had already laid down his Commission of General at Sea. This man
was to go in the spring to Constantinople, where Soliman, who was already upon
his return, was then to be, to congratulate his happy return, and to promise
good correspondency, and continuance of friendship with that Court. The
business of Marano was not as yet quieted, but the French were still more hot
in maintaining that Fort, and the Dutch in recovering it; so as besides 400
Foot, who were brought thither first by Monsieur de Senei, the King of France
sent a new recruit thither of a good many foot and horse: And on the other
side, the King of the Romans sent some Dutch foot companies over the
Mountains, under the Conduct of Giovan Baptista Savello, and mustred some
others of his nearest Territories, to make up a body of an Army, wherewith to
besiege Marano; and they were all forthwith suffered to pass through the
Commonwealth, that they might appear free from siding with any one in this
business. The Venetians were more troubled at the manning out of a Pinnace,
and two Brigantines at Trieste, wherewith they began to streiten Marano by Sea,
entering by the Haven of Dignano, because they would of necessity draw other
armed Vessels to those parts: and the sufferance of these, seemed to entrench
upon the Commonwealths pretenses to that Haven, and showed some partiality in
them, by suffering Maranos outrages in the same parts, where by formerly
destroying the Fort, they would not favor her defense: yet the Commonwealth
proceeding calmly on, endeavored to free her self from these prejudices and
jealousies, rather by negotiations, and by a certain cautiousness, than by open
force. Therefore they pressed Ferdinando and the Emperor very much, that those
armed Vessels might not tarry in that Haven, and at the same time caused the
Captain of the fly-boats, and one well armed Gallie to come to the neighboring
shores; that the Triesteene Vessels, which were but weakly furnished, might be
resisted, and be made to suspect that force should be used against them. Whilst
these things were in Treaty, Iovan Francisco de Pazzi, a Florentine, came to
Venice, to deliver up the Fort of Marano, in the name of Pietro Stozzi, to the
Commonwealth, receiving a reasonable reward, and to tell them, if they should
not listen to this offer of his, he should be forced to treat with some other
great Prince, who he knew would willingly accept of it. And it was generally
said every where, that Strozzi being resolved not any ways to deliver up that
Fort to Ferdinando, and intending to make what advantage he could of it, might
easily close with the Turks. The King of France had left Marano in the free
power of Strozzi, in reward of the service he had done that Crown; and as
others more expressly said, in account for great debts which he pretended unto;
and that he therefore affirmed, Strozzi might do with the Town what he listed:
Yet it was thought, that nothing was done without the knowledge and particular
consent of the King of France, whose Ambassador then resident at Venice, as
soon as the Agreement was made, did much commend the Senates resolution, and
did thank them for it in his Kings name. The Venetians were much troubled at
the business; for the receiving, or refusing of the offer, was a trouble unto
them in diverse respects. They desired to shun doing of any thing that might
displease Ferdinando, and much more to occasion any jealousies, that they had
had any hand in Strozzi's Counsels; but to permit that a place so near the
Towns of Venice, standing as it were upon her own shore, should fall into the
hands of the Turks, was too hard and prejudicial a business, and which might
prove injurious not only to the Commonwealth, but to all Christendom. Being
therefore reduced to this necessity, they resolved to listen to Pazzi's
proposal, and two Senators, Antonio Capello, and Francesco Contarini, were
appointed to treat with him upon the particulars. After many meetings, the
business was conculded thus; That upon the delivery up of Marano to the
Commonwealth, Strozzi was to receive 35000 Ducats. Thus Alexander Bondemiere,
was chosen Commissary of the Town, who accompanied by Pazzi, and a few foot,
was received in, and had the Town delivered into his hands by Strozzi, and with
the peoples applause. Some of the chief of them, swore allegiance to the
Commonwealth: they afterward acquainted the Emperor and Ferdinando with all
that was done, alleging just reasons for this their necessary resolution.
That their actions for two years last past, might sufficiently witness their
sincerity; during all which time, they would not only listen to these
practices, which had been proffered them several times before, but had readily
given passage, victuals, and all other commodities to Ferdinando's men, for the
recovery of Marano; that they had considered, that Town was of no moment to
Ferdinando's affairs, neither for State, Confines, nor advantage that he got
thereby; but that it would have been very dangerous for his other Territories,
if it should have fallen into the Turks hands, as it was apparent it would have
done, if they had continued to have despised Strozzi's offer: these reasons
being handsomely represented to these Princes, by Bernando Navagiero, and
Marino de Cavalli, the one being sent Ambassador to Caesar, the other to the
King of the Romans, did appease them who were at first much incenst at this
accident.

But the condition of the Times, did chiefly make them capable of these
reasons; for a Diet being intimated to be held in Spire, in the beginning of
the year 1544. wherein the chief Lords of Germany were to intervene, to treat
of important affairs, of making War with the French, and of withstanding that
which the Turks made with them, the Emperor, and the King of the Romans, were
wholly bent upon these Negotiations and preparations. And as they did much
desire this, so they hoped that the Commonwealth, moved by the Authority of so
many German Princes, and Cities, would suffer it self to be drawn into some
confederacy, when they should see that they had embraced the enterprise against
the Turks. But the Emperor in particular, was not free from suspicions, that
the Venetians so often attempted by the King of France, should, upon the taking
of any distaste at his hands, part from his confederacy, and join with the King
of France, which troubled him the more at this time; for that having made peace
with the King of England, and the Swissers, he hoped he might prosper better in
his attempts against France, then he had done the last year, wherein the good
he had got was not answerable to his preparations for War. For the French
having lately relieved Landresi, were returned with all their Forces safe into
France; and the imperial Army dispairing to get the Town, gave over the
enterprise. Wherefore Caesar intending to fall upon France with more forces, at
the same time that it should be assaulted by the King of England, was very
desirous of the peace of Italy, that his Forces might not be divided by being
employed elsewhere. But on the contrary, the King of France knowing all this,
placed much of his hopes in being able to defend and secure his own affairs, by
troubling the peace of Italy, by assaulting Napolls, and Millan; so as Caesar
should be necessitated to turn his Forces to defend those States which he so
highly valued: therefore considering the advantage he might make thereby,
either forgetting other respects, so often considered, by reason of his ardent
desire, or for that he hoped to bring him the more easily to some Agreement, or
that he believed time and accidents might make the Venetians alter their
determinations; he resolved to invite them once more by many offers, to join in
League with him against Caesar; and to the end that the Authority of the person
employed, might purchase more belief and honor to the business; he sent the
Cardinal of Ferrara to Venice, who was received there very honorably; and
public Complements being past, he was brought, according to his desire, to
private Audience in the College, where he spoke thus.

The occasion of this my coming hither, and the proposal that I am to make, as
it may peradventure be cause of wonder to others, so ought it to cause content,
and no small consolation to you, wise Senators, since that coming from a great
King, to make new entreaties, and new confederacy with this Commonwealth,
after the having so often endeavored your friendship, may be a manifest sign
of Francis King of France, his good will toward you, and your affairs, and of
the great esteem he has of this Commonwealth, and of her Forces; it will suit
with the wisdom which is attributed to you, Gentlemen, and with the praise
which is particularly given to your Senate, to know how to make good use of
this Prince his well wishes toward the common good, and particularly toward
your prosperity, to know your own greatness and forces; and withal, to know
the opportunity, nay the necessity which the condition of the Times, and the
designs of other Princes, do put upon you, to embrace these great offers which
are made you; the which I knowing them to be effectually such, has made me to
undertake this employment the more willingly, as thinking I shall not do
service only to the King therein, to whom I stand so much indebted, but that I
shall also procure the liberty and greatness of Italy: Your not having formerly
agreed with our King, and accepted his offers, has not been esteemed a
coolness in your affection toward the Crown of France, since there have been
sufficient both modern and ancient Testimonies thereof* nor to any little
credit you give to the Kings promises, since this Commonwealth, has to her
great advantage joined in league so often with his predecessors, and with
himself; nor yet to want of Counsel, or care in Government, your Senate
having always been a more vigilant Guardian then any other Potentate, not
only of your own Country, but also of the liberty of others, and for a long
time a true defender and Arbitrator of the affairs of Italy: but for that in a
business of so great moment as this, you have been pleased to proceed with all
maturity, lest you might repent too late the having quitted your Neutrality,
and have entered into the charge and trouble of War, so as there is none who can
as yet blame this your resolution; but all things which might have caused any
doubt, are now so ripened, that there is no time left for longer delay. Caesar's
ends and intentions are now too well known, to be wholly bent upon making
himself supreme Monarch, and in particular, Lord of Italy: Him has the King
opposed in these things with all his might; and for this is he the more hated
by Caesar, because he sees he withstands these his machinations; and that he is
ready not only to defend his own affairs, but to become a refuge to others,
who have need of assistance against this powerful Enemy, and has been able
hitherto by the Forces of his own Kingdom, to oppose the violence of the Dutch
and Spanish Forces, able to frustrate Caesar's hopes, to maintain his own
Dominions, and to repair the eminent dangers of other men. But now that Caesar's
power is so increased, by having the Forces of Germany, of the Swissers, and of
the King of England joined with him, as that every other Prince ought to be
jealous of him, and to be awakned at the aspect of such greatness, which is in
an instant both born and sprung up, and to provide against it, before the
mischief be grown greater which threatens all men. The King of France his
Forces are certainly very great, his mind very ready to employ them all against
Caesar's immoderate greatness, wherein he will value, nor labor, nor expense,
nor danger, being resolved to run all fortunes, and never to lay down Arms,
unless overcome by utmost necessity, or that there be no occasion to make use
of them: but that he may secure these his intentions the most he may, to show
that he does not undervalue the forces and assistants of others, when the
common cause is in question: it is therefore that he has made known these his
most important respects to you Gentlemen; it is therefore that he has opened
his most inward thoughts unto you, and has endeavored a new conjunction
between this Commonwealth and his Kingdom, because when the wills and forces
of these two Potentates shall be joined, and that it may in reason be thought,
that the safety of their states is in a good part provided for, Caesar may be
made to divide his Armies, and no longer think upon usurping other men's
Estates, but upon defending his own. The King does therefore desire, and this
it is that he wills me particularly to propose unto you, that your Fleet may be
brought to the Rivers of Puglia, where, the Towns being unprovided of
Garrisons, the people well affected toward the Commonwealth, and declared
enemies to the Spaniards, there may be hopes of doing much good speedily: And
on his part, he offers to maintain always 15000 choice Foot in Piemont, or
where else you shall please, whereby the Imperialists being curbed, your State
by Land may be safe from all danger; nay the Dukedom of Millan, and the Duke of
Savoy's whole State, whose interest is the same with Caesar's, will be sorely
endangered. In this Proposition, all things will be maturely considered; it
will be sufficiently known, that all things do therein concur, which may make a
Prince take up Arms: the necessary defense and safety of his own affairs; hopes
grounded upon good foundations, to increase Dominion; the assured purchasing of
a powerful and faithful friend in all Fortunes. The very resolutions of your
Senate show, that Caesar's greatness ought to be esteemed a sufficient cause,
to make your Commonwealth take up Arms to keep off further dangers, which much
to your praise have constantly for so long a time maintained Wars, not being
frightened by any danger, nor changed for any expense or trouble, only to keep
the State of Millan from falling into Caesar's hands. For you know, it was too
great a danger, to have so powerful a Neighbor. But if these things were
apprehended when they were farther off, and the suspicions thereof endeavored
to be secured; how ought they to be suffered, now that they are at hand, when
Caesar's counsels are sufficiently known, when his cunning is discovered, and
when there is no more hope left, that he will quit the State of Millan. Can it
be thought a good and wholesome counsel, to neglect the occasion now, which
was more desired by you then, than any thing else, to oppose Caesar's vast
designs, and not to suffer the Malady to grow to such a height, as that no
remedy will be found for it? Consider, I beseech you, if it should so fall out,
(as all human things are subject to various changes) That the Kingdom of
France, assaulted by such powerful forces, I will not say, should be lost, but
should be so weakened, as that not any Prince should for many years, be able to
counterpoise Caesar 's power. Who sees not, to what condition the liberty of
Italy would be reduced? Who can think himself free from his injuries, for not
having offended him? Who can hope to work upon his haughtiness by submission?
Who can think, that his insatiable thirst after Government, can ever be
satisfied by any acquisition? Caesar will say, that you have opposed his
greatness, because you have not favored him; that you have not valued his
friendship, because you would not make a straiter conjunction with him; though
it be known, he sought thereby to put greater ties upon you, for his own
advantage. So as it cannot be thought safe for you, to keep at this time in
your Neutrality; for it does neither purchase you true friends, nor does it
secure you from those that are your real enemies. And if your aim, by this
your neutrality, had always been, to obtain peace and quiet, your
Commonwealth would never have arrived at such greatness, nor would she have
either Dominions or Forces: But depending upon the discretion of others, she
would have become a prey to any one, who would have oppressed her. This desire
of peace kept Greece a while from the troubles of war, but was the reason, why
she was afterward the sooner subjugated by Philip, whose greatness they had
inconsiderately suffered to increase too much. It becomes then the wisdom of
this Senate* to know, to foresee, and to provide against these dangers, since
your Commonwealth is more concerned therein, then other Potentates, because
the Emperor has so many pretenses to the Towns which she possesses, and may
think, that his designs are chiefly hindered by her, so as he may hope, so to
increase his power by her ruin, as all his other vast designs which he
ruminates upon, may prove the less difficult. But he who shall consider it
well, will find, that the eschewing of these evils, and the true and only
remedy for these threatening ruins, is the King of France his friendship; for he
keeps his weapons in his hands, not to possess what belongs to another, but to
defend himself, his friends, and confederates. He is a Prince of great
Dominions, and mighty in power, but of a benign and moderate mind; generous,
in not suffering injuries and insolences to be done him by any one; but easy
in giving, forgiving, and in conferring grace and favor on all; constant in
his friendship, and one who does carry himself so to his friends and
confederates, as his friendship is an advantage and an ornament unto them, no
grievance nor prejudice. But, that which ought to be most valued by you,
Gentlemen, is, that he is so affectionate to your Commonwealth, and to your
affairs, as thinking his Kingdom concerned in all her fortune. He desires and
endeavors, that there be not only a good understanding betwixt you and him,
but a strict conjunction, and that the common interests of his Kingdom, and
your Commonwealth, may be jointly treated of, both in war and peace.

These words were spoken by the Cardinal in a very grave and affectionate
manner, so as it seemed, they might have made some impression in the Senators;
but no resolute answer being as then (according to the custom of the
Commonwealth) given to the things proposed; when they came afterward to take
them into mature consideration, thinking upon the same reasons, which had
persuaded them to keep Neuters, wherein they had found great good; and not
finding any alteration now, in affairs or respects, they resolved to give the
same answer, which they had formerly done, which was, That the Commonwealth
put a great esteem upon the King of France his friendship, and would be always
very faithful and sincere therein; but that being now in peace with other
Princes, and having suffered much by the late Wars, they neither could nor
would enter into the trouble and expense of a new War. The King was not
satisfied with this answer, but being very desirous to have the Venetians join
with him, in the war which he made against Caesar: The Cardinal going soon
after to Rome, and thinking that he had received encouragement from the Pope,
whereby to make the Venetians put on new resolves, the King caused Bartholomeo
Cavalcanti, a banished Florentine, to go from Rome to Venice, to acquaint the
Senate, how well he found the Pope inclined to the affairs of France, and to
renew the Treaty of League; though the King, that he might take the less
offense, at the so many refusalls given to his offers, cloaking the business,
affirmed afterward, that Cavalcanti came only by the Cardinals appointment.
Cavalcanti had a great wit, and was a great Master of Oratory, as appears by
his Writings, which are now printed. He made an eloquent and long speech, which
was read in the Senate, containing the same things which were formerly
propounded by the Cardinal. But the graver Senators were the more constant to
their first proposition, not listening to these discourses, nor suffering
themselves to be ensnared by fair appearances and proposalls; for that they
understood, a Treaty of peace was begun between the Emperor and the King of
France, which did much impede the King of France his hopes, of having the
Commonwealth join with him, in his continuance of war; and to hinder
Christendom from so great a good, as Peace, and so long desired by all good
men, seemed not to become a Commonwealth, whose actions had always been
upright. Moreover, it appeared not to be a good or useful resolution, to
incense Caesar at a time, when he might be free from all other wars, and resent
injuries. And the Pope, though he, not to make the King of France despair, or
perhaps for some particular end of his own, seemed not averse to confederate
with him; yet employing his whole endeavors upon peace, he had chosen the
chief Cardinals of his Court, to go as his Legates to these Princes; Morone to
the Emperor, and Grimani to the King of France; and at the same time he
exhorted the Venetians, to choose Ambassadors extraordinary, as they had
formerly done upon the like occasion, at the meeting at Niece, to the end, that
their joint endeavors might be of more force, to persuade to so good a thing,
and so becoming the piety of every Christian Prince. But the Senate, though
they would very gladly have seen peace and union between these Princes, yet it
behoved them for several respects, to proceed therein with great caution; for
they had often had their good intentions ill interpreted, at the Courts of
Christian Princes; and the like to be done under false pretenses, and to their
prejudice, at Constantinople. Therefore content with what might be done by
their Ambassadors in ordinary, they avoided these vain and prejudicial
appearances. The Ambassadors, in the relation they made unto the Senate, said,
That in the discourses had between these Princes, concerning peace, they
discovered a great inclination thereunto, being thereunto induced, as they
believed, rather by weariness of war, and by necessity, then for that they had
laid aside their animosities, or out of any desire of friendship or agreement.
For the King of France being at this time in great trouble and danger, by
reason that his Kingdom was assaulted by the King of England, who having landed
a great many men at Callice, was come himself in person, and had laid siege to
Bullen; and for that the Imperial Army, after a long and strict siege, had
taken the Town of St Desire, a frontier, of great importance, upon the River
Matrona; by the getting whereof, way was made for further progress into
France; desired to free himself by agreement, from so many troubles, and to
lessen the numbers and forces of so many enemies. And on the other side, the
Emperor, being highly exhausted of money by so continual Wars, and the danger
of his affairs in Italy increasing, by reason of the numbers of men which were
raised in the King's name, about Mirandola; being also doubtful of the issue
of War, by reason of the many Swissers that were taken into pay by the King,
and which were still added unto his Army; but chiefly being desirous to see the
Duke of Savoy re-possessed of his State, which he had lost in his service,
whereof he had but little hopes, save by way of agreement, by reason of the
convenience the French had to succor, and to put garrisons into the places
which they had taken; and for the affection which those people bare unto the
French, it became him to think of peace, and to desire it. And both these
Princes being thus well disposed, each of them stood expecting, that the motion
should be made to him. Wherefore the Queen of France, who was sister to the
Emperor, sent her Confessor, Father Gabriel Gusman, a Spaniard, to the
Imperial Camp, to the end that he might discourse thereof with the chief
Officers, and might introduce the Treaty, knowing that she therein did what was
acceptable, both to her husband, and to her brother; and that Princes, in the
greatest managements of State, do often lend an ear to people of mean
condition, especially to those of the Clergy, to show, that nothing but
Religion induces them to give ear thereunto. The agreement begun by Gusman,
who passed often between the two Camps, was quickly brought to a good end, so
as the Cardinal Legates came not time enough, to have a hand in it. For the
Admiral of France, and Secretary Baiardo, meeting with Monsieur Granville, and
Don Ferrante Gonsaga, they, in the behalf of their Princes* agreed upon these
conditions: That all Towns which were taken after the Truce at Niece, should be
by both restored, and that any differences that might arise therein, should be
decided by Commissioners, who were to meet for that purpose at Cambrei. That
the King of France should assist Caesar with some Foot and Dragoons, together
with Germany, in case of any war made with the Turks. That the Duke of Savoy
should be restored to all his State, taken from him by the French in the war,
except some Towns, to which the Crown of France laid claim. And that for
establishment of this agreement, the marriage should be made between the Duke
of Orleance, second son to the King of France, with the Emperors daughter, or
with one of his nieces, daughters to Ferdinando, the choice being to depend
upon Caesar, who had four months given him to resolve therein, but with
different portions; for he was to give Flanders, and all the Low Countries,
with his daughter; and with his niece, the State of Millan, with other
conditions concerning it, which were to be regulated, according to diverse
accidents which might fall out. That the Venetians should be nominated in this
peace, as friends both to the King and Emperor, who had proceeded so equally,
as both these Princes were either content, or not dis-satisfied. But it fared
not th^^ with the Pope, of whom the French complained, for that being very
fervent for them, he had not, notwithstanding, done any thing for them, in
their so great need: And the Imperialists, plainly accusing the Pope's
intentions and designs, said, That his not declaring himself openly for the
King of France, was not for any want of will, no^ out of any respect of not
offending Caesar, but for fear of his forces. Insomuch as the Pope's Legates
could not, without much difficulty, obtain, that the Pope should be admitted
into this agreement; which was at last granted, rather out of decency, then out
of any sincere affection, it not being fitting, that the Pope, who is the head
of Christians, should be left out in that Peace, which was said to be made for
the common good of Christendom. This Peace ensuing in a time, and in a manner,
such as was least expected by those, who were best experienced in the
management of affairs, though it was much desired by all, afforded occasion of
many several discourses; the secrets of these Princes not being easily to be
seen into, nor could it be prognosticated, of what continuance it would be;
every one spoke diversely of it, according to their passions, or interests: Nay;
those that had the same relations, did not agree in their judgments. Some
Venetians thought, that this peace would continue long between these Princes;
for the King of France getting thereby the State of Millan, or in lieu thereof
the States of Flanders, a rich Country, and lying very conveniently for the
Crown of France, might now appease his thoughts. And the Emperor, having put
the Duke of Savoy into his State, married his daughter nobly, and into his own
blood, and being now weary of war, might peacefully enjoy the glory he had won,
and his exalted fortune. It was likewise thought, that this Peace, as very
durable, would be acceptable and advantageous to the Commonwealth, for thereby
the power of Christian Princes would be preserved, and they might the better
resist Soliman's so vast Forces, which were bent upon the ruin of
Christendom. And that it made likewise much for her service, that the Forces
and greatness of these two Princes, should be balanced as equally as might
be, which proportion was likely to be destroyed, or weakened, if the war should
have continued, by which the King of France was forced to fight within the
bowels of his own Kingdom, in defense of his own affairs, against powerful
Armies. And moreover, the parting of the Dukedom of Millan or Flanders, from
the so many States, which were fallen to the Crown of Spain, could not but be
commodious for other Princes, who were to be jealous of such greatness. Others
notwithstanding were of another opinion, thinking that this agreement would be
to no purpose; for that Caesar, who would not see France oppressed by the King
of England, which had made him make this agreement, would not likewise suffer
it to increase and flourish by peace, and by the acquisition of so noble
Dominions. And that King Francis, who was naturally very unquiet, nor content
with what he might have got by agreement, but aspiring still after new things,
might very likely give occasion of re-assuming Arms. But say that, this were to
prove a good and true union, the Commonwealth had reason to suspect it, since
so many men as were in these Princes Dominions, could not keep long idle; that
there was no thought of seeing them do any thing against the Turks, since
there was speech already, that they were to send Ambassadors jointly to
Soliman, to treat of Peace, or of a long Truce. That it was likewise to b^
considered, the Commonwealth would be of less esteem, when neither the King
of France, nor Emperor should need her friendship; that the jealousy which
these two Princes had for a long time, to see this Commonwealth join with
either of their Rivalls, or Enemies, whereby either of them might grow more
powerful then the other, had brought much safety and reputation to her
affairs, each of them forbearing in this respect to injure her, or rather
seeming to value her very much, and desirous to make her partial to them. But
in this diversity of private opinions, all men appeared to make public show of
rejoicing for the conclusion of this peace: for which thanks were given to God
with much solemnity, and the wisdom and piety of these Princes were much
commended, every one expecting what fruit it would in time produce.

This mean while Barbarossa being gone from Porto Hercole, to return to
Constantinople, coasting along the Rivers of the Kingdom of of Naples, had
plundered and burnt much, particularly in the Islands of Ischia, and Lipari,
which were almost barbarously destroyed, passing from thence to Corfu; and
being there friendly saluted, he received the accustomed present, dealing
friendly with all men, not suffering any the least injury to be done to the
Islanders. Polino was with the Fleet, who followed it with five Galleys, and
some few Ships, and seeming desirous to come to Venice, the Venetian Commanders
offered to conduct him thither with their Galleys: but afterward, changing his
mind, and accompanying the Turks as far as Lepanto; he returned with his
Vessels to Marcelles. The Turks were much troubled at the news of Peace between
Christian Princes, thinking it might hinder their going against Hungary, or
Transylvania, for which enterprise they did already prepare. But they sought to
conceal this their displeasure, the better to sustain their reputation, being
accustomed to make little account of Christians. They did not only therefore
not forbear their former intentions, but made greater preparations then usual,
by publishing, to make War the next spring against the House Austria; and yet
they said at the same time, that if the Ambassadors of these Princes should
come to that Court, they should be willingly received and heard; for by their
Law none was refused to be heard, who came to demand friendship, and peace,
from their Grand Siginor. The terror of their Arms being increased by the news
of these preparations and the late ruins, made Caesar and Ferdinando, hasten
their resolution of sending people expressly to that Court, to treat of
Agreement; And to make their way the more easy, they got the King of France to
send a servant of his, to discover what Soliman, and his Bashaw's minds might
be therein and to desire a safe conduct for their Ambassadors. The King
accepted this employment willingly, as well in respect of the Articles he was
entered into by the last Capitulation, of assisting Caesar upon any occasion of
warring with the Turks, as also to acquit himself in part of that infamy which
lay upon him, of making use of the forces of Infidels against Christians, he
himself being a Christian Prince. Wherefore his Ambassador acquainting them of
Venice, with his departure for Constantinople, told them by order from his
King, that his King kept friendship with the Turks, to no other end, but that
upon such occasions, he might make use thereof for the good of Christendom. He
therefore sent a Gentleman of his, one Monsieur Dalla Vigna, to Soliman, to
effect this, who found him very ready to grant all that was desired, not out of
any desire to pleasure the King, but for his own peculiar interests; for new
Tumults were raised upon the confines of Persia, which necessitated him to turn
his Forces into those parts, to resist that warlike Nation.

The safe conduct being gotten, which was in the beginning of the year 1545.
Girollomo Adorno, went to Constantinople in Ferdinando's name, who going from
Vienna, took his way by Servia Valaschi^, and Bogdania. But the Emperor having
chosen Doctor Girardo for this employment, made him go first to Venice, and
being accompanied by Monsieur di Monl^ch, who was at that time the Kings
Ambassador in that City; they went to the Court at Constantinople, being
carried by the Commonwealths Galleys to Rag^gi. These men, before their
departure, had requested the Sena^e in their Prince's name, that they would
enterpose themselves by the means of their Consul, which they did, and he
readily obeyed, but so dexterously, as the Turks might not suspect his words,
nor actions, whereby more harm might have insued to the Commonwealth, then
good to any others; for it was very certain, that by reason of false
imputations laid upon the Venetians, by those who did either seek to disturb
their quiet, or to make use thereof in some other of their occasions; those
people being naturally jealous, did so suspect the Venetians friendship and
fidelity, as they watched diligently over their ways. At the same time an
accommodation was treated of at Venice, of the differences which yet remained
undecided between Ferdinando, and the Commonwealth, as well in old affairs,
(no means being as yet found to fulfill the decree of Trent) as touching the
more recent differences of Marano. For which Treaties, Doctor Antonio Queta,
who had been there many times before, was sent again to Venice, where many
things were treated of concerning those businesses; and it was at last
concluded, that as for the affairs of Trent, Commissioners should be sent, who
should end those differences upon the place: Francisco Michaele, Advocate of
the Treasury, one who was well informed of the public interest, was chosen by
the Venetians for this Employment; and the Major and Captain of Istria, for
what belonged to that Territory, the Major of Cividale for those of Friuli; and
the Captains of Vicenza, and Verona, for the confines of Trent. But the
business of M^rano was referred to be discust at Caesar's Court, whereof one of
the chief conditions was, that the Venetians should pay 75000 Ducats to
Ferdinando, which when other differences should be accorded, they promised to
pay in three years, by three equal proportions. These Treaties, though they
wrought not the accommodation that was expected, were notwithstanding
malignantly interpreted by such as went about sowing of discord, and were
reported to Soliman as Treaties of Leagues against him, and in favor of
Ferdinando, to whom the Turks said, that the Venetians gave this money, to
raise Soldiers, according to the obligation they had undertaken: the which
reports, being afterward justified to be false, by the truth of the action,
and Soliman being saitisfied, it was not thought good to give him new occasions
of jealousies; wherefore the Consul forbear visiting the Ambassadors, and all
other public demonstrations, though he forbore not to do all good offices that
he could in his private discourses with the Bashaws, that the Agreement might
proceed; wherein, because the Commonwealth had no other end then the common
good and quiet, the Senators desired the Bashaw, that Caesar and Ferdinando
might be bound not to wage War in Italy during the Truce; but Rusten Bashaw
hearing this proposal, and being desirous to do something, to the particular
satisfaction and advantage of the Commonwealth, said, he would have her named
in what soever agreement should be made, as a friend to the Grand Seigneur;
nay, that it should be declared in express words, that the State of Venice
should not be molested during that Agreement, by those Princes that were
therein comprehended; and that if it should happen otherwise, the Agreement
with Soliman should be taken as broken; and yet there was an opinion, that the
Venetians opposed the Truce, which, there being no hopes of Peace, was treated
of: wherefore Caesar made his Ambassador Mendosa, return from Trent to Venice,
not cloaking this suspicion, but attesting howsoever his great good will to the
Commonwealth, and praying the Senate to favor the treaty of Truce, which was
said to be already well begun at Constantinople, and would be the easilier
brought to a good end by the assistance of the Commonwealth, promising to make
her be named therein on their behalf, and included as a friend. These things
made the Venetians the more desirous to endeavor a suspension of Arms between
these Princes, because besides other no small considerations, they thereby
received much safety and honor, being to be declared friends to both Parties,
and to receive and enjoy the benefit of peace, which might arise from that
Agreement, which made the Senators more zealous in interposing their Authority,
knowing very well how much it might make for them, to make the Turks believe
that she was in good esteem with the Christian Princes, and the same Christian
Princes that she was so valued by the Turks, as that they were steadfastly
resolved to keep peace with her. It was thought the Emperor did so very much
endeavor the conclusion of this Truce with the Turks, because he was not only
out of all hopes of being assisted by the German forces against them, but
enforced to take up Arms against the chief Lords and States of Germany, who
contaminating both sacred and profane things, to the great disparagement of
the Church of Rome, and Majesty of the Empire, did daily plot more Novelties,
breaking forth into open Rebellion: Wherefore the Emperor, who to purchase
their loves had formerly yielded, not without the Popes resentment, that the
Council should be held in the City of Trent, with great prerogatives on the
Germans behalf, did afterward repent himself, knowing that he had done
little good to the cause of Religion, lost much ground with the Pope, and
gotten nothing with Germany, and sought to moderate the conditons, whereupon
the Council was to meet; he therefore sent his Ambassador, Don Diego de
Mendosa, to the Commonwealth, to bridle the liberty which some of the most
licencious, and worst affected toward the Court of Rome, used. But the
Venetians knowing that the calling of the Council was not acceptable to the
Pope, as being done at an unseasonable time, and in an unfitting place, and in
a manner little becoming the dignity and authority of the Apostolic Sea
thought they would not openly oppose it, would not send their Ambassadors
thither: But the Agreement at Constantinople, which was so hopefully brought
near a conclusion of Truce for many years, no way of accommodation being to be
found, for the difficulties which arose touching the restoring of some little
Castles in Hungary, ended in a short suspension of Arms for but one year; but
with intention, as it was said, and written also from Salamons self to the
King of France, that things being better debated at Ferdinando's Court, the
Ambassadors were to return again the next year to the Court at Constantinople,
with new Commissions, to establish peace for a longer time.

New dislikes arose this mean while, between the Turks and Venetians, upon
occasion of the Confines of Dalmatia, where the Sangiacchi of Bossina, and
Clissa, desiring to trouble the quiet, for their own advantage, or else to
pillage the Country, or to make the Venetians give them something to avoid
those troubles, went about to usurp a good part of the Territory of Zara;
alleging, that a Country which contained 49 Towns, did belong to the Towns of
Nadino, and Urana, as the proper Territories thereof, which being by the last
conventions granted to belong to the Grand Seigneur; they said their
Territories belonged unto him too, wherefore they threatened the Inhabitants of
these places, upon pain of great penalties, not to acknowledge any other
Government then Solimans. This did much trouble the Venetians, this Country
being of great concernment both in it self, and for the preservation of the
City of Zara. And though their claim was clear, for Nadino and Urana, being
small Castles, have no peculiar Country; but the Towns thereabout make up a
Country, together with Zara, the chief City of that Province; yet by reason of
the strange and insolent proceeding of the Turks in such like affairs, laying
claim to any whatsoever Country, whereupon the Grand Seigneurs Horse has once
set his foot; they feared this might be the occasion of longer and greater
trouble. But Soliman being acquainted with the business, referred the
examination of the difference over to the Sangiacco of Chersego, and to two
Cadi's; (these are the ordinary Judges in point of justice) and what they
should determine should be done, who were to meet upon the place to that
purpose, with the Representatives of the Commonwealth. The Senate chose Luigi
Reniero for this employment, who handled the business with such dexterity and
wisdom, as the possession of that whole Territory which was in question, was
left free and quiet to the Commonwealth. And new difficulties being raised
again upon what had already been decided, according to the Turkish custom,
Reniero, as being well acquainted with the business, was sent Consul to
Constantinople, who making our claim appear clear to Soliman, did not only
obtain that these pretensions should never be any more questioned, but that
some other Towns formerly usurped, and till then enjoyed by the Turks, should
together with the 49 Towns be restored to the Venetians. So great a friend was
this Prince to what was just and honest, unless he were misled by false
suggestions. This year the Doge, Pietro Lando, dyed, leaving behind him the
reputation of a good and wise Prince; and Francisco Donato was chosen Prince in
his place. Nor did any thing else worth memory happen this year.

The next year, 1546. those who desired the peace of Italy, were sorely afraid,
that she would quickly return to her former troubles; for the peace between the
Emperor and the King of France, not having effected the most important
affairs, which were agreed upon between them, it remained so loose, that
nothing but opportunity of time was expected, to make them reassume Arms; both
their forces and thoughts for the present, being otherwise employed. The King
of France, by the unseasonable death of his son, the Duke of Orleans, could not
obtain the Dukedom of Millan, promised him in consideration of the marriage;
but his ancient desire of possessing it was no whit lessened. Nor was the Duke
of Savoy re-possessed of his Towns, the King detaining them under various
excuses, hoping to satisfy Caesar some other way. An other novelty likewise
happened, which was thought, would add fuel to this fire of war, which was a
kindling: The Pope finding his other designs, for the agrandising of his
house, prove vain, the City of Parma and Piacenza being severed from the
Church, which were thereunto joined by Julius the 2d. gave them in fee-farm to
his son Pier Luigi, obliging him to pay 8000 Crowns a year for them, by way of
tribute; and in lieu thereof, to yield up the Dukedom of Camerino, and the
Signiory of Nepi, wherein his son Octavio was but a little before invested, to
the Apostolic Sea. Caesar was so much displeased hereat, as he could by no
means be brought to assent thereunto, nor give way to the investment thereof,
desired of him by the Pope, as being Lord of the State of Millan, whereof these
two Cities had wont to be a member. This obdurancy of Caesar did so alienate
Piero Luigi's heart from him, who was formerly sufficiently inclined to the
French, as it was thought, he would embrace any occasion that should be
offered, to witness his ill will, and to damnifie Caesar. The Pope being for
these respects grown suspected by both sides, and equally mistrusting both
Caesar and the King of France; but being notwithstanding resolved, come what
will come, to make good what he had done, touching the settling of the new
Dukedom upon his son, he had much discourse with the Venetian Ambassador,
showing in what danger the affairs of Italy would be, as soon as the King of
France should have rid his hands of war with the King of England, with whom he
was in treaty of peace: Or when Caesar, having reduced the Protestant Princes to
his obedience, at the Diet at Ratisbone, should have no need to take up Arms
against them. He therefore desired, that the Senate would join in close
intelligence with him, concerning the common interests; and in sign of greater
confidence, he made the new Duke send Agostino di Laudi, as his Ambassador, to
Venice, who acquainting the Senate with the dignity conferred upon him, offered
both himself and State to be at the Commonwealth's service. Correspondence was
had hereunto in a friendly manner, but in general terms,, which might not any
ways oblige, nor whereby the Pope might be the more encouraged, to do any
thing upon these hopes, which might disquiet Italy. But minding their own
defense, and providing for what might happen, the Senate took Guido Ubaldo,
Duke of Urbin, into the service of the Commonwealth, with the title of Captain
General of the Militia, allowing him 5000 Crowns a year pay for himself, and
15000 for a hundred Curassiers, and a hundred light Horse, which he was bound
to have always in a readiness for the Commonwealth's service.

But Italy's safety consisted, in the troubles which were to continue between
the Emperor, and the King of France; for the latter could not, by any forces,
though very great both by sea and land, and by hazarding all fortunes, recover
the City of Bullen from the English, who were resolved not to restore it upon
agreement. And Caesar having assembled the Protestant Princes in the Diet at
Ratisbone, to treat of things touching Religion, could do no good upon them,
though he went there himself in person. But whereas they first seemed
contented, that the Council should be held in Trent, promising to send their
Doctors thither, to treat of the points of Faith, and to stand to what should
there be decided; they now demanded, that a National Council might be called
in Germany, which being afterward reduced to Trent, that the meeting might be
in all parts free; and other more exorbitant things. Whereby the Pope argued,
that making use of this occasion, he needed not to fear the Council, but might
secure his son in Parma and Piacenza; since both Caesar, and the Princes, and
people of Germany, had turned their thoughts elsewhere, and were to end bitter
contestations by war. He therefore began to incite Caesar, by frequent messages,
who was already sufficiently incenst against many German Princes and Cities,
exhorting him, for his honors sake, to take up Arms against those Rebels, and
promising him great assistance, not only by concession of many boones in
Cesar's States, but by contributing a great many Foot and Horse, to be paid by
the Apostolic Sea. The Senate had at first a hand in this business, seeking,
as they formerly had done, to slacken the Pope's fervor, in undertaking this
war, whereby they thought Italy might receive prejudice, and no certain hopes,
that the affairs of Religion would fare the better by force; for whole Germany,
a great and powerful Province, being, as it was said, to concur therein,
whereof many of the chief Hans-Towns had already declared for the Protestant
Princes, who were risen, for fear, ^est the Emperor might, under other
pretenses, bereave them of their liberty; and the name of the Pope being grown
greatly hateful in Germany, there was reason to fear, that that warlick Nation
might overflow Italy, and they be prejudiced thereby, who had no hand in that
commotion. Or if Caesar should subdue Germany, his forces and reputation growing
greater by this victory, his power would be more dangerous for the Princes of
Italy. But afterward, knowing the Pope's resolutenesse herein, and that being
carried away by two powerful affections, fear and hope, touching State
respects, and his own greatness, and the like of his family, he would not be
brought to listen to any other counsel.

The Senate forbear any such courses, and rather sought to go by the way of
diversion, in the discourses which were often held with them to this purpose,
by the Pope's and Cesar's Ambassadors; that they might not offend Caesar
without any advantage, by advising him against the enterprise; or, by
commending it, make him demand more express aids of them. Notwithstanding all
this, it was said, that the Commonwealth was comprehended in the League, which
was made at Rome, which some did so assuredly aver, as in the notes which were
publicly given about, of the confederates contributions, and of the
preparations for war, five thousand Foot were reckoned to be paid by the
Venetians; who being desirous to satisfy these Princes, in what might neither
cost them moneys nor trouble, did, upon request, willingly grant passage to the
Pope's Soldiers, who being mustered in Bolog^^a, to the number of 12000 Foot,
and 500 Horse, were to pass to Trent, through the territories of Verona; and
the like was done to Cesar's Soldiers, they being furnished with victuals,
and all other conveniences. The Pope's Army was made up of the best Soldiers
of Italy, and commanded by valiant Captains; of all which, the Pope's nephew,
Ottavio Fernese, was General; a young man, but of great hopes, and who had been
trained up some few years before in the Militia, when he went with his father
in Law the Emperor to the Affrican wars. But people from several Nations were
flocked to Cesar's Army, and many out of Germany her self, drawn out of the
Patrimoniall States of the House of Austria, and out of those of the Dukes of
Bavier and Cleves, and of the Marquis of Brandeburg; which Princes adhered unto
the Emperor: So as he might muster about 40000 Foot, and 5000 Horse. At the
same time the protestant Princes, whose chief Commanders were John Frederick,
Duke of Saxony, Elector of the Empire; and Philip Lansgrave of Hesse,
endeavored to get more Lords and German Cities to join with them, and used
all the means they could to increase their numbers, making profession to defend
the liberty of Germany, and causing those who joined with them, to swear
fidelity to the Empire, which they said, Caesar would possess himself of, as of
his own peculiar State, and turn it into a tyrannical Government. Wherefore
many chief Lords and Cities, embracing this as the common cause, took up Arms
against Caesar, as, the Duke of Wittemburg, the Count Palatine, the Communalty
of Argentine, ^lms, Franckfort, and Noremburg, the City of Auspurge being long
before declared. These sent their Ambassadors to Ulms, where a Diet was
intimated, to treat particularly of preparations for war, any where there was
such a concourse of almost all Germany, as thed soon got an Army of 80000 Foot,
and 10000 Horse, with which Forces they hoped the rather to beat Caesar, and to
drive him (as they said) out of Germany; for that they saw, he could not raise
any considerable Army of Germans; they only apprehended foreign soldiers, and
chiefly the Pope's Italian Foot, which they being desirous to keep from
coming, they writ very earnestly to the Venetian Senate, declaring the
good will they bore to the Commonwealth, which was highly esteemed by the
whole German Nation; desiring them, that they would not afford passage to those
people, which the Emperor sought to bring in to their prejudice, and to
enslave all Germany, to the pernicious example of all other Countries. The
Senate replied to this, That they did very much cherish the friendship of those
Princes, and of all those people, to whom they had always corresponded with
like affection, and esteem of their particular persons, and of the whole noble
German Nation. But that their Country being plain and open, they could not
hinder soldiers from passing through it, unless by strong force of Arms,
which their Commonwealth was not wont to do, unless to their declared
enemies. Soon after, there came particular Letters from the Duke of Saxony, and
from the Lansgrave, wherein declaring their designs, and their necessities,
and that they had taken up Arms in their own defense, they desired to be
befriended by the Commonwealth, with a certain sum of money. Which desires of
theirs were much furthered and assisted by the King of England, who employed
his secretary therein, he being then resident in Venice, who presented these
Letters. The King was moved to defend the cause of these men, though not
altogether openly, either for their joint dissenting from the Church of Rome,
or for that he was not well pleased with Caesar, for the agreement with France,
and that he was troubled at his greatness. But the Senate continuing their
wonted answers, said, That they esteemed those Princes as their very good
friends, and wished them all good success; but that they could not pleasure
them in this, lest they should offend other princes, whose peace and friendship
they desired to preserve. These respects being set aside, the Senate seemed
very well minded toward the German Nation. Also when the City of Auspurge had
by express Letters recommended their Merchants to the protection of the
Commonwealth, many whereof were already in Venice, and others came thither
daily in greater numbers, by reason of these commotions, that their persons and
goods might be safe. For after this City had declared enmity to the Emperor,
they had received ill usage in other Cities, where they had been for their own
private affairs. Answer was made, that the people of that City, and all other
people, had always been welcome, and well received, as if they had been their
own Citizens, and that they would still keep all terms of justice and civility
with them. The City of Venice keeps always great commerce with Germany,
because of many things which come from the Levant, which the Germans have need
of, and which are brought unto them by Venetian Merchants ships, as Spices,
Cottons, and several other Merchandises; and likewise many other things, which
grow abundantly in their Country, are brought to Venice, and carried from
thence to other parts, to the great advantage of private men, and of the
public customs; wherefore for the better convenience of the German Nation,
there was long before this, a great and Noble Palace, or Warehouse built in
Venice, upon the Rialto, standing upon the Canale Majore, in the fairest and
most frequented place of all the City, where usually many of this Nation are,
and whereof many of them, finding themselves so well treated, live all their
life, choosing this City for their Country, where they purchase Estates, and
build particular Houses to themselves.

Whilst all sides were thus intent upon making War, and that a mass of
Soldiers being got together, they were ready to march, news was given out that
peace was made; and though the conclusion thereof was not certain, it was most
certain, that messengers were employed on both sides to treat thereof; whereat
the Venetians were not a little troubled, considering that when so great Armies
were in Italy, they might peradventure betake themselves to other enterprises,
and, other States being unprovided, might cause much apprehension in them all.
Therefore the Pope, fearing lest the Senate might join in some straiter
friendship, and Intelligence with some others, which might be contrary to his
designs; discourst long with the State's Ambassador, showing that he had been
always desirous to keep the peace of Italy for the Common good, but that he
had continually had a particular eye to what might concern the Commonwealth's
safety and greatness; he wished him therefore to assure the Senate of his
good will, and that he would keep good intelligence with him still, which would
be the way to preserve both their States, and the rest of Italy quiet. That he
had renewed this his desire purposely at this time, when he himself being
armed, and free from offense, it might be believed, that it was not fear, but
true zeal which made him thus unbowel himself unto them. But the endeavors of
Peace proving vain, the Armies of both sides were drawn into the field, in one
and the same Country; for though the Protestants (which was the denomination
they gave themselves, who were in league against the Emperor, by reason of
their protestations made in matter of Religion) endeavoring to do that for
themselves, which they could not get others to do; to wit, to stop the passage
of such as came against them through Italy, had possessed themselves of the
Castle of Chiusa, in the County of Tiroll, placed amongst the Mountains, by
which way they thought the Enemy was to pass. But the Papal, and Imperial
Army, being gone by the way of Isprach, were entered into Bavaria, and were
passed from thence toward Ratisbone, where the Emperor waited for them with
more men. Both sides stood a long while idle, each of them expecting some
advantage: And though the two Armies were often approached so near one
anoother, as great skirmishes past (...) them in face of both the Armies; yet
they came not to a join battle, which Caesar wisely sought to evade, that he
might draw the business out in length, and so break the Enemy, who had
several Commanders; and were of several opnions; as he did. For the people
and Soldiers beginning to fall from their first high conceits of being able
quickly to overcome and chase Caesar; and being troubled with the great
contributions for war, and King Ferdinando being at the same time entered with
an other great Army into the State of Duke John Frederick, accompanied and
adhered unto by Duke Maurice of Saxony, who was Fredericks Enemy; the Enemy was
so confused and terrified, as suffering many Castles to be taken within fight
of their Army, and the Army beginning already to moulder away of it self.
Charles the Emperor with unexpected success, was able in a short time to
bring that dangerous War, by unexpected success, to a good end. For having by
this his first good fortune won much reputation, many Princes, and Hans-Towns,
came in unto him, and craved his pardon, so as in a few months space he had
subdued a great Tract of ground, belonging to powerful Princes, and warlike
people; a thing which he could hardly have hoped to have done, with much
hazard, and in a long time. The War being thus ended for this year, and winter
being already come on, Caesar dismissed the Pope's Forces, who being disbanded,
returned for Italy; and Cardinal Alexander Fernese, the Popes Nepew, who was
his Legate in the Camp, being to return for Rome, would take Venice in his
way: where though he understood he was to be received with great honor, yet he
resolved to come thither privately; but he was so joyfully seen, and honored
by all, and so complemented both in public and private, as he departed very
well satisfied. The Cardinal was much favored and beloved by the Venetians,
not only for his being so near in blood to the Pope, but for his noble
qualities, and for that he was lately received into the number of the Gentlemen
of Venice: For not long before, at the Popes desire, the honor of being a
noble Venetian, was conferred upon the Family of the Fernese's, an honor
highly esteemed by persons of the best degree, by reason of the Antiquity of
the Commonwealth, and for the unblemisht reputation she holds of liberty, with
the dignity and authority of no small Dominion: and since some mention happens
to be made thereof here, it will not be amiss to understand some particulars
touching it.

Those are called noble Venetians, who partake of the Government of the
Commonwealth, that is, who have authority to choose, and may themselves be
chosen public Magistrates, which power is gotten by birth, not by the usual
way of votes. For he that is born of Noble Parents, is Noble, and at a certain
time, and in a manner prefixed by the Laws, may enter into the great Council,
wherein the usual disposal of Magistrates is made. Such are admitted into
this order, who either have descended from the first inhabiters of the City,
and who have more eminent then others for worth, or wealth, have from the
beginning had the mannaging of public affairs; or such as have at several
times, and by various accidents, been received thereinto for ^ome famous and
signal service done for the good of the Commonwealth, who for the most part
are of noble Families of other Countries; or some others, who have the honor
of this order conferred upon them, out of particular grace and favor, wherein
such a measure is notwithstanding kept, as it is only granted to Lords of
great quality: and by this way were the Families of Este, of Gonsaga, and some
other chief Families of Italy, admitted thereinto; and Henry King of France,
being at Venice the year 1574. amongst many other honors received that of a
Noble-Venetian, which he seemed to be very well pleased withal. And it has
been the endeavors of many Popes in these latter times, to get their Families
admitted into the Venetian Nobility, esteeming it a great honor to them in
prosperous fortune, and in adverse fortune, a safe refuge. This honor is
continued in all those that descend from any one that has once been received
into this Order, and great care is had, that it be preserved pure and
immaculate: so as it is required, that in the birth of those that are admitted
into the great Council, the Fathers nobility be not only considered, but that
they be born in lawful Marriage, and of no mean woman, but of one of good
condition. The charge whereof is particularly committed to a chief Magistrate,
called, L'Auogaria del Commune, who keeps Books, wherein the names of all the
Nobles that have been from the beginning, are written. Into this order was the
Family of the Ferneses thus received, at the importunity of Pope Paul the
Third, and has ever since been, and is still, esteemed a friend and confident
to the Commonwealth.

But to return to our Narration. Caesar was mightily cried up every where, for
the successes of Germany; his glory therein being the greater, for that by this
act he witnessed to the world, that the victories which he had won by the
German Forces, were gotten by his own worth and felicity; since the same, who
whilst they fought under his guidance and fortune, were Victors, when they
became his enemies, were subdued and overcome by him: and though, to quench the
remainders of this War, there remained nothing but his overcoming of Duke
Frederick and the Lansgrave, who dispairing of pardon, as having been the heads
of these Tumults, continued in their contumacy against Caesar; yet it was easily
seen that their Forces were not sufficient to hold out long against so
victorious a Prince. Upon better considerations, the Pope found by this
business, that the Venetians had advised him well, which made him praise the
Senate's wisdom therein: He saw that none of these things had succeeded, which
he had propounded to himself. The Council was still open, though some
Prelates were gone from thence, by reason of the Wars approaching: nay it grew
more dangerous for him, for that Caesar desired to give some satisfaction to the
people of Germany, whereby to continue them in his devotion, by waging War out
of Italy. Nor was Duke Pier Luigi very safe, since the Emperor was so soon to
be rid of that war, which was thought would have continued longer: and in the
opinion of men, he was cheated in the glory which he hoped to purchase to his
name; for it was wholly attributed to Charles, who by his wit and worth, had
overcome all difficulties. Therefore recalling his men from the Imperial
Camp, he openly complained, that Caesar had not shared the advantages of war
with him, by giving him part of the moneys, which were paid by those that
compounded; nor having communicated the most important advices of peace or war
to him, nor his representatives, as he ought to have done, since he shared in
the expense and hazard. But on the other side, Caesar said, that the Pope had
failed him in his promise, and devoire, since, the war not being yet fully
ended which he had undertaken, chiefly at his entreaty, and by his advice, he
had recalled his men, whereby he did not only deprive him of that aid, but did
diminish the forces and reputation of his Army, whereby there was yet a great
strength of men to be overcome in Germany, under the conduct of John Frederick,
and of the Lansgrave; the one of which, for the ancient blood of Saxony, and
the other, by reason of the love the people bore him, would be able to raise so
great an Army, as without due providing for the contrary, might yet question
the victory. These things did Caesar amplify, either to draw the Pope to a new
contribution of Moneys or Foot, or to get leave, as he had often desired, to
make use of the revenues of the Church in Spain, for this war; or peradventure
to make his victories appear the greater, by magnifying the forces of the
enemy. But the Pope, being far from favoring Cesar's designs any further,
preferred the apprehension of his greatness, and his being very ill satisfied
with him, before all other respects.

But the occasions of dividing the Pope from the Emperor, grew much greater
the next year, 1547. For Cesar's power and reputation daily increasing, he grew
the more ambitious of Government. He did so prosper in Germany, as bringing the
Duke of Saxony to Battle, not affording him time to withdraw into the strong
holds in his own Country, as he designed to do, he won such a victory, as he
thereby put an end to the war, the Duke being taken prisoner, and his forces so
utterly defeated, as the Lansgrave dispairing to save himself by force of Arms,
or by any other means, put himself willingly into Cesar's hands, who possessing
himself of the Forts of Hessen, detained him prisoner. So as all things being
peaceable and quiet in Germany, he entered as it were in triumph into Auspurg,
where he summoned a Diet from all the parts of Germany, wherein he obtained
many things for his advantage and satisfaction; amongst the rest, a great
contribution from all the Princes and Haun^e-Towns, whereby to take 20000 Foot,
and 4000 Horse into pay, for the service of the Empire; wherein he comprehended
his own patrimoniall estate, and the like of his Family: Betwixt which, and the
Princes, and Haun^e-Towns of Germany, a perpetual League was made for the
common defense. Yet these his great prosperities, did not at all quench his
thirsting after new acquisitions and glory; his chief aim was at Italy, and
together with other higher designs, to settle himself fast in the State of
Millan, whither he sent great store of Artillery, which were presented him by
diverse German Lords; and afterward a good number of Spanish Foot, making of
them an ordinary Garrison in that State, esteeming them most faithful to him.
He also made the people swear fealty to him, and to whomsoever he should name
to be Lord over them, intending that Government to his son Philip, who to that
end, was to go quickly for Italy. And he treated still with the Swissers,
capitulating with them to defend the State of Millan. He moreover had placed a
guard of 400 Spanish Foot in Sienna, and an Officer of his, who exercised much
authority in many things, and attempted to build a Fort there, intending, as it
was thought, to bring them under the yoke of servitude, for the which,
occasions were not wanting, by reason of commotions raised in the City; the
people whereof not being able to see themselves inslaved, had driven out the
Spanish Foot, and done many other things, contrary to Cesar's dignity. He
sought also to possess himself of the Town of Piombino, and to take it from
the Lord thereof, upon several pretenses, promising to recompense him with
other territories; that he might make use of that situation, which lay upon
the Sea-cost of Tuscany; and was very commodious in other respects, for affairs
at Sea. But above all other things, the taking of Piacenza, which was done, as
shall be said, together with the death of Duke Pier Luigi, caused fear in all
men, and particular affliction in the Pope; and two of the prime Princes of
Christendom, Francis the first of France, and Henry the eighth of England's
death, which ensued not long after one another, all things seemed to smile upon
Caesar: For these Princes, of great power, and mature counsel, being taken
away, he remained in supreme authority, and sole arbitrator of affairs. The
King of France his death begot more alteration in thought, than in effect; for
Henry his third son, coming by the death of the Dolphin, and of the Duke of
Orleance, to the Crown, who was brought up under his father's discipline, and
did inherit his affections, especially his hatred to Caesar, appeared soon ready
to tread in his fathers foot-st^ps, and not to yield any ways to Charles his
fortune. But the King of France his death was severally interpreted by the
Italians; some thought, that the occasion of many troubles to Italy was taken
away, which by reason of his unquiet nature, of the bitter hatred which he bore
to Caesar, and of his obstinate resolution of getting the Dukedom of Millan, was
never to have an end, but by his death. Others were of a contrary opinion, who
thought, the new King would not so soon forego his fathers resolutions and
enterprises; which though he should do, they thought, that more prejudice then
advantage, would redound thereby to the Italians, who, the counterpoise of the
French forces being taken away, were, with little cure to their liberty, to
depend the more upon the Spaniards will. Some in Venice did, with much grief,
call to mind, the love which the late King bore to the Commonwealth, his
readiness to assist her, in her lowest ebb of fortune, and chiefly his
assisting her, in the recovery of Verona. They likewise alleged, as signs of
his good will, his having so often desired a new conjunction with the
Commonwealth, not being any ways scandalized at his so many repulses, which
had won no small honor to the Commonwealth, and had made her be the better
esteemed by Cesar's self. Others, not without some bitterness of spirit,
remembered the fickleness used by this King, upon many occasions, and his
great ingratitude toward the Commonwealth, which having with much readiness
taken up Arms, and exposed her self to so much expense and hazard of war, first
for his own freedom, and then for the like of his sons, from Cesar's hands, had
been so scornfully abandoned by him, as that in his agreement made with Caesar,
he had made peace, not only without making any mention of her, but with much
prejudice to her affairs, and not acquainting her with any such resolution: And
that the estimation he seemed to put upon the Commonwealth, proceeded only
from his own interests; which when they were severed from those of the
Commonwealth, he valued her honor nor safety no longer. Yet in this variety
of opinions, all agreed, in preserving friendship with the Crown of France, as
they had done of late years, without quitting their Neutrality: Wherefore as
soon as they heard of King Francis his death, they chose two Ambassadors,
Vector Grimani, and Matteo Dandelo, who were to go forthwith for France, to
condole, according to custom, with the new King, and Court-Lords, and then to
congratulate the King's succession to the Crown; affirming, that the
Commonwealth was willing and ready to continue peace, with the same
observancy, with Henry, as they had done with his father, and according to the
usual and ancient affection, born by the Venetians to the Crown of France. The
Italians made less account of Henry's of England's death, he being less
interessed in the affairs of Italy, by reason of the far distance of his State;
but the Venetians valued the friendship of that King and Kingdom, more then the
rest; not for any reason of State, but for that by holding good intelligence
with the English, they received many conveniences in their Merchandising; for
diverse sorts of Merchandise were usually sent from Venice to England, so as the
commerce with that Nation, was very advantageous to the Venetian-Citizens, and
Merchants: Wherefore the Commonwealth kept usually an Ambassador in Ordinary
in England; who being upon some occasions removed, in the time of war with
France, upon the ensuing peace, the same King desired the Ambassador might
return; and Bernardo Navagiero was chosen for that employment, whose journey
was stopped by Henry's death, who, by reason of this commerce, had taken a great
affection to the Venetians, and did much favor the affairs of the
Commonwealth, in her times of greatest trouble, as may be known by the
precedent Narrations. And though being altered in his own conditions, his mind
was sometimes altered in this point, and his friendship lessened, he continued
notwithstanding, to make much of those of the Nation, particularly of the
Nobility, in whom, upon many occasions, he did confide, in many most important
businesses; and lately, in the Treaty of peace with France, he made use of
Francesco Bernardo, a young man, full of spirit, who for some occasions of his
own, kept in that Kingdom, and past often, by order from the King, into France,
and was the chief instrument in making the peace. King Henry was succeeded by
his son Edward, who not being yet eleaven years old, the government of the
Kingdom was put into the hands of some of the chief Barons. The Senate chose
Dominico Bolani, their Ambassador for England, who met with excellent
correspondency in the chief Lords, and those of greatest authority, touching
the maintenance of friendship and commerce with the Venetians, with promises of
giving fair entertainment to all Venetians, who should come to that Island. But
the peace between the English and the French lasted but a while, the
Inhabitants of both Nations being naturally enemies; for the King of Scotland
having left one only daughter, heir to his Kingdom, King Edward's Governors
desired, she might be married to their King, so as those two Kingdoms might be
joined under one Government, as they are joined in neighborhood. But the Scots
abhorring to be brought under the obedience of the King of England, to preserve
the honor of their Kingdom, and through a natural hatred which they bear to
all the English, would not give ear thereunto, and had recourse to France for
help, if the English should endeavor to compel them by force of Arms,
promising their Queen to Henry, for wise to one of his sons, together with the
succession of that Kingdom; and obliging themselves to bring her into France,
as a pledge of their fidelity. These offers were the readilier accepted by King
Henry, who took upon him the protection of the Infant-Queen, and of the Kingdom
of Scotland: For that being desirous of acquiring new Dominions, he was not
well pleased with the agreement made by his father, whereby the City of Bullen
was to remain in possession of the English: So that a bitter war began already
to be kindled between these two Kingdoms. Those that dreaded Cesar's power, did
much dislike, to see the new King busied in this enterprise, whereby he was to
give over the thoughts of Italy, and leave Caesar free, to prosecute his own
designs: But of all others, the Pope was most troubled hereat, who not only
for the common cause, but for his own private interests also, had designed to
bridle Cesar's greatness, by the French forces: He therefore resolved to send
Cardinal St. George into France, to procure, as it was given out, that the
French Prelates might come to the Council of Bullognia; but indeed, to make
the King set his mind to oppose Cesar's greatness, offering him therein his
friendship and assistance. Whereunto Henry willingly listened, as he, who being
strangely ambitious of warlick glory, would not let any occasion slip, of
making war, upon hopes of doing some remarkable action; for which, the Pope was
thought a very fit instrument, in regard of his forces, for the opportunity of
affairs in Italy, and much more in respect of his authority. Wherefore being
easily persuaded to attempt novelties, he set his mind upon increasing his
faction in Italy, by all means that he might, and to gain friends; and amongst
the rest, he sent for Pietro Strozzi, whom he honored with the Order of St.
Michael, which was then in great esteem, and given only to people of great
birth* and such as had deserved very well of the Crown of France; esteeming him
for the vivacity of his spirit, for his being an enemy to quietness, and for
his being greatly followed by outlawed Florentines and others, to be an apt
instrument, to make some important commotion, for the service of the Crown of
France, by disturbing the affairs of Italy. He also fomented the rising of
those of S^enna, and incited them to defend their Liberties, out of hopes of
his assistance: but the Pope, and King of France, (between whom a union was
already settled and confirmed, Horatio Fernese, Son to Pier Luigi, having
married a natural daughter of Henry's) bent chiefly all their endeavors to
get the Venetian Senate to join with them; whereupon they thought they were to
ground their chief foundation, of attempting any thing in Italy against Caesar,
to which purpose the King sent Monsieur de Soissonne to Venice, a man of great
account for his births sake, and to the same purpose made use of Monsieur de la
Casa, who was the Popes Nuncio there. These hoped to find the Venetians more
ready hereunto, than they had been formerly, for what has been already said of
Cesars Achievements, and particularly in consideration of the weightinesse,
and unworthiness of the action committed upon the person of Duke Pier Luigi,
who was slain by some Gentlemen of Piacenza, who had conspired his death, by
the assent and for^knowledge, as was commonly believed of Don Ferrante Gonsaga,
Caesar's Lieutenant in Italy, and the City of Piacenza was possessed by a good
number of Spanish Foot, led on by the same Don Ferrante, and was still held in
Cesars name; whereby it was perceived, that Caesar aspired to possess himself
of other men's states, not only by force, but by fraud. It was known that this
action would be very displeasing to the Venetians: wherefore Gonsaga had
quickly sent Giovan Battista Schizzo to Venice, a Senator of Millan, to affirm
that he had not any ways been the Author thereof; but that he could not
notwithandsting refuse, being thereunto called, and required by those that had
slain the Duke, and who had quickly had recourse to him at Millan, to receive
that City in Cesars name, till such time as his will should be known, who they
knew to be a friend to what was just and honest: yet his actions persuaded to
the contrary; for at the same time he caused the building of the Fort to be
continued, which was begun by the Duke, made the people and Nobility swear
f^alty to Caesar, and possessing himself of many Castles, fortified them, and
prepared to besiege Parma, Ottavio complaining in vain that such injury should
be done to him, who was the Emperor's Son in law.

This Commotion made the Venetians bestir themselves in making better provision
for their own defense. They made Stephano Tiepolo, their Commissary General on
Terra ferma, that by the Authority of the supreme Magistrate, he might order
their Militia, view their Forts, and speedily provide for what was needful.
They had likewise recalled the Duke of Urbin, General of the Commonwealth's
Forces, into the State, who was at this time gone to Rome, upon occasion of his
marriage formerly concluded, with Virginia, Daughter to the late Duke Pier
Luigi Fernese. And they commanded Antonio da Castello, who was a man well
reputed, and Captain of the Artillery, to go to Brescia, and to increase the
ordinary Garrison, with the Country People. They did the like at Verona,
whither the Commissary-Generall hasted, and great care was taken for the safe
custody of all other places of concernment; and all things seemed full of
snares and jealousies. Things being in this condition, the Pope and King of
France ceased not to try the Venetians, inviting them not to delay declaring
themselves any longer, and not to stay applying remedies to the eminent danger,
till there was no remedy to be found, but that all Italy must run the same
fortune by the total ruin and loss of Dominion and Liberty. But the Senate
would not be easily moved to take up Arms against a powerful
Neighbouring-Prince, in the height of his prosperity and greatness. For the
Commonwealth was not in so weak a condition, as that any enterprise might be
easily undertaken against her by any whosoever, nor yet in such a height as to
infuse fear into others, and make them seek to secure themselves by abasing
her; so as her condition seemed to differ from the like of the rest; and
therefore the Commonwealth being somewhat freer from fear, of being molested
by Caesar, might wait the advantage of Time, and till by the variation of the
present condition of affairs, a way might be opened to safer resolutions. And
what reason have we (said the Senators, whilst they advised upon what answer
should be returned to the Pope, and to the King) to part from Caesar's
confederacy, and to enter into other Leagues, and union? What should persuade
us to seek for safety, by exposing our selves to nearer and more certain
dangers? Wherein has Caesar failed us, for the space of near upon these
eighteen years that we have had peace with him? By what injury has he provoked
us? The Commonwealth was never more quiet at Land then now; And if it were not
that War by Sea does trouble the so many advantages of Peace, certainly this
our City would be now in the height of all prosperity. And shall we, by seeking
after better fortune, bereave our selves of Peace? and vainly think that we
shall be bereft thereof by others? Who knows not, that the League which is
propounded to us only by way of defense, will quickly necessitate us to offend
others, and expose our selves to the offenses of others? It is used as a
forceable argument to make us embrace a new League, that Caesar is desirous to
acquire glory, and dominion: But I beseech you, is not this so proper to every
other great Prince, as who should be otherwise, would be despised by others,
and by his own subjects? Has not the King of France the same thoughts? Shall
we peradventure persuade our selves, that we shall be at more quiet, if we have
him for our Neighbor in the State of Millan? We have tried often enough, when
the French were in Italy, how unquiet they are, and easy to break peace upon
any slight occasion: Wherein has this ambition of Caesar's hurt us? when did
he ever ceaze upon any thing that was ours? what sign has he given us of his
ill will toward us? what necessity have we to be at expense, to secure our
selves from his mischief? But on the contrary, what dislikes, nay what open
enmities have there been between the Pope and Emperor? what ancient, and
inveterate hate between the French and Spaniards? how great emulation between
the Kings of France, and House of Austria? The French cannot endure Caesar, not
only out of fear of his greatness, but for mere hatred to his particular
person, and measuring things rather according to their desire, than to the
likelihood of success, they would drive him out of Italy: But what is there of
like in us? If we may say truth, Caesar has not only abstained from injuring
us, but has always seemed to honor and esteem the Commonwealth very much,
and has rather been an instrument to preserve, then to disturb our peace. How
often, and with how much readiness, and affection (were it, or real, or
feighned) has he interposed himself to accommodate our differences with
others, particularly with his Brother, and in the business of Marano? All men
say, that he helped much to pacify Ferdinando; why should we then join with
them i^ these commotions, not having the like cause to take up Arms, either for
fear or revenge? It Is true, we are somewhat troubled at the taking of Millan;
but it is as true, that it was chiefly for our sakes, that he went about to
replace Duke Francis Sforza in that State; and afterward, upon our pressing,
promised to grant it to the Duke of Orleans, though at last by his death, and
to the almost fatal misfortune of Italy, it be fallen again into his own
hands: and how often has he asked our advice, and seemed chiefly desirous to
satisfy us, touching what he ought to do concerning that State? wherein our
proceedings have been so cool, and so full of circumspection, as we may partly
blame our selves, if we have not met our desires therein. And if he had so
great a mind to suppress the Commonwealth, as is affirmed: when could he have
better done it, then of late years, when we have had our hands full of War with
Soliman? yet he has rather endeavored our maintaining, then our suppressing,
having sent his Fleet to assist us; and he has increased our honor and our
Forces, to defend our selves against so powerful an Enemy, by the new
confederacy he made with us; and if his provisions for War may seem to have
been short, and tardy, in respect of our necessities and desires, and that his
actions have not been answerable to his promises, we must be content to have
received such usage, as all men do receive by the Law of Nature; that he minded
more his own interest, then that of others: and if we measure this very thing
more by affection then by true reason, it is a usual thing for humanity to do
so. Caesar would assist us to such a degree; but he did not think it became
him, to expose his Fleet to the same danger as we would do ours, his cause not
being the like to ours. He would not s^e us fall, yet he would not see us grow
too powerful, lest he might have reason to apprehend our greatness, as we now
fear his. These are passions common to all men, and very usual in Princes: but
if we weigh all things well, we are not only not necessitated, but we have no
reason to make War with Caesar; neither for any injury we have received, nor
for any we are likely to receive.

These reasons were the more easily credited, because they tended to the
preservation of Peace, to which every one was of himself well inclined; and
Caesar endeavored much to keep them in this mind, promising faithfully to
preserve Peace and Friendship with the Commonwealth. The Pope's, and King of
France his desires were conformable, but, by several messengers, thus answered:
That the Senate commended the care they took of the common good, and for the
defense of their own affairs, that they would take example by them, and watch
the more narrowly over their State, which they thought would prove a sufficient
remedy at this time against such dangers as were to be feared; wherefore they
saw no reason of coming to a straicter and more particular union, by which
they might provoke such as went about to disturb the Peace. Though the Pope,
nor King of France, were not well satisfied with this answer, yet they seemed
to be so, to keep from alienating the Venetians further from them, hoping that
they might at last be brought to alter their minds, and adhere unto them;
therefore praising the mature wisdom of that Senate, they said, that Cesars
intentions, which could no longer be concealed, being now better discovered,
and the world believing no longer that they had ambitious ends, they would
speedily resolve upon assured and good grounds, to secure the affairs of the
Common-^ealth, and of all Italy. But though the hopes of any good success in
their endeavors against the Emperor, were lessened by this the Venetians
resolution; yet the Pope's, and the King of France his desire of taking up
Arms, was not much lessened; which they were kept from doing, rather by the
difficulty of the business, then for any want of will. But though they could
not use open force, the French and the Ferneses held private intelligence in
diverse Cities of Italy, particularly in Genua, Sienna, and Millan, Cities which
were infected with humors of several factions, and therefore the more easy
to mutiny; for that upon finding a good Inclination to Novelties, they might
with the less forces compass their designs. It is certainly worth
consideration, to think how great human Imperfection is, and into how many
excesses they fall, who give themselves over in prey to their own affections.
Pope Paul, who was a very wise man, so many years versed in the waightiest
affairs of the World, being by the unavoydable laws of nature, brought to the
extreme period of life, yet being carried away by vast designs, and irregulate
thoughts, did not value the exposing Himself, his Family, the Church, and all
Italy, to the greatest labors, and dangers of eminent ruin, by taking up Arms
against Caesar, so powerful, and so prosperous a Prince, at a time when he had
whole Germany to join with him, which was implacably offended against the Pope,
and Court of Rome, for the difference of Religion, for the counsel given by
the Pope to Caesar, to wage War with them, and for not being able to obtain,
that the Council of Trent, which they had so earnestly desired, and which was
now granted, should be perfected; and on the other side, he being so ill
provided of men, moneys, and friends, to withstand so great a force of War, as
he drew upon him; and being bereft amongst those Heretics, of that sacerdotall
Majesty, and respect, by which Popes have kept themselves free from injuries,
more then by forces; which things being seen and well known by the Venetians,
they were much troubled at, insomuch as though their Counsels were not listened
too, and suspected, they forbear not notwithanding, when they found the Pope,
after their answer, still resolute in his former opinion, modestly to represent
unto him these things so worthy of consideration, to which he had sometimes
given ear, when his reason prevailed over his sense; wishing him therefore to
be somewhat more circumspect in these his intentions, and in delivering
himself, as it were a prey, into the power of the French.

The next year, 1548. was spent in almost the same Negotiations, in endeavors
of Leagues, secret Treaties, Princes machinations upon other men's estates,
preparations for Arms, and in a desire of attempting novelties, but without any
great effect or commotion. For though the King of France did very much desire,
to trouble the affairs of Italy, so to keep Cesar's thoughts and forces busied
there; yet he thought, his hopes in the Pope were but small, who was already
very old, in almost a decrepit age, having little money, and peradventure no
constant resolution to maintain the war; if any accommodation should at any
time be proposed by the Emperor, (as might easily happen, by his alliance with
Octavio Fernese.) He saw the Venetians resolved, though Arms should be taken
up, not only to keep their neutrality, but so joined in amity, by the
friendship of so many years, with Caesar, as he thought it impossible to divide
them. He had also a mind, and had already turned much of his forces, to
prosecute war against the English, hoping by reason of many divisions, risen
between the Governors of the young King, in point of religion, and out of
particular contentions, not only to defend Scotland, by virtue of the marriage
between the young Queen thereof, and his eldest son, who was destined to be her
husband; but also to recover Bullen, which was by his fathers agreement,
yielded up to the English. For which respects, he entertained diverse practices,
not only with the Pope, touching the affairs of Parma, but also in Genua, and
in Sienna, to alter the Government of those Cities, which depended upon Cesar's
authority. Yet did he not prepare to put these his designs in execution, nor
did he openly declare himself an enemy to Caesar. But on the other side, the
Pope, though he had a very great desire to revenge the injuries done him by
Caesar, and to recover Piacenza to his family, yet he was doubtful, whether he
should attempt this by force, or by treaty. Sometimes he was induced to hope
well, considering that the Emperor, who was Lord of so many States, though he
appeared more severe unto him then, to the end that he might obtain other
things of him, might not at last deprive his son in Law Octavio, and his
children, of that State, and reduce him to a private condition. He had
therefore often sent several expresses to him, desiring, that Piacenza might
be restored to Octavio, and that he would cease troubling him in the possession
of Parma. But at the same time he negotiated a League with the King of France,
by which the King was to take Duke Octavio, and the City of Parma, into his
protection, and to defend it against the Imperial forces. Sometimes, to
honest, and to facilitate the business, and to satisfy himself at least, in
taking this City from Caesar, he thought to reassume it into the obedience of
the Church. Nor did he cease to solicit the Venetians, sometimes by promises,
sometimes by minding them of the fear of Cesar's forces, to join with him in
the defense of Italy, for which, he said, he was no less troubled, then for
his nephews interest. And sometimes he complains, that they were too much
Imperialists, and did glory in Cesar's friendship and favor; which was
occasioned more by Cesar's own words, then by the Venetians; for in his public
discourse of the Commonwealth and Senate, he named them with love and honor,
meaning, it may be, to make them by this means more his friends. But he did not
much confide in the King of France, whom he named his friend and confederate;
suspecting lest the King, who demanded, that the City of Parma, preserved by
his forces, should not be given to Octavio, of whom he might always be
jealous, as being the Emperor's son in Law; but to Horatio, who was not only
the Popes nephew, but his son in Law. When he should have gotten that City,
which lay very opportunely for the mol^sting of Millan, might keep it for
himself.* Moreover, what could make him despair more, of finding favor at
Cesar's hands, then to see, that that City should be given into his enemies
hands, and by whom he might be much prejudiced, by the Fernese's means? Being
much distracted in his thoughts, by reason of these considerations, after long
and various disputes and difficulties, touching the Council, which the one
would have celebrated at Bullen, the other at Trent; the Pope, to give
satisfaction to Caesar, resolved, after having sent the Bishop of Fano his
Nuntio to him, to send also the Bishop of Verona, his Legate into Germany, with
authority, to dispense* with the Germans in many things, which were demanded by
them, and with some alteration of the usual rites of the Church of Rome; a
thing which Caesar had very earnestly desired, to curb those people, who not
having obtained the general Council, which was promised them by Caesar, and
many of them not having accepted of a certain reformation, made for a time, and
therefore called the Interim, till the Council should be celebrated, threatened
to mutiny again, unless they might receive satisfaction in some of their
obstinate demands: Whereat Caesar was much troubled, because it hindered his
other designs. But he minding only his own affairs, and not being moved by
any affections, or reasons, which were contrary to the interests of his
Dominions, did wisely nourish certain uncertain hopes in the Pope, and in Duke
Octavio, whereby he kept them unresolved, and in doubt: Sometimes he propounded
proposalls of accommodation, with recompense of Territories elsewhere;
sometimes he said, he would have it tried, whether the Church or Empire had
more lawful pretense to those Cities; and sometimes, seeming much incensed,
instead of restoring Piacenza, he demanded, that Parma should be delivered up
unto him. But in ^ine, it was conceived by those, who saw further into his
designs, that by th^se uncertainties, he would keep the Pope in perpetual
doubts, being already resolved, by no means to part with Piacenza, as lying
very opportunely for the State of Millan; but that he went about to protract
time, and to shun the necessity of taking up Arms, expecting the Pope's
approaching death, that he might the mean while put an end to his other deeper
designs. He thought to settle a mighty Monarchy upon his own Line, making the
Empire, together with so many other Kingdoms and States, descend upon his
only son Philip; and his brother Ferdinando's claim to the Empire standing in
his way, as to that, who was some years before made King of the Romans, (a
title conferred upon such as are declared to succeed in the Empire) he sought by
several ways to persuade his brother, to give way unto his son, promising to
give the Dukedom of Wittemberg to Ferdinando, to help his son Maximilian to be
chosen King of Bohemia, to give him his daughter for wife, with some
Territories for her portion, to make him Governor of his Kingdoms of Spain, in
his sons absence, and other things, which were not afterward altogether
effected. But Philip past from Spain into Italy, whither Maximilian was gone
before, to celebrate the marriage concluded, with 300000 Crowns for portion,
but no Dominion; and to tarry there as Governor of those Kingdoms: for Philip
was to go into Germany to his father, who was gone to Brussells, to ease
Germany of the Spanish Soldiers, part whereof he sent to meet his son in
Italy, and led part along with him into Flanders. The Prince was received with
great pomp and honor in every place; he was met at Genua, where he landed, by
many Ambassadors from several Princes, and particularly by Frederick Badoaro,
in the behalf of the Commonwealth, whose Commission was merely Complement, and
to attend the Prince, whilst he passed through the State of the Commonwealth,
which he was to do, as he went from Millan toward Germany. A stately Bridge,
richly adorned, was built over the River Adice; and upon the confines of
Verona, he was met by the Captain of that City, nobly attended, and by a great
concourse of people, who were come from several parts to see him, who was born
to so great an Empire, and to succeed in so many Kingdoms, and united States,
as he was likely to have been the greatest Prince that ever was in Christendom.
This Prince did not, upon this occasion, satisfy men's expectations, but was
held to be very haughty, being as yet very young, unexperienced in affairs of
the world, having never been from home before, and bred up by his mother in
great pride and elation, according to the custom of the Portugalls. But
afterward, when he came to mature years, he proved a Prince of singular worth,
and full of modesty and temper, treating with all men with a miraculous
comeliness, so as greater civility nor gravity was not to be desired in him.

Whilst Christian Princes were thus full of disorderly and unquiet thoughts,
their States and Dominions were not troubled by the Turkish Forces; by reason
of an unexpected advantage, which arose from new resolutions put on by Soliman,
of turning his Forces against Persia, which were first destined for Hungary:
For being eg'd on by a fervent desire of glory, which he thought he might
acquire, if he could beat Tamas his forces: Being desirous to effect this his
design, he listened more willingly then before, to new treaties of Truce; to
which end Ferdinando had sent his Ambassador, I^sto de Giusti, to
Constantinople, with new Commissions, and Truce was at last established for
five years, upon engagement, that Ferdinando should pay 30000 Ducats yearly to
Soliman, by way of Tribute, for the Towns of Hungary. The Commonwealth was
named by both sides in this Agreement, which redounded, in men's opinion, much
to her honor and safety; especially, because it was therein expressed, that none
of the within named, should disturb the peace or quiet of rest, during the time
of the Truce. And truly it was worth observing, how our Princes did by their
want of Trust, lessen their own reputation, and add to the authority and daring
of the common enemy. Caesar demanded, that, the King of France being to be
comprehended in this Convention, should be bound to observe those things, which
were promised him by his father King Francis. And on the other side, the King
of France desired, that by the Articles of Truce, Caesar should not make war
with any Christian Prince, during the said time. And the business proceeded so
far, as King Henry sent his Ambassador, Monsieur de Codogne, in all haste, to
Constantinople, to disturb the agreement, though the directions of Truce were
dispatched; affirming, that Cesar's only end in making this Truce, was, that
he might the more freely make war with him; and that it became the wisdom of
Soliman, not to suffer Cesar's power to increase; for he would observe the
Truce no longer, then might make for his own advantage. Monsieur de Codogne
said the same things at Venice, minding them likewise of Cesar's greatness,
and exhorting the Senate to join with him, in keeping the Treaty from being
effected: Which though the Venetians did not assent unto, yet he passing on to
Constantinople, and finding the Truce already concluded, procured a Letter from
Soliman to Caesar, and to Ferdinando, written in an imperious manner, but
containing things becoming a great and just Prince: That he did willingly
accept of the Truce, but with an intention, that Arms should be laid aside
every where, by those who were friends to either parties. And that therefore,
if any of the within named Princes, should make war with the other, he would
with his forces assist the injured party, against him that should first disturb
the peace. The King of France upon this occasion grew jealous of the Venetians,
that out of a desire that this Agreement might be concluded, wherein they were
to be comprehended, not caring for the interest of him their friend, they had
too much favored Cesar's and Ferdinando's affairs. And on the other side,
Caesar complained, that this counsel was first given to the King of France by
the Venetians, and was afterward countenanced by them in Constantinople, to
the end, that he might be the more straightly obliged, to keep peace with the
King of France, out of a desire, that he might have no occasion of renewing war
in Italy, which would be very inconvenient for them. But the truth was, that
after the first treaty for universal peace and quiet, the Venetians meddled in
nothing, but what concerned the interest of their own Commonwealth, knowing
that these Princes would be jealous of every thing.

At the same time, great dislikes grew between the Pope and the Emperor, and
there was great appearance, that they would come to an open breach; for Caesar
was still for the celebration of the Council, as it was first intimated, and
already begun, at Trent, as well to content Germany, which desired it very
much; as also for that he thought, it would detract from his reputation, that
the Council which was already proclaimed by his authority, nay, at his desire,
to be held in Trent, should now, without him, and contrary to his will, be
dissolved, and transferred to another place. and the Pope was as resolute, that
the Council should be celebrated in Bullognia, whither many Prelates and
Bishops were already gone by his order. But the Imperialists, though the Pope
had made it be intimated unto them, that they should depart; affirming, that
the Emperor was protector of the Council, but that he had no power to call it,
tarried still at Trent, obeying Cesar's power and commandment; who, on the
contrary, protested against the Prelates which were at Bullognia, and against
the Pope himself; and to give it the greater force, sent the Cardinal of
Trent, of the House of Madrucci, a Prince of the Empire, to Rome; affirming,
that he would not give his assent to any Council, save that which was summoned
at Trent, which if it should be disturbed, and that thereupon great mischiefs
should ensue, he desired to be justified before God and Man. Though these
things were very grievous to the Pope, especially being added to the success
at Parma, yet his hopes of agreeing with Caesar, made him proceed more
cautiously. But whilst the time was spun out in many negotiations, Octavio
being impatient to wait any longer, for the recovery of Parma, having in vain
endeavored to reduce it into his own power; for Camillo Orsino, who had the
custody of the City, had forbid him coming into the Citadell, resolved rashly
to throw himself into the power of the very Spaniards themselves, from whom he
had so lately received such injuries, to get possession of that City by the
favor of Arms, as Mendosa, Ambassador at Rome, had cunningly persuaded him to
do. The Pope was strangely dejected at this accident; the great dislike whereof
being added to the weakness of his very great age, for he was 84 years old, he
died soon after, having governed the Sea of Rome 15 years, with great wisdom
and commendations; for he had proved himself to be a just Prince, a lover of
good and virtuous men, and for a good while having been Neutrall amongst
Princes, and desirous of peace and quiet; for which he would have been the
longer praised and remembered by men, if he had not parted from his former
resolutions in his latter time, being carried away by an immoderate desire, of
aggrandising his family. He always bore a great respect to the Commonwealth,
and was particularly well affected to the Venetian name. He honored Gaspero
Contarini, and Pietro Bembo, noble Venetians, and men of singular learning and
worth, with the title of Cardinal, and had them in great esteem. The Italian
Princes were much grieved and troubled at the Pope's death, fearing that it
might prove an occasion, of disturbing the peace of Italy; for the French and
Imperialists had raised a mass of men, in many parts, with intention, as it
was thought, of possessing themselves of Parma, which was as yet held by
Camillo Orsino, but with a small Garrison, and little preparation of
maintaining war; he having denied obedience to the Letters and Orders of the
College of Cardinals, who had ordered him to deliver up that City to Octavio
Fernese: But he said, He would keep it for the next Pope. This fear increased
the more, for that it was long ere a new Pope was chosen; the two factions of
French and Imperial Cardinals, strove with much obstinacy for the Popedom;
neither whereof would give way to the other, but endeavored the more
fervently, and more cunningly, to have the greater part in the election of the
Pope, for that it was commonly thought, Italy would not continue long quiet;
which made each faction desire to have the Pope to be one, who might depend
upon them, and who for so great a benefit, might be obliged to be governed by
them, and to favor their designs. The Venetian Senate, following the custom
of their forefathers, would not interpose themselves in this long
contestation; but aiming only at the common good, writ to the College of
Cardinals, wishing them to choose such a Pope, as might prove most serviceable
for Christendom. The Venetians, being therein very wise, have never
endeavored, to make Cardinals partial to their Nation; nor did ever use the
authority of the Commonwealth, in the election of the Pope; although they
ought to covet as much, as any other Prince, to be befriended by the Popes. And
the Commonwealth being so principal a Potentate in Italy, doubtlesly their
faction, if they had so pleased, might have been very prevalent: But they knew,
that this so great combining with particular persons, in the Court of Rome,
might be a great prejudice to the public; and that the word Faction, first
begun in Rome upon the occasion of Ecclesiastical dignities, might creep also
into their own City, and infect it with this disease; therefore they have
always forborne it. At last, Giovan Maria Cardinal dal Ponte, was by adoration
created Pope, a Tuscan by Nation; one, who being gotten to the degree of
Cardinal, without any noble descent, or prop of parentage, was thought to be a
very good and virtuous person, and to be far from siding with any great
Princes. Wherefore thinking him either to be equally their friend, or at least
not their back-friend; the Imperial and French Cardinals, did all of them
willingly give their assent, to his being named Pope, by Cardinal Farnese. The
Venetians were very much gladded at this choice, persuading themselves, that
depending no more upon the Emperor, then upon the King of France, he would
keep friendship with them both, and produce peace between them in Italy:
Wherefore their Ambassador, Matteo Dandolo, received speedy orders from the
Senate, to congratulate Iulio the third, which was the name the new Pope took
upon him; and soon after, a solemn Embassy of four of the prime Senators, was
destined to go to Rome, to give the due and usual obedience to the Vicar of
Christ; by name, Philippo Trovo, Francisco Contarini, Marc Antonio Veniero, and
Nicolo da Ponte.

and joins with the Imperial Forces. The French by stratagem put a Garrison into
Parma: the Venetians keep Neutrals. Florence adheres to the Emperor. Ferrara

THe Popes actions did not at all correspond to the hopes which were conceived,
no not in what was most expected and desired; to wit, that he would appease the
Tumults which were raised, and provide for the Peace of Italy, and the safety
of Christendom: for, giving himself wholly over to building, and other
trifling matters, he seemed to neglect the more weighty affairs, which became
his degree, and the times, wherein seeds of great troubles were sown in many
parts of Christendom. And though Peace was now made between France and England;
yet it was known it would be the beginning of another War. For Henry King of
France, being of a very lively spirit, and desirous of Glory, finding himself
free from Wars with England, and having by that Agreement gotten safety and
honor to himself and Kingdom, by the recovery of Bullen, was not likely to
keep long quiet. Horatio Fernese being gone to him in France, to recommend the
protection of his Family, and of his House yet further unto him, and the
defense of Parma, things which had been before treated of by others; he was
willingly seen and listened unto by the King, who was desirous to trouble the
quiet of Italy, whereby he might have occasion at last to take up open Arms
against Caesar, hoping (though it fared much otherwise with him) that this might
make way for his holding straiter intelligence with the Pope, or at least to
alienate him from Caesar, since he undertook to defend a vassal of the Church,
whom Caesar sought to oppress, and would not for any thing the Pope could do,
desist from molesting him in the business of Parma, but required that Piacenza
might likewise be delivered up unto him, so as a great fire was already kindled
in the midst of Italy. No less dangers were likewise threatened in other parts;
for Ferdinando, King of the Romans, taking occasion from the discords which
arose amongst the Barons of Hungary, and particularly from the commotions
raised in Transylvania, by George Bishop of ^aradino, a man of great Authority,
and who hoped to be able to possess himself of that Province, parted from
Auspurg, laden with promises of assistance from the Emperor, which tended to
the inducing him to yield up his pretenses to the succession of the Empire, to
his Son Philip; he was gone into Austria, where he had already commenced Dyets,
that he might raise as many men and moneys, as he could for such an enterprise:
And on the other side, it was known that Soliman, who was already returned from
Persia to Constantinople, would not endure that that infant-King, recommended
to his protection, should be bereft of any part of his Dominions: and he had
the better occasion to take up Arms against the House of Austria, and to think
the Truce for five years, broken, for that the Imperial Army had taken two
Towns in the Rivers of Africa; to wit, A City called by the same name of the
Province, Africa, and Monestero. These Towns being formerly possessed by the
Moors, were the year before taken by Dragute, who being afterward made a
Sangiaccho, had received them into Solimans custody; and were since taken by
Prince Doria, who put thereinto a Spanish Foot-Company. The Venetians were the
more displeased at these accidents, because they thereby lost their hopes of
renewing the Truce for a longer time, a thing which was yet in Treaty at
Constantinople, promises being past therein on all sides; and if it had
succeeded, the Commonwealth would have been therein named, and comprehended
with much honor. But Soliman continuing his desire of friendship, and peace
with her, when he came to Constantinople, sent a Chians to Venice, to acquaint
the Senate with his return from Persia, and of his prosperous success, boasting
them sufficiently, according to the custom of that Country; though in effect
the attempts made in Persia, meeting with greater resistance by the Persian
Forces, than was expected, proved to no purpose; so as he was reeturn'd to
Constantinople, with his Army very much harrassed: But the Senate being
desirous to preserve Solimans favor, corresponded with this his demonstration
of friendship, and sent Caterino Zeno, Ambassador to him, who though he were
very aged, being 84 years old, refused not to serve his Country, though it were
to take so long and difficult a journey. And his Embassy proved very
prosperous; for by his wisdom he quieted the complaints which were often
renewed by the Turks, touching the death of Sabba Rays, whereof Soliman
promised there should be no more speech had.

The year 1550. past over with these petty proceedings, which was the more
celebrated notwithstanding throughout Christendom, for that the year of Jubilee
fell that year, wherein the treasury of Indulgencies, according to the ancient
Rites of every five and twenty years, is largely opened in Rome to devout
people, whereof there was a greater concourse then, in that City, upon occasion
of the new Pope. This year was likewise more remarkable for other reasons; for
the new intimation of the Council to be held at Trent, whither many Prelates
flockt apace from all parts; and then by reason of a great scarcity of Corn,
which was almost general, but chiefly in Italy, which made Princes make bold
with the public Moneys, to furnish their people, particularly the Signory of
Venice; which with singular Piety and Liberality, provided for the people of
that City, and of her other subjects, and inviting others to bring Corn from
Countries far off, they gave great sums of Moneys to such as brought Grain into
Venice, from whence it was distributed into other Towns belonging to the State,
according to their need.

But the year 1551 which insued, the fire of War began to flame higher in Italy
than before, to the danger of all Italy; whereat the Venetians were the more
troubled, because they had always taken the greatest care and pains to
preserve peace. The Pope was a great cause hereof, but more out of the
uncertainty of his resolves, than ou^ of any ill will: For he suffered himself
by little and little, to be drawn from his first intentions, giving ou^ Writs
of summons against Octavio Fernese, whose defense he himself had undertaken
but a little before: accusing, and protesting against the King of France, his
having taken the City of Parma into his protection; though (as it was said) he
seemed at first to assent thereunto, at least not to dissent. He was not aware
that the bitter words which he continually used against the French and the
Ferneses, made them join the closer together, and to increase their Forces, and
provisions for War* against which not providing any sufficient defense, he was
brought into a necessity of throwing himself into Cesars power; with whom he
was notwithstanding ill satisfied for the very self same business of Parma.
The Pope was by degrees drawn into these Inconveniences by tricks used by the
Imperialists, which he was not aware of; those who were nearest him, seeking
for their particular ends to conceal the truth, to make other men's dissemblings
be believed, and to nourish vain suspicions in him; so as without being aware
thereof, he was drawn from his neutrality, and occasioned the interruption of
that quiet, by which he at first endeavored to win praise and Glory. It
becomes Princes to bethink themselves well, before they undertake any
business; for they cannot without loss of honor, easily withdraw themselves
from their resolutions, when they are once made known; nor can they often
prosecute them to any purpose, without great prejudice to themselves, and
subjects. The Venetians did oftentimes intercede with the Pope, to appease
these most troublesome commotions, considering how long and grievous the War
was like to prove, which was now about to begin upon so slight an occasion in
Italy. That it was a very unfitting time for it now, by reason of the news
which was every where ^^ard, of Solimans intentions, nay of the preparations
which he was making to assault the Christian Countries both by Sea and Land.
And these Discords between Christian Princes, what were they else, but
inducements to make the Turks sooner put on such resolutions; nay assured hopes
of giving them the Victory in their hands? Peace and Quiet was to be desired by
all men, but particularly by him, to whom it was recommended as to the common
Father, and expected from his wisdom, and from that holy resolution which he
had shown, of being Neutrall between Princes; and of maintaining general Love
and Agreement between them, which had made men begin to celebrate the memory of
his Popedom, as very glorious. The Pope appearing to be somewhat persuaded by
these reasons, began to think of an Agreement; to which purpose he sent the
Cardinal de Medeci, brother to the Marquess of Marignano, and Cousin to the
Duke of Parma, and proposed the giving of Camerino and Nepi to him, in lieu of
Parma, which was to remain unto the Church: wherewith he forthwith acquainted
Caesar, making use both of the Senates reasons and authority, and affirming
that he was thereby put upon such a resolution. The Pope thought he should not
find the Emperor averse to an Agreement; if not out of his own disposition, at
least not to alienate him from him, by despising these his proposalls, and his
pleasure, and giving him occasion to favor the French faction in Italy, not
without danger to the Kingdom of Naples, by reason of the insurrections which
were therein at that time. And it was thought that the Popes endeavors would
have prevailed with the Emperor, had not he been otherwise wrought upon by
contrary counsels given unto him by his Ministers of State, and chiefly by Don
di Mendoso, Ambassador at Rome, and by Don Ferrante Gonsaga, Governor of the
State of Millan; who used therein, as it was thought, their own particular
enmity against the Fernesi, more then their love to their Princes good. But the
Pope finding it resented otherwise, and not daring for fear of his Forces to
offend him, returned to his first purpose of prosecuting the Ferneses, who on
the other side, being joined in League with the King of France, could the less
listen to any proposalls.

All wisest, and best men, were much troubled to find the State of affairs in
this condition: for it was too clearly seen, that the continuance of this
controversy for the affairs of Parma, would breed open War between the two
most potent Princes of Christendom, Charles the Emperor, and Henry King of
France; and would bring the Seat of War into Italy. For whilst the Pope was
incited to the recovery of Parma, by Caesar's Forces; and the King of France did
back the Ferneses in the possession of that City, by his Men and Moneys: their
Forces must needs meet, and suddenly full foul one upon another: so as those
who saw further into the sequel of these things, knew, and did not stick to say
openly, that the reward of this Victory, would be the appropriating of this
City to the one or the other of these Princes, to the certain prejudice of the
Italians, since they would not want pretenses, 'either by way of re-imbursement
of the expenses which they had been at, or for some other reasons, to retain
this City which must be either taken, or preserved chiefly by their Forces. The
King prepared to send succor to the besieged, and encouraged Octavio with
great hopes: and the Emperor, having much increased his Forces in Lumbardie,
did still encourage the Pope, pomising to make them join with the Forces of the
Church, and that he would give order to Don Ferrante Gonsaga, to observe the
Popes commands, in the business of Parma; but the Pope growing jealous of
Caesar's designs, and openly detesting the proceedings of his Officers, began to
repent what he had done, and sought how to draw himself out of the business.
He therefore resolved to send his Nephew Ascanio della Cornia, to the King of
France, to persuade him to desist from Arms, and to listen to some Agreement;
showing him the difficulty of the enterprise which he had undertaken, in
maintaining a City which was so far distant from his Dominions: and not long
after, he sent Achille de Grassi to Venice, who though he seemed to be sent
only to justify the Popes actions, and to correspond with the so many
endeavors oftentimes used to him by the Senate, in exhorting him to Agreement;
having showed him powerful reasons, by which he said he was persuaded to put
on that resolution; yet mentioning other matters, whereby the Pope might be
concei^ed to desire that the Commonwealth would interpose her Authority with
the King, and the Duke, to bring the business to some Agreement, which the
Senate was not unwilling to do, if they thought they might have done any good
for the common quiet. Ascanio returning speedily from France, brought word back
of the Kings good inclinations, which he would be willing to witness by his
actions; for he would persuade Octavio, that Parma might return to the Church,
upon condition that the Emperor would likewise restore unto her the Castles
held by him in the Territories of Parma: nor would he remove his Garrisons from
Parma, till he might be sure the Emperor could not possess himself of it:
wherein there being many difficulties, it was seen that the proposition tended
more to the spinning out of time, then to come to any Agreement: So as there
was no thought now on any side, but to provide for Arms. The King continued
sending of men into Italy, under Monsieur de Neuers, and other Commanders,
raising more Soldiers at Mirandola, commanded by Pietro Strozzi. The Pope and
the Emperor did the like, so as the Imperial and Ecclesiastic Armies being
numbered together, they amounted to 15000 Foot, and good store of Horse, which
were all commanded by Ferrante Gonsaga, who was Captain of the League. And
these Forces were held to be such, as it was generally thought the City of
Parma would soon fall into the Leagues hands. But Strozzi used great vigilance
and diligence, who parting suddenly from Mirandola entered the Bullognian
Territories, overrunning, and plundring the Country so fearfully, as the Pope
beginning to apprehend not only Bullognia, but Ravenna also, and some other
parts of Remagna, was forced to send for his men from before Parma, to come to
the Bullognian Territories, to keep his own affairs from danger; which Strozzi
making use of, he marched with miraculous speed toward the parts about Parma,
and entered the Town himself with a good number of Foot, and great store of
Victuals; so as the besiegers dispaired to get Parma in haste; and war was
likely to be drawn out at length, and occasions likely to be given of many
other weighty occurrences, whereby all Italy, already much perplexed, might be
reduced to much danger and calamity. Therefore the Venetian Senate, being
intent upon all things, and resolving whatsoever should fall out, to depend
only upon themselves, resolved to take 4000 Foot, and 500 light Horse into
pay, whereby to increase the Garrisons of their frontier Towns; and placing
their chief Commanders in them, they had a great care of their own affairs.
But the Duke of Florence, being bound to Caesar for many favors already
received, and out of hopes of others, that he might receive, did openly assist
the Imperial party, both with Men and Moneys: not with any intention of
fomenting this fire, which he would much more willingly have seen extinguished,
but not to increase some jealousies that were conceived of him; that he as well
as the other Italians, did not approve of the Imperialists proceedings, nor of
Caesar's own intentions. Which suspicion was much increased, by the new Fort
which they built in Sienna, which was commonly called the Ceppo or Stocks of
Tuscany. The Duke of Ferrara, who, as vassal to the Church, ought to have
proceeded with much circumspection; following his own dependencies and
passions* did adhere sufficiently in his mind, and in underhand-helps, to the
French faction. Wherefore to keep those that were besieged in Parma, from being
relieved with victuals and other things, from that side, the Imperialists had
taken Brisello, and two other little Castles belonging to the Duke, which stood
upon those confines. The Duke being much moved at these things, sent his
Ambassador, Girolino Serofini to Venice, to be advised by the Senate, how to
govern himself in these hard times, and so sad occasions; for he was resolved
to walk in the same steps the Senate did, and follow their wise counsels,
particularly in keeping himself Neuter, but that he had not forces enough of
himself to do so: So as unless he should receive some assistance, he feared,
he must be enforced, for the preservation of his State, to side with some one,
and to act contrary to his desire. This was thought to be a piece of cunning,
whereby the French desired, to spy into the Venetians intentions, that they
might draw them into some confederacy, or at least discover somewhat more of
their meanings. Therefore the Senate thought fit, to answer in very general
terms, That the Senate had ever desired above all things, that the peace of
Italy might be preserved; to which purpose, they had used several endeavors,
both with the Pope and others, as they saw needful: But since they could do no
good thereby, they would at least keep themselves in peace, and in their former
neutrality; which that they might do, with more honor and safety to the
Commonwealth, since the rest stood upon their Arms, they were resolved to Arm
also; and by providing for their own affairs, they would have respect to the
preservation of the Duke's State, out of the particular affection which they
bore unto his person, and for their own interest, which by reason of the
neighborhood of their Dominions, was almost inseparable from his. The French
not being satisfied with this answer, thought to discover unto the Senate, as
it was already generally known, their intentions, of attempting some important
novelty in Italy; to which purpose, the King had sent Luigi Alemanni to Genua,
to make that City, upon several pretenses, join with his faction, and
particularly, that he might have the use of their Havens, for his Fleet to put
into, and to land the men which he designed to send into Italy: And Cardinal
Tornone being then at Venice, whither he had retired himself, when together
with the other French Cardinals, he was commanded by the Pope to depart from
Rome; he was ordered by King Henry to appear in the College, and in his name
to acquaint the Doge and Senators, With the condition of the affairs of Italy;
with the occasion which had moved him, and with his intention, to send his
forces ^o assist Duke Octavio, and to maintain his cause: wherein, he thought,
he did a generous act, and what became a great Prince, and which he thought
would please all the Italian Princes; since thereby he undertook the defense of
a pettty Italian Prince, who was unjustly oppressed by others, and who had had
recourse to him for protection. That he could not dream, the Pope would have
been displeased that a vassal of his, should be preserved by the forces and
assistance of another, not being able of himself to defend himself; and that he
did much less believe, but that the other Italian Princes would be pleased,
that Caesar 's greatness might be moderated, and some bounds put to his vast
desires, which were bent, as was clearly seen, to thrust the weakest to the
wall, and to enslave all Italy. That the act it self might testify, that his
thoughts were bent upon nothing else, since he was in a condition, as not
needing the City of Parma, by his being possessed of so many Cities in Pi^mont,
he had opened his way to what he designed to do, against the State of Millan.
But that ^ince he now understood, his actions were otherwise interpreted, he
had resolved to give it over. Yet he could not be persuaded, but that the
Venetian Senate, being so great and so wise a Potentate in Italy, and upon
whose authority the rest would finally depend, would have that care and
consideration of these commotions, as many other of their important
consequences did require. That he did excuse what the Pope had done, as actions
rather of necessity then free will, being overcome with fear, both by reason of
Caesar 's so great power, and of his so many armed men in Italy; as also by the
Council already intimated, out of weighty and dangerous designs, the German
Heretics being to convene therein. But that if he could be assured, of the
company and assistance of other Princes, doubtlesly he would be of another
mind; for to sever himself from Caesar 's friendship, in such a condition of
affairs, might be termed a regaining of his liberty. The King was very much
thanked for these his overtures and counsels; and his generosity, in defending
those that were the weakest, and stood most in need of his assistance, was
commended; and they hoped, that by the Agreement, wherein the Senate had
already interceded with the Pope, and which he seemed not to dissent from,
affairs might be quieted. The King for all this did not forbear prosecuting the
war, though he could not, according to his desire, hope to meet with any, that
would receive or favor him therein, in Italy, except Duke Octavio. Nay, being
now resolved to declare himself more openly against Caesar, he sent more
soldiers into Piemont, and suddenly assaulted several places, that were
guarded by Imperial Garrisons, some of which he quickly took; and ordered,
that the Galleys, which were forty in number, commanded by the Prior of Capua,
brother to Pietro Strozzi, and which roved upon the Seas, might upon all
occasions evil entreat the Imperial vessels. And it happened soon after, that
Doria, who as he was conveying Maximilian King of Bohemia, and his wife, in his
Galleys, past from Barcellona to Genua, escaped narrowly, being assaulted, and
fought with by the French Fleet, whereof some Vessels which were behind, were
notwithstanding taken, and carried to Marcelles. But the League which the King
of France negotiated with Duke Maurice of Saxony, with Albertus Marquis of
Brandenberg, and with other Princes and Hans-Towns of Germany, all of them
unsatisfied, though for differing occasions, with Caesar, was of much more
moment; some of them were highly incenst at the Lansgrave, being detained
prisoner, contrary to Cesar's parole, as some of those Princes affirmed; and
others were incited to novelties, for fear of Caesar, in matters of Religion.
Henry was so resolute herein, as he communicated his thoughts to Giovanni
Capello, who was with him, as Ambassador from the Commonwealth, t^lling him,
that he would go himself in person into Germany; and earnestly desiring his
company, because he thought he might have some occasion, to treat of a
confederacy with the Commonwealth, or at least, to keep Caesar in continual
jealousy and suspicion. Yet the Senate, who were not willing to come to a
nearer conjunction with the French, thought it not fit to deny the King so much
satisfaction, to witness their good will to him; and because it made for the
good of the Commonwealth, that Caesar, who knew very well, that the Italians
were grown very jealous of him, for the affairs of Paxma and Pi^cenza, and for
other actions of his, might conceive, a straiter intelligence might be had
between the Venetians and French, to the very much prejudice of his Territories
in Italy. But the Pope, being very much perturb'd at these commotions, for that
they had their first rise from the business of Parma, which might draw upon
him the infamy of this war, which was raised in Christendom; and that according
to the various success thereof, he might not be free from danger, resolved to
send two Cardinals, as Legates of the holy Sea, to these Princes, Verral^ to
the King of France, and Carpi to the Emperor, to desire them, That they would
lay aside all hatred, and all thoughts of wageing war one with another, for
that the success at Tripoli might admonish them to agreement, and much more
the preparations which the Turks made, both by Sea and Land, bent to the
prejudice of Christendom. But the fire was already kindled to such a height, as
these endeavors were not of force enough to quench it; so as though the King
of France gave good words, and that not long after he sent the Cardinal
Tornone to Rome, to keep the treaty of Agreement on foot, and also to desire
the Venetian Senate, to intercede therein with the Pope; yet it was
comprehended, that he was not any whit more inclined to peace in his mind, but
that rather, having resolved within himself to make war, for which he had
prepared all things, he thought the business of Parma to be offered as a very
fit occasion; but he kept this his truest intention concealed, out of hopes to
draw the Pope by little and little, rather to accompany him in the war, which
he intended to make against Caesar, then in making peace with him. The Emperor,
on the other side, apprehending these practices, had reinforced his Army which
was about Parma, and laid the straiter siege to it, thinking that his
reputation was sufficiently concerned, if he should now be brought to yield the
least in any thing. Wherefore the Pope being in a very doubtful condition, out
of fear of not being forsaken by the Imperialists, and not well annexed to the
French, knew not what resolution to put on; yet being swayed by Cesar's present
power, and being already obliged unto him by particular ties of confederacy, he
resolved to make several demonstrations, of his being very well-minded toward
him. To gratify him, he made many Cardinals, all of them of the Imperial
faction; and spoke bitterly against the King of France in the Consistory,
detesting many of his actions, and particularly the friendship he held with the
Turks. Insomuch as the King, dispairing altogether of his friendship,
discharged his Legate from the Court, and recalled also his own Ambassador,
Monsieur de Terms, from Rome, threatening many things very prejudicial to the
Pope, and to the whole Court, if he should be so treated; and particularly to
free himself of the obligation of sending to Rome, to pay for the investiture
of Church Livings; affirming, it was not fit that war should be made against
him, with the moneys of his own Kingdom.

At the same time were 30 of the Turkish Galleys put to Sea, commanded by Sinon
Bashaw, by Rustin, first Vicier, and by other experienced Captains, amongst
which, Dragut, one who was much esteemed and feared, as being very well verst
in the Western Seas, and a bitter enemy to the Christians, which caused much
apprehension in all men, by reason of their strength, and of the uncertainty of
what course they would steer, or what enterprise they intended. The news of
this preparation by Sea, made the Commonwealth increase their Fleet to the
number of 47 Galleys, over which they made Stephano Tiepolo Captain General
the second time, and chose Governors for 20 other Galleys; for the arming
whereof, all things were ready, that they might be ordered according as
occasion should require. The Turkish Fleet past quietly through the Channel of
Corfu, and going from thence to Sicily, they desired to know of the Viceroy of
that Island, what order he had received from the Emperor, touching the
restoring the Affrican Towns, and Monesterio, which Doria had taken the
preceding year. And answer being returned, That Caesar would keep them, which he
must do, to take away the nest from those Pirates, which did infest those Seas;
the Turk's, who till then had abstaind from doing any injury, landed a great
many men, and took and sacked Augusta, carrying a great many men from those
shores, whom they made slaves. From thence the whole Fleet went to Malta, where
finding the business very difficult, they re-imbarked their Men, and their
Artillery, which they had landed, and going soon away, they passed to Gozo, an
Island eight miles distant from Sicily, which they totally plundered, and
stormed the Castle, though it were well munited, and had in it a good
Foot-Garrison. Then taking the way of Barbary, they coasted along the shore,
and went to Tripoli, and after a while-battery, they took the Town, upon
agreement, that the Knights of Malta, who were within it, for it was then under
their Government, having made but small defense, they, and some of the chief of
the Town, got away in the French Galleys, which were in the Turkish Fleet; the
rest, contrary to promise, were cruelly treated. These things were very sore of
themselves, but men were more terrified with the apprehension of the next years
danger; for it was noised abroad, that this Fleet was to winter in Tolon Haven,
and to join with the French Fleet, the increase whereof was much endeavored,
that they might put forth to Sea very strong, and very early in the next
season. Yet men's fears were quickly over, by the Turks steering their course
toward the Levant. The King of France was generally blamed by all men, but
chiefly by the Pope, as the promoter of these mischiefs; wherefore the Kings
Ambassador, who was at Venice, had a long discourse with the Senators in the
College, wherein he labored to prove, that his King was falsely accused to
have been the Author, and occasioner of these Wars, and of the so many
mischiefs which then befell Christendom. The Turks proceeded thus at Sea, but
the Christians had the better of them by Land, in Hungary and Transylvania; for
Ferdinando, King the Romans, assisted by Iovan Battista Gastaldo, by Sforza
Palavesino, and by others, possessed himself of whole Transylvania, and of the
Country and Town of Timisuar: which though they were taken from the Infant King
Stephen, and from the Dowager his Mother, were notwithstanding protected, and
defended by Soliman: who sent the Bashaw of Buda first thither, and then the
Belgerbie of Greece, with a great number of Horse, to drive out Ferdinando's
Forces; but in vain as then* the authority and discretion of Fra. Georgio,
having done much therein, by whose advice, though contrary to the Barons of the
Kingdoms opinions, who did all they could to encourage the Queen, with hopes
of assistance from the Turks: but she despising their Counsels, and being full
of apprehension both for her self and Son, resolved speedily to yield up the
whole Country of Transylvania, to King Ferdinando, contenting her self, to
receive by way of recompense, the Dukedom of Opelio in Slesia; together with a
promise of marriage, between a Daughter of the said Kings, and her Son Stephen,
when he should be of years; and of other honors, and more Revenues; so as the
Turks succors coming, when Ferdinando's Forces were grown very strong, and
were already possessed of the Towns of Transylvania and Timisuar, they could not
drive them out, but being overtaken with the inconveniences of winter, the
Turks were forced to forego the enterprise, and with little honor, to return
to their own homes; and by the same reason, of the bitterness of the season,
actions of War were likewise ceased in Italy; the Imperial and Ecclesiastical
Camps, keeping still before Parma, and Mirandola, not doing any thing.

But it was generally thought, there would be much greater doings, and chiefly
the two Brothers of Austria, Charles the Emperor, and Ferdinando King of the
Romans, had business enough to take order for the safety of their Dominions,
and Dignities. Sore War was protested against Charles by almost all Germany. It
was treated of in a Diet, how they might do to beat him out of Germany, and
create a new Emperor, he having done, as they alleged, many things to the
prejudice of the Empire, and of the German Liberty. He, contrary to his usual
custom, hoped to appease these commotions by agreement, but it proved almost
fatal to his eminent dangers: For as it was too late to provide against them,
so also did his provisions prove scarce, and uncertain. For it was in vain for
him, to endeavor the raising of Soldiers out of the Towns and parts of the
Empire, they being for the most part either risen, or about to rise against
him; and King Ferdinando had drawn all the best men out of Austria and Tiroll,
the Swissers and Grisouns were employed in the King of France his service, so
as his chiefest hopes lay in 1000 Spanish Foot, which the Duke of Alva was to
being to him. Ferdinando was in no less trouble, by reason of the great forces
which Soliman prepared, to assault Hungary, and Transylvania; to resist the
which, he was the more disabled, for that he could not hope for any help from
his Brother, by reason of his being employed elsewhere, and for that there was
no great love between them, because Ferdinando had denied to resign up the
succession of the Empire to his Nephew Philip, the Emperors Son, as he was
requested to do. Therefore endeavoring to provide for his safety by some other
means, he had endeavored to appease Soliman; by offering to pay him other
30000 Ducats by way of tribute, for Transylvania, as he did for the Towns of
which he held in Hungary, and to free himself from insurrections, if he should
be forced to fight, and from any intelligence which the Turks might hold, as it
was suspected they did in the parts which Ferdinando had gotten: he was very
diligent in observing all men's proceedings, whereby he came to discover, that
the Bishop of Varadino, who had then been made Cardinal by the same
Ferdinando's intercession with the Pope, in reward for the service he had done
him, held private intelligence with some Bashaws, and adhered unto the Turks,
aspiring to have the Dominion of that Province himself, under Solimans
protection. Wherefore to free himself from these treacheries, he resolved to
take away his life, as he did by the means of Sforza Pallevisino, who taking
some few others along with him, slew him: no less preparations was rumored to
be made by the Turks in Constantinople, to send forth a powerful Fleet the
next spring, well provided of all things for some great enterprise: All men
were the more afraid, because it was not well known what Solimans designs were,
and because these his Forces by Sea, might easily betake themselves to several
places, and enterprises. The Venetians were more vexed hereat then any others,
by reason of the vast expense and assured trouble they were to be at, by the
Fleets putting so often forth from Constantinople, it becoming them to be
provided for all accidents. They therefore made Stephano Tiepolo, General at
Sea the third time; they increased the Garrisons of the Islands, and maritime
Towns,: they made some Galleys be armed in Candia, and were very diligent in
making men work extraordinarily in the Arsenall, that they might be furnished
with many more. The Senate did moreover choose twenty Governors of Galleys,
and other twenty were chosen by the Consiglio Maj^re, to the end that all
things might be ready, and in good order, to increase their Fleet to the number
of 100 Galli^s, upon any unexpected accident which might fall out.

These so great preparations of the Turks, did not only not incite the
Christian Princes to any better Agreement, but the King of France seemed the
more eager to molest Cesars affairs, for that he saw him busied in fencing
himself from the Turks Forces, but continued his intention of going into
Germany, believing that the Emperor being strained in so many parts, and being
particularly reduced to so great dangers, by the conspiracy of so many German
Princes against him, would be brought to some Agreement, even by the parting
with some of those States in Italy, or in some other parts whereunto the Crown
of France had any pretense. Having therefore assembled about 40000 Foot of
several Nations, and 4000 Horse, together with a great train of Artillery, he
went toward Lorrain, where the City of Metz had been taken a little before by
Ana de Momorancy, High-Constable of France, who was gone before with part of
the Army, a City belonging to the Chamber of the Empire, though the Government
thereof was put into the hands of some of her own chief men, whereof the Bishop
was the head. The King entered armed therein too, soon after, and was received
as became a great and victorious Prince, with much honor. He kept a while with
his Army in this Country, to keep those of Flanders, who were prepared by Queen
Mary, sister to Caesar, from disturbing his designs, or the like of the
confederate Princes of Germany, who had begun so successfully in their first
attempts, as having taken the City of Auspurg, and passing easily and speedily
through the Duke of Bavaria's Territories, had caused much fear in the
Emperor, in King Ferdinando, and in the whole Court, which was then at
Isprach; so as it was propounded in the Council, to retire to a place of more
safety: but afterward taking more courage, and having well munited some strait
passages of the Mountains, by which the Enemy were of necessity to pass, if
they should be resolved to come and find them out; they forbore doing so,
since their sudden and shameful flight might prove infamous, though an
agreement might ensue thereupon. The King of France inheartned by the
apprehensions of these Princes, and by the prosperous success of their enemies,
thought he was not to let slip the occasion of straitning Caesar yet more, and
of sharing in this glory: He therefore resolved to draw near the River of
Rhine, that he might keep the Confederates true to him, and adhere unto them,
intending to pass on further himself: but he was not well got thither, when
he found himself so deceived in his expectation, as he returned back; for the
Confederates thinking that they were strong enough of themselves to deal with
Caesar, and being desirous to keep their own Country from such sufferings, as
they feared it might receive by the French Army; they agreed that Duke Maurice
should by his Letters advertise the King, (which was more for their own
convenience, then for any truth that was in it) that they had already made an
Agreement with Caesar, wherein they had obtained all that they had proposed unto
themselves, or desired by this League: and that now they had no more to do, but
to return many thanks unto his Majesty for so great a favor, which Germany
would never forget, but always acknowledge it as a great obligation from the
Crown of France. The King was much troubled at this news, seeing himself
fallen short of the so great hopes which he had conceived, and that the charges
and labor of so great a journey was lost; yet that he might make use of his
forces elsewhere, he retreated with his Army into the Dukedom of Luxenburg,
where he took many places of importance, and also the Fort Monvalliere,
esteemed to be the Key of that Country, wherein Count Mansfeilt was made
Prisoner, who was Governor thereof in Cesars behalf. But ruminating still
upon much higher designs, he thought it his best course to free himself from
all Impediments, by closing in with the Pope, so to separate him from Caesar;
and he at last obtained, that Arms should be laid down between the Church, and
the Crown of France for two years, as concerning the affairs of Parma, and the
Prince of Salerno, going to the Camp to him; ^e propounded unto him the
enterprise of the Kingdom of Naples, which the King willingly listened unto, and
began to advise with him in many things, touching forces, and how the business
was to be carried on. And it was agreed upon, that the said Prince should
command in chief, he being very forward in making offers, and promises,
grounded upon several things, and chiefly out of the great desire of those
people, to withdraw themselves from the Spanish obedience, and to put
themselves under the Government and Empire of the Kings of France. The Prince
of Salerno had lived a while at Padua, having withdrawn himself out of the
Kingdom, for diverse dissatisfactions received from Don Pietro de Tolledo,
Viceroy of Naples; and from the Emperor himself, for suffering those
injuries to be done him. Wherefore taking occasion to raise Novelties, out of
these present Commotions, and to resent himself at the same time, of the
private injuries done unto him, and of the public injuries done unto his
Country by Caesar, he resolved to go himself in person into France, but would
go first to Venice, to communicate these his intentions with the Senators, that
he might carry some news to France of the Senates intentions, touching the
proposalls which he was to make to the King. He therefore in a long and
eloquent Oration, held out what reason the Commonwealth had to regain the
Towns and Havens which she had formerly been possessed of in Puglia, and to
secure themselves from Caesar's greatness. He sought to find out how they
would be inclined to this business, if it should be propounded to them by the
King of France; He wished them to consider, how ill-satisfied, and discontented
the Neapolitans were at the Spaniards Government* by reason of the Viceroy's
insolent and Tyrannical proceedings, who was not only born with, but rewarded
by Caesar; but chiefly by reason of the office of the Inquisition, which was
endeavored to be brought in then into that Kingdom, to the persecution and
ruin of the Nobility; who, not being able any longer to undergo that bitter
slavery, would endure any thing rather then to continue under Charles the
Emperor's Dominion, by whom they had been so despised and injured. That these
same things being represented to the King of France, had made him much
compassionate their miseries, who as became the magnanimity of such a King, had
taken them into his protection, and promised to assist them in what he could;
but excused himself for not being able to serve them to any purpose at the
present, by reason that his Fleet was so small. Therefore, said he, it becomes
the Venetian Senate, more then any others, to embrace this enterprise, as being
an Italian Prince, a lover of Liberty, strong at Sea, and having a just
pretense to a part of that Kingdom. That no friendship could be more useful to
the Commonwealth, nor more to be desired then that of France, which was so
clearly seeen by things past, known by so many proofs, and by so many reasons
confirmed, as there was no need of any persuasion thereunto. That such was the
magnanimity of the present King, in particular, that all great things were to
be expected from his liberality, and from the affection he bore to the
Venetians. And what greater opportunity could be offered, then the condition of
the present times? wherein the Emperor had his hands full of employment, by
the War waged with him by almost all Germany, by the threatening preparations
made against his brother Ferdinando, by the Turks. But the wisdom of the
Venetian Senate ought chiefly to consider, not to suffer the Neapolitans, being
abandoned of all help, and in so great necessity, to precipitate themselves to
their own loss, and the like of others, and to have recourse for succor to
Soliman's forces, which were now ready to put to Sea with a great Fleet. As
also the Kings negotiations already had at Constantinople, to try this, as the
last hope the Neapolitans had. These words made no impression in the Senators,
nor did any one listen unto them. Whereupon the Prince was dismissed, they
seeming displeased with the malignity of the times, and particularly with the
Prince his perturbations, and holding out the importancy of the business,
which would require long and mature consultation. Yet he went, as has been
said, into France; and representing the business which he had designed, to be
more easy then it was, and that there was greater hopes, then he really found,
to work upon the Venetians, he was entered into strait practice with the King,
to effect what was thus designed.

The King of France was in some doubt what to do, but had still these
intentions in his mind; he received several advertisments, which might confirm
him in his first purpose; to wit, Of the great straits whereinto Caesar was
reduced, which were such, and so many, as he might really seem to be abandoned,
by that good Genius, which had wont to accompany him in all his actions, with
miraculous prosperity. Duke Maurice, and the rest of the confederate Princes,
pursued their march toward Isprack; and having forced a strong and narrow
passage, called Chiusa, near Fussen, and took it, it being the place wherein
the Imperialists chief hopes lay, of hindering the enemies passage, so as their
way being open to go to Isprack, Caesar and his brother Ferdinando, took such
counsel, as was dictated to them by necessity* and in the obscurest time of
night, not having above 500 Horse with them, they went from Isprack toward
Persenon, and from thence to the County of Tyroll: And hearing soon after, that
the Enemy were drawn near Isprack, they took their way again over steepy
Mountains, and marched apace, not tarrying till they came to Villacco; where
they likewise were so full of fears and jealousies, as being told by those that
came from Italy, that Arms and Horses were a raising in Friuli, they began to
think, that the Commonwealth of Venice might be agreed with the King of
France, and with the Germans, and might raise men to assault them. This
jealousy was occasioned by a great number of Sav^rgnian Horse, which were seen
to be assembled about the Castle of Osoffo, to meet and rescue the Count
Gazuolo, who was going to the Emperors Court. Caesar had likewise conceived
these jealousies, (men being easy to believe, either what they fear or hope)
by the Treaties of the Prince of Salerno; so as though he was counseled, when
he was at Isprack, to go into Italy, he was not thereunto inclined, thinking he
should not pass with safety through the State of Venice, though the Venetians
were always so far from making any advantage of the adverse fortune of any
great Prince, who was their friend, as some German Lords having offered their
service to the Commonwealth, and to bring with them upon any occasion 10000
Foot, and 2000 Horse; the Senate, that they might not be any ways interessed
at this time in the affairs of Germany, and being desirous not to cause any
jealousies in the Emperor, would hardly listen to their proposition. But being
at last freed of this suspicion by Dominico Moresino, who was Leiger
Ambassador with him, and had always followed him, as also by the fact it
self, he thanked the Senate, for the good will which they had showed unto him.
Truly, great was the example of the inconstancy of human affairs, to see that
very Emperor, who but a little before, had in a glorious and triumphant
manner, subdued and overcome Germany, should be put into such a terror by the
very same Forces, that he distrusted his liberty, and the dignity of his
person. In these so many straits, the Foot not being yet come which were
expected from Spain, Caesar turned his thoughts to agreement, giving way to the
present bad crisis of affairs and times, and expecting a better occasion to
redeem his ancient honor. To this purpose, a Diet being called in Possonia, by
the confederate Princes, the King of the Romans went thither himself in person,
to negotiate conditions of peace. But the German's pretensions were great, who
would make use of those occasions, to moderate Cesar's greatness, and to
increase the liberty and privileges of the Princes, and Hans-Towns. So as,
though Caesar was sometimes willing to satisfy them, being forced so to do by
necessity, and his so many misfortunes; yet sometimes he re-assum'd his
accustomed courage: He said, That rather then to give way to such unworthy
things, and so prejudicial, not only to himself, but to his successors, he
would run all hazards of fortune. But at last being resolved, not to grant
further liberty to those Cities in point of Religion, nor to give way to the
Decrees of new Dyets, he was content to accept of Agreement, as far as
concerned the setting prisoners at liberty, and the receiving of the Rebels
into favor. The King of France was the more encouraged by these successes, and
both he and the Prince of Salerno conceived better hopes, of bringing the
business of Naples to a good end; to the effecting whereof, the Venetians
assistance being of all other things held most necessary, the Prince of Salerno
returned to Venice, where, accompanied by Monsieur di Selva, the King^
Ambassador, they did again endeavor, to bring the Commonwealth to join in
League for such an enterprise; they alleged all things, whereby they might
hope, to bring the Senators to hate and undervalue the Emperor, urging his
ill will toward the affairs of the Commonwealth, and his present low
condition. And on the other side, they concealed nothing, which might purchase
good will to the King of France, or reputation, by reason of his mighty Forces,
and of the love he bare to the Commonwealth. And because it was known, that
the Senate was very positive, in keeping their Neutrality, Monsieur de Selva,
handling this business with much fervency, said: Are not you aware, Gentlemen,
that it lies not in you to hinder the Kings intentions, since he is resolved,
if not accompanied by you, or any others, to undertake this business of
himself alone. And whatsoever resolutions you shall put on, these Princes will
try their fortunes; and which way soever it shall bend, you will not be able by
your Neutrality to secure your State, nor the affairs of your Commonwealth,
but will rather, let the ^vent be what it will, leave them equally exposed to
the hatred of the Conqueror, and Conquered; Of the latter, because, not valuing
his adversity, you would not assist him when you might; of the former, because
you would not join with him, out of envy to his prosperity. And what can my
King expect from you, and from your ancient, and (as you your selves term it)
so dear friendship, if you do not accept his so gracious offers, tending to
your so great, and so assured advantage, if you do not listen to his fair and
advantageous desires? How can he hope to have you his friends in adverse
fortune, if you seem so much to slight his friendship, when fortune smiles
upon him? What more ^it occasion can you expect, to increase the welfare of
your Commonwealth, and to secure your self from Caesar 's formidable power, if
you neglect this? How often have both you, and your ancestors, taken up Arms,
much to the praise of your magnanimity, being moved thereunto out of these very
reasons? Can you peradventure doubt, that my King, who scorns to make any
agreement with Caesar, now when he may do it so much to his advantage, will do
it at any other time without you, or without the great good both of you and
h^mself? or does it prevail with any of you, that if Caesar shall chance to
return to his pristine greatness, he will remember, that you would not take up
Arms against him, when entreated? When it is much more likely, that following
the custom of all Princes, but more particularly his own, he will not value
his own convenience and interest more, then any thing that is done, or could be
done in his behalf? Are not the Cities of Florence, Sienna, and Genua, examples
hereof; which he has rewarded for their many services done him, with bereaving
them of their liberties? These things had a fair appearance; but being well
looked into, it was found, that they were not grounded upon any solid reasons,
nor upon any sound foundation^* for to forgo Cesar's friendship, which had been
so many years p^^^erved, with much prosperity to the Commonwealth, out of
avoiding uncertain, and far-distant dangers, appeared to be no good not wholesome
advice; and if they should have any thought of quitting their Neutrality, and
make another trial of the Commonwealth's fortune, how should they think this
to be a good opportunity, the season being already f^r spent, for attempting
any thing that year by Sea, and having few or no Soldiers, to make any
important attempt by Land. Nor was Caesar at so low an ebb, but that upon
agreement with the Germans, which was still in treaty, and was near effecting,
he might recruit himself, and take the sore^ revenge, for the injury he should
have received, it being aggravated by the condition of affairs and time. These
things being maturely considered, and added to the desire of peace, to which
the Senators were much inclined, made them resolve, by almost all their votes,
to give this answer to the Prince, and to the French Ambassador: That they very
much thanked both the King and Prince, for this their forwardness to
accommodate the Commonwealth, which they would never forget: But that they
having been, for many years past, in peace with all Princes, they were of
opinion, that they could not depart from it, having no occasion to do so. That
in all things else, the Senate would willingly correspond with the Kings
pleasure, desiring the continuance of all splendor and prosperity to his
Majesty, and to his Kingdom. This answer being given, the Prince did
notwithstanding pursue his former purposes, causing a meeting of several
personages of the French faction, in the City of Chiozza, to consult touching
the managing of the business of Naples. Here met the two Cardinals of Ferrara
and Tornone, Monsieur de Terms, the Kings Lieutenant in Italy, the Duke of
Somma, and other Dukes and Lords of the Kingdom; to whom, though the Prince did
endeavor to demonstrate the easiness of the enterprise, yet they finding many
evident difficulties therein, it was not absolutely approved of. Nay it so fell
out, as the same things being more maturely considered, by the King of France
himself, he soon after sent to the Prince, and to Monsieur di Selva, wishing
them to forbear proposing any such thing to the Venetian Senate. But it was
already done, as you have heard; and the Senates wisdom, in their resolution
and answer, was generally the more commended.

And behold the face of affairs began soon to alter; for the King of France
received news, that the Dutch were fallen from him, alleging for this their
alienation, that he possessed three chief Towns, Metz, Tull, and Verdane, which
did belong unto the Empire. And Queen Mary having increased her forces, by the
Flemish, did with them besiege Eden, a Town in Picardy. And on the contrary,
grievous and contagious sicknesses fell in the Kings Army, which made it of it
self daily to dissolve. Wherefore he was forced of himself to give over the
enterprise of Luxenburg, and breaking off the course of his victories, to send
many of his men to their winter quarters, and to bring the rest to the
frontiers of his Kingdom, to defend his own affairs. This mean while, 10000
Spanish Foot were come unto the Emperor, and the Marquis o^ ^randenburg, who
had at first adhered unto the King, facing about, joined, with all his forces,
with the Emperor; whose example was afterward followed by many of the chief
of Germany, who had first made the French colors be displaid; being displeased
with the King of France, for not having been able to obtain somewhat, which
they did very much desire. The Emperor having by these new accidents recovered
his former ardency, began to bethink himself of going in person, with all his
forces, immediately to the recover of Metz, though the winter season, which
came on, and the condition of the City, which was very strong both by
situation and art, excellently well munited with a Garrison of 10000 French
Foot, and many valiant Commanders, did advise him to the contrary. All his
Commanders differed from him in opinion; but the business being unseasonably
attempted, met with conformable event: for having much lessened his Army, by
the sufferings of many of his Soldiers, he was forced to retreat, having done
more prejudice to himself than to the Enemy.

Whilst these things were in action, another Combustion, which had been long
raked up in ashes, broke forth in Italy. The Senesi being no longer able to
endure the insolent proud command of the Spaniard, and having all things ready
to drive out the Imperial Garrison, and to regain their Liberty, sent to
Rome, to acquaint the French Officers with this their firm resolution,
requiring their assistance at this their so great need, and promising to keep
the City for the King of France. The business, whereof there had been formerly
some secret Treaties had in France, was willingly listened unto; and order was
given, that many Foot, who were under the French pay, in Parma, and Mirandola
should march presently toward that City, and soon after, Monsieur de Lansack
went thither himself in person, the more to encourage the people. So as,
according as it had been first ordered, many armed people of the Country coming
thither at the same time, and many foreign Soldiers, conducted by Nicolas
Count of Petigliano; the Spanish Soldiers were suddenly affrighted, and driven
by an assault out of the Town. The Fort was slighted, and many other things
done in contempt of Caesar, and his dignity; his Ensigns dragged about the
street, his Arms broken, things which made this action appear more grievous to
Caesar, and which did trouble him the more, and made him very desirous of
revenge; therefore, to lose no time, to satisfy his anger conceived against the
Senesi, and to keep the French from having another receptacle in Italy: he
commanded Don Piedro di Tolledo, Viceroy of Naples, to go with 5000 Foot,
what-Dutch, what-Spanish, (the Kingdom being now free from the danger, for
which the Garrisons of those Cities were increased with these men) into
Tuscany, and endeavor the reducing of the City of Sienna to his devotion
again. It was thought that this success, if the French-mens designs should
prove secure, would be very prejudicial to the Emperor's affairs in Italy;
for though the French professed in words, that they had taken upon them the
defense of Sienna, to free it from the oppression of the Spaniards, and to
restore it to its former dignity and freedom; yet their intention was too well
known. For refusing propositions of Agreement which were offered, they would
continue their Garrisons in that City, that they might make use thereof, and of
other places which they had gotten, to raise men in Italy, and for other
designs of theirs. So as in reward of Liberty, the King of France required of
the Senesi, that they would declare themselves to be friends to his friends,
and Enemies to his Enemies. The Viceroy then desiring suddenly to obey Caesar's
Commands, obtained passage through the Churches Territories; which the Pope
said he gave way unto, because he knew not how to hind^ ^^im. He entered with
his Army into the parts about Sienna, which he plundered; and took some weak
Castles, which soon yielded; but the stronger places were so well munited, as
the Imperialists were forced to keep long before them: the whole force of the
War almost was reduced to about Monte Alcino: whilst which Fort was preserved,
Sienna, which was excellently well provided of all things, was in the lesser
danger. That which made the Senesi chiefly so resolute to defend themselves,
was, the fear of being severely punished by Caesar, if he should regain the City,
and their hopes of not being long troubled with the Imperial Army, by reason
of the dangers which befell the Kingdom of Naples, by the Turkish and French
Fleets. The Venetians endeavored to quench this fire which was kindled in
Italy.

THe War made by the Commonwealth of Venice against Selino Ottaman, when his
Empire and fortune was at the greatest height, both by Sea and Land, in defense
of the Kingdom of Cyprus; he being the most powerful Emperor of the Turks, and
in League with some of the chiefest Princes of Christendom; may be numbered
amongst the most remarkable things which has happened in our times, or in the
memory of our forefathers, or in whatsoever other former Age: The War being
undertaken with much fervor, and warlike preparation on both sides, and with
no less indignation then power; whilst not only the ablest Nations, but such
as did differ in Customs, Laws, and Religion, did contend for the priority of
the Militia, and for the glory of the Empire; so as the present War contains
events, which for their variety and greatness, may afford such delight and
help, as the knowledge of what has been done, uses to afford: I have thought
it a praiseworthy work, in being very careful and diligent, in recollecting
all the Counsels, and most important Actions which insued in the space of
three years, the time which this war lasted; and severing them from the
continued Series of other things whereof I am to write, to give you a
particular story thereof, that I may fully satisfy the curiosity which the
same of great things may excite in those which shall come after us, to know so
strange events orderly and distinctly; and that being taught by such examples,
they may the better draw some useful precepts for politic Government.

The occasion of this War, was that which has troubled almost all Christendom
for these many years; the Ottaman Princes immoderate desire of Empire, and
military Glory, which is begot in them by the Rules of that State, being wholly
given to Action, and military Exercises: So as thinking the enlargement of
their confines a sufficient reason of making War, they have been always
troublesome to their Neighbors; not reputing those their Enemies, who have
been readiest to provoke them by injuries; but those are most exposed unto
their fury, whose forces are weakest, or whose States be most convenient for
them, or whom they may opportunely offend; and these they have endeavored to
bereave of their Dominions, whereof both this and the preceding Age does afford
us many evident examples. But it will be clearly seen, by what shall hereafter
be said, what the particular occasion of this war was, and pretenses the Turks
made use of to take up Arms.

The Venetians, amongst other of their Territories in the Levant, were at this
time possessed of the Island of Cyprus, which they had been Masters of for
fourscore years: for the Commonwealth seeing that Kingdom reduced to eminent
danger, of falling into the Turks Dominion, it being oppressed by the snares and
violence of B^ia^es Ottaman, who apparently aimed at the getting of it; after
she had for many years defended the Dowager Queen, wife to Giacopo E^signano,
the last King. The Dowager being a Venetian, and whom the State had adopted for
her Daughter, to make her the more worthy of so great a match; the
Commonwealth endeavored by the means of her Brother Georgio Cornaro, that she
would deliver up the free and absolute Government of Cyprus to her native
Country: for her only Son being dead, she by her Husbands last Will and
Testament, was left sole Heir and Legitimate Lady of that Kingdom: Which she
giving way unto, was, after she went from thence, reduced unto a Province; and
the Commonwealth continued still to send diverse Magistrates to look to the
Government thereof, being very careful to preserve so noble a Member, and so
great an adornment added to their State: whereby this Island has not only
hitherto been preserved from the Turks, but has been much enriched by the
industry of many Gentlemen of Venice, who being invested with Inheritances
there, began to manure the Grounds, to govern their Farms, (which the Country
people there call their Ville) and to use frequent Navigation thither in
Venetian bottoms, whereby not only the native Commodities were exported, but
many other Merchandises brought thither from Egypt and Soria, it being made as
it were a Landing-place, whereinto diverse sorts of Merchandise were brought
from the Neighboring Turkish Territories, as into a safe and convenient place.
The Venetians paid unto the Turks yearly, eight thousand Ducats, by way of
Tribute for this Island, which was wont to be paid by the Lusignian Kings, to
the Emperors of the Malamacchy, after that King Giano, Son to Giacopo,
overcome in battle by the Sultan, and carried Prisoner to Cairo, was forced for
his freedom to tax his Kingdom with this perpetual Tribute; having also
disburst a great sum of Gold. The Ottaman Emperors did afterward succeed to
this interest, when Sultan Selino, father to Soliman, had subdued the Empire of
the Malamucchy: wherefore the Venetians, as new possessors, continued this
recognition to them, which made the Turks still desirous to possess themselves
of this Kingdom, both out of reason of State, and for the cause of Religion, it
being a particular fee-farme of the Meccha, a place of worship and devotion
amongst the Mahometans. The Turks grew also suspicious that this Island, by
reason of the fitness of its situation, was become a receptacle to the Malta
Galleys, and to other Western Pirates, by which the Rivers of their
neighboring parts were infested, and the subjects of the Ottaman Empire, kept
from sailing safely on those Seas; and had yet a more particular quarrel, for
that the voyages of those Masselmans, who out of any vow, or religious zeal,
sailed to Meccha, were thereby hindered, and exposed to danger. The disturbers
of the peace making use of this, and cloaking their own peculiar interests
under it, strove to make War with the Commonwealth, to bereave her of this
Noble and Rich Island: Nor was the inclination, which was known to be in many
of those inhabitants to change their Government, that so they might change
their fortune and condition, a small incitement hereunto. For a sore slavery
being by ancient custom introduced, which arose first from a small tax laid
upon the inhabitants to pay the Cavalry which kept those shores from
incursions, and the Venetians not daring to abrogate it, when they had gotten
that Kingdom, for fear of losing the love of the Nobles, whose Lands were
labored by these slaves, whom they call Parici; many of those men grew
discontented, and desirous of Novelty, which not hoping to attain unto from
elsewhere, they had recourse unto the Turks, as to those to whom such an
enterprise might prove very easy and opportune, by reason of their power and
nearness. But these things being represented to Soliman, and much discourse
being had thereupon, which bred much doubt and jealousies in the Venetians,
could work no effect. For he, were it for that he was always employed in other
affairs; or that he would not without occasion violate his friendship with the
Venetians, and by breach of Oath stain that glory which he was always so
ambitious of; or for that he thought it not good to necessitate them whose
friendship he might make advantage of, to turn their forces against him, which
were very strong at Sea, and therefore very fit to molest many of his
Dominions, and to occasion a League amongst the Christian Princes, and so
interrupt his greater designs, would never lend an ear to those who advised him
to this enterprise, nor make use of any occasion, wisely refusing the
invitations, and the promises of the Parici of the Island. The Venetians were
not wanting to preserve this opinion in him; wherefore refusing all Counsels
which tended to War, and thinking it not fit to make use of any occasion which
might compel them to take up Arms against so potent an Enemy: they these late
years stood idly looking upon others men's actions, that they might not endanger
themselves to free others; having learnt by experience, how unfortunate they
had been in waging War with Soliman; how powerful and formidable an enemy he
had been to all Christendom, and how little reason they had to trust to the
help of other men, or in the doubtful success of War, having been much to their
prejudice deceived in their hopes, either by the insincerity of some of the
Colleagues, or by the uncertainty of fortune. At this time all men commended the
Senates wisdom, who could use such temper with the Turks, as they should
neither fear, nor despise the Venetian name. For as often as any powerful Fleet
was put to Sea, they spared for no cost to keep the maritime Forts munited, and
by arming their Galleys to give a kind of counterpoise to the Turkish Forces:
But they did still shun all occasions of interposing themselves in their
designs; and kept such friendship with Christian Princes, as might seem to look
more at their own safety, then at the injuring of others, and rather to the
preserving of what was their own, than to the acquiring what was their
Neighbors. Whence the Turks saw that the Venetians desired to keep friendship
with them; and that they knew how, and were able to make War, and be at enmity
with them: that they willingly avoided all occasions of making trial of their
Forces, but yet would not suffer such injuries as might be prejudicial to their
Honor, or State: and by this means they had enjoyed peace for above thirty
years. Whereby, besides the spinning out of time, which made much for the
weakest, they did very much advantage the City of Venice, wherein all Arts and
Merchandise did flourish. Whereby being much increased in inhabitants, and in
all sorts of Commodities, they had lived a long time joyfully, and contented,
in great tranquillity and plenty; the Citizens gaining much by traffic in the
Levant, and enjoying their Revenues so long free from extraordinary taxes of
War. Yet were not all men's minds free from jealousies and troubles; for finding
that Soliman had studied Sea-affairs, more by much then any of his
Predecessors, so as he sent forth almost every year a great Fleet, the end
whereunto not being known, it caused much fear; the Commonwealth being able,
by reason of her situation, to give a just counterpoise to the Turkish Fleets,
which grew now as formidable at Sea, as their Armies had been some years before
at Land: so as feeling the inconveniences of War in time of Peace, they were
often necessitated to Garrisonize their Forts, knowing how little faith they were
to adhibit to Infidels, and to be in continual expense and jealousy, as may
be known by what has been said in the preceding Books. But all men were
chiefly concerned in the care of Cyprus, that Kingdom being a very considerable
member of the State, and which lying far from the City of Venice, and being
environed round about by the Turkish Territories, was in greater hazard of
being possessed by so powerful Neighbors. Being therefore intent upon the
preservation of so rich and commodious a Province, they had reduced the City of
Necossia, the Metropolitan of that Kingdom, into a Fort-Royall, and had added
new Foot-Companies of those of the Country, to the ordinary Militia of the
Stradiosti, and made other provisions for War, endeavoring thereby to secure
that Island, and to bereave the Turks as well of mind, as of means to assault
it. Thus this war, which had been feared many years, was deferred all Solimans
life time.

But, his Son Selino succeeding him in his Empire, all men grew quickly more
afraid, it being publicly given out, that he had long had an inclination to
the enterprise of Cyprus. For before his Fathers death, whilst he, according to
the custom of the Ottamans, lived far from him in the Province of Magnasia;
having occasion, by reason of the Neighborhood, to receive several
informations of that Island, and daily hearing much talk of the fruitfulness
thereof, of the Noblemens wealth, and of the abundance of all things therein,
he had a great desire to possess it; so as he said publicly, that when he
should succeed his Father in his Empire, he would seek to make himself master
thereof. It was also given out, that Selino had begun to build a magnificent
Moschea in Andrenopoli, following therein the custom of many of his Ancestors;
who, (perhaps in imitation of those ancient Egyptian Kings, who built Piramids,
and other Fabrics of a stupendous magnitude) endeavored to perpetuate their
memory to posterity by making royal Edifices. He being therefore very fervent
herein was told by the Mufty, whose authority is as venerable, in the Mohammedan
superstitious Ceremonies, as is the Popes, in the true Christian Religion; that
he not having as yet made any acquisition, it was not lawful for him to build
a Moschey, together wherewith many pious works were to be instituted; and that
it was not lawful by their Laws, to employ any of the ancient Revenue of the
Empire in such things, but only the Incomes of such Countries, as were
conquered by him, who would have so much honor done him. Hereunto was added,
that it seemed, Selino had not only an occasion offered him to do this, but
that he was almost necessitated to make war somewhere, that he might follow the
footsteps of his predecessors, who were always used to do some notable action,
in the beginning of their Empire, to win the favor and good will of the
Soldier; the which it was thought it was the fitter for Selino to do, for that
he not being held to be a warlick Prince, began to fall from that high
reverence amongst the soldiers and people, which was wont to be given by them
to his forefathers. War being therefore to be made, it was not judged
convenient for him, to make it in Hungary, and much less in Persia, since the
confines of the Turkish Empire were of so large extent, as their Armies could
not be conducted thither, without much inconveniency, they being much wasted by
sufferings, and by the length of the way, before they could see the face of the
enemy; as had happened to his grandfather Selino, in the wars against the Sophie
of Persia, whom though he overcame in Battle, yet he himself was overcome at
last, having in his return lost the greatest part of his Army, by the length
and difficulties of the march. And as was more clearly seen, in the last
enterprise made by Soliman in Hungary, wherein the getting of the Fort of
Zighet, was not thought answerable to the loss of so many of his best
soldiers, which ensued thereupon. So as it was best for Selino, to betake
himself to some Sea-enterprise, whereof none lay more convenient for him, then
that of Cyprus, it being full of wealth, and placed in the utmost precincts of
the Venetian Dominions, and therefore weakest, as lying furthest from the
heart; wherefore it might prove an easy and a rich booty. Whereas if he should
go to the steril parts of Spain, to attempt any enterprise, he might fear, he
should consume his men in vain by hardships, and consequently reap rather blame
and hatred from the Soldier, then love and honor: And by any bad accident, he
might fore-bode bad success in the remainder of his Government. And the recent
example of the bad success at Malta, which was maintained by a few Knights of
Jerusalem, (whose peculiar seat and habitation it is) against a powerful
Turkish Fleet, might better teach them, upon what disadvantage war was waged in
another Territories, far distant from their own Dominions. Whereas on the
contrary, a more assured victory, and good reward was promised him, by the
enterprise of Cyprus, a plentiful Country, and environed on all sides by
Rivers, whereunto he had but a short passage of sixty miles for his men to
make. These things being maturely considered, did at first produce great fears,
that Selino would war with the Venetians, concerning the Kingdom of Cyprus. But
finding afterward, that he had very readily confirmed the same Articles of
peace, which had for many years been established, and inviolably observed by
his father; and that he had given signs of long continuing his paternall
affection to the Commonwealth, by his handsome treating of the Venetian
subjects, and their affairs. Moreover, it being observed, that no great
preparation was made for the Sea, and that several Summer-seasons being past
over, one only Fleet had put to Sea, and that but a weak one. All men were
persuaded, that what was formerly said of Selino's being naturally given to
pleasure, and not to military exercises, degenerating therein from the
Ottaman-race, would prove true; and that he would pass over his Government in
delights, and in idleness. His having given over the enterprise of Hungary,
which was happily begun by his father; his having made Truce for eight years
with Maximilian the Emperor; his not preparing to send out Fleets, and other
such like things, would have made it be believed, that all this had been done,
to confirm and to increase his forces by some repose, after the many past wars;
and that, free from other impediments, he would the better attend what he had
proposed unto himself. This opinion was likewise confirmed, that Selino would
continue peace and friendship with the Venetians, for that Mehemet, who was the
first Bashaw, and his son in Law, was thought, would be of great authority with
him; who, as a wise man, and well experienced in the management of many weighty
worldly affairs, would not advise him to make war with the Venetians, knowing
that it made not for their advantage, to deprive themselves of the Venetians
friendships, and of the many commodities which were brought unto them by
Venetian Merchants, who trafficking much in those parts, accommodate them with
many things which they want; and, to the great advantage of those Inhabitants,
export many commodities wherewith they abound, into other Countries. To which
the Prince his particular interest was likewise added, whose customs and
public revenues were much increased by Traffic with foreign Nations. And if
such a prejudice were not to be considered, to try fortune rashly and
unnecessitated, unseasonably, and without any cause, affording thereby occasion
to all Christian Princes, to join in a League, was judged to be a very
considerable thing; for when they should see their safeties undermined, under
the shadow of a seeming peace, and that a supreme Monarchy was labored to be
grounded in the Ottoman-Empire, they would be forced, being thereunto moved by
their own danger, to take up Arms together with the Venetians, to abate the
power and daring of the common Enemy. Which danger was not counterpoised, by
the hopes of getting a little Island, which though it were a Noble one in it
self, yet was it but a small addition to so ample a Dominion. To these so great
interests both of Prince and subjects, was Mehemet's own particular concernment
added, for he being in greatest honor and authority, he might in peace enjoy
his riches and his power, whereas in war he was to run many hazards; since he
being to tarry at Constantinople, when his Master should be in the wars, he
would be accused of negligence in making provisions, by his Rivalls; and if any
ill luck should happen, other men's bad counsels would be imputed to him; or the
main enterprise being committed to another, this other man, if things should
succeed happily, would be advanced in his Princes favor and esteem. It was
therefore believed, that the wisdom and dexterity of Mehemet, would much allay
Selino's immoderate desires, and that he would be a fit instrument, to divert
him from these thoughts. Hence it was, that many men beginning to fall off from
their first suspicions, the Venetian Merchants did not only continue their
former Traffic under the new Emperor, but traffickt more then before,
striving who should send most gold and silver, and other precious Merchandise,
into diverse places belonging to the Turks, whither people of several Nations
came, every one beginning to promise peace unto himself, out of the aforesaid
considerations, which were much credited out of hope of gain.

There is nothing more difficult, then to penetrate into the inward counsels
of Princes; there is no more fallacious argument, then that which is made upon
their resolutions, especially when their minds (as for the most part they are)
are agitated by variety of reasons, or disturbed by various affections. Selino
being in this height of greatness, though of himself he was no great friend to
Arms, yet this his natural defect being overcome, by the orders and power of
that Empire, or being persuaded out of the aforesaid reasons; he bent his mind
to possess himself of the Kingdom of Cyprus. Thus in the third year of his
reign, in the month of November, as he rid out with some of his chief Bashaws
to hunt, (which the Turks call their Divano a cavallo) he began to consult with
them herein. Mehemet, the first Bashaw, continuing in his former opinion, out
of the aforesaid reasons, sought by all means possible to dissuade him from it;
he showed, That whether it were Religion, State-interest, or Glory, which moved
Selino to make war, he should do it, to succor the Moors of Granado, rather
then for any other respect. That it became the greatness, wherein by the
favor of the Prophet Mahomet, the Ottaman Emperors were placed, chiefly not
to abandon them, who with a pious and constant resolution, had never abandoned
the Mohammedan religion; and who whilst they suffered bodily slavery, kept the
liberty of their conscience unspotted, by any superstition. That it likewise
became the power and safety of that Empire, as also the glory which Selino
seemed so desirous of, not to permit any Potentate to grow too powerful, but
to quell those first, who might oppose the Ottaman grandezza, as did the King
of Spain; and to undertake things, which though they might peradventure prove
difficult, would notwithstanding merit praise, and be of great expectation.
That therefore he should acknowledge, and make use of so good an occasion, as
God did now lay before him, to preserve the faithful Musselmans, to molest
their enemies, and to make way for noble and glorious atchievments. But Pi^li
and Mustafa Bashaw endeavored the contrary, with much fervency, and with the
same reasons, but applied otherwise; who not only out of envy to Mehemet, but
as his declared enemies; the former having by his means been deprived of the
dignity of Bashaw del Mare; and the latter's life much endangered by several
imputations, whilst he was Governor of Cairo, did always oppose Mehemets
designs and counsels; and they appeared the more zealous herein, for that
knowing they advised that, whereunto their Lord was much inclined, they hoped
to wind into his favor, and to deprive him thereof, who advised the contrary,
by applauding his resolution. To this was added, That if the business of
Cyprus should be pitched upon, according to their opinions and persuasions,
Piali hoped to be restored to his former honor, and to be Governor of the
Fleet; and Mustafa hoped to have the chief employment by land: so as upon any
happy success, they might each of them regain their former reputation and
authority. These men, sometimes considering the advantage, sometimes the
easiness of this enterprise; and oft-times mixing the consideration of
Religion with these concernments of State, showed, How that the Venetians
forces were of themselves weak, and that what assistance they might receive
from other Christian Princes, was by example known to be uncertain and
fallacious. That the Island of Cyprus, by reason of its far distance from
Venice, was hard to be garrisoned or succored; very convenient to be assaulted
by them, by its lying so near their Countries. That it was a rich and noble
Kingdom, commodiously seated for their other Territories, and so, as it might
secure the navigation upon those Seas, to the subjects of the Ottaman Empire,
which so great an Emperor as he, ought the rather to take into his care; for
that not only in derision of his dignity, but to the heinous scandal of
Religion, and of the name of Musselman, the voyage to the Mecca was impeded,
the Pilgrims being miserably made prisoners by the western Pirates, who had safe
harbor in that Island. And that as this war was of it self holy, so it might
be made the more meritorious, by applying the rich revenues of this new
acquisition, to the use of the magnificent Temple, which Selino caused to be
built in Andrenopolis. They moreover opposed Mehemet 's opinion very strongly,
and the Spanish enterprise, urging the difficulty of carrying so numerous a
Fleet into so far distant Countries; to what dangers it would be exposed,
sailing through places, where there were no Havens, through the enemies Rivers;
and then how long it would be, before the war could be begun, what alterations
time might afford; how vain those hopes use to prove, which are grounded upon
popular insurrections, without the groundwork of real forces. How craggy and
mountainous those parts were, and naturally apt to hinder any considerable
progress of any power, how great soever. Selino listened the more willingly to
what these men said, for that it was conformable to his own sense; and on the
other side, Mehemet's allegations were of less authority; for he being known
to be very wary, nay, rather timorous sometimes in his advices, he was thought
to act according to his own inclinations, when he was against making any war
without necessity; and now when he was for the enterprise of Spain, wherein
there wanted not much difficulty, he seemed to do not only what was
contradictory to reason, but contrary to his own nature. Selino proceeded
therefore herein with great respect and temper; and at last meeting with no
more opposition, he resolved upon the enterprise of Cyprus, saying, He would be
himself in person in it. And he was so affectionate, and so constant in this
resolution, as all men believed, he would have begun this War the very first
year of his Empire, had he not been detained by other impediments: for he found
the Empire much exhausted of many things, by reason of the continual Wars made
by Soliman, and especially in the last enterprises of Malta and Sighet, wherein
many men were consumed, and the Fleet was also almost unfurnished of all
things; so as it was necessary to refresh the Forces, and to recruit the Navy,
by time and rest.

The Bashaw of Caffa being put upon it, as it was thought by Mehemet, to employ
the Grand Signior in other affairs, had put him in mind, that by cutting a
neck of Land, about some eighteen miles over, in a place called Asdragan, which
was possessed by the Russians, two great and famous Rivers might be joined
together, the Tanai, and the Volga, whereby several Navigations would be much
accommodated, and the fishing of the Tanai would be bettered, to the great and
assured advantage of his Highness Imposts, and with hopes of greater things;
for thereby an easy Navigation would be opened to Mare Maiore, whereinto the
Tanai falls, and to the Caspian Sea, whereinto the Volga does disgorge her
self; so as Armies might upon any occasion be easily led into Persia. For the
which many men being assembled, and much endeavor being had, the Muscovites,
through whose Country the Cut was to be made, did not only raise many Horse to
disturb the work, but the King of Persia hearing thereof, and considering (as
it was true) that by leaving this way open to his Territories, they were bereft
of a great security, by reason of the difficulties of the deserts, and by the
length of the march, which the Armies meet withal which come to assault them,
he began to multiply his men, who were upon his confines, and gave Selino just
occasion to suspect, that these things being discovered, he would not ratify
the peace and confederacy which he had made with his Father Soliman. Nor was
the rising of the Arabians to be slighted, who had possessed themselves of much
Territories about the River of Giemen, taken the City Aden, and endeavored to
make themselves Masters of the Mecca, and giving out that they held
intelligence with the Portuguesse, made greater proceedings be apprehended. But
these rumors of the Arabians being at last appeased, and the King of Persia
having sent Letters, that he would continue his friendship and former
confederacy, and together with them (which made them be the better credited)
notice being given by the Bashaw of Ersirun, that all things were peaceful
upon the confines of Persia; Selino thought that being free from all
impediments, and having already made much provision for War, he ought not now
defer it any longer; and the rather, for that he seemed to be invited to hasten
the enterprise, by two sad accidents which happened this year, which did much
incommodiate the Venetians, but not so much as it was thought. The one was,
that there was so great a scarcity of all sorts of Grain this year throughout
almost all Italy, as there was great want found thereof in the City of Venice,
and in all parts thereabouts: so as it was thought, that not having
wherewithal to feed their own people, it would be impossible for the Venetians
to maintain an Army, and a Fleet. The other accident was not so sad of it
self, but very horrible in appearance. For fire taking on the 13th of
September, in the Ammunition of the Arsenal by night, were it by chance, or by
any other malice (which was never discovered), it burst out into so great a
flame, as much mischief was done, not only in the buildings which are within
the Arsenal, but in the parts about it, and to the wonder of all beholders, it
wrought some miraculous effects. For those Towers wherein the Gunpowder was
placed, were blown up even by the foundation, in so much as in the plain
thereof there was a ditch, above fifteen foot deep; and the walls which begirt
the Arsenal on that side, though they were very strong, and of a large circuit,
and certain huge vaults, under which Galleys are sheltred, were thrown down to
the ground. It threw down likewise the Church Monastery of the Nuns, Della
Celestia, and some other neighboring houses, and many other Houses that were
further off, were torn and spoiled; great holes were made in the walls, marble
broken, tops of Houses carried away, all the Houses of the City did so shake,
as it was generally thought, that if such an accident had happened a little
before, whilst some little Towers in the neighboring Islands were not
replenisht with Gunpowder, whereinto the greatest part of the Ammunition
Powder, was carried but a little before: that noble City, full of so many, and
so stately structures, had been utterly ruined; and truly, the noise was so
great and terrible, as it was heard by those that were above thirty 30 miles
off; and many in Venice, amazed at so unusual a sound, thought Dooms day had
been come. It was noised abroad, that very great mischief was done in the
Arsenal, and a great part of the Navall preparations lost by this fire; though
indeed the prejudice was not great, nothing having suffered, save only four
Galleys which were crushed by the weight of the Vaults; but those who solicited
the War at Constantinople, exaggerated these things, representing to the Grand
Signeur the Venetians condition to be very low and mean, prognosticating
certain ruin to the Commonwealth, and an assured victory to the Ottaman
Empire. These were the reasons why the Turks continued peace for many years
with the Venetians, and why they broke into war with them at this time.

The Senators received due information of these Counsels and transactions from
Mark Antonio Barbaro, their Consul at Constantinople, a very wise man, who did
excellent service all this while to the Commonwealth. But at first men could
not believe their own fears, which they had found to prove false several times
before; so as being now accustomed to a long peace, they could not easily
persuade themselves, that their condition could be altered; but either not
believing these advertisements, or interpreting things otherwise then they
were, they thought that this fury of war would burst forth somewhere else. Nay,
some of the chief Senators, and best experienced of that Nation, advised that
they should be very wary in making provisions for the Navy, lest they might
peradventure raise more jealousies then were needful in Selino, by their so
great preparations, and make him do that which peradventure he never dreamt of;
whereby they might rather hasten, then avoid their danger. The long nourishing
of these appearing hopes, was the cause why they did not make such provisions,
at the beginng of these jealousies, as the eminent danger did require.

But at last, in the beginning of January, the year 1570 being now commenced,
Letters came from the Consul to the Senate, wherein he gave notice not only
of the general speech and stirrings; but of the certain resolution put on in
the Divano, to assault Cyprus; though the Bashaws constanly affirming the
contrary, sought to conceal it. Mehemet, that he might not oblige Selino to do
it, by divulging it, and so deprive himself of any occasion which time might
produce; Mustapha; and Piali, that to their better advantage, they might
assault Cyprus at unawares. But the Consul cunningly seeming not to believe
that which he knew to be very true, discoursing with the Turks, and chiefly
with Ibrahim, their interpreter, a domestic servant of the first Bashaw, and
therefore of good esteem; he drew him at unawares into several communications,
whereby he learnt much of the Bashaw's intentions, of their preparations, and
particularly of a great number of flat bottomed boats, which were making in the
Gulf of Aiazzo, and in the Mare Majore, and of Orders given out by the
Captain-Generall of Asia, (by them called the Belgierbie della Natolia) to all
the Soldiers of that Province, that they might provide to ride into Caramania,
and of other things of like nature, by which he might clearly learn, that the
next summers action was to be against the Kingdom of Cyprus. After which
advertisements, they all began to be very diligent in providing for so great a
need, sought by their present diligence to repair the time they had lost, and
gave themselves with all diligence to provide for all such things as were
thought fit to withstand the fury of so certain a war. They resolved to send
forthwith great Garrisons into Cyprus, and wished all the Governors of the
Island to be very vigilant in preparing all such things to sustain the War,
which was chiefly intended against that Kingdom, to exhort the common people to
Loyalty; and the Gentlemen that were Feudatories, to provide Arms and Horses,
according as they were bound to do; and Commanders in chief were provided for
their Sea-forts, Luca Michiele was made Commissary of ^ania; Lorenzo da Mula,
being sent a little before into Candia, with title of Commissary General of
that Island, with particular charge to inform himself of such as were fit for
the Oar, wherewith to furnish twenty Galleys, which were to that purpose sent
into that Kingdom. Sebastian^ Veniero went to Corfu, who had the supreme
Authority of the Militia of that Kingdom given him; and Giovanni da Lege, a
Cavalier, and Procurator of St. Mark, was sent to Zara, and made General of
all Dalmatia. All the Ships which lay in the Havens of the City, were forbidden
to depart without license, though they were so few at this time, as thereby the
difficulty of sending such Foot as was requisite into Cyprus, was made the
greater. Soldiers were raised in many parts of Italy, diverse Commanders were
brought thither, and with much union and diligence they were continually
careful, in ordering all their Forces both for their own defense, and to offend
the Enemy, insomuch that there was never any provision for War proposed in the
Senate, which was not approved of by almost all the Votes. But chiefly they
gave themselves with all diligence, to have work done in the Arsenall, and to
prepare great store of Galleys: There were eleven Governors chosen of the
greater Galleys, and Francesco Duodo was made their Captain, one highly
esteemed for his valor, and knowledge in Sea Discipine; and eighty were chosen
to be Governors of the lesser Galleys, who were all of them chief Gentlemen of
the City, and such as were best experienced in Sea affairs. Pietro Trono, was
made Captain of the Frigates; and they resolved to arm a Gallioune, very
artificially built before by Vittore Fausto, a learned man, and who had a
particular excellency in composing Sea-Engines; Girolimo Contarino, was made
Captain thereof; but Girolomo Zane, Procurator of St. Mark, was to have the
supreme Authority over the whole Fleet: He was held to be very fortunate both
in his own private condition, and in the public employments, who had always
governed himself therein with much integrity and wisdom. These things being
thus ordered, they applied themselves diligently to see them performed; and all
provisions were so easily and readily had, as exceeded expectation. Concerning
the using of these Forces, some propounded, that forty Galleys should speedily
be sent toward the Levant, who keeping in Candia, should be ready to make use
of such occasions as time, and the Enemies proceeding should offer. They
considered, that to show this courage at the first, would add comfort to the
subjects, and reputation to their affairs; and on the other side, would infuse
doubts and confusion into the Enemy, and retard their expedition. For it was
likely they would not venture to come forth of the Strait of Galipoli, without
their entire strength, when they knew they should meet with such resistance:
The which was known, would be of so much the greater help, for that they
understood afterward, that the Turks feared this more then any thing else; and
that therefore they had been extraordinarily diligent in sending out 25
Galleys, that they might carry the Ammunition which was prepared for the
enterprise of Cyprus, early from Allessandria, which if they should be
intercepted by our Galleys, they knew their whole design would be lost. To this
it was objected, that it might prove to be of greater danger then security; for
that the Turks did always keep so many Galleys ready for the usual guard of
some of their places, as that many Pirates Vessels being added thereunto, (as
was usually done in time of War) they might trouble our Galleys, and perchance
endanger them, which they thought was the rather to be shunned, for that they
had great hopes to do some remarkable action, by using all their forces jointly
together. Therefore laying all other thoughts aside for the present, they
seemed all of them to be chiefly troubled, how to put sufficient Garrisons into
the Forts of Cyprus: Some were for the furnishing them so with men, as if they
were never to be relieved; and for providing to relieve them so, as if they had
never been Garrisonized. But as the one was variously incommodiated, by the
shortness of time, by want of vessels, and by fear, that the enemy would be
out, very strong, and very betimes; so they thought, they could not repose any
certain hopes in the other, by reason of the enemies powerful forces, and out
of the various events of war, and of actions at Sea. This mean while, whilst
they were treating, whom they should send to bear chief sway in Cyprus,
together with succor; Eugenio Singlitico Count di Rocas, a noble Cyprian, who
at this time discharged the office of Lieutenant General of the Militia, by
Terra Ferma, and was for the most part resident at Venice, readily offered
himself to relieve his Country, at this her so great need, and to serve his
Prince: And being speedily dispatched, went his way in a ship with a 1000 Foot,
and was by the Senate made chief Commander of all the Cavalry of that Kingdom.
Girollimo Martiningo, conductor of the Gens d' Arms, readily and generously
offered himself, to raise 2000 Foot within a few days, in the States of other
Princes, and to go with them himself to the relife of Famagosta, and to stay
there to defend that City. Thus having in a very short space, much to his
praise, put all his men in order, and brought them to Venice, to embarque both
them and himself, in ships destined to that purpose, he would show himself with
all his soldiers to the City, appearing in a military habit in the Piazza of
St. Mark, a thing well worth the seeing; for the sight of so proper men,
adorned with bright Arms, and variety of other noble ornaments, did much
delight the unskilful multitude, who being pleased with the novelty of the
spectacle, considered not, what the progress and end of war might prove: For
these so many and so valiant men, did all perish in a short time, some by
suffering, some by the sword of the enemy; and Martiningo's self falling
grievously sick, through the inconveniences of Navigation, dyed before he
could arrive at Cyprus, being herein the l^sse fortunate, that he did not die
in Battle, and crown his glory with a more noble death. He was much praised for
his loyalty, and for the service he showed to his Prince.

The Senate, when they were certain of these the Turks designs and
preparations, made an account be given thereof by their Legier Ambassadors, to
almost all the Princes of Christendom: wherein the Venetians were the more
solicitous, being moved thereunto, not so much out of hope of getting them to
join in their defense, as that they might not seem to scorn the help of
others; and that confiding too presumptuously on their own strength, the event
of that War, wherein the common cause of Christendom was concerned, might be
the more endangered. They therefore acquainted them with the weight, of what
War the Commonwealth was to sustain, and with the dangers wherewith at the
present they were threatened, but wherein all Christendom would in time be
concerned. So as some Senators were not listened unto, who advised to do what
they were able, speedily, and of themselves, lest by relying upon the uncertain
hopes of others, they might either slacken their own provisions, or being
allured by the no-certain promises of Princes, quite give over all thought of
any treaty of peace. Pope Pius Quintus sat then in St. Peter's Chair, who being
but of a mean extract, and exalted to that Supreme dignity out of the fame of
his integrity, made good the opinion of his worth, and his so great authority.
Wherefore the Venetians addressed themselves to him, as to the chief head of
Christendom, and as to a person of singular goodness, entreating his
assistance, and that he would persuade other Christian Princes to embrace the
common cause. Michielle Suriano was at this time Ambassador for the
Commonwealth at Rome, whose experience in State Affairs was the more set off
by his learning: He, adding to the Pope's already good inclination* many
weighty persuasions, did continually excite him to take to heart the
Commonwealth's cause, in this time of so great danger. He sometimes urged the
examples of other Popes, who had at other times readily assisted the Venetians,
against these enemies to the faith of Christ; sometimes he remembered the
services done by the Commonwealth to that See, for which she had always so
readily exposed her forces, against powerful Princes. But he oftest mentioned
the great and eminent danger of the other Christian Kingdoms, and chiefly of
the Church-Dominions, if the Commonwealth of Venice should be weakened, which
was held by all men to be the surest Bulwork of Christendom. The Pope being by
these persuasions wrought upon very much, to defend the Venetians, showed a
very great zeal to the common good, and an ardent desire to provide for what
was needful for this War, and to assist and sustain the Commonwealth, that
her dignity might not be suppressed by so potent an enemy, nor her dominions and
forces weakened. Yet calling to mind what had been done formerly, upon like
occasions, by other Popes, and lately by Paul the third, in the League made
against Soliman, he desired to be pardoned, if he did not all he desired to do;
deploring the condition of his times, wherein the moneys of that See were much
exhausted; and also by reason of the commotions in France, wherein the City of
Avignon was much endangered, being put to great expense and trouble. Therefore
though he often moved in the Consistory, that the defense of the Venetians
might be embraced, that they might be assisted in this their necessity; and
though their cause was approved of in the College of Cardinals, and generally
favored, yet they came to no particular declaring what they would do; only it
was granted at the first, that they might raise 100000 Ducats, for the
maintenance of that war, by a general tax upon the Venetian Clergy, from which
no Prelate of what condition soever, should be exempted. The Pope propounded
afterward, that the King of Spain's Galleys might speedily join with those of
the Venetians, whereby to make a powerful Fleet to oppose the Turks, and to
disturb these their first designs: And that in the mean time, a League might
be treated of with the said King, and the other Princes of Christendom, whereby
their forces might for a long while be established, to oppose the Turks. And
having made this be signified to the Senate by the Ambassador Suriano,
exhorting them to assent to this proposition, and to put this business into
his hands, who, as the common Father, would be very zealous of the good of
Christendom, and would have a particular care of the good of the Commonwealth.
He found them all very well inclined, to follow his authority and advice. He
resolved at the same time likewise, to send Ludovico de Torres, Clark of the
Apostolic Chamber, into Spain, to Philip of Austria, the Catholic King, to
exhort him to assist Christendom readily, against Selino Ottaman, enemy to
himself, and to the Catholic Faith, which he did particularly profess to
protect, as, by the glorious name acquired, by the pious and generous actions
of his Ancestors, he was bound to do. He therefore laid before him, the great
danger, wherewith diverse States of Christian Princes were threatened, by the
Turkish Fleets, which though it was given out, they were intended against
Cyprus, yet was it not certain, but that they might easily and speedily fall
upon his Dominions; which though they were not for the present molested with
war, yet were they in the future the more exposed to the incursions and
assaults of the Turkish Fleets, when the Venetians should be weakened in their
Maritime forces, and the Turks Empire increased. So as he was to esteem the
interests of that Commonwealth inseparably joined with his own. That the
Ottaman Empire was a common enemy to all the Potentates of Christendom, and
more strong and powerful, then any one of them apart. But that if all, or most
of the Christian Princes, would join together, they would exceed the Turks in
power, and might hope, not only to resist them, but perhaps to beat and
conquer them. That the King was to consider, that if he should not aid the
Venetians, at this their so great need, he would lose much honor amongst the
Turks, making either his weakness clearly appear, as if the Moors
insurrections were sufficient to keep him so employed, as that he could not
make use of his forces elsewhere; or else, that he held but bad intelligence
with the Commonwealth, or with other Christian Princes, by not moving against
his enemy, being invited by so fair an occasion, but abandoning the common
cause. That he had used the same endeavors to the Venetians, who had readily
referred all things to him, promising to stand to all that he should decree;
nor was their truth herein to be doubted, since they knew by experience, they
could not ground any safety to themselves by peace with the Turks. Moreover,
that great respect would be given to his authority, since he had the spiritual
arms in his hands, and did declare himself to be the head and manager of all
this business. These things were prudently and effectually represented to the
King of Spain, in the Pope's name, by Torres, who presented him likewise with a
Brief, wherein the Pope did much deplore the miseries of the present times,
remembering therein particularly, the many mischiefs which Christendom had
suffered in several parts, through the wicked conspiracies of men branded with
heresy, and several infamous vices; who rebelling against God, and against
their Princes, had with much audaciousnesse and fury, shaken several whole
Provinces of Christendom, and sought to corrupt the into gr^ty of the Catholic
Faith. To which inward grievances, other mischiefs and greater dangers were
added, by foreign enemies; Soliman having attempted by great forces, to bereave
Maximilian Caesar of the remainders of the Kingdom of Hungary: which fire of war
was likely to have burn^ forth throughout all Germany, had it not been
extinguished by Soliman 's death. But that now, new combustions and calamities
did seem to threaten Christendom: that therefore he knew it became him, to have
an eye to these commotions, and to denounce so great dangers to Princes,
wherein he was to address himself chiefly to the Catholic King, and to
excite him to be the first, that should embrace the defense of Christendom,
since God had endowed him to that purpose with greatest power and command. That
for what concerned himself, he would not be failing in any thing that lay in
him, nor in pouring forth prayers continually to God, that he would look with
the eyes of mercy upon our actions.

These were the endeavors used by the Pope to the Catholic King, who listening
thereunto with much benignity and attention, seemed to be very much rejoiced
thereat, showing a very good inclination to the common welfare, and to put an
high esteem upon the Pope's authority and advice. But because the King was then
in Cordua, and was to expedite the affairs in the Courts of Castile, he excused
himself, that he could not give a positive answer to the particulars propounded
by Torres, in an express memorial, till he should come to Sivill. Yet Torres
soliciting his expedition with reiterated endeavors, as he who knew nothing
could be so prejudicial to the business in hand, as delaie, nor nothing so
helpful, as speedy resolution; He got the King to promise him, that he would
give order that his Galleys, and those of his stipendiarie, and confederates,
which were about 75, to boot with those of Spain, which by reason of the
commotions in Granada, were to tarry in those Seas, should be all brought to
the Island of Cicily, with particular Commission to John Andrea Doria, who had
the command thereof, to follow the Pope's commands, touching the time and
manner of joining with the Venetian Galleys, and to undertake the voyage and
business of the Senate. He likewise obtained orders to the Viceroyes of Naples
and Cicily, that they should furnish the Venetian Fleet with as much corn, as
they could conveniently spare, out of those Kingdoms. But as for the League, he
would not at that time determine any thing, since the King said, It would
require mature consideration. But soon after, when he came to Sivill, he
resolved of his own free will, though it was thought, he was persuaded to the
contrary by many, to send sufficient Commissions to Don Jovan di Zuinga, who
was then his Ambassador at Rome; and to the two Cardinals, Gravelle and
Pacecco, to treat of the League, and to conclude it; it being thought fit,
(...) viating the delays and difficulties, which the far distance of Countries
might occasion, in a business of such concernment, that the whole Treaty
should be reduced to the City of Rome. The Venetian Senate had sent orders to
their Ambassador, Sigismonde de Cavalli, their Ambassador at the Catholic
Court, to be aiding to Torres in his negotiations; the King affirming, that
when he should know the Pope's proposalls, finding him very well inclined to
the common good, he would willingly accept of his counsels and exhortations,
and would readily do, whatsoever should be resolved of in Rome, and established
by the Pope's authority, and by the consent of the Princes. That he very well
knew, what the present mischief was, and what the eminent dangers of
Christendom. That he would not be wanting in any thing, which might remedy
them; and not only to sustain the dignity and state of the Commonwealth, but
the reputation of the name of Christian. These endeavors wisely performed by
Cavalli, prevailed very much, in bringing the King to put on this resolution;
and being several times efficaciously reiterated by Lunardo Donato, who at
this time succeeded Cavilli; they did help very much, to keep the King in this
good mind, and to overcome many difficulties which were importunely promoted
by many of his Counselors, and State Officers; Donato having purchased much
favor and reputation in the Court, by his worth and grave Eloquence.

Torres having thus dispatched his Commission in Spain, that he might fully
complete the Pope's orders, past suddenly into Portugal, having first got
Letters of recommendation for what he was to treat upon, from Io^e the Kings
Mother, who was then at Madrid. Sebastian the first, was at this time King of
Portugal, a youth of some seventeen years old, religiously educated under Don
Luigi Gonzabell, a Jesuit, one well esteemed for his integrity, and of great
Authority with the King: wherefore the Pope promised himself all the assistance
that could be expected from him, for the service of Christendom. He therefore
desired, that the ten Galleys, which were continually kept armed in that
Kingdom, might pass along into these Seas, together with those of the
Catholic King, and join with the Venetian Galleys. But the King, showing great
obsequy and reverence toward the Apostolic Sea, and much desire to satisfy
the Popes request in this so pious and profitable enterprise, excused himself,
that his actions could not correspond with his inclinations; for that his
Galleys were for the most part disarmed, by reason of the Plague which had been
the year before in Lisbon; and that it was not possible for him to arm them so
soon, as that they might be fit for service that year; so as Torres his journey
into Portugal, as to that point proved to no purpose. But he began an other
business with that King, which was, to procure the consummation of his
Marriage with Margaret, sister to the King of France, which had long before
been treated of, but to no effect, by the Catholic King. But it happened very
unseasonably at this time, that the Pope's power was not great with the
Emperor, by reason of his being offended with him, for having granted a new
title of great Duke of Tuscany, to Cosmo de Medici, Duke of Florence, which
being done not only without Caesar's knowledge, but (as he said) contrary to
his will, expressly signified by his Ambassador, then resident at Rome, he
thought his honor much concerned therein, and the Authority of the Empire; so
as being much scandalized thereat, he in his Court declared this act of the
Popes to be invalid, and had already sent his Ambassadors to Rome, to protest
the invalidity thereof unto the Pope. Therefore the Pope minded the Venetians,
that they might do well to work the Emperor to be a friend herein, which when
he should declare himself so to be, he the Pope would not be wanting to make
him the more fervent therein by his exhortations, and express Nuncio's.

At the same time therefore, when the Treaty concerning this Confederacy was
promoted at the Catholic Court, Iovan Michiele, the Venetian Ambassador, an
able man, and very dexterous at the management of important affairs, had given
a beginning to the same at Caesar's Court: He told the Emperor, that now the
occasion was given of doing that which he himself had often wished for before;
and whereby he might safely assault the Turkish Territories on that side,
whilst they being busied at Sea, would not have opportunity to relieve them:
That he was not therefore to wait, till this War being ended, and their Empire
secured by their Sea-Forces, the Turks might turn all their Forces to prejudice
him: from which danger, how little safe he was by the League with the Turks,
and their plighted faith, he might easily perceive by Selino's having broken
peace with the Venetians, and by his having violated his Oath, for no other
cause, but that he would govern the whole world. To which Caesar seeming to
assent, he readily answered; He would not be wanting to his own good, and to
the good of Christendom, but exhorted the Venetians to accept of, and to
prosecute this War, with a constant and magnanimous resolution; saying, that
their noble daring would make all other Christian Princes the more willing to
assist and back them, which they would never fail to do, if the Venetians were
not faulty to themselves. For his own part, they might promise themselves a
ready resolution; that he knew, the Archdukes, his Brothers, would be of the
same mind with him; and did hope that the King of Poland, and the Duke of
Muscovy, would follow his example: but that it was necessary to see first what
the other Princes would do, and particularly the King of Spain* whose pleasure
in that point he had desired to know speedily and assuredly, by a messenger
which he had purposely sent unto him.

The Pope did often solicit Charles the ninth, King of France, by his Nuncio,
to side with the League, endeavoring to persuade him, that though perhaps he
could not lend so speedy assistance to the League as was requisite, by reason
of the troubles his Kingdom had been in for many years of late by domestic
affairs; yet ought he to favor it as much as he could, and add unto the
Reputation, if not unto the Forces thereof, by his name, and by his authority;
which request the King not thinking himself able to satisfy, and yet being
unwilling to seem to undervalue the Pope's exhortations, and authority; he
interposed several delays, saying, That he would see, what others would do,
who were then more powerful then he, and freer from impediments: But the
Queen Mother, on whom the weight of that Government did then very much rest,
excusing her self more directly, said, that her Son's condition differed from
that of other Princes, because the point in hand with them was, of continuing
War against an Enemy; but with France, it was of breaking amity with a potent
Prince, their ancient friend; that therefore it was a business of great
weight, and which ought to be well considered. But both the King and Queen,
were very civil in their speeches toward the Commonwealth, in so much, as to
boot with their offers made to the Venetian Ambassador, then resident in the
Court of France, and many that they made their Ambassador make, who were then
resident at Venice: The King sent a Gentleman of his expressly to offer unto the
Signory, all that it was possible for the Kingdom of France to do at the
present, being molested with so grievous accidents; to wit, That he would use
his Authority to divert this War, and to accommodate their affairs with the
Turkish Emperor, making use of that friendship which he had never contracted,
but found it commenced by his Grandfather, King Francis, and by Henry his
Father; and that he would think she should now make good use thereof, if he
could thereby do any service to his ancient good friends the Venetians. But
neither did time nor occasion permit any use to be made of these things;
preparations for War being already too far advanced on both sides; nor was it
thought a good course to slaken either other Princes, or themselves, all of
them being now hotly set upon War, and bent to defend their own Dominions. The
Italian Princes appeared well inclined to the League; the Duke of Urbin offered
both himself, and his State readily, and the Duke of Savoy did the like, but
to better advantage, by reason of his Galleys, whereof good use might be made,
as did after the Confederates. The Duke of Florence was the more forward
herein, professing to be governed in all things by the Pope, as being obliged
to him for his new access of honor; and to win his favor the more, he seemed
not only willing to favor the League, but being then in Rome, he encouraged
the Pope to what he saw him already zealously bent. But the Duke of Ferrara had
so incensed the Pope against him, by reason of the old difference of the Salt,
and of certain Navigation upon the Poe, as he constantly affirmed, that he
would by no means bear with the disobedience of a vassail of the Church: nor
that his own Authority should be so lessened, threatening to go against him with
his temporal arms, unless he altered his mind: And on the other side, the
Duke said, that if he were necessitated to do so, to preserve the jurisdiction
of those Dominions, which being gotten by his Ancestors fell to him by right of
Inheritance, he would leave nothing unattempted; nay, that he would call in the
French H^genots to his assistance; which the Venetian Senate thinking to be too
unseasonable at this time, and that it might not only disturb the League which
was now on Treaty, but otherwise necessitate and endanger the Commonwealth;
they sent Iovan Formento, Secretary of the Council of Ten, a man well
experienced in such Negotiations, to Ferrara, to mediate with the Duke, that
considering the present state of affairs, and the due obsequy which he ought to
pay unto the Apostolic Sea, he would both for the common good, and for his own
particular interest, lay aside all thoughts which might put him upon the trial
of his Forces, and that he might hope to receive better, and more certain
advantage by Treaty. Thus by the interposition of the Senates Authority, first
with the Duke, and then with the Pope; this other fire was extinguished which
was a kindling, to the prejudice of Christendom.

It was also resolved, to solicit Tamas king of Persia, to take up Arms, and
to revenge the ancient and new Injuries which his Kingdom had received by the
Ottaman Princes. Vicenza d' Allessandri, was chosen for this employment, a
Citizen of Venice, as one, who having lived long at Constantinople, was versed
in several Languages, and had had some converse with these barbarous Nations.
This man, the passages being blocked up, by reason of the Wars, in the lower
parts toward the Sea, took his journey throuhg Germany, Poland, and Walacchia,
and coming to the banks of the Mare Majore, took shipping at Moncastro, which
is the ancient Hermonassa, and went from thence to Lynope, a City famous, for
having been the Country of Mithredates; and from thence he went to Tauris,
whither being come, and understanding that Tamas was then at Casmin, one of the
Residences of the Kings of Persia, which lies more inward into the Country,
which was anciently called Arsatia, he went to that City. Here; being brought
in by some Armenian Merchants, (who had had commerce formerly at Venice) by
night according to the custom of that Nation, before Sultan Caidar Mirice, the
Kings third Son, and who was then his Lieutenant, he had several long
discourses with him, touching his journey, and the occasion thereof; Vicenzo
acquainted him with Selino's having taken up Arms against the Venetians, and
with the great preparations for War, which was made by almost all the Princes
of Christendom, to assault the Turkish Empire, by their Armies, and by their
Fleets, exhorting him in the names of his Lords and Masters, to make use of
this occasion, and to make War with the Turks on that side: now that their
Asian Territories being exhausted of all their Soldiers, who were to be
employed in the enterprise of Cyprus, were left a prey to whosoever would
assault them. All which things Caidar seemed willing to hear, and by many
questions informed himself of every particular; but promised nothing, save that
he would be a means that he might be admitted to audience by his father.
Al^ssandri perceiving this unseasonable delay, began to treat with the Lord
Chancellor of the Kingdom, being advised so to do, and assisted therein by Coza
Ali, a Merchant of Tauris, to whom, he going at the same time from Venice, the
business was recommended; the Chancellor, after some discourse had thereupon,
said that his King was a wise Prince, and that he was to proceed maturely in a
business of such Importance, and would a while expect the success of the
League, upon which he might afterward ground his resolution the better. Thus
Alessandri not being admitted into the Kings presence, departed without any
other answer: For it was clearly seen that Tamas, being now very old, and
addicted to peace, shunned giving occasion to the Turk of any suspicion, that he
would conspire against him, together with the Christian Princes. This business
was likewise much impeded by accidents which happened at that time, wherein
(according to the usual course of the Ottaman family) the Persian forces were
employed in appeasing certain Insurrections, raised by a Nephew of Homat,
formerly King of Giland, a noble and rich Country of Media, now in the
possession of the Kings of Persia: whereupon Mustapha Mirise, the Kings eldest
Son, was gone with 10000 Horse into that Province, to suppress the Author of
those Commotions. Thus whilst the Christians were in trouble, the Persians
enjoyed their quiet, nourishing thereby a long and heavy War unto themselves,
which was made against them some few years after by Amurate, Son to Selino, who
possessed himself at unawares of several places in Media, in the Country which
is now called Servan, whilst the Persians did in vain desire to see the
Christians take up Arms against the common enemies, as the Christians did now
in vain desire the help and favor of their forces. These were the Venetians
preparations, these their counsels, and treaties with other Princes at this
time, that they might jointly wage war with the common enemy.

But the Turks beginning this mean while to commit many hostile acts, had
detained several subjects of the Commonwealth, together with their goods, who
traffickt in Narenta, and in other parts of Albania, within the Turkish
Dominions; and had likewise unloaded two Venetian ships which were at
Constantinople, and not suffered them to depart from those Havens, though upon
other pretenses: Which when the Venetians heard of, they thought it became
them, to treat the Turkish subjects which were in their City accordingly; to
the end, that their persons and goods might serve, to ransom our men, and
their merchandise. A guard was likewise put upon a Chiaus, named Mamutbei, who
being parted from the Court to go for France, was come some days before to
Venice, and stayed there, to negotiate a certain business of some particular
Merchants, with the Venetian Signories, to whom he brought credentiall Letters;
as also to be advised therein by Monsieur Duferier, the French Ambassador,
then resident at Venice, who thinking, that it had been fit to have known his
Kings intention, which peradventure might have been altered, by the various
accidents of the times, and to procure a safe conduct for Mamutbei's passage
through the State of Millan, had kept him from pursuing his journey into
France, out of these respects. Duferier did modestly resent the detention of
this man, as of one who was sent to his Prince, and had been advised to tarry
there by him; wherefore he endeavored his liberty. But the King, when he knew
the Venetians just reasons, and that Mamutbei had not any important business
to treat of, but that he was come either to be a spy over the Venetians, under
other pretenses, or else sent out of some idle occasion by the French
Ambassador, then resident at Constantinople, without his knowledge or consent,
he was soon pacified. Mamutbei was therefore sent to Verona, and kept prisoner
in St. Felice's Castle, till the end of the war. Whilst the Venetians were thus
employed, the Turks were not idle at Constantinople, but were alike diligent in
providing all things, that they might put to Sea as soon, and as strong, as was
possible. Selino being returned to Constantinople in December, he was so
diligent in making men work in the Arsenall, in causing new Galleys be built,
in caulking old ones, in casting Artillery, and in all other necessaries, as he
himself went thither sometimes to hasten the work. A great number of Pioners
were listed in Grecia, great quantities of Biskets was made in Morea. Galleys
were sent to Constantinople from many Provinces, to make up the Fleet; and
twenty five Galleys were prepared in all haste, to be speedily sent into
Allessandria, to bring away much provisions, which were made ready there for
the Armies: For they did very much fear, that the Venetians would be speedy, in
sending a great squadron of Galleys into the Levant, whereby their Navigation
might be blocked up and hindered, much to their prejudice. They were likewise
very solicitous in finishing a Fort, which was begun a little before at Brazzo
di Maina, that they might have a fitting and safe receptacle for a good
squadron of Galleys, which they purposed to send early out, to hinder the
succor which might be sent by the Venetians to Cyprus. And Selino continuing
his resolution, to go himself in person in the Army, an infinite number of
Camells were prepared, and great solemnity was used in getting all things
ready, according to the custom of that Nation, when their Emperor goes into
the field. The Bashawes discoursed often, how the war was to be managed, wherein
their opinions were very different; some were minded, that before any thing
else were done, men were to be poured into Cyprus, by a great Fleet of all
sorts of Vessels, which being landed, and the flat-bottom'd Boats, and small
Pinaces being left there, together with a squadron of Galleys, for their better
security, the rest of the Fleet should make for our Gulf, to terrify the
Venetians, and to confuse them the more, and to keep the Christian Fleets play
in these seas. And that if it should be too long, ere the whole Fleet could be
united, the first hundred Galleys which should be ready, should be presently
sent toward Cyprus, to get footing there, and to secure the landing of the
rest of the Army, by building a Fort there. Others would, that Piali, without
any further loss of time, should instantly put to Sea with 100 Galleys, and
enter our Gulf, and that the rest of the Fleet should be sent to Cyprus. And
others thinking it neither safe, nor of any use, to advance so soon, proposed,
that Piali should go with the said hundred Galleys, to the Haven of Suda, and
possess themselves thereof; and pillaging the Island of Candia, should wait
there for the rest of the Fleet, and to do then as they should see cause, by
the movings of our Fleets. The different respects of Mustafa and Piali,
nourished the variety of these opinions the longer; for the former, to whom the
enterprise of Cyprus was commended, desired, for the better success, that the
whole Fleet should be employed only therein: And the latter, who had the
supreme authority over the Fleet, endeavored, that the Fleet might go
somewhither else, whereby he might have occasion of doing some gallant action,
which might redound to his particular praise.

The Consul got notice of all these preparations and counsels, who being very
desirous that they might be known at Venice; to which purpose, as he was very
diligent in writing to the Senate, so feared he, that all his Letters might be
intercepted, as he knew some of them had been. Wherefore knowing, that Mehemet
was against this enterprise, he sought how to work this his intent by him: He
cunningly invited him, to propound somewhat to him, which if he should have
moved to Mehemet, he knew would not be granted; to wit, that some of his
servants might be sent to Venice, which was the only means, whereby he might
fully and safely acquaint the Senate, with all that past at Constantinople. He
therefore first by Ibraim's means, and then himself by word of mouth, did let
the Bashaw know, how ill it became the power and generosity of so mighty a
Prince, to assault those at unawares, who thought themselves safe under his
plighted faith and oath; as if he were not able, when time and occasion should
require, to use his forces against them, to get what he thought he had just
pretense unto: that first he was to use the way of justice, then of violence;
and to try what might be done by Treaty, before he laid his hand upon his
sword. Which Mehemet thinking to be reasonable, he persuaded Selino to demand
the Kingdom of Cyprus from the Venetians, by a man of his, who should be sent
to Venice of purpose, before he should forceably assault it. Cubat Chiaus was
chosen to do this, who had been at Venice some two years before, about other
business. Whereupon the Consul took occasion, under pretense of securing the
Chiaus in the Venetian Dominions, and of putting a greater reputation upon the
business, to send his Secretary, Luigi Buonrizzo, who being very well informed
of all things, was very fit to be employed herein: And he got leave, by the
Bashaw's means, to send his young son Luigi to Venice, who he feared might run
some danger, by being at this time amongst the Barbarians. Another no small
advantage was also hereby got; for the Turks suspended their Arms till the
Chiaus should return; and our men had more convenience given them, to garrison
their Forts, and to provide for their subjects safety, who were every where
already sorely infested by the Turks; for the St. Iacks of Clissa and Bossina
being up in Arms, upon occasion of this war, and every one striving, who should
first prey upon the neighboring places, they ran every day through the
Territories, and came even to the gates of the Venetian Cities, carrying away
corn, cattle, and all things else, from the Country people, and taking many of
them prisoners; insomuch as Bernardo Mallepiero, Commissary of Horse in
Dalmatia, going one day out of Zara with 80 Stradiotti, to secure the men of
the Country, he met with a greater number of Turks, and advancing too forwards,
transported by his courage and desire of praise, he was so sorely wounded, as
he fell down dead off his horseback, and Fabio de Canale was chosen in his
place. And not long after, Iulio Savorguano was likewise sent to Zara, to be
General of the Militia of Dalmatia. The coming of the Cubat Chiaus with the
Secretary, signified to Venice, as soon as he was come to Ragugi, made several
impressions in men's minds: Some were solicitously desirous, to know the reason
of this unexpected Embassy; others imagined it to be what they desired, and
were glad, that a way was opened to a treaty of Peace; and others were sorry,
thinking that he was come to hinder their preparations for war, and to
interrupt the great hopes which they had already in vain fancyed unto
themselves. But understanding by the Letters which the Consul sent them from
Ragugi, the true occasion of his coming, and the copy of the very Letters,
which the Chiaus brought them in the name of the grand Signior, and of the
Bashaw, wherein the voluntary surrender of Cyprus was demanded, which if they
would not do, he then denounced War against them; The Senators began suddenly
to think, what answer they were to make, thinking it a thing which much became
the honor of the Commonwealth, to give a speedy answer to this Embassy; as
also, that it suited not with the condition of those times, and to the putting
a good end to the Treaties, which they had already begun with other Princes;
wherein many considerations were to be had, which tended notwithstanding all to
the same end, so as each strove to confirm other, in the generally received
opinion; which was, to dismiss the Chiaus suddenly, without any other answer,
but that they would accept of the war which was intimated to them, and prepare
for their defense. These considered, That no good could be done by the way of
Treaty to keep off the War, which was already resolved on by Selino; and that
since they were howsoever to undergo the hasard, it would become the
Commonwealth better to be generous, in taking up Arms speedily in their own
defense, not showing any the least sign of fear, which might seem to make them
distrust the honesty of the cause which they were to defend. They said, they
were deceived, who thought, that Selino 's vast desires, which, caused by a
greedy desire of Government, tended to infinities, and was not to be appaid by
the Empire of the whole world, could be satisfied with beginning to grant
something to his unjust demands. So as it was not only not to be hoped for,
that this his desire should terminate, in some new Tribute imposed upon the
Kingdom of Cyprus, or in any thing else that should be voluntarily yielded unto
him, as some would seem to say; but that esteeming the acquisition of that
Kingdom but a small matter, he would quickly begin to aspire after the rest of
their Dominions, even to their total destruction. Nor that they ought to be
terrified by the example made use of by some, of the great dangers which the
Commonwealth underwent in the last wars by Terra Ferma, since it was apparent,
that it was rather the rash resolutions of their Captains, which had thrust
them upon those difficulties, then the Senate's mature advices; and that these
might now be in a great part avoided, since that the war which was now to be
made, was by Sea, and by their own Citizens, who for their own honor, and for
their great concernment therein, would handle it with no less fortitude, but
with more wisdom and fidelity, then peradventure their land Armies ^ad been
managed by forrainers. That likewise such was the condition of times, the
nature and intentions of the present Princes such, as they might more safely
rely upon hopes from them, then they had reason to do formerly. That now all
men knew, the common cause was in question, and were all therefore bound, to
join in the maintaining thereof. That in the mean time they should not, by
setting new business on foot, make them grow cool and jealous, so as they
might with reason refuse to affye in them, whom they should see so afraid at
the very fame of danger; and who, after such preparations for war, should so
easily give way to thoughts of peace. They added moreover, that the condition
of the commonwealth was to be considered, the state of affairs being reduced
to that pass, as she was continually in many grievious dangers, which were not
lessened by time, but made greater daily. That therefore they ought not to give
those that should succeed them, occasion to complain as much of them, as they
did now of their predecessors, for having suffered the Ottaman family to grow
so powerful. And that such a fault would be now more heinous, as that they
knowing the danger better, then peradventure their ^^^^fathers did, and being
more necessitated to provide for their own safety, would not do it; preferring
the conveniences of a short and uncertain peace, before the honorable
troubles of War, whereby, the Forces of Christendom joining together, they
might hope to procure greater safety to themselves, and posterity.

The hearts of all men not being only confirmed by these reasons, but even
inflamed on War, it was by a general consent of the whole College, propounded
to the Senate, and the advice of dispatching the Chiaus away quickly, with few
and resolute words, accepting the War which he was to denounce against them,
was approved of. But that which was wont to be said is true, the too great
desire of things, does often make the obtaining thereof more difficult, and the
truth not being suffered to be seen, things are brought to an end, differing
from what too ardent a desire had framed unto it self: Surely the doubt
propounded, that the Princes might grow suspicious, that they would treat of
some Agreement with the Turks, if they should return a slower and less
positive answer to this Embassy, was more prevalent than any other Reasons;
which made it be apprehended, that the treaty of League, which the Venetians
did so much desire, and which was hopefully begun, might be interrupted: and it
is most certain, that when news of the Chiaus coming was brought to Rome,
those who treated of the League for the Catholic King, began to be more
jealous in the business; and it was afterward more clearly known, that these
jealousies, and these suspicions, did more then any other reason, remove many
difficulties which arose in this Agreement. But the answer being resolved upon,
and Cubat being already come to the City shore, where he was made to tarry in
the same Gally which had brought him from Ragugi, and all commerce was
forbidden him: order was given, that he, unaccompanied by any, save Secretary
Buonrizzo, and two Dragomani, should be privately brought into the College,
without any such honors, as are wont to be given to such as come from that
Court upon any public business; yet he had the usual place allotted him,
which is the right side of the Princes Chair: being thus brought to audience,
he kissed the Princes Garment, and sitting down after he had made many
reverences, he drew forth a Purse embroydered with Gold, wherein, accordding to
the custom of that Nation, Selino's Letter was; and said, This, most
Illustrious Prince, is a Letter from my Lord and Master, when his demands
therein shall be known, I will expect an answer: Which the Prince saying, he
should have, he was somewhat troubled that no more was said unto him, and
added. Gentlemen, Mehemet, the first Bashaw, has willed me to tell you, that he
is very sorry, that occasion is happened of breaking that peace, which he has
always endeavored to preserve: But the so many complaints made at Court, from
so many places of the unfriendly behavior of the Officers of this State, and
chiefly of the harbor, and favor given in Cyprus to the western Pirates, by
whom the Musselmans have been much indammaged this very year, have made such
impression in the grand Signor, and so incensed him against this State, finding
that his endeavors often used with the Consulls, has done no good, as he can
no longer forbear intimating of War unto you; and knowing that you will not be
able long to resist the power of so puissant a Prince, be as a friend advises
you, rather to choose any other means to free your selves from so many and so
great dangers: And to this end, he has procured me to be sent to this City,
and offers to interpose himself in all he can, to keep you from falling into
this great misfortune, and to preserve you in the ancient friendship of the
Grand Signeur. This being said, he gave them a Letter from the same Bashaw,
which contained all that he had said. To all which, the Prince answered; That
the Senate had resolved upon an answer, the which that he might be the better
able to understand, and to relate again, the very words should be read unto
him, which was done by Antonio Milledonne, one of the Secretaries of the
Council of Ten: the answer was this. That the Senate did very much wonder, why
his Master, being unprovoked by any injury, should violate the Oath, wherewith
he had but a little before confirmed the peace; and that he might pick a
quarrel to make war with them, should demand the surrender of a Kingdom, which
had been for so many years, lawfully, and peacefully possessed by the
Commonwealth, which he might be sure they would by no means part with. But
that since he was pleased to proceed in this manner, the Venetian Senate would
never be wanting in defending what was theirs; hoping to be the better able to
do it, for that the goodness of their cause, would procure them the assistance
both of God and Man. He was afterward told, that when his Masters Letters were
translated, they should be read, and an answer should be sent him. And thus
without any further discourse, the Chiaus was dismissed. The Letter began with
many complaints against the Venetians; for their having disturbed the ancient
confines of Dalmatia, which were prescribed to each of their Dominions, in the
Agreement made by their Predecessors, that contrary to the ancient and new
Articles, they had taken away the life from many Musselman Pirates; after they
had been taken alive in fight. But particularly, that refuge was continually
given in the Island of Cyprus, to the western Pirates, who infested his
adjoining parts, and hindered the Navigation of his subjects upon those Seas:
wherefore he demanded in the latter part, That if the Venetians, would continue
their ancient friendship, they should yield up the Kingdom of Cyprus, so to
take away the chief occasion which nourisht these discords; and that
otherwise, they were to prepare to sustain a sore War both by Sea and Land; for
he would send his Fleet with powerful Forces, to take that Kingdom, and would
assault their Dominions in all other places; and he did trust in God, the
Patron of all Victories, and in his blessed Prophet, Mahomet, who had blessed
the Ottaman Family with so large an Empire, to prove victorious in this
enterprise, as his Predecessors had always done in all their attempts. To
these Letters, the Senate returned this answer. That the Venetians had always
observed peace with the Ottaman Emperors inviolably, despising all other
respects, and refusing all occasions, which they might have made use of to
their advantage. For they thought it became Princes, above all things else,
diligently to keep their word, and their plighted faith; that being desirous to
avoid any suspicion in this point, they had past by some injuries, that they
might not be the first disturbers of the Peace: but that since they perceived
that War was pronounced against them now, when they did least suspect it, they
would not refuse it, to defend themselves, and to preserve the Kingdom of
Cyprus; which as their Fathers had possessed for the space of several ages,
under a just title, so they did trust in divine justice, to be able to defend
it against whosoever should go about to rob them of it unjustly.

War being thus intimated to the Venetians, and by them accepted, drew all men's
eyes upon it, every one expecting how the Potentates of Christendom would
resent this great commotion; and believing that strange revolutions would be
seen in the greatest Empires of the world, according as the fortune of War
should favor, or frown upon the several designs of Princes. And as men do
always differ in opinion, this resolution was diversely understood and
interpreted. Some thought, that it might have better become the wisdom of the
Senate, and the manner wherewith the Commonwealth had wont to proceed, to have
given honorable reception to Cubat Chiaus, and by endeavoring to sift out
whether he had any secret Commission or no, from the Grand Signeur, or from
Mehemet, to use their skill and cunning to bring the business to a Treaty,
which when it should be begun, time would be got, which would make much for the
advantage of the offended. These recalled to memory the passages of the former
Age, and how late our Fathers did repent their not having taken this course,
when War was denounced against the Commonwealth, by almost all the Princes of
Christendom in the League at Cambrai, from which, and from the so many miseries
thereby occasioned, they might perchance have freed themselves, if they had
betane themselves betimes, rather to Treaty than to Arms. That the present
business was no less perilous, than that which had preceded; but the
greater, for that then the first brunts being sustained, they might expect much
benefit by the protraction of time, since these Forces were likely soon to
sunder, and grow weak, by reason of the differing designs of the associate
Princes: but that now having to do but with one only Prince, who was very
powerful, they underwent the same dangers and difficulties, whether they
should hazard themselves upon the fortunate of Battle, or spin out the War in
length, nor was all ways to Treaties hard up, since Selino was not provoked by
an injury, to assault the Commonwealth, nor by any jealousy of State, whereby
he might plead necessity of selfe-safety for what he did; but by a certain
slight appetite of his own, or desire of Glory, which he having but small
reason to do, it might in time cool of it self, and by the chief Bashaws
mediation. Nor would this be any baseness, but true moral wisdom, by which a
wise man aiming at the common good, and setting aside all other vain respects,
knows how to suit his actions to time and occasion; Nay, the Commonwealth
might gain more honor, if treating of peace with their sword in hand, they
might come to Agreement with so proud and haughty an enemy, by the bare fame of
their Forces; and if these Negotiations should not be able to reconcile the
Enemy, it might advantage the League which was in treaty with their friends.

But others on the contrary, whose number was much the greater, exalting the
constant generosity of the Senate even to the skies, fancied extravagant things
unto themselves, and what they might more truly have excused by necessity, or
have praised for wisdom, in having without loss of courage, accommodated their
resolves unto the time; they did celebrate it, as sprung out of mere election,
and out of a magnanimous and noble purpose, to abate the power of the common
Enemy, inciting other Princes to do the like, by their leading the way, and
making war upon the Turks in their own confines, both by sea and land. That the
power and greatness of that Nation, was not peradventure so much dreaded
before, because it was far off, and unknown; that now it was grown so near, and
so well known, and esteemed by all Princes, as there would not be any one of
them, who would not for their own safety, favor the enterprise; and that so
much the rather, for that nothing was more manifest, then that if the Venetians
should be worsted, the Turkish Fleets might much the more easily, run
victoriously over all the Seas.

The zeal and charity toward their Country, increasing the more in some, out
of these respects; in others, the obsequie toward their Prince; and in some,
the desire of military honor; many of the Venetian Nobility, especially those
who held any Ecclesiastical dignities, and many Gentry of the Terra ferma;
nay, many of the Commonalty, and also many chief personages, not only of other
parts of Italy, but forrainers came in apace, and offered the Commonwealth, in
so just and pious a war, either money, or soldiers, or their own persons, or
other things fitting for the Fleet; and all this with strange and miraculous
alacrity: So as vying in a noble emulation, it is not easy to determine who
did exceed in their offers, liberality, piety, and fidelity. This did very much
comfort the Senators, it being a manifest testimony, of the pleasing and
moderate government of that Commonwealth, and of the esteem she was in with
forrainers. So as their Citizens and Subjects uncommanded, and moved only out
of a singular affection toward the State, did of their own free will employ
their persons and faculties, for the preservation thereof. And other Nations,
esteeming its defense as the common cause, sought to maintain its greatness,
and increase its glory. Therefore proceeding with all respect, as far as the
present necessity would permit, in taxing the City of Venice, and the other
Cities belonging to the State, they resolved to alienate diverse public goods,
to make use of much moneys deposited in the Exchequer, to the great advantage
of such as brought gold or silver thither. To this purpose, the number of the
Procurators of St. Mark was increased; this honor, which is next that of the
Doge, being conferred upon as many, as did lend above 20000 Ducats to the
Public, in reward for their good will toward their Country, and for their
having assisted her at such a need. Leave was also given to all young men, as
were nobly born, upon depositing a certain sum of money in the Exchequer, to
enter into the Consiglio majore, before the time allowed by the Law, and to be
capable of choosing Magistrates, and of exercising some places of Magistracy
themselves.

There was at this time a cessation of Arms, Cabat's return being expected, and
the issue of his employment; but the news which he brought being divulged,
when he came to Ragugi, the soldiers of those confines not waiting for any
orders, assembled themselves together in great numbers, and did not only
pillage the Venetian's subjects that were in Albania and Dalmatia, but encamped
themselves before the Cities of Dolcigno and Antivari; wherein finding that
there were good Garrisons, and many of the Country, and wanting Artillery to
storm them, they were forced for the present to retreat. But when the Chiaus
was come to Constantinople, and that the Senate's answer was known, every one
was struck with wonder; for the Turks knowing, that the Venetians had formerly
studied very much to preserve their friendship; thought they would do any
thing, rather then take up Arms against them. Selino was not only amassed, but
was very angry, at the neglect which he thought was done to him, in their not
having treated Cabat with the wonted demonstrations of honor, and for that
they had not sent their resolution in a business of such importance, by an
express messenger of their own, but contrary to their promise, detained
Secretary Buonrizzo at Venice. Wherefore contrary to custom, and Mehemet also
desiring it, he would have Cabat brought into his presence, and receive from
his own mouth what the Venetians said, and did unto him, and how they were
prepared for war, things which are commonly brought to the grand Signior's ear
by the chief Bashaw. So as these things bearing with them the greater force,
being related by the messenger himself, Selino was sometimes much amassed at the
forces of the Commonwealth, and did almost repent what he had done; sometimes
he was the more incensed, being incited thereunto by his own haughtiness, and
by his servants flatteries. He therefore set a guard upon the Consul's house,
not suffering him to come forth, nor to negotiate with any one; and gave orders
to the Bashawes of Cairo and Aleppo, to do the same to the Consuls of
Alessandria and Soria, being Venetian Magistrates, kept in those parts for
matter of Merchandise; who were all of them at first kept under the same
restraint, but were soon after se^ at liberty, upon the giving in of security
not to depart themselves, nor to send any of their goods out of the Turkish
Dominions. But Selino did chiefly solicit the departure of the Fleet, there
being not ^s then above twenty five Galleys gone forth, under Amurate Ra^s,
destined to hinder the relief which might be brought to Cyprus; which being
encountered by the two ships, wherein Martiningo's soldiers were, they fought
them, and valiantly repulst them, with loss to the enemy. But soon after,
seventy Galleys were committed to Piali's charge, and ordered to put to Sea,
which going first toward Rhodes, stayed there, expecting Mustafa with the rest
of the Fleet, that they might then do as they should see occasion, and
according as they should hear news of the Christian Fleets, they not daring to
divide themselves, nor go jointly to Cyprus, nor to put on any certain
resolution, in what they had at first designed, by reason of the great opinion,
which Cabats relation had raised, of the forces and preparations of the
Venetian and Spanish Fleets. Wherefore their fear and confusion did increase so
much, that no news being heard of the Fleet for some days after it was put to
Sea, and fearing lest the Christian Fleet might be past by, and gone toward
Constantinople, they sent to view, and to put Garrisons into the Forts of the
Dardenelli, so to provide against any sudden accident.

At this time the Doge, Pietro Loredano dyed, on the fifth of May, having
possessed that supreme dignity for about three years space, but had not been
therein very fortunate; for many sad accidents of fire, famine, and war,
falling out at the same time, though without any fault of his, who was a Prince
of much innocence and integrity, made the memory of his Government but meanly
acceptable to the people. Luigi Mocenico was chosen four days after to succeed
him, in whose election, the memory of his ancestors concurred, (who had been
famous and well-deserving men) as also the favor of his kindred, and his own
worth, which prevailed the more with men; for that these times of danger
required, to have a man of mature wisdom for their Head, and one very well verst
in the management of affairs, both at home and abroad; and such a one was
Mocenico held to be. And to the end that men's minds might be busied about
nothing but war, though it was provided by the Laws and ancient Customs, that
a Magistrate should be chosen in the vacancy of the Dukedom, whose office was,
to correct the disorders of the Judges of the Palace; and an other Magistrate,
whose particular care it was, to enquire into the actions of the dead Prince;
yet the former was at that time quite forborne, and the choice of the other
deferred, till after the election of the new Prince. And now the Venetians
having sent word to all Princes Courts, of the coming of the Chiaus, and also
acquainted them with the answer wherewith he was suddenly dismissed, they
continued the treaty of the League. Therefore to the end, that the business
might be carried on at Cesar's Court, with the greater reputation and
authority, they resolved to send a particular Ambassador thither, and Iacomo
Soranzo was chosen for this employment, a man of great esteem and authority,
and who had been long verst in the Courts of Princes, on the Commonwealth's
behalf; for the Senate thought it was very fit, to quicken Maximilian, by a
particular Embassy, and by more pressing endeavors; since they knew, that his
resolution would be of very great concernment, for the establishment of the
hopes of this union of Christendom, both in his own respect, and for that other
Princes would be willing to follow his example: Who when it was thought, he
would have been more fervent in his first intention, by the dismission of the
Chiaus, and by the wars being resolved upon, began to grow cool, and to move
many difficulties, saying, That it would be necessary to find out some means,
to be sure, that none of the Colleagues might not withdraw themselves, upon the
approach of any danger, and leave the rest engaged, seeming to believe but a
little in the German assistance. And men did the more apprehend these his
doubts, because it was said, that he prepared at the same time to send the
Tribute to Constantinople, which is paid to the Turkish Emperors for the
Kingdom of Hungary. Wherefore the Senate used all the means they could, by
their Legier Ambassador, that the Tribute might be kept unpaid, till this
Treaty were at an end; which if it should be sent before, the Treaty would be
almost ruined, before it was well begun, and much prejudice would be done to
the common cause of Christendom. But notwithstanding the Emperor desired, were
it either by way of excuse, or that he did really wish it, that the
Commonwealth would send an Ambassador to be assistant to this purpose, at the
Diet which was to be held at Spire, by whose presence a business of that
concernment might be therein treated of, and concluded with more honor and
safety, wherein the contributions of the Princes, and Hans-Towns of Germany was
requisite, without which Caesar could not resolve for certain to enter into the
League, nor expect any good thereby. But no speech being had at the Court, of
Spain, of the Confederacy, which the King was contented should be treated of at
Rome, and had to that effect sent sufficient commission to his Ambassador Iovan
di Zuniga to Antonio Cardinal Gravella, and Francisco Cardinal Pacecco, the
Popes Nuncio, and the Venetian Ambassador, pressed that Doria, as soon as he
should have got the Galleys of those Seas together, which he had received
orders to do, might be commanded to join with the Venetian Fleet, wherein the
Kings Counselors propounded several doubts; sometime alleging, that it was
not fit that he who commanded the Kings Galleys, should obey the Venetian
General, and that by the inferiority of his Forces, he and his Fleet should be
totally at another disposal: sometimes seeming to believe, that the Venetians
would make use of this semblance, and of the name of these Forces, to treat
with the Turks upon the better terms: wherefore they affirmed, that the Treaty,
and conclusion of the League, was chiefly and primarily necessary. But in Rome,
where the scene of the business lay, the Pope, knowing that to treat of every
particular Article, would draw to a necessary and very prejudicial length,
proposed, that since the King of Spain, and the Venetians, were already
resolved to make this union, the League should be publish^ without any more
delay, as done in the same manner as was observed in the year 37, That the mean
time, those Forces which were in being should join, to give more reputation to
the common cause, to invite the other Princes to declare themselves the sooner
Companions and Confederates, and to cause more fear in the Enemy, and that the
particulars of the agreement might commodiously be discust afterward.

Whilst these things were a ripening thus, the General Zanne was gone from
Venice in the beginning of April, and was come to Zara, where the Rendesvouz of
the whole Fleet of the people and provisions for War was to be; that when all
things should be ready prepared, they might pass on into the Levant. But the
coming of some Galleys being delayed, as also Arms for the Soldiers, and
several other instruments of War, great store whereof were taken order for,
for Land enterprises; and the design of using those Forces, whereon great hopes
were grounded by the conjunction of the Spanish Galleys, being altered, the
Fleet was forced to tarry longer in that place then was thought for. So as this
long time of leisure, which was for about two months, began to be very
prejudicial to the Fleet; for so many people being assembled together, must
needs suffer many inconveniences, which occasioned many maladies; for that
men's evil humors were not wasted by exercise, which made many fall daily very
sick; so as all the Galleys were but in ill order as concerning Soldiers and
Mariners: some desired, for the encouraging of the Soldier, whom they found
to be miserably lost by idleness, that they should make some attempt upon the
neighboring parts; but this was gain said by many things: for the Towns which
the Turks are masters of upon those Confines, are far from the shore, so as
there seemed to be much danger in attempting any thing with the foot alone, and
those most Italians, most whereof were new men, and ^nexperienced, especially
being unback'd by Horse: the Enemies Country being full of Horsemen, ready to
go whithersoever there should be any occasion. Moreover, the places were such,
as there was no hopes of doing any good upon them by the sword; and it was
almost impossible to bring Artillery thither, as well by reason of the
mountainous ways, as for the want of Cattle. It was likewise considered, that
to attempt any thing in the Gulf, was not much to the purpose, lest they might
thereby draw either a great number of their Land men into those parts, or
perhaps their whole Fleet; so as they must with more danger make War at home,
and excluding the Galleys which were in Candia, and others at Corfu, and
likewise those of the Pope, and of the Catholic King, they must wrestle for
the main business with but a part of their Forces. Moreover it was not thought
convenient for their business, nor answerable to the opinion which the world
had conceived of so great a strength, to betake themselves to any slight
employment, wherein if they should effect their desire, the acquisition would
not be a sufficient recompense for so great a preparation; and if it should
happen otherwise, the reputation of the Fleet would be much lessened, and the
hopes of greater things. But it being known from Rome, by the Popes own words,
that Doria had orders from the King, to join with the Venetian Fleet; the
Senate gave present command to their General, that leaving four Galleys in the
Gulf, under one of the Governors, he should go immediately with the rest of
the Fleet to Corfu, and there to expect news from the Spanish Galleys, that he
might go together with them to Messina; and that when the Fleets should be
joined, he should fall upon such enterprises as he should judge would make most
for the Commonwealths advantage, and whereunto God should open an occasion,
aiming chiefly at the beating of the Enemies Fleet, but to be well advised in
what he did, and to proceed with maturity. Wherefore Zanne going from Zara on
the twelfth of July, he went toward Liessena, where he met with six great
Galleys, and some Ship^ which joined with the Fleet. From Liessena, he went to
the mouth of Catharo, and from thence straight to Corfu, without making any
attempt upon Castle Nuovo, o^ Durazzo, for the fore-alleadged reason. But
before any news was heard at Venice, of the Flee^s being come to Corfu, news
came to Rome, contrary to the former touching the joining of the Fleets; for
Doria said, that the orders he had received from the King were not such, as
that he was thereby to be gone with his Fleet, and to join with the Venetians;
and though the Pope made his complaints thereof to the Kings Ministers of
State, and writ himself to Doria very efficaciously, yet they making many
excuses, spun out the time, and Doria, seeming to be of himself very willing to
obey the Pope, said openly, that he must have his Orders more fully renewed;
those which he had received, not being sufficient to that purpose. The
Venetians were the more troubled at this, for that they did not at all expect
it, and because this variety of Counsels did withdraw from the hopes of
concluding the League, since such tediousness and difficulties were interposed
in granting those Forces which were already in order, which occasioned no
further charge, and which might be so advantageous; and since they proceeded in
so reserved and irresolute a manner. The Senate seeing themselves in these
straits, and that they had lost so much time to no purpose* sent new orders to
their General, that without expecting Doria's Galleys, he should go with his
Fleet into any part of the Turkish Dominions, which he should think fittest,
and should do what the good of the Commonwealth, and occasion should counsel
him unto. At the same time, the Popes Galleys were armed at Ancona, to go join
with the Venetian Fleet at Corfu: for after many consultations had by the Pope,
and College of Cardinals, touching what assistance they should give to the
Commonwealth in this War: they resolved to arm twelve Galleys with the
Churches moneys, which the Venetians were to find, and furnish with Oars,
Tackling, and Artillery. Mark Antonio Colonna, Duke of Paliano, was by the Pope
made Governor of them, with title of the Churches Captain-Generall against the
Infidels. The Venetians were very well satisfied with this choice; though upon
former treaty, upon whom this charge should be conferred, they had pressed very
much, that according as had been done formerly, a Venetian Prelate might be
chosen for this employment, thinking that such a one, (as a Venetian) would be
faithful to the Commonwealth; and (as a Prelate) would depend upon the Church
and Pope, and consequently, give satisfaction to all parties.

Colonna, as soon as he was sure of this Employment, writ thereof to ^^e
Senate, and strove by very affectionate words to ascertain them, that no was
very willing to serve the Commonwealth, whereunto he said he was very much
obliged for their favors, showed at all times to his House, and particularly
to his Father, nay unto himself in this very occasion, for having put such
confidence in him, and made him capable of serving the Apostollick Sea, as also
the Commonwealth which maintained the honor of Italy* ye^ in a business
wherein the good and exaltation of Christendom (...) concerned.

Thus having solemnly received the Standard from the Popes (...) in St. Peter's
Church, he took Venice in his way, as he went to Anco^na, to take order for
arming the Galleys, where affirming by word of mouth, what he had said in his
Letters, he gave a general, and truly, a very miraculous satisfaction touching
himself; every one thinking that they might promise all things unto themselves
for the service of the Commonwealth, from this Captain, and from the
pontificiall Forces which were recommended to his charge, and returning
suddenly to Ancona, where all the bodies of the Galleys were already come; he
was diligent in seeing them manned, that he might go with them into the Levant,
to find out the Venetian General.

Whilst the Fleet was thus preparing, Sebastiano Veniero, who, as has been
said, was Commissary-Generall in the Island of Corfu; a man of great age, but
of as great worth, whose age had not at all abated the edge of his youth: he
not being able to lie long idle, resolved to employ those few Forces which he
had with him, in some Enterprises. Thus, by the advice of Emanuele Mormori da
Napoli di Romagna, a valiant man, and well-experienced in those Countries, he
went to the taking of Sopotia, a Fort belonging to the Turks, standing on Terra
Ferma, just over against Corfu, which if it should fall into our men's hands,
would open the way to greater actions in Albania. Veniero being gone from
Corfu, with twelve well armed Galleys, commanded by Iacomo Celsi, Commissary by
Sea, when he was past the Channel, landed his Men, and his Artillery, whereof
Natale da Crema, then Governor of all the Militia of that Island, was Captain;
and to make their work sure, they resolved first of all, to seize on certain,
Passes, in the neighboring mountains, whereby they feared the Enemy might
bring relief; and this was committed to Mormori's charge, as to the first
Author of this resolution. They began then to play furiously upon the Castle
both by Sea and Land, so as breaches were soon made for our men to assault it;
and the Turks who were within, dispairing to be able to maintain it any longer,
provided for their safety by secretly running away. Whereupon our Commanders
entered with all their men, and without any withstanding, set up the
Commonwealth's Standard; by which the Venetians beginning to get reputation in
those parts, some that were near Cimera, did willingly submit to the Government
of the Commonwealth: and the like disposition was found in many others, if
they had been fomented and defended by convenient forces, and had had weapons,
and Chief-tains to rise withal.

But on the other side, the Turks ceased not to molest Dalmatia: and after the
Fleets departure from Zara, having got together many Horse and Foot, they took
the Castle of Xemunico, eight miles distant from Zara* wherein they used more
fraud then force, for having bribed Ierolimo Contarini, a base Bastard, who had
the custody thereof, in the name of certain Venetian Gentlemen, of the Family
of the Veniero, to whom the jurisdiction of that place did particularly belong;
they did not only prevail with him, to deliver up the Castle, but as one
perfidious both to God and Man, they drew him to be a Mohammedan. After this,
the Turks attempted Castello de Novigradi, but with differing success; for
having begirt it with many Horse and Foot, and played upon it for three days in
vain with certain small pieces of Artillery; they were forced, little to their
honor, to quit the enterprise. Our men ran more danger, and were more
endammag'd in the Gulf of Catharo, for the Catharians having manned forth two
Galleys, to relieve their neighbors and friends of Lustica, who were much
molested by the Turks, they were at unawares set upon by a great number of the
enemies Vessels, and were all of them either slain or made prisoners.
Wherefore fearing lest the Turks, encouraged thereby, might betake themselves
to greater attemps, they began quickly to munite Catharo, putting four hundred
soldiers into it, and sending three Galleys thither from Venice, with good
provision of all things necessary.

In the interim, the General was come to Corfu, with 70 small Galleys, the
Ships and greater Galleys being tarried on the way behind; wherefore they began
to consult upon what was to be done: (In all resolutions, by order from the
Senate, besides the General, who had a double voice, the two Commissaries of
the Fleet, and Sforzia Pallavesino, were admitted) all desired, that the Fleet
might forthwith advance. But many things made against this, for neither had
they as yet any certain news of the Candia-Gallies, which were twenty in
number, commanded by Marco Quirini, Captain of the Gulf; nor did they
assuredly know, what course the Turkish Fleet did steer: So as it was judged to
be a rash counsel, to hazard the main business with half their forces, since
by a little patience, they might receive much safety and accommodation. The
mortality which continued still to be very violent in the Fleet, was a great
hinderance to this resolution; for some Galleys were totally unmanned: and the
malady grew so contagious, as they who lay with the sick, fell ill of the same
disease; and some were so strangely taken, as growing mad, they threw
themselves into the Sea. And the violence of the sickness was the greater, for
that the number of the sick, and the want of many necessaries, would not permit
such care to be taken, nor such remedies to be used, as was needful. So as
there died of this pestilent disease 20000 men of the Venetian Fleet, amongst
which, many Venetian Gentlemen, who commanded Galleys, and other personages of
honorable condition. Therefore to advance any further, without a new recruit
of Mariners and Soldiers, was not only thought dangerous, but almost
impossible. The Commanders by common consent, did therefore betake themselves
to provide more men, to supply the place of those that were dead; to which
purpose the Governors of Zante and of Cephalonia were wished, diligently to
prepare as many men as possibly they could. But they thought it fit the mean
while, to keep the Soldiers exercised in some military service, who did
already begin to grow insolent and disorderly, through too much idleness. They
resolved therefore to fall upon the Castle of Malgariti, a mean thing of it
self, but, by its situation, fit for other enterprises, and proper for what
was now intended, it being an easy enterprise, and which would require no long
time: For the uncertainty of the Turkish Fleet, and the hopes of the coming of
the Pope's Galleys, and those of the King of Spain, by whose assistance they
might employ themselves in greater matters, dissuaded them from undertaking any
thing of length or difficulty. The charge hereof was given to Sforza
Palevisino, who being General of the Venetian Militia, had the particular care
of managing, what was to be done by Land. For this, there were forty eight
Galleys destined to be commanded by Commissary Celsi, with 5000 Foot, and four
great Guns; with which Forces, our men being gone from Corfu to the Haven of
Nista, which lies just over against it; and being come thither, upon the
Sunrising, Palevesino landed his men immediately, hoping to assault the enemy
advantagiously at unawares, and to begin and end the business that very day:
He sent some Harchebugiers toward certain places which lay open between the
Mountains, to possess those passes, by which he feared the enemy might be
succored; and dividing the rest of his men into two squadrons, he ordered one
of them to march with the Artillery, to the foot of the Mountain, and to wait
there for new directions, and kept the other with himself, following the former
somewhat slowly; and resolving to advance himself in person, accompanied by
Commissary Veniero, to discover the situation and form of the Castle the
better; which it being long ere they could come within sight of, they perceived
the way to be further, and more difficult, then had been told them by those,
who said, they knew the place; so as they found the Artillery could not be
brought thither, without much difficulty, and some expense of time: Besides,
the Castle was seated upon an high Mountain, and well flanck'd, so as it would
be able to defend it self for a while; the which was the more likely, for that
those that had the custody of the Castle, would boldly hold it out as long as
they could, hoping to be relieved by the neighboring Sangiacchi. Palevisino
weighing these difficulties, and thinking it did by no means behoove him, to
hasard those men in a petty business, which were destined for far better
hopes, resolved suddenly to be gone, not making any attempt; though Commissary
Veniero sought to persuade him to the contrary, alleging, that if they should
be so sudden and resolute in doing so, they could not avoid that blemish which
they lay under, of having in vain taken in hand an unseasonable and difficult
business; or else, that it not being so, they had through too much fear, too
soon given it over. He therefore proposed, that they might keep their men in
the field, at least the next night, and expect whether the enemy, when they
should see them resolute, would not by their fleight, open them way to an easy
victory; which if they should not do, they should at least show, that their
retreat was not occasioned by any disorder or fear, but by reason, and
necessity; which just excuses would not be admitted of, by their so great
haste. But Palevesino not allowing of these reasons, began to make his men that
were with him retreat, and sent at the same time to those that were with the
Artillery, to re-imbarck speedily, though they were in order at the foot of the
Mountain, waiting till he should come. Thus both the squadrons being met, they
marched back to the place where they had that morning landed, a good part of
the night being over before they got thither: Then missing their Harchebugiers,
whom they had sent to possess the Passes, they were forced to keep all on land
till the next day, when they sent a good band of soldiers speedily away,
commanded by Count Cesare Bentevoglio, to be a convoy to as many as could
retreat with safety; which they could not do, without some opposition and
danger, for there appeared already diverse squadrons of the enemies, both Horse
and Foot: But though the Soldiers got safe to the Galleys without much
prejudice, they were but coolly welcomed to the rest of the Fleet; for it was
thought, this so sudden retreat might much lessen the reputation of those
forces, which were to serve against the enemy, and was an ill Omen to their
more important proceedings. Yet after diverse consultations, it was resolved, to
depart with their Galleys from Nista, and to return and join with the rest of
the Fleet at Corfu. And every least action being at this time observed by all
men, who were desirous to see, what the event of so great a preparation for war
as this, would prove; Palavesino had much ado, to justify this action to
many: But he, by the testimony of several, constantly averred, that he had
sent certain Grecians, to wish the soldiers, who were sent to guard the
Passes, to retreat; who being overtaken by some of the enemies Horse, went
elsewhere for fear, and by their great cowardlinesse, occasioned another error
in some of the same Nation, who being acquainted with those parts, had
persuaded them, as he said, to come thither, by their false informations; which
they must believe, if they would effect that enterprise: for to send a few to
discover the situation, was to hasard them to too manifest danger; and by
sending many, they should give notice to the enemy, and make the difficulties
the greater. But to shun the like error an other time, when it was proposed to
attempt the Castle of Prevesa, or of Santa Maura, Palavesino would go thither
himself, and took with him Paolo Orsino, Harcole de Pii, and Commissary Celsi;
who at their return to the Fleet, brought back word, That those enterprises
would prove difficult, and would require time; for the enemy fearing an
assault, had fired their suburbs, and were very vigilant; so as it would
require much forces, and length of time, to storm them, which made them think,
they were not at that time to be attempted.

At this time came Marco Quirini, Captain of the Gulf, to them, with the
Candie-Gallies, who had been long detained in the Haven of Candia, as well by
occasion of contrary winds, as also in expectation, that the Turkish Fleet,
which he heard was to go for the Island of Cyprus, might be past those Seas;
for he had but a few Galleys, and those but lately manned, and the refore unfit
to contend with the enemy, or with the sea; which did so moderate his usual
daring, as it was overborn by mature advice: For his experience in sea-affairs
was commended by all men, his vigilance, and his being ready to undergo all
labor and danger; and some did sometimes desire, that he would have been more
temperate in his actions. Being at last got from Candia, and being desirous to
redeem the time he had lost, when he was come to the Quaglie, he bethought
himself of expugning the Fort of Brazzo di Maina, which (as has been said) had
been lately built by the Turks; he considered, the Haven della Quaglie, might
be a commodious receptacle for Christian ships, being placed in the utmost
angle of la Morea, on the outside toward the sea, made as it were by nature,
to receive those which failed from the Levant westward, by the Ionick sea;
which conveniencie was taken away by this Fort, which overlooked the whole
Haven, and commanded it almost on all sides. This place was anciently called
Leutro, famous for a great victory, which the Lacedaemonians had there of the
Thebans, who had long had the principality of that Region. Quirini's intention
was chiefly, to assault the enemy at unawares, being not desirous to delay his
journey upon any occasion. Coming therefore within ken of la Maina, on the
29th. of June, by break of day, he presently landed some Harchebugiers, who
possessed themselves of the little hill before the Castle, and he, the mean
while, drew near it with his Galleys; so as the enemy was at one and the same
time assaulted both by sea and land, and were soon kept from defending
themselves on that side, by shot from the Galleys; and they were much
endammaged on the other side by the Harchebugiers, who being upon a higher
place, played upon those that defended the walls; so as despairing to be any
longer able to defend themselves, the defendants withdrew into a Tower which
was within, and left the way free and open, for Quirini's men to enter the
Fort, wherein very few men were left: So as playing upon the Tower with the
enemies own Artillery, whereof they found 24 Pieces, they forced them that were
within to yield, with safety to their lives. But the Fort, because it was hard
to be kept, was in a few hours undermined, and thrown down. This prosperous
success, and the arrival of these twelve Galleys, which came all safe within
twelve days after to Corfu, did somewhat encourage the other Commanders, who
were much disheartened by the former misfortunes; and they were the more
cheered, because Quirini told them, That if the whole Fleet would withdraw to
the Isle of Candia, they might easily furnish themselves with Mariners,
soldiers, and all other necessaries. Which made them all desirous to advance,
and so to order their affairs, as that they might hazard the fortune of war.
But the first thing they thought fit to do, was, That Quirini should with
twenty Galleys, overrun the Islands of the Archipelagus, that he might give
the enemy a feeling of their forces, and to get from thence some men for the
Ore; which he readily did, and went to the Island of Andro, one of the
Cyclades, as they were formerly called by the Ancients, where landing his
soldiers, he carried away above three hundred men; but he was not able to
refrain the insolency of the Soldier, who being in an Enemies Country, though
of Christians, committed many other out-rag^s, which made him hasten his
return: but General Zanne, was this mean while gone from Corfu, having
received new orders from the Senate, to go with those forces which he had, more
toward the Levant, and to endeavor to raise of the siege of Cyprus, either by
diversion, falling upon some of the Enemies places, or else by carrying
sufficient recruits, making his ways through the midst of the Enemies Fleet,
and fighting them: Wherefore Quirini, in his return, found the Venetian Fleet
upon Modone, which joining with these her other Galleys, arrived two days
after, upon the 4th of August, at the Island of Candia, and went altogether
into the Gulf Anfialeo, called now by the Mariners, the Haven of Suda; which
is a great Creek of the Sea, lying under the Promontory Drepano, called Capo
Meleca, which thrusting it self out, makes it the larger, and more capacious.
Here General Zanne was very solicitous in providing all things necessary for
the Fleet, wherein he found much difficulty, especially in finding men enough
to supply the number of the dead. Wherefore sending some Galleys to the
Archipelagus, again to that purpose, he went with forty of the best Galleys to
the City of Candia, as to the fittest place to make all his provision in. The
two Commissaries, and Palavesine, staid at the Haven of Suda; the General at
his departure, having left them the same Authority, which they were very
industrious in making use of, to furnish their Galleys with men, wherein they
made good use of Luca Michiele, Commissary of Cania, who by the Authority which
he held there, and much more by the love which he had won amongst those
people, proved an excellent instrument to propagate that business. But the
other difficulties being at last overcome, and the Fleet being sufficiently
provided of Soldiers, and Mariners, they were notwithstanding forced to keep
within the Havens, and lose the best time for action at Sea, expecting daily
the Churches Galleys, and those of Spain, which by new advertisements from
Venice they understood, were to join together by directions given to Doria, and
to Colonna, and meet the rest as soon as might be at Candia. Wherefore the
Senate added this to their former orders given to their General, that his
chiefest endeavor should be to find out, and to fight the Enemies Fleet. At
last, about the end of August, Mark Antonio Colonna, the Churches General, and
Andrea Doria, General to the Catholic King arrived, which caused much joy in
the Venetian Fleet, all of them being infinitely ambitious to fall upon some
honorable Enterprise. The Venetian General had Orders from the Senate, to use
all manner of honor and respect to these Commanders, and to give them the
precedence, in regard of the Princes whom they did represent; but that in any
enterprise they should undertake, they were only to advise. Zanne, when he
heard of their coming, went with his whole Fleet out of the Haven of Suda, to
receive them with all demonstrations of honor, having to this purpose sent the
Captain of the Gulf, with a squadron of Galleys out before him. The Fleet
stood expecting them, divided into two parts, as into two great wings, saluting
them as they came with all their great Guns, and Harchebuges; and when they
were all met, they entered in to the Haven, where after a short stay, by common
consent the whole Fleet went to Scythia, to resolve there what course they
should steer, and to raise the siege of Cyprus.

Whilst the Christian Fleet through several impediments, had spent much time
in preparation, and in getting together: the Turks having with more resolution
disposed of all their Forces, were gone forth very strong to Sea, and without
any obstacle prosecuted their design prosperously; which they did the sooner,
for that Selino, after having long said that he would go himself in person to
the coasts of Caramania, resolved not to part from Constantinople; his former
ardor being allayed by the advice of Mehemet, and Mustafa, wherein all the
other Bashaws joined with them; but their ends were herein differing; for
Mehemet thought it not safe to leave the States of Europe unguarded, by his
going into parts so far off, since according to the custom, and to the honor
due to so great a Prince, he was to be attended by all the best Warriers; so as
Bossina, Albania, and Greece, would be left exposed to the assaults of the
Enemy. He likewise knew Selino's nature, and customs to be such, as if they
should be known by the Army, it might lessen his reputation, and occasion some
disorder. To these, his own particular interest were added, fearing lest upon
any sinister accident, he might be thought to have been negligent, in not
having made timely provisions for such things as were necessary for so great an
Army: But Mustafa's reason was, for fear lest by the presence of his Master,
his glory would be diminished, and his merit upon any happy success made the
less, since it was done under the grand Signors Conduct. Selino therefore by
their counsel altered his resolution, but not without the Soldiers complaint,
who were for the most part well minded to this voyage. They accused Selino of
cowardice, and Mehemet of covetousness, who to shun giving the donative, which
belongs by privilege to them, when the grand Signor goes forth in person with
the Army, had persuaded him to this dishonorable resolution. Thus Selino gave
the whole charge, and honor of this War to Mustafa, making him
Captain-Generall of all Enterprises by land; but Piali, the second Bashaw, was
to command in chief at Sea, who was by birth an Hungarian, little versed in
Navall affairs; but who by the good success, had some years before against the
Spanish Fleet at Gerbi, had won some honor and reputation: Yet the particular
charge of the Mariners, and of ordering the voyage, remained in Als, who
supplied the place of chicef Admiral. This Ali, was Aga of the Ianisaries, (so
is their Captain called) and was made Captain at Sea, chiefly by the means of
Mehemet, who telling the grand Signor, that it was dangerous to have one and
the same man to be both Bashaw della Porta, and Captain at Sea, had made his
Enemy Piali, a disturber of the Peace, be removed the year before. Yet Ali,
having occasion the first year that he went forth with the Fleet, to go to
Cyprus, and being persuaded, as it was conceived, by the easiness which he
thought he should find in that Enterprise; and eg'd on thereunto out of a
desire of glory, forgoing his peaceful thoughts, when he returned to
Constantinople, and forgetting his obligations to Mehemet, sided with Mustapha,
and Piali, the Authors of the War, and Mehemets Enemies, because (as has been
said) he had endeavored to bereave the former of his life, and the other of
his honor. So after Piali's departure, Mustafa went forth with other 55
Galleys; Selino, in token of extraordinary favor, having granted him the
Imperial Gally, a stately Vessel, and richly furnished, which, out of a
certain Grandezza, and high point of honor, is wont to be employed in any
Sea-enterprise made by the Ottaman Emperors, without having any Chief, when
the grand Signor himself does not go, only with men sufficient to guide her.
These being joined together, went to be calkt and rig'd in Nigroponte, and from
thence went to Rhodes, where having intelligence, that the Venetian Fleet was
at Zara, and not able to get out of those Havens, by reason of grievous
sickness, and other necessities, and that there was no news heard of the
Spanish Galleys; they thought they needed not apprehend the joining of those
Fleets, nor that they would dare to advance, though they should join; wherefore
they resolved to go with the whole Fleet to the Island of Cyprus. But as they
past from Nigraponte to Rhodes, Piali would attempt the Fort of Tine, and
endeavor to get that Island, lying at the end of the Archipelagus, between
Micone and Andro, which was then in the possession of the Commonwealth; being
thereunto persuaded, either by the convenience of the place, it being as it
were, the key of the Archipelagus, and by which all Ships past, which went
toward Constantinople, or from thence; or else, as it was said, corrupted by
the gifts and promises of Ioseffo di Nasi, an Hebrew, commonly called Gio
Miches, one who was of great power with Selino, and hoped to get this Island to
be given him, as he had gotten those of Pario, and Nixia, a little before; the
which was the rather believed, for that some provisions, Soldiers, and
Ammunition, which were sent from Candia to Tine, were detained by the Governor
of the two aforesaid Islands, who was placed there by Nasi. Ierolimo Paruta, a
Noble Venetian, was at this time Governor of Tine, who by reason of the being
abroad of the Enemies Fleet, and of the detaining of the aforesaid provisions,
was well prepared for whatsoever might happen. He had been careful in
repairing the walls, in levelling such Houses as hindered the defense, in
placing the men of the Country upon the Guards, in providing Arms, and in fitly
ordering of all things, as if he had foreseen, that he was to be the first that
must withstand the Turks assaults. He was much encouraged to hold out, by the
love which those Inhabitants bore to the Commonwealth, and by the situation
of the place, which is naturally very strong. For the Fort had but one front to
defend, which lay toward the south East, which by reason of its hight, was
safe enough, and was surrounded every where else by an unaccessible Rock. ^^ali
being gone from Castle Rosso, which is seated upon the head of Nigraponte,
after Sunset, came early the next morning before the Island of Tine, where
landing about 8000 foot, he made them presently march toward the Town, which
was five miles from the shore, hoping to take it by assault. But the Governor,
who was always vigilant, discrying the Fleet before it came to the Island, and
endeavoring at one and the same time, the safety of the Islanders, and of the
Fort, gave the Islanders timely notice of the Enemies approach by shooting off
of Guns, so as they might get time enough to get within the Town, and by them he
might the better resist the assault, which was made that very day; and wherein
the Enemy were repulsed, and much galled by the Artillery as they retreated, in
so much as they were forced to keep aloof off, and quarter that night in the
plain called St. Nicholas. The next day, landing some great Guns, they intended
to batter the Fort; but finding by the situation of the Place, that that
design would prove vain; they incampt about it, hoping that many men being
gotten into the Town, they might take it by siege. Wherein having spent 12
days, and solicited the Governor in vain by Letters, containing both threats
and great-rewards, to surrender the Town; and finding him still more resolute
to defend himself, they resolved to be gone, having first ransackt the whole
Country, fired the farm Houses, ruined the Churches, and killed all the cattle.

This action purchased great praise to the Governor, who was not at all
daunted at the sight of such forces, had valiantly sustained the assault; and
in so great commotions of War, preserved that Island which lay in the very jaws
of the Enemy, and rendered this their first design vain. The Turks leaving the
Island of Tine, went to Rhodes, where having staid a while, and designed what
they would do, they came to Fenica. Hither were all the Soldiers brought,
which were to come aboard the Fleet, which being altogether, made above 200
Sail, whereof there was 150 Galleys, and of the bigger sort, some vessels for
burden, one Gallyoune, six Ships, and a great number of lesser Vessels for
carriage, called by the Turks, Caramusolini, and about fifty Palandarie, which
are made like small Galleys, but somewhat larger in the Poope, and higher on
the sides, and much covered, containing about a hundred Horse a piece. The
Turks parted with these forces from Fenica, and steered their course toward
Cyprus: but because the actions of greatest importance in this War, happened in
this Island, the possession whereof was the cause of the War: it will be worth
the while, to acquaint you with the State and most remarkable proprieties of
this Country, before we proceed to the Narration, of what was there done.

The Island of Cyprus lies toward the Levant, in the furthermost part of the
Mediterranean; which, according to the several Provinces which lie upon it,
has several names given it. The Island looks on the East toward Soria, with
which, if we will credit the testimony of the Ancients, she did at first join
in a Terra Ferma. On the West, lies Panfilia, which is now called Sarmania: On
the South, Egypt, and Caramania on the North, which is the ancient Cilicia, on
which side this Island lies nearest the continent: It is seven hundred miles in
compass, extending it self about 200 miles in length, East North-East,
toward the Levant; but in the largest part, it is not above seventy miles
over. It is of a very good Air, being placed in the beginning of the fourth
Climate, under the ninth Parallel, so as it produces almost all things
belonging to humane life, in great abundance and perfection: And though hardly
the fifth part thereof he cultivated, the half thereof lies every other year
follow; yet is it so fruitful, as it has not only wherewithal to supply the
necessity of the Inhabitants, but to serve Forrainers: Besides Corn, it yields
much Sugar, Cotton, Saffron, and many other things, which are transported into
foreign parts. It abounds in Salt Pits, which though they be now reduced to the
third part of their former number, yet as much pure white salt may be taken
from thence every year, as will load one hundred great ships. It abounds also
in several sorts of Creatures, excellently good; nor does it want Mines of the
most precious Mettalls. By reason of this great plenty of all things, it was
anciently called Macaria, as if Blessed, which made the Poets fain, that the
goddess Venus was born here, and did delight to live here, as in her proper
(...): Wherefore the Cyprians erected a famous Temple to her, in the City of
Paphos. It was celebrated by antiquity, as the seat of nine Kings, having
within it thirty Cities, which though according to the custom of modern days,
they be greater in number then reality; yet there remains many worthy
memorialls, of their pristine grande^sa and prosperity. And there are yet seen
the ruins of several Cities, as well Maritime as Inland, which are wholly
destroyed. But at this time, her chiefest Towns are Nicossia, Famagosta, Baffo,
Cerines, and Limiso; which latter two were only reduced into any strength,
there not being any other place in the whole Island able to resist the Turks
power, though Cerines has held out long formerly against lesser forces. The
Inhabitants of this country were so highly este^^ed for worth in war, and for
experience at sea, as Alexander the great, forbore to molest them with his
Arms. And we read in modern Histories, that they did many memorable acts in the
business of the Holy Land, and in Soria, against the Infidells. This Island
was Tributary to the greatest Empires of the world; for following the fortune
of other Eastern people, it became obedient to the Kings of Egypt, and to
those of Persia, and lastly to the Romans. When the Roman Empire began to
decline* it was possessed by the Sarasins, which the Turks make use of at this
time, to show, they have some just pretense to this Island; affirming, that
they found in their H^stories, that their fifth Captain of the Mohammedan
Religion, after Mahomet, had acquired and possessed it; and that there were the
Sepulchers of many Musselmans, which they could not suffer to remain in the
power of those, of another Religion. But it was recovered from the Sarasins by
the Christians, in the year 1122. and joined to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, when
they went to the taking of the Holy Land. And after several accidents, being
separated from thence, it was governed for many years by Lords of its own,
under the protection of the Emperors of Constantinople, till such time as
Richard King of England sold the Signiory thereof to the Knights Templars, by
whom it was quickly sold to Guido Lusignano, who being driven by Sultan
Saladine out of Jerusalem, withdrew himself to live in Cyprus, and was the
first Latin Lord; whose son succeeding his father in the Dominion, got it by
the Pope's authority to be made a Kingdom, the first Gre^ian Lords having used
the title of Dukes. The peac^ble and quiet condition of this whole Kingdom,
continued under the Government of twelve Kings, except: the city of Famagosta,
which was possessed by the Genoveses. After which, the Kingdom falling into the
hands of Lewis, son to Amideo the 7th. Duke of Savoy, by the right of
inheritance of Charlotta, daughter to King John Lusignan, it was taken by the
aid of the Mamalucchy, by James son to the same King, illegitimate, a man of
much valor, and of aspiring thoughts, who also recovered Famagosta from the
Genueses; and that he might be the better confirmed in the possession of the
Kingdom, procured the friendship and protection of the Venetians, by marrying
Catharina Cornaro, adopted daughter of the Commonwealth, who was made heir of
that Kingdom by the last Will and Testament of her husband. And by her it was
freely given to her Country, as you have heard before. By which it may be
known, what reason the Commonwealth had to make any attempt, and expose her
self to all danger and trouble, for the preservation of so rich and noble a
Kingdom, which was so lawfully possessed by her.

But to return to our narration. The Turkish Fleet was discryed to be about
Baffo, upon the Western Cape of the Island, on the first day of July, which
falling lower toward the South, scoured the River which is between Limisso,
and the Promontory, which is called by many Capo de Gatti, taking many
prisoners, and sacking and pillaging several country houses. But making no
long stay there, they steered the same course, and came the next day to Saline,
a place which lies upon the same shore, somewhat more toward the East; where
not meeting with any to withstand them, they landed their Artillery, and their
soldiers, and secured their quarters by strong Rampires, from whence they
issued out, to plunder the neighboring parts, endeavoring to inform
themselves by the Prisoners, of the affairs of the Island. And advancing as far
as Leucata, a Town nine leagues from Saline, they easily reduced those country
people to their obedience, to whom Mustafa Bashaw gave many gifts, and promised
them much more, thereby to invite others to submit to his devotion, especially
the Mountainers, whom he could not so soon reduce by force. This mean while,
the Turks sent forth 80 Galleys, and many Bottoms of Barthne, some to Tripoli,
some to the Rivers of Caramania, to raise more Soldiers, and Horse; so as
their whole forces being soon after brought together, there were found (as most
men affirm) in the Turkish Army 50000 Foot, 3000 Pioniers, 2500 Horse for war,
besides as many or more for burden, 30 pieces of Artillery, some bearing
bullets of 50l. weight, some of a 100l. and 50 Faulconets. But there were not
Garrisons in the Island of Cyprus, sufficient to resist such forces; for there
was not above 2000 Italian Foot in the usual Garrisons, nor were there any
more sent afterward, save 3000 of the common people di Terra Ferma, and the
2000 of Martiningo's men, which by suffering at sea, were reduced to a much
lesser number. So as the greatest hope in defending the Cities, lay in the new
Militia, which was mustered of the Islanders themselves, from whom, as was
affirmed by many Captains and Governors, excellent service might upon all
occasions be expected. Nor were there any Horse in the Kingdom for action, save
500 Stradiotti, which were still kept in pay, nor was it easy to get more; for
though many of the Nobles, who enjoyed several things from the Camera reale,
some through ancient, some through new privileges, were bound to find by those
their Fee-farms three or four horses a piece, for the Princes service, and that
these amounted to about 700 Horse, yet were there not many more than 100 of
them, that were serviceable at this time: Nay, the breed of Horses was very
much decayed throughout the whole Island, by reason of the greater convenience
which the Inhabitants found, in riding upon Mules, whereof this country
produces great abundance, and those very large. Things were therefore in a
very bad posture, since there wanted sufficient forces to withstand so
powerful an enemy, who were masters of the field, nor could they long maintain
two Forts, whereof Nicossia being one, by reason of the largeness thereof,
required a great many soldiers to defend it; and the other, which was
Famagosta, though it was lesser, was so weak and imperfect, as it likewise
required many men, and those valiant ones too, to make good the defects of the
Fort. And though these forces were but small, yet were they of lesser use, for
want of experienced Commanders: for there was not any one in the whole Island
of quality or condition, save Astore Baglione, who was General of that
Militia, Martiningo being dead at sea, as has been said. Nor was there any
Commissary General of the Island, nor any Venetian Magistrate, as is usually
had in all places, in times of danger; for Lorenzo Bembo, who held that place,
was dead but a little before, in whose place, though the Senate soon chose
Sebastian Veniero Commissary of Corfu, yet could he not come so soon to Cyprus,
to execute his office. The chief commands of War were therefore conferred upon
diverse Cyprian Gentlemen, who were of great wealth and nobility, and very well
affected toward the Commonwealth; but of very little, or no experience at
all, in the Militia, and therefore the less fit for such employment. Count
Rocas was made Baglione's Lieutenant, who, after Bembo's death, held supreme
authority in all things belonging to the Militia. Iacomo di Nores, Count of
Tripoli, was Master of the Artillery; Iovanni Singlitico, Captain of all the
Horse of the Kingdom; Iovanni Sosomino, Captain of the Pioners; Sapione
Caraffa, and Pietro Paolo Singlitico, Captains of the Country people, who were
to be placed in strong scituations upon the Mountains; and so other offices and
employments were disposed of to others. And the received opinion being, that
the Turks would first assault Famagosta, Baglione would go to the custody
thereof himself, that he might use his endeavors, where there should be most
need. Things being thus ordered, after many consultations, it was concluded,
That the first thing they would do should be, by all possible means to hinder
the enemy from landing; or at least to infest them, keeping along the shore
whither they should seem to come, so as they should be enforced to separate,
and change their station, by that means prolonging the business, since they
could not tarry long upon those downs without danger, where there was no
harbor for their Fleet. According to which advice, as soon as they heard news
of the enemies approach, Count Rocas parted from Nicossia, with three hundred
Horse, which was all that in so great haste could be got together, and with one
hundred Dragoons, commanded by Antonio dal Beretino, and Lazaro Cocopani; and
marched toward the place, which was designed for mustering all the Horse,
which was a fitting place for that purpose, not far from the shoars of the
Saline, where it was thought, the enemies Fleet would land their men, because
there was the best Anchoring, and for that it was nearest the two chiefest
Cities, Nicossia and Famagosta. Baglione went also from Famagosta, with 300
Dragoons, and 150 Stradiotti. Pietro Roncadi, who was Governor of the Albanese
Militia, going at the same time from Baffo, with the rest of Cavalry; which
being all met, they resolved not to advance any further, nor to attempt any
thing, but to return all from whence they came; were it either, for that they
considered their forces better, or for the neernesse of the danger, being much
troubled at the sudden news, that above 300 sail (for so it was reported)
were already upon the shore; or for that they thought, it was too late, and
would be to no purpose to do what they formerly had resolved, the enemy being
already arrived, and having begun to land their men. So as all things were left
free, and safe to the Turks, to their no little wonder; for they began at first
to suspect, that this easy entrance into the enemies country, did not proceed
from any weakness, negligence, or cowardice of the defendants, but that it
might be done out of some design, or military stratagem, to draw them at
unawares into some snare. They therefore knew not at first what to do, and
proceeded with much caution: but having over run many parts, and done much
prejudice, not meeting with any resistance, they grew more bold: They did not
only advance with their whole Camp, but roved up and down every where, whither
soever their desire of pillage, or any other thing drew them, without any Order
or Colors.

But the Commanders, that they might lose no more time in vain, began to think
upon drawing near one of the two chiefest Forts of the Kingdom; Pials was for
expugning Famagosta first, hoping to get it within a few days, which being
lost, he said, That Nicossia must likewise necessarily fall soon into their
hands; for that being full of unnecessary people, far from the seashore, and
in midst of a Campagnia, possessed by so many enemies, it would not be able to be
relieved, without which, it could not long hold out. That Famagosta was a
little and a weak Fort, and so defective, as it would not be able to withstand
the first Battery; nor were the defendants so many, or so valiant, as that they
durst expect the assault of so valiant an Army, whose reputation would be so
much increased by that victory, as all things would become easy, which might
as yet peradventure be thought difficult. Nay, this sole example in^using
terror into all the Inhabitants, would be sufficient to put them soon, and
with little trouble, in possession of the whole Kingdom. But Mustafa affirmed
on the contrary, that the reputation of so great forces ought not to be
lessened, by falling upon petty enterprises, whereby to encourage the enemy,
and to dishearten their own men. That Famagosta was possessed by the Genueses,
for the space of 90 years, and yet the Lusignian Kings were Masters of the
Island at the same time. So as it might be conceived, the taking of that City
would not make much toward the getting of the whole Kingdom: whereas the whole
Nobility were withdrawn into Nicossia, and most of the People, Wealth, and
Ammunition of the Island, so as one labor might do the whole business. That
the alterations which are often seen to fall out in a short time, when great
actions are in hand, are not to be foreseen: nor was it certain, that Famagosta
would be so soon taken, but that they should rather be necessitated to employ
those Forces elsewhere, according as the Christian Fleet should divert them: so
as if they should depart from the Island, and leave the Enemy Masters of almost
all the whole Kingdom, they should get but little good by such an enterprise.
He further added, that the Air about Famagosta was very bad, the Town being
seated low, amongst marish grounds, and that therefore it would be
unsupportable to those that were not long accustomed thereunto; that therefore
they were not to carry their Soldiers where they were likely to perish of
sickness, but where they might give proof of their valor: that to die without
praise or merit was common; that no worthy valiant man could fear the greatest
dangers of War, or of the Enemies Forces, when they were accompanied with the
hopes of glory. Moreover, that they had learnt by such Prisoners as they had
taken, that the men of chiefest Authority, and best experienced Soldiers, were
withdrawn into Famagosta, wherein the true defense of Cities lay; not in walls
nor Balworks, when every man's valor is to be tried in assaults; the skill and
worth of his Soldiers being much better, as was known by experience, in taking
in of strong holds, then was the art or industry of Christians in erecting, or
in defending them. That their great train of Artillery, the infinite number of
their Pioners, and their experience in such things would facilitate their
throwing down the walls of Nicossia, and the bringing of their valiant Soldiers
to an assault; wherein being to meet with but little resistance, by reason of
the paucity and pusillanimity of the defendants; it was not to be doubted, but
that the victory would fall into their hands, with as much, may peradventure
with more easiness, then they could hope for ^f Famagosta, but certainly with
much greater rewards, and more worth their labor and hazard.

For these reasons, and out of the respect born to Mustafa's authority, they
resolved to attempt Nicossia first, toward which the whole Camp moved the 22d.
of July, having sent five hundred Horse toward Famagosta, to hinder commerce
between those two Cities. All this while the Cavalry lay idle in Nicossia,
leaving the whole Country open and free to be pillaged by the Enemy* though
Ca^ail^r R^ncadi, and some other Gentlemen of the City, did often earnestly
desire, that they might go out, and show themselves to the enemy to keep them
from growing the bolder, by reason of these the Nicossians too timorous, and
peradventure too cowardly counsels. But those who had the Government of
affairs, not thinking fit to hazard those men, who were intended for the
defense of the City, would by no means be brought to give way thereunto. Yet
being more moved by the offenses of their own men, then by those of the Enemy,
when they heard of the Rebellion of Lifcara's family, which had not only
suddenly come in to Mustafa, but committing other outrages to the prejudice of
those of the City, had sent some of their men to persuade other Citizens, who
had retired themselves to certain narrow passages amidst the mountains, and
were free from being injured by the Turks, that following their example, they
should descend into the plains, and submit willingly unto the Turks; it was
resolved one night to send out 100 Horse, and 400 Foot to fire that Hamlet,
whereof almost all the inhabitants, to the number of above 400 were put to the
sword. Thus their treachery was severely punished, and by the terror thereof,
the desire of Novelty was curbed in many of the Inhabitants, by reason of the
slavery wherein they were, for the aforesaid causes; so as it was clearly seen,
that hoping by change of Government, to change their fortune, they were not
only not likely to oppose the Enemy, but rather to afford them all
convenience: which inclination of theirs, Mustafa sought by all possible means
to nourish, making many presents, and greater promises to such as should come
in unto him: But the Turks pursuing their way, without any obstacle, drew near
the walls of Nicessia; and as soon as the Army was discovered, by those that
were within the Town, they were all possessed with infinite fear. Nicolo Dandalo,
was then Governor of that City, being made Lieutenant thereof by the
Commonwealth, a man of weak judgment to manage so weighty a business, but
who had that preferment put upon him, out of an opinion conceived, that though
he was not very quick witted, yet he was good at action, by reason of the
experience which he was believed to have gotten in several employments at Sea:
He having either lost his understanding through the extraordinary apprehension
of danger, or not knowing through his want of reason, and understanding, how to
provide against so great an exigency, increased the difficulties and danger:
for when the Enemies Fleet was arrived, he had not got the Ditches to be fully
emptied, nor ordered the Militia, nor those of the Country, nor provided for
sufficient victuals for the City. To amend which disorders, he was forced to
commit greater; a public Edict was made, that it should be lawful for every
one to take Corn wheresoever they could find it, which being brought into the
City, should be understood to be their own; which being too late a remedy,
could not work the effect which was expected, a good part thereof being left
abroad in the Country houses, with a double inconvenience to the Countrymen,
by reason of the advantage the Enemy made thereof. Moreover, having with very
little regard to the eminency of the danger, dismissed the meaner sort, he in
great haste, and confusion, sent for them back, before they were got to their
own homes, and did at the same time list new Soldiers in the Country, as the
occasion and necessity did best dictate; whilst our men oppressed thus by many
mischiefs, spent their time in ordering their affairs, and in advising how they
might hinder or disturb the Enemies proceedings; all resolutions being the
longer in taking, for want of any Chief-taine, who might decide the diversity
of opinions: the Turks had leisure and opportunity given them, to set up their
Pavillions, plant their Artillery, and fortify their Quarters, not meeting
with any disturbance, save by shot from the Town. For though the Stradiotti did
often sally out wi^h some companies of Harchebugiers to skirmish; yet not
daring by reason of their small numbers, to go further from the walls, then
they were sheltred by shot from the Town, nor the enemy approaching so near, as
that they might be thereby prejudiced, nothing of moment insued. And Andrea
Cortese, Captain of the Stradiotti, a bold and adventurous man, being one day
advanced a good way before his own men, he was environed by a great many of the
Enemy, and after having valiantly defended himself for a long while, was
slain. The Turkish Army incampt themselves from Santa Marina, to Aglangia,
possessing the whole space of ground which was opposite to four Bulworks: and
on the other side of the Fort, whither the Camp reached not, each Bashaw sent
out 100 Horse, and as many Foot, so as the City being environed on all sides,
could neither receive in, nor send out any men.

Nicossia stands in the midst of the Island, almost equally distant from the
Northern and Southern shore, and from the two utmost parts of the Island,
Baffo, and Carpasso: It abounds in fresh water, is of an indifferent wholesome
air, being breathed on by the pleasant South-west wind, which inliven and
refreshes the Inhabitants when they are wearied, and sw^^er'd with the
immoderate heat of that Climate, wherefore it was more inhabited then any other
City of the Kingdom; and this was the cause why the Island being to be secured
by a Fort, the Cyprians, not valuing any other situation, concurred all of them
readily and liberally in contributing toward this, so as this City was reduced
into a Fort-Royall, by the means of Francesco Barbaro, Commissary of the
Island, and of Iulio S^vorgnano the Governor, to whom the Senate had committed
the particular care thereof. The Fort was of a circular form, with eleven
Bulworks, whose Front was 75 paces, and their shoulders thirty; so as each of
them was capable of 2000 foot, and of four pieces of Cannon, and they were so
built, as there being out-lets on every side, the Soldiers might go sheltered
on all sides, to the Counterscarpe; but they were chiefly secured to the
Plat-forms, which were above 30 paces broad, so as it was held by such as were
professors of military discipline, one of the fairest and best Fortifications
that was in the world, for as much as could be contributed by Art. But as there
was plenty of these things, so was there scarcity of defendants: for when
Astore Baglione, went from thence, Colonel Roncone remained there, with charge
of the Communalty of the Island, and of all the Italian Militia, and some other
Captains, who though they had some experience in War, and were ambitious of
honor; yet having but small Authority, their advice profited but a little* for
they were either not listened to, through the indiscretion of such as stood at
the helm of Government; or else accepted of with much dispute and difficulty,
and therefore but slowly, and badly executed. It was therefore resolved, to
send to Famagosta, to desire Baglione, that he himself would come to Nicossia,
and bring some Soldiers along with him: but the Magistrates of that City
thinking that they had not men enough to defend it, and not being certain but
that the Enemy might alter their minds, so as they might have occasion to use
them themselves; they positively refused to part either with their men, or with
their Captain; and Baglione making use of their Authority, desired to be
excused for that time: adding, that Martiningo's Soldiers, having lost their
Commander, said absolutely, that they would render obedience to none but to
him; so as his coming away might cause some great disorder in that City. There
were then in Nicossia 10000 foot for her defense, whereof 1500 were Italians,
and all the rest Inhabitants of the Island, to wit, 3000 of the common sort,
2500 of the City, 2000 newly listed into the Militia, taken out of the Country
houses, and paid partly out of the Exchequer, partly out of private men's
Purses, and 1000 Nicossian Gentlemen: These were almost all new men
unexperienced, and not over-well armed, in so much as many wanting Pikes and
Muskets, were forced to use ^ills and Halberts. But the City was very well
provided of Artillery, nor were there wanting such as knew how to manage them;
They had likewise great store of Pioners, to make use of upon any occasion:
for, to boot with 400 ^^sted under Iovan Sossomeno, they had taken in above
4000 more (...) such employments. Yet amidst so many men, and so much ground,
the Commanders not agreeing in the manner how to orde^ their in works, this so
necessary provision was left unperfect. By these disorders these Forces were
weakened, which were certainly too few to resist so puissant an Army of the
Enemies, wherein, on the contrary, great observancy, and reverence was gi^^h to
the Commanders, and all military actions, being severely ordered, were with
strange readiness observed. Mustafa's authority, who was a bold and warlike
personage, as also his reputation by the same which he had won by fighting in
Selino's Army before he was Emperor, against his brother Achomet; the unhoped
for victory which was then gotten, being attributed to his forward valor; The
Soldiers, who were accustomed to the duties of War, to labor and hardships,
grew much more hardy, by the opinion they had of their Captains worth, and by
the hopes of great reward which was promised them upon getting the victory.
There were, as has been said, a great number of men in the Army, the chief
foundation whereof consisted in 6000 Ia^isarus, and 4000 Spacchi, (these are
Soldiers who are kept in continual pay, to serve on Horseback, and upon
occasion, do serve with others on foot) valiant ment^, and brought up in War.
Therefore the more humane foresight had been wanting to provide against such
Forces, the more did they apply themselves to beg assistance from God. Solemn
processions were daily made throughout the City, which were done the more
frequently, and with the more devotion, by the example and exhortation of
Francisco Contarini, Bishop of Baffo, in whom Episcopal dignity became more
honorable and reverend by the ancient Nobility, and by the riches of his
family, and by his own goodness and worth. He being the prime ecclesiastic
person, (for Philippo Mocenico, Archbishop of Nicossia, was then at Venice)
was not wanting in performing such duties to those people, which they could
have expected from their own Pastor. The chief of the City being one day
assembled in the Church of Santa Sophia, where were also many men of all
conditions, he spoke thus unto them.

If I shall look upon the greatness of the present dangers, I cannot but much
apprehend the common safety; and as doubting the issue, and with a submisse
mind, yield to adverse fortune. And if on the other side, I think upon your
worth, magnanimity, fortitude, and, constancy, I find a certain warmth arise
within me, which encourages me to hope for better things. But if I raise my
self from these more lowly cogitations, to the consideration of divine
providence and goodness, my first fear is not only allayed, but is changed
into an assured hope: For when I observe the truth better, I know, that hard
and difficult things become easy, to such as are valiant; and even
impossibilities to faithful Christians, are made facile. Therefore if you be
not wanting in your ancient and known worth, and if you continue constant and
steadfast in that faith, which, together with your own safeties, you have
undertaken to defend, I am assured, you will find these troubles at the last,
not ordained for your ruin, but for your praise and eternal glory. We know by
infinite examples, of all ages, how many sieges have been withstood and rendered
vain, by a few, though the besiegers were very numerous. Constant worth, and a
noble resolution of undaunted mind, being sufficient to stave off greatest
dangers. But as for such, whom God has taken into his particular custody, no
powers of man has been able to prejudice them; nay, Natures self, the very
Heavens and Elements have been subservient to them. The waters stood still, and
made a safe passage to the Jews, through the midst of the sea; the most
scorched grounds afforded them fountains of clear water, to refresh them
withal; and the Heavens gave them Manna, a miraculous food, to nourish them.
We are to hope for these, or the like assistances, from the hand of God; for
Selino Ottaman is a no less wicked and cruel persecutor of the faithful,
then was that ancient Pharaoh. Nor are we Christians* who are bought with the
blood of his Son, less dear to God, or less beloved by him, then any others
have formerly been, of which future miracle, we have an evident late example,
which may persuade us to believe we shall share of. Do you not know in what
condition the Island of Malta was, this time five year? begirt by so long and
so sore a siege, oppugned by so many soldiers, defended by so few, void of all
hopes of help, and in all sorts of want and necessities: Yet the defendants, no
whit lessening their valor nor loyalty, for whatsoever adverse fortune, the
Barbarians power was rendered vain and useless, and they were laughed at, for
their over-daring attempt. And that the power of divine providence might the
more appear, the Fort, when reduced to the last extremity, was freed from the
siege by the enemy, before it was relieved by friends. You are to imitate these
stout and valiant men, by exposing your selves willingly to all the labors and
dangers of war; nay, you must exceed them: for those Knights, being forrainers,
of several Nations, fought for religion. and glory; you do not only defend
these, but also your wives, children, and estates; so as all things, both human
and divine, invite you to show invincible valor; and that the more readily and
boldly, as that you being free men, and generous, are to fight against slaves,
base and unarmed people, wont to overcome more by their numbers, then their
valor. Which advantage, they at the present want, this City being defended by
strong walls, and by so many great guns, as this alone will be sufficient to
repulse the enemy, who if they shall dare to assault us, you are sure of the
victory, if you can but withstand their first brunt. For it cannot be long ere
the succor come, which you have heard our commonwealth is sending us, with a
powerful Fleet, which will never refuse to expose all her forces readily, for
the preservation of this Kingdom, which she esteems, as a noble member of her
State, and loves so well. These humane provisions being of themselves
sufficient to deliver us, will, through your prayers, faith, and firm
resolution to forego your sins, make you invincible; when your sins being
punished more by fear then pain, you shall have time and reason, to honor and
praise the All-glorious God, who showing you only the face of his anger, in
the fury of this barbarous Ottaman, will have provided for your souls health,
and for your atchieving of heavenly blessings, together with the preservation
of your lives, country, and estates; to the end that you may use all these
hereafter, to his glory, who is the true and liberal Lord, and the free giver
of all grace.

The whole Auditory seemed much affected with these words, so as they
cheerfully comforted one another; and preparing courageously to defend
themselves, they betook themselves solicitously to all military actions, to
secure their Parapets, to bestow their Companies in places of greatest danger,
and to guard their Bulwarks carefully. The danger increased daily, as the enemy
drew nearer; for the Turks wanting neither for diligence nor industry, were
come with their Trenches very near the Ditch, and by frequent Musket shot,
playing upon those that were upon the walls, kept them from appearing upon the
Parapets. Moreover, they planted diverse great Pieces toward the City, on St.
Marina's side, whereby they did much prejudice to the houses, not without great
fear unto the people. But that which gave the Commanders justest cause of fear,
was, their stupendous earth-works, which being made with great art and
expedition, several Forts were seen within a few days, to be raised to such a
height, as the enemies standing thereupon, might fight securely, and upon great
advantage; and make use, not only of their Artillery against our men, but of
their Arrows, and artificial fireworks, which being thrown over the walls,
and fastening upon wool-sacks, whereof the Traverses were made, destroyed those
works, depriving those within of those defenses. The difficulty grew the
greater to the defendants, for that being but a few, they could hardly supply
the duties, which the defense of so many places required; so as they were
forced to keep from sending people abroad to molest the enemy, lest they might
add to their own difficulties. Their chief hope lay in their Artillery, which
being well managed, did disturb the enemies works; Antonio dal Berentino, a
witty man, and a well experienced Canonier, did much good thereby to those of
the Town: But the City soon lost him, and many others, who were well verst in
that affair; for being shot by the enemies, whereunto they were continually
exposed, most of them were slain: So as the Turks brought on their Trenches so
far, as they came to the Counter-scarfe, wherein making some breaches, they at
last entered the Ditch; and having thereby made rampires of earth, whereby to
defend themselves from the enemies shot, they began to undermine the Bulworks
with their Mat-hooks, so as they soon made stairs, whereby they might the more
easily mount the Bulworks; and climbing up thereby, they began to make some
little assaults upon the Bulworks, Costanzo and Padacataro, (which were so
called, from the families of such Gentlemen, as had had a particular care in
building the Fort) to see, how they that were within would behave themselves.
And it so fell out, as those who were upon the defense of Costanzo, being
surprised at unawares, suffered themselves to be so charged, as many of the
Turks advancing very boldly, got beyond the Parapets; but Paolo dal Guasto, and
Andrea da Spelle, falling upon them with their Companies, the enemies were
repulst, much to their prejudice; but not without the loss of many of our men,
particularly of Andrea, who fighting valiantly amongst the foremost, was slain.
This unexpected assault did so terrify the defendants, as many thought, that
if the Turks had seconded the first assailants with greater forces, the City
would have been lost. But the eschewing of this danger gave them no better
hopes, for they could find no way to disturb the Turks works, who laboring
continually in the making of, as it were, several Cawseys of earth, twenty
five foot broad, which reached from their Trenches to the Breaches, which (as
has been laid) was made in the Counterscarf; and sheltring those ways on the
sides, with faggots, and baskets filled with earth, they prepared for greater,
and more secure assaults; which if they were not timely opposed, there was no
way of safety left. So as though it was a hard and dubious thing, to expose the
best of their few good soldiers, to so great danger; yet no better exigency
appearing, they resolved upon that course at last, which had been several
times before refused. Cesare Piovine, an Italian, Count Rocas his Lieutenant,
sallied therefore out of the Town, with part of the Italian Foot, and with the
Horse, intending to fight the enemies Trenches, and their Forts, to clog their
Artillery, and to destroy, or at least to do what mischief he could to their
works, which resolution was very welcome to the soldiers, who were impatient
to see themselves daily wasted, and the utmost of dangers to draw nigh, without
making any trial of themselves, or taking revenge upon the enemy. But this
generous action, being perhaps too lately attempted, and then too precipitously
pursued, wrought not the good effect which was hoped for, nor which the happy
beginning promised; wherein Piovine boldly advancing, took two of the enemies
Forts, and slew almost all that were within them; who being sweltered with the
extreme heat, (for it was at full noon when our men assaulted them) and being
free from any apprehension, had laid aside their Arms, and were fallen asleep.
But Piovene's soldiers, according to the abusive custom of our Militia, gave
over pursuing the victory, and fell to pillage; which disorder became
afterward the greater, because the Grecians and Albaneses, having too early
advanced with their Horse, to assault the enemies Trenches; were it either, for
that vying with the Italians for valor, they would be the first that should
appear in that action; or that they were not well pleased to be commanded by
Piovin^* they, by this their unseasonable haste, made those of the Camp too
soon acquainted with their coming, so as many Turks hasting thither, they
easily made our men run, who were divided, and busied about plunder. But
Piovine, together with Count Alberto, and Iovan Battista de Fano, tarrying with
some few of their men, to defend the Fort which they had taken, after a long
and stout withstanding, the enemies coming still in, in great numbers, were cut
in pieces. These valiant men were encouraged to make this defense, out of hopes
of being soon assisted by those from within, the usual sign of succor being
already given between them. But because the Turks, who upon the notice of our
men's coming out, were assembled together in great numbers, and making use of
this occasion, prepared to assault the Bulwark Costanzo, as they did
afterward: Count Tripoli, who had the keeping thereof, was forced to stay
Captain Gregorio Panteo, who was appointed to go forth with the relief, that he
might make use of him, and of his men, against the enemies unexpected assault;
who not being able, after a long dispute, to mount the Parapets, were forced to
retreat. Thus the Turks continued many days to annoy those within, by several
ways, and to attempt the taking of the City, though but with trivial
assaults. Wherefore by reason of the paucity of the defendants, our forces were
much lessened, which could not well discharge all the duties which were to be
done, both by day and night, in several parts of the City. The Parapets of the
Bulwarks were already very much weakened, and in some places wholly cast down,
by the enemies continual shot; so as great diligence was used, to fill up
those Parapets with earth, and to finish the in-works, where they were
imperfect, and to erect some Cavalliers for more security, upon the Bulwarks.
But these works proceeded on but slowly; for the Ploners, wearied with
watching, and other hardships, grevv not able to perform their work; and
because the enemies Artillery, which were levelled by day, shot also by night,
and did much harm. Yet the soldiers, especially the Italians, and the Gentry
of the City, continued steadfast in their resolution, to defend themselves to
the very last, being a little comforted, with hopes, that the Venetian Fleet
would soon come and raise the Siege. No answer was therefore given to diverse
Letters, which were conveyed by the Turks into the City, by Arrows, wherein
the Bashaw Mustafa writing, sometimes to the Governors, sometimes to certain
of the chief Nobility of the City, and sometimes to the people in general,
exhorted them to yield, promising, in case they would do so, to use great
liberality and humanity toward them; and denouncing severe punishment, if they
should do otherwise. But finding that they could not learn any thing of the
people's, nor of the Governor's intention by this means; they made signs of
parley to those of the Bulwork of Costanzo; and having free liberty given them
to do so, they in the name of the Bashaw Mustafa, said, That he wondered very
much that he had received no answer to any of his Letters, as if his Forces
were despised, which were notwithstanding such, as he might have ended the War
much sooner by them, had he not had regard to their safeties, which they
themselves seemed to slight so much. That therefore he had thought good to
admonish them, that duly weighing the state of their affairs, which was now
reduced to the utmost of danger, by the death of so many defendants, and for
that there was no hope of relief left them; for he had had certain
intelligence, that the Venetian Fleet being oppressed with much sickness, and
other difficulties, could not stir out of their Havens: it might suddenly so
fall out, that they might in vain entreat those fair conditions which they now
refused; for he could no longer moderate the Soldiers rage, who had made
frequent demands, that they might be permitted to plunder the City, in reward
of the labors and dangers which they had undergone: So as if they should delay
surrendering the Town, the ruin thereof would be attributed rather to their
foolish obstinacy, than to the cruelty of the Enemy. Having quickly resolved to
give an answer to these words, for the Truce was to last but for two hours,
they put an end to the parley, telling them only, That the Soldiers and
Citizens were firmly resolved to defend the City with all their might, to the
very last minute, and to keep loyal to their Prince; so that whatsoever the
event should be, nothing could be more desired of them, but better fortune,
which they hoped they should not fail of, since they would not be failing to
themselves, to their honor, nor to their religion, which, together with their
safety, they had undertaken to defend.

Thus having placed all their hopes in their Arms, the Governors thought good
to feed the Soldiers and people with hopes of Succor, which did chiefly
increase in them their resolution, and courage to defend themselves. Wherefore
they made it be divulged by a Renegado who was fled from the Enemies Camp to
the City; that he had brought Letters from Famagosta, which brought certain
news of the arrival of the Christian Fleet; which that it might be the more
credibly believed, the Captains which were upon the Mountains with the
Islanders, were ordered to give the sign of ten fires, which every one knew was
to give notice to the City, that the Christian Navy was arrived. This wrought
such impression in some, as imagining that to be true which they did so much
desire, they affirmed, they saw the Turks begin to remove their Artillery, and
their Pavillions. But the Enemy who feared nothing less, continued their
batteries, whereof nothing of remarkable insued for some days, save only that
Iacobo di Nores, Count of Trepoli, one of the chief Barons of the Kingdom, who
had won the name of being vigilant and valiant, was slain in an assault which
was given to the Bulwork Costanzo, and his Brother Francisco Maria was in his
place made Governor of that Bulwork.

Thus did the Turks waste those within by little and little, with frequent
skirmishes: but they durst not enter upon the Bulworks, for fear of Mines;
whereof they were the more cautious, by reason of the loss which they received
at the expugning of Zighet. Moreover, Mustafa thought he had too few men to
make a great Efforte; for the Ianisaries were not very forward to be the first
that should fall on; wherefore he spun out the time, till such time as having
more certain news of the Enemies Fleet, he might, (as he did afterward) safely
increase his Army by those that remained in the Galleys: Who as soon as they
were come to the Camp, all fear of the Fleet being over, and the Cawseys being
now perfected, and rendered secure, which led from the Trenches to the four
Bulworks of Podacataro, Costanzo, Davila, and Tripoli: he began to place all
the Commanders and Soldiers in their proper employments, and gave an orderly
assault at one and the same time with his whole Forces to all the four
Bulworks, which the besieged interpreted to be done by the Enemy as their last
essay, with intention of departing suddenly, if they should not succeed
therein. So great an impression had the news of the arrival of the Venetian
Fleet made in them, which being held by all to be true, they encouraged one
another; affirming confidently, that the Victory, the end of their labors, and
their safety from all danger lay, in withstanding the fury of that assault.
Wherefore worthily out-doing themselves, and the opinion which was held of
their Forces; they repulsed the Turks that day every where, and slew very many
of them: Whereat Mustafa being much incensed, and beginning almost to despair
of getting the City, as he thought he might easily have done, he ceased not
continually to solicit the Soldiers, that they would once more be brought to
give another assault; sometimes reproaching them of cowardice, sometimes
promising largely to reward their valor. And what is it, said he, that can
infuse courage into you, if that now that you do so far exceed the Enemy, both
for number and military discipline, who are but a few, and those fresh
soldiers, and unexperienced in Arms, you cannot so much as abide their looks,
whom you have suffered to baffle you so ignominiously, being stricken rather
with a panick fear, then with any danger? If the hopes of prey provided for
you, by the plunder of so opulent a City, if the desire of glory, in having by
your valor won so noble a Kingdom to the Ottaman Empire, be not able to excite
in you that fortitude and generosity which is always wont to accompany those
who fight under the prosperous Ensigns of the Ottaman Empire; you must never
think hereafter of any military action: for no Commander will dare to confide
the honor of the Grand, and always invincible Signor, under his guidance,
that grand Signor, whose perpetual felicity ordained to him by heaven; you
seem not to know, by believing that any Nation is able long to resist his
Forces. Be sure, unless you will resist your selves, the Enemy must soon yield
unto your Prowess, and to your Princes fortune, who having a just regard to
gallant actions, does largely impart rewards unto his Soldiers; so as there is
no degree of honor, to which each of you may not by his own worth be brought;
to whom alone all the wealth and honor of the Ottaman Empire is reserved,
which are disposed of in other Dominions, more according to favor, oft-times
purchased without any merit, or according to the vain name of Nobility, then by
true and peculiar worth: whereas there is not any one of you, who may not hope
for the highest honors of the Militia, to which the way lies always open, and
whereunto you are particularly by this occasion invited. Which words the Bashaw
being willing to confirm by more express promises, he made it be proclaimed
throughout the whole Army, that the first three who should mount the walls of
the City, should be made St. Iacchi; and in case any Bashaw should dye, he who
should first enter the City, should succeed in that dignity. The Soldiers
being thus encouraged, order was given for an assault the next morning, wherein
the Turks, before sunrising, approached quietly to those very Bulworks, which
they had before attempted, hoping the more unexpectedly they should fall upon
the Enemy, the more easily they should get the victory; and so it fell out. For
finding those who were upon the guard of the Bulwork Costanzo, fast asleep;
they overcame the greatest difficulties without any dispute, and getting upon
the Parapets, did not afford them time to defend themselves; nay being amazed
between sleep and fear, they could not get, time-enough, into their inward
works. The opinion of the coming of the expected succor, had wrought so much
with our men, as they thought the noise which was made the preceding night by
the Turks, standing to their Arms, was an assured token of the raising of the
siege; so as in that respect, and because they were almost quite spent with
watching and labor, they had the more securely betaken themselves to their
rest: The Turks entering promiscuously in this confusion, with our men into the
inner-most works, it caused such noise and terror, as many began to run away.
Count Rocas was lodged a little way distant from the Bulwork, who learning what
had happened, more by the noise and tumult, than by any certain information, put
on his Arms, wherein he spent some time; and coming to the place of Conflict,
found all things in such disorder, as, though he kept his own men from running,
yet could he not bring safety to what was already almost in despair, for being
shot with a Musket in the head, all the rest, who through hopes in him, had
with much difficulty, and upon great disadvantage, disputed the business as
yet, quitted the defense of the walls, and ran every one to their own houses,
hoping to provide for their wives safety. So as though Pietro Pisani, a
Counselor, and Bernardino Polani came quickly thither, they in vain used their
Authority and example to stay the people, who were already in disorder and much
confusion; amongst which* whilst Polani mixed himself, and did by force stay
some of them, he together with them was cut in pieces. But Pisan^ retreated
with the rest to Piazza, whither people ran from all parts to save
themselves, and were not as yet pursued by the Turks; for minding only the
making of themselves Masters of the Walls, after they had driven the first from
the Bulwork Costanza, they went presently to the other Bulworks, where the
Enemy were valiantly fought with, but especially with the Italian foot. But in
fine, finding their in-works lost, and that they were at the same time fought
with, both before and behind, not being able to make any longer resistance;
they quit the Walls, and betook themselves all to make good the Piazza, which
they did for a while against the assaliants, till the Bashaw of Aleppo came in,
who entering the Town by the Bulwork Tripoli, hasted first about the Walls,
killing many that were tarried behind; though throwing down their arms, they in
vain endeavored pardon. And having routed some armed Companies upon the
Bulwork Barbaro, who had been got together by Iovanni Faliero, a noble
Venetian, and one that being but a private Merchant in the City, had upon
several occasions given good testimony of his valor; and meeting with nothing
to withstand him any where else, he came to the Piazza, where finding so many
in arms, as they made stout resistance: he presently made three pieces of
Artillery be brought from off the Walls, wherewith he disordered, and sorely
indammaged those squadrons which defended the Piazza, and forced them to
forsake it, many of them withdrawing themselves into the Courts of the Palace,
whither the Lieutenant, the Bishop Contarini, and diverse others of the chief
of the City, were first come. And those that could not get in, being scattered
up and down, and not having any defense, were either slain, or taken Prisoners:
but soon after, he made sign of parley to those that were within the Court, and
sent to the Lieutenant a certain Cyprian Friar, to Treat with him, who having
yielded a little before, was received upon his Parole. This man having in the
Bashaw's name, promised life unto them all, was immediately sent back with
Tutio Costanza, who in the Lieutenant's name, said, they would surrender. By
whose order they having all forthwith laid down their Arms, it fell miserably
out, that at the opening of the Gates, the Turks, who were thronging round
about, entered violently into the Court, and cruelly, put all those unarmed
people to the sword: wherein the Lieutenant, the Bishop, and all the other
eminent personages, ran the same fortune as did the Soldiers, and the
meanest men. After which, the Turks ran without any order or discipline all
over the City, plundering the Houses, destroying the Churches, dishonouring
Matrons, violating Virgins, and putting all to the Sword, without any
distinction either of sex, age, or condition. So as the Turks slew that day
above 20000 persons; and those whose lives were spared by the cruel Enemy,
rather for their greater punishment, then out of any charity, were tied in
chains, dragged over the dead carcasses of their parents and friends, and
carried away Prisoners. Thus that City, which for many years had lived in great
pomp and splendor, and in great abundance of all things, did in one day
undergo all the extremes of calamity; affording by this so horrible spectacle,
a new example of variety of humane affairs. This sacking, happened on the ninth
of September, the fourth day after the Turkish Army was encamped before the
City. The booty which was exported by the Enemy, and sent to Constantinople, to
be presented to the grand Signor, and to the Bashaws, was very great and rich;
yet did they not go away wholly triumphant, for a ship which was loaded with
many of the most precious things, and with the better sort of Prisoners, was
not got far from the Island, when the Ammunition falling on fire, it utterly
perished, with all that was within it.

Nicossia being taken and sacked, Musta^a leaving 4000 Foot to guard it,
marched with his Army toward Famagosta; for after the taking of Nicossia, the
Turks found no obstacle, but easily made themselves Masters of all the rest of
the Island: All the other Towns being neither strong, nor having people to
defend them, yielded suddenly to the enemy, as did also Cirenes, though Iovan
Maria Mudazzo, who had the custody of the Castle, and Captain Alfonzo Palazzo,
in order to the advice and exhortations of those of Famagosta, had some few
days before signified, that they would defend themselves as long as they
could. Those of the Mountains did the like; Scipio Garaffa, Paolo Singlitico,
and others of the Nobility, accompanied with many Grecian Priests, and by a
great crowd of country people, coming in suddenly to Mustafa, and swearing
fealty unto him; so as now, nothing in the whole, Island but Famagosta, held
for the Venetians. Mustafa therefore led his Army thitherward, and pitched his
Camp at the Pomadamo, three miles distant from the City, making many Turks ride
daily to and fro within sight of those of the Town, with the heads of diverse
chief persons, who were slain at Nicossia, upon their Lances, to terrify the
soldiers, and to make them desist from their resolution, of standing out the
siege. He afterward drew a little nearer the City, making his Trenches, with
baskets full of sand, for that that soil was not proper for such works. But
those of the Town sallying out to skirmish with the enemy, drove them twice
from their Trenches; and by their Artillery from the Fort, destroyed three
Forts, which the Turks had with much expedition raised, at St. Georgio, at
Priepole, and at la Torre del Ocha, whereby the besieged got no great good, as
it fell out afterward; for in a few days, they had consumed in this business
only, more then 50000 weight of powder. But because the winter came already
on, which was not seasonable for the siege, which was likely to prove a long
and hard business; and because some of the men were to be employed in
re-inforcing the Galleys, by reason of the advertisment, that the Christian
Fleets were joined; Mustafa, being desirous not to try his fortune again,
whereby he might lessen the glory which he had gotten, in taking Nicossia, had
several treaties with the besieged to come to an agreement. Wherefore
suffering Iovanni Sosomano, whom he had taken prisoner, to go into the Town,
under pretense of getting moneys for his ransom, he made many motions, tending
to surrendering the Town; that he should tell the Governors, and Commanders,
That if they would not of themselves resolve to surrender the City, they might,
whilst they had time to do so, write to their Masters at Venice, to acquaint
them with the condition they were in, with how hard it was to hold out against
so great an Army; and to exhort them to make use of this occasion, of
accommodating their affairs with the grand Signior, and consequently of
securing their Dominions, by yielding up that, which they could by no means
keep. Mustafa made several Letters of the same tenure be written, and ordered
it so, as they might seem to be written by the Governors of Famagosta, and
come to the hands of the Consul at Constantinople. But the Governors and
people of Famagosta were resolved, to hold it out to the last; therefore they
did not only not listen to any such discourse; but in stead of writing to the
Senate for leave to surrender, they resolved to write very effectually for
relief. And to the end, that the condition of affairs, and their own
particular needs, might be the better understood, they sent Nicolo Donato to
Venice, who was then with two Galleys in the Haven at Famagosta; with whom came
also Ierolimo Rogozzoni, Bishop of that City, very well instructed with all
things, and ^it for such an employment.

But it is now time, that we return to acquaint you, with the proceedings of
the Christian Fleet, which parting (as has been said) all jointly together,
from the Haven at Suda, came to Scythia, where the Commanders began to give
their several opinions, how those forces were to be made use of, to the best
advantage; Some were for assaulting some of the Ottaman Towns, and for the
endammaging them as much as possibly they could, upon their own confines,
whereby they might make them forego Cyprus, and come with their Fleet, and the
greatest part of their forces, to relieve themselves, where their affairs
should be endangered most: Which if it should not so succeed, yet it would
stand with their first purpose, to counterpoise the loss which they might
suffer, in losing any of the Towns of Cyprus, which peradventure might be more
easily recovered by that means, then by defending it now. Wherefore they
affirmed this to be the safer, and more advantageous course to be taken, than
to go for Cyprus, whereby in many cases, they might rather reap loss then
profit; for it would not be in their power, to force the Turkish Fleet to
fight, which riding in good order, being flanckt on both sides by great
Vessels, full of Artillery, might keep upon those shores, as in a safe haven,
and either not be brought to fight, or if they should, it would be a sure token
that they knew, they might do it upon great advantage. Nor could they hope for
more safety, when they should be arrived at Cyprus; for the good they could
expect by landing their men, to assist Nicossia, could not be answerable to the
danger they might incur* the enemy being so strong, and Masters of the field;
and to besiege the besiegers, would be almost impossible, since there was such
store of victuals in the Island. And then again, to keep long at sea,
especially in that season, and amidst the Rivers of the enemies Country, was a
thing which might be subject to several accidents; and if any misfortune
should befall, they could not avoid the imputation of rashness. But on the
contrary, others, and chiefly General Zanne, were no less fervent for going
for Cyprus, alleging, That that Fleet was principally destined for the defense
of Cyprus, which, by reason of their so long delay, could not be freed from
danger, by any diversion. That the only remedy, and not without very great
hopes, lay, in going to find out the enemy's Fleet, and in fighting them. For
at the news of their arrival, the Turks would be forced to withdraw unto
their Fleet, and would abandon the siege of Cyprus to defend themselves* And if
they should busy themselves any longer about it, what could they desire more
for certainty of victory, than to find the enemy dispersed up and down the
Country, and the Galleys abandoned, and exposed to secure prey? But that it was
much more like, that the Turks, when they should have notice of the Venetian
forces, and of their Galleys, being joined with those of the Church, and of
Spain, they would depart with their Fleet from Cyprus, not to fight, but to
return to Constantinople. And that therefore, meeting the Enemy upon the way,
they might fight them upon great advantage. But howsoever, they might promise
unto themselves as far as the uncertainty of war would permit, prosperous
success from this their forwardness; for though they were inferior to the
enemy, in the numbers of shipping and men, yet did they undoubtedly exceed them
in the goodness of their vessels, and valor of their soldiers. Moreover,
they being fresh and entire, now that they were sufficiently recruited with
mariners and soldiers, they might upon great advantage fight the enemy, who
must be wasted and wearied by much of action, wherein it was to be believed,
they might have lost the flower of their men; and that certainly, if they
should get no other good thereby, they should gain much honor, by approaching
so near, and by so much urging the enemy's Fleet. Whereas on the contrary, to
fall upon any other undertaking, would argue fear, as if they shunned
encountering the enemy, whereby they would be much enheartned, and our men
discouraged, especially those that defended Cyprus. Nor would it be wisely
done, to lose what was ones own, to get what was an other's; and that so much
the less, for that it would be the harder for a weaker Principality, such as
was their Commonwealth, either to maintain what they should get, or recover
what they should lose, from the Turkish Empire, amidst their own territories,
so full of soldiers. These reasons being of themselves very strong, drew all
to be governed by them, especially, because they were conformable to the orders
and desires of the Senate; to wit, That setting aside all lesser affairs, they
should mind the main business. They therefore all jointly resolved to go for
Cyprus; and those who were formerly of another opinion, showed no less
forwardness to do what was resolved upon. Thus parting from Candia on the 18
of September, they steered their course toward Cyprus. The whole Fleet
consisted of 181 Galleys, 124 of the Venetians, 12 manned out by the Pope, and
45 of the King of Spain's. And to boot with these, 12 great Galleys, and 14
Ships manned by the Venetians, together with a great number of Vessels of
burden, fraught with ammunition. There were in this Fleet about 15000 Foot, to
boot with a great number of Volunteers, who were come from all parts, most of
them Gentlemen, and people of good quality. And though many of the first
Venetian soldiers, that were on board, were wanting; yet the first number,
which was 10000 Foot, was almost made up by new men, taken from the Islands.
And in the Pope's Galleys, there was above 1000. and about 4000 in those of
Spanish. These were all commanded by men of great esteem and experience, so as
they went boldly on to find out the enemy. Thus they sailed with favorable
winds toward Cyprus, though, that they might keep company, they used only the
Trinchet; and having gone above 300 miles in three days, they came to the
Castle Ruzzo, which is a Fort lying over against the Set Cani in Caramar^a,
and not above 150 miles from Cyprus. The night, and foul weather coming on, our
men were fain to put into the Havens of Vathi and Calemiti; and here they met
with the unfortunate news of the loss of Nicossia, whereat they were all much
abashed. Wherefore calling a Council the next day, wherein they would have the
advice of all those that bore Lant-horns. Those, who whilst in Scythia, were
against this enterprise, did now more expressly protest against it: Yet the rest
promised, that they would not obviate, what had been formerly resolved upon,
neither by their votes, nor by their counsels, provided that the whole forces
should join therein. But Doria soon declared openly, that he would by all
means return back; saying, That they went from Candia, with a resolution to
relieve Nicossia; which being now lost, they had not the same reason to expose
themselves to the hasard of a Battle, which was by this news become much more
great and considerable: For the enemies having nothing to do on land, and being
grown bold and insolent by this victory, would be all of them got aboard the
Fleet, not only ready to withstand us, but to advance and meet us, who should
assault them. To this, the season of the year may be added, winter being at
hand; the long voyage which they were to make, before they could get into their
Havens; and the particular care he had to preserve that Fleet, which was
committed to his trust by the King his Master. He was so positive herein, as
neither General Zane, nor Commissary Veniero, who being gone aboard, seemed
very desirous to make for Cyprus, could by any means persuade him, to run the
same fortune with them, and to try the fortune of war, now that he was come so
far along with them in company; since they could not excuse themselves of the
imputation, which would be laid upon them by all men, of having consumed so
many men, and spent so much time in doing nothing. But all was to no purpose.
Nay, his actions witnessed this his will no less, then did his words; for it
was observed, that Doria keeping his Galleys from mingling with the rest, by
the way as they went, kept still to the lee-ward, to the end, that he might do
(as it was suspected) whatever he listed; and that the night that he was at
Castle Ruzzo, lying more outward toward the Sea, then the rest, though a
brisk wind that blew, might have advised him, to have withdrawn to more
safety, made it also be suspected, that he intended, if the wind should grow
stronger, to steal quietly away, and seem as if he had been necessitated to do
so. Whereupon those others, who were not for advancing any further, taking
occasion from Doria's words and proceedings, were for returning back. Thus
Doria's assured resolution appearing, and the others dubiousnesse, General
Zane was forced to think of returning, though much against his will, seeing
that he could not obey the Senate's orders, and must leave the enemy free and
at liberty, to return home in triumph, after having done such injuries, and
made such prey. But assuredly, if we shall reflect upon what ensued, this
advice did not deserve blame, being accommodated to the time, and an occasion
of avoiding greater dangers: For in returning, the Fleet met with great storms,
which suffered it not to get wholly safe into the Havens; for some of the
Pope's and of Venetians Galleys being driven on land, by boisterous winds,
split in sunder And the Turks (as was understood afterward) being informed by
Caiaceleby, who had been sent toward Candia, to discover the proceedings of
the Christian Fleets, that they were joined, and ready to set forwards, and to
fight them, laying aside whatsoever might be a hinderance to them, and all
unuseful people; had manned all their Galleys with choice and fresh soldiers,
and stood expecting our men, who were wearied with so long a voyage, and so
many sufferings. The Christian Fleet being thus parted from Castle Rozzo, came
jointly together to Scarpanto, and entered into Tristano Haven, where Doria
taking his leave, went presently with his Galleys toward Puglia, and from
thence to Sicily, seeming to mind nothing, save how to get quickly home: So as
Colonna and Zanne's endeavors proved all vain, who were desirous to keep those
Forces united, and to fall upon some other enterprise. For Doria refused to
fall upon any petty business, as not worthy for his Kings Fleet, to run any
hazard in; and as for any long or difficult affair, he said, the season was not
fitting. Thus the Popes and the Venetian Fleet, being weakened by Doria's going
away, and hearing that Piali was parted from Cyprus with a great number of
Galleys in pursuit of them, they steered their course toward Candia, not
without danger of being set upon by the Turkish Fleet, which being advertised
of our departure, made such speed as it arrived at the Island of Stampalia.
Piali thinking (as it was believed) to find some assured prey of some scattered
Galleys, which might be sailing upon the shore of Candia, void of any such
fear, which he could not do, by reason of the great winds which blew from the
North, to which the best Havens of Candia, which look toward the Archipelagus,
are directly exposed. And this was so credibly believed, as Quirini, who was in
the City of Candia, with certain Galleys, came suddenly to join with the rest
of the Fleet, at Suda; which not long after went for the same reason all away
together in a body to Candia, to get into a place of more safety. But Piali,
who peradventure intended no such thing; or were it that by reason of the times
he altered his design, turning backward, penetrated further into the
Archipelagus, intending as he seemed, to winter in the Haven Calegiero, which
to that purpose he made be cleared of some shelves, though changing his mind
again, he left some guards abroad, and went with the Fleet to Constantinople.
The Venetian General endeavoring to dive into these designs of the Enemy, had
sent two Galleys toward the Archipelagus, which lighting unawares upon five of
the Turkish Galliouns upon the Island of Par^^, either of choice, or out of
necessity took several ways, and ran several fortunes. For the one of
them, which was commanded by Vicenzo Maria de' Priuli, came to a fight, and
after a long and valiant contest, had her Masters Mate, and all that were in
her cut in pieces, and fell into the hands of the Enemy: the other, commanded
by Angelo Suriano, taking advantage of the time, and giving way apace, escaped
the danger and got safe away. At the same time, five Galleys of St. John of
Jerusalem, which were sailing toward Candia, and commanded by Pietro
Iustiniano, Prior of Messina, a noble Venetian, who had given sufficient
testimony of his valor some years before in the siege of Malta, and was
therefore made General of that religious order at Sea, being assaulted by a
great squadron of Turkish Galleys, were all of them but hardly dealt with; two
of them being taken by the Enemy, the other three, whereof the Admiral
Iustiniano was one, got with much ado into the Haven at Suda. Thus so great
Venetian Forces, put to Sea at so vast expense, and with such incredible speed
(all humane accidents, those of War especially, being subject to various
chance,) produced not the least good to their affairs; nay, it may be said,
they were rather cause of prejudice to them, for they hoped so much in the good
which they expected by their Fleet, against the enemy, and they were wholly so
busied in the business of the Levant, as they did not much mind lesser
affairs, which might have brought them certain, and no small advantage,

The Turkish subjects in Albania, had made an insurrection in several parts;
and being desirous to shake off the yoke of slavery which they lived in under
the Ottaman Empire, they desired assistance of men and arms from the
Magistrates of the Venetian Towns, which lay upon those confines; saying, that
as soon as they should see a Venetian Standard, they would readily give
obedience to the Commonwealth, and would give up their Sons as hostages of
their Loyalty; in which their requests, although they could not receive
satisfaction according to their necessities, and desires, yet great store of
the inhabitants of Monte Negro came in unto them, and from about Boiano, which
is now called the Country of Drino, and from other parts of the Marcovicchi, to
put themselves under the Venetians Government; so as above a hundred Towns were
received into the obedience of the Commonwealth, by the Governors of
Antiviri, Dolcingo, and Budua; by which risings, and by reason of the small
Garrisons which were then in the neighboring Turkish Towns, it was thought
they might make good this their action, though sufficient forces had been ready
to assault them. The Venetian Magistrates of that Province, ceased not
notwithstanding, to do all that they were able, to nourish and increase the
good affection of those people toward the Commonwealth, and to make way for
better successes. Amongst these Magistrates, Alessandro, Dorato, chief
Magistrate of Antiviri; the Archbishop of the City, interposing himself
therein by the means of some of his friends, held secret intelligence with
Mustafa, who was Governor of Scutari, to deliver up that Town into our men's
hands, upon promise of very great rewards; for which enterprise, whilst foot
were assembling out of the neighboring Garrisons, and whilst Ferrara's Horse
were expected, together with two Brigan^ines, which were to come for that
purpose from Zara, the opportunity was lost; for were it either that many
Soldiers were come into the Fort of Scutari, from Vallona, which hindered his
designs, as Mustafa alleged; or that under pretense of this practice, he
plotted some mischief to our men, which he found afterward by new accidents
he could not compass; the business could not be effected, nor had they so
great forces, as they might hope thereby to force the Town, which was already
Garrisonized with new men. The like success, and out of the same reasons, had
the business of of Alessio; attempted not long after, by those of Dulcingo.
For having taken the Suburbs of the Town, with those few men which they could
put together, and chased the St. Iacco of Ducagini, who was come with some
Horse to relieve the Town: they could not keep long before the Castle, nor so
soon effect the enterprise by a few men, but that it was impeded by the
Belgerby of Greece. But our men made War upon the confines of Zara, rather to
keep the Enemy from doing injuries, and to secure that Country which was
mightily infested by the Turks, than out of any other hopes; for the enemy
were mightily increased in Horse thereabouts, so as our light Horse, which kept
for the most part within the City of Zara, went out as occasion required to
hinder Pillage, and many other mischiefs which were done by the Enemy; wherein
Brandolino Brandolini, Count di Val-di Marino, and Ierollimo dal Nero
Vicentino, did behave themselves gallantly with their Ferrara Horse; wherewith
appearing often in the field, and valiantly assaulting the Enemy, who came to
do mischief, they revenged themselves upon them before they suffered them to
depart. But no remakable action happened in these Countries: Pillage, rather then
Battle, being the effect of this first years actions.

At the same time that these things happened, whilst the Fleets were gone
prepared for hostile actions, the business of the League which was agitated
(as has been said) by common consent in Rome, was no less solicitously
attended; where as soon as sufficient Commissions were come from the King of
Spain, and from the Signory of Venice, to their Agents, inabling them to
conclude it, the Pope sending for them to come before him, in a grave and
affectionate manner, spoke unto them thus.

As soon as there was any news heard of War resolved upon by Selino Ottaman,
against the State of Venice, we, fearing lest this might be the beginning of
much mischief to Christendom, a million of our-enormous sins having provoked
Gods anger against us; We I say, presently betook our selves to our prayers,
and devotions, which if they might not impetrate pardon for us, might at least
mitigate the punishment, wherein we have intermitted nothing, neither by our
internal peculiar affection, nor by our admonitions, nor by our example, which
belonged unto our office, as the true Pastor and Custos of the Flock, committed
unto us by God. And now we begin to rejoice, thinking that our humble Petitions
have not been powered forth in vain, since the Catholic King, moved by the
divine spirit, has so easily and so quickly been persuaded to concur in this
holy League, and to this purpose has made choice of pious and wise men, that
so important a business may the more easily be brought to a good end. And the
like good disposition of mind is seen in the Venetian Senate, all whose votes
have concurred to the undertaking of this War; Those Senators being resolute and
constant, not to dispense with any cost or pains, wherein their own safety may
be concerned, and the common good of Christendom, which was certainly very much
threatened by the Turks. Which, as it is well known to you Gentlemen, who are so
wise, so ought you with all your study and endeavors, to intend this union,
wherein the purchasing of perpetual peace and quiet to your Princes Dominions,
and immortal glory to their names, is negotiated. Men's Governments and
Empires, are not secured from ruin, by the far distance of others men's
Countries; but those ruins are retarded, that they may fall the heavier.
Constantinople, Cairo, and Jerusalem, how far are they distant from the Caspian
Gates, from whence these Barbarians had their first beginnings? and yet these
Seats of noblest Empires, are inslaved by a foreign people, neither known nor
feared by them before. And at this time, when these men, extending the bounds
of their Dominions on all sides, are become neighbors to almost all Princes;
now, that overrunning the Sea with their shipping, and having so many Havens
in their hands, they have made the way more easy for them into the most remote
Regions; Shall it be said, that Spain, or any other Province, is free, or safe
from the power of such an Empire, which being wholly ordered for War, will
never meet with any Boundures, but making one War arise from an other, aspires
at the universal Monarchy? But say, that the Venetians were solely concerned
in the damage and danger of this war, it ought assuredly be common to all
Christian Princes, since it is made by Infidels against the faithful; nay
against that Commonwealth wherein the true Christian Religion has always
been professed and nourisht, and which has so often defended and maintained the
dignity of this holy Sea, the head of Christianity; and which imports not a
little, since she fights in defense of the Kingdom of Cyprus, the preservation
whereof ought to be highly esteemed and defended by every Christian Prince,
lest that Island which lies so opportunely for the enterprise, of the Holy
Land, fall not into the hands of Infidels. To which enterprise, now that the
Empire of Constantinople is lost, that passage will be shut up, whereby
Christians have formerly past happily thither. Nor will we despair, and think
that our fervent desires shall always prove vain, but that we may yet see a
Croisado, wherein all Christian Princes and people may so zealously concur, as
a new Kingdom of Jerusalem may be sounded, and the Trophy of the Cross be
replaced there; so as that blessed Land be no more the receptacle of impious
and wicked men. The Hermit Peter was able to persuade so many Princes, and join
together so many Armies, almost of every Nation, for so glorious and pious an
enterprise, in the time of Pope Urbane; who knows, but that God may be as
gracious to us? And that the time is now come, we have some signs thereof,
since God has so long preserved so famous and and powerful a Commonwealth,
from so many dangers; and that he has been pleased by so many ways, to
increase the power and dignity of the House of Austria, wherein he has now
given us so powerful and pious a Prince, that he may quell the pride of the
Enemies of the Holy Faith, and parallel the worth and glory of Charlemain,
whose fame is made so illustrious, by the memory of so many things done by him,
for the increase of Christian religion. This so great and honorable work, and
the hope of such happy success, is recommended to your diligence and trust, so
as you ought not only be diligent and effectual, in executing your Princes
desires, but labor by all possible means to confirm them in this their good
intention; nay solicit and provoke them, endeavoring that as their interests
cannot be separated in respect of Religion, nor State; so neither may their
Forces, nor minds be divided, but united together by the firm bonds of charity,
and common safety; so as they may become a terror to those enemies, whom
rather our own discords, than any worth in them, has made to undervalue us.
But let us overcome our selves, and our affections, and we shall easily
overcome others. The Forces of these three Potentates being firmly united, will
be such, and so many, as we may promise thereby unto our selves, noble and
assured victories. Besides, we do not doubt, but that our example will invite
the Emperor, and all other Christian Princes, to partake with us, not only in
our labors and expense, but also in glory. We will use our authority with
them, will pray, admonish, and solicit them, to enter into this holy League,
and not to be wanting to their common safety, honor and duty, to the end, that
howsoever our conscience* may tell us, we have not failed in any thing, in the
discharge of that place, whereunto God has called us. And if it shall be
thought, that our presence may further the business, and that our authority
and example may move others, the imperfections of old age shall not detain us,
from willingly exposing our life to all danger and labor, to whom nothing can
be more welcome, then to die for the glory of Christ, and for the good of
Christendom.

The Ambassadors, and the two Cardinals, seeming to be much affected with
these words, humbly thanked his Holiness, and promised to lend all their
assistance, with sincerity and diligence, in so important and pious a
business, and which was so much desired by their Princes, as well for their
own particular interests, as for the common good of Christendom. But all these
words, though much magnified by all parties, produced not answerable effects;
for every one minding their own ends, as those differed, so differed they in
their opinions: and the conclusion of the business was spun out to an
unseasonable length, wherein many months were spent in vain. The Pope deputed
five of the chiefest Cardinals of the Court, to intervene in the Treaty, in
the name of the Apostolic See; Alexander, the Popes nephew, Morone, Cesis,
Grassi, and Aldobrandino; with whom, when the two Spanish Cardinals, and the
Spanish and Venetian Ambassadors, begun to treat, they presently met with many
difficulties. The Signory of Venice, because all her Territories by Sea, are
first exposed to the violence of the Turks; and because the League lessened not
the expense of so many Garrisons, in their so many Cities, and Maritime places,
and did not secure their affairs, but that they were to be at greater expense
and danger; being desirous to reap some advantage, which might be answerable
to so many inconveniences, propounded things, which tended to the abating of
the Turkish power, and to the destroying of their Fleet, and to the bereaving
them of some of their Dominions, that for the future, they might not fear their
forces. Which things, though they might also bring advantage to the King of
Spain, yet was not the event so certain, nor the profit so apparent, and at
hand. Therefore the King's Commissioners thinking, that, if their King's
Dominions were not more safe, were yet further from danger, proposed
temporising, and rather to wait for the advantage of time, then to expose any
thing to fortune. They therefore endeavored the making of a perpetual League,
and upon such terms, as tended more to defend themselves, then to offend the
enemy; by which League, the Catholic King would have reaped much good; for by
being, as he always was, at open wars with the Turks, he made use of the
credit and forces of his friends, without drawing a new enemy upon himself; and
by increasing his power much at sea, and carrying the war far off, he freed his
Dominions from the expense of Garrisons, and from being molested by the Turkish
Fleets; which things did not only not put him to greater expense, but (which
is but seldom seen) war brought safety and advantage to him: For to boot with
the lessening of his ordinary expense, in maintaining soldiers in so many
maritime parts, he reaped so much profit by the immunities granted him by the
Pope, which were now the greater, by the new concession of the Croysado in the
Indies, as did largely supply the charge he was at in his Fleet; for during the
League, the revenues of the Crown of Spain were increased to about two thousand
millions of gold. These were the Kings thoughts, which were nourished and
fomented by diverse of his State-Ministers, chiefly by some of those, with whom
the Treaty of the League at Rome was entrusted; for it was generally thought,
that their opinions corrupted the Kings good intentions, and was the occasion
of depriving Christendom of the good, which men thought might have been
expected upon this occasion, had it not been for them: And yet they themselves,
that were the raisers of so many difficulties, propounded contrarieties. And as
if they had thought it nothing to abase the Turks power, and to save themselves
from the present danger, began to propound other things, whereby utterly to
destroy the whole Mohammedan Sect, and all their Empires; constantly affirming,
that this League was to be declared, to be not only against the Turks, but
generally against all Infidells, intending thereby also to extirpate the Moors;
and the Ottaman Empire being overcome, to proceed on to the King of Persia, to
the end, that Christendom might be for ever secured, from these barbarous
Infidells. The vanity of which proposition appearing too plainly, they bounded
that Article afterward within narrower precincts, and would have ill Siriffo,
or King of Barbary, and the Moors, and others depending upon the Turks* to be
named as enemies to the League. But notwithstanding, when any thing of action
was propounded, they appeared to be very backward; they would not consent to
what the Venetians desired, to wit, That the forces of the League should be
intended to continue, for at least two or three years, and that they should be
such, as might be employed in the greatest enterprises of the Levant, for the
common advantage of the Colleagues. Against which, it was objected, That
Princes could make no certain resolution in things, which depended upon the
variety of several accidents; that therefore they were to inform themselves of
the Turks preparations and designs, and resolve accordingly upon the Leagues
forces, and what they should do every year, in Rome: Which being but a
semblance of satisfaction, was thought, would really hinder or retard all good
success, the chiefest time for action being thereby to be spent in disputes.
This intention of the King's Agents, aiming too much at their own
accommodation, and at the prejudice of the common cause, appeared yet more
plainly in other things, more especially in their constant opinion, that the
enterprises of Barbary, should be particularly named, in all the Articles of
the War; alleging, that without this hope, the King could not get that sum of
moneys out of Spain, which was requisite, for the expense he should be at, in
the League. But the Pope, who proceeded with great sincerity in all things, and
aimed only at the universal good of Christendom, sought sometimes to temper
the Spaniards immoderatenesse, by reason, sometimes by seeming angry,
protesting, that unless they came to a speedy resolution, he would withdraw
all those acts of favor, and all those immunities, which he had granted their
King, for the raising of moneys to this end. Nor was he wanting, in using his
endeavors with the Venetians; he exhorted them, to accommodate themselves even
to such resolutions, as might not be over advantageous, encouraged them to hope
well, and promised, that he would never abandon their cause, nor be wanting, in
favoring and assisting them to his utmost. The Cardinals, deputed to this
business, siding sometimes with the one party, sometimes with the other, that
they might the more easily bring them together, labored very much to put an
end to the Treaty. Morone, a man of much experience, in the management of
important businesses, and very welspoken, adhering often to the proposalls made
by the Venetian Ambassadors, as those that aimed most at the common good,
endeavored to remove the Kings Agents from their peculiar interests, or
rather, to make them more capable of truth.

Is it not most true, (said he) that by fighting the Turkish forces in the
Levant, where they are strongest, the Catholic King will not only secure the
Spanish seas, which he shall hardly do by the Affrican affairs, but will also
procure safety to his other Dominions for many years, nay perhaps for ever? For
when the enemies Fleet shall be ruined, and when he shall be weakened in the
very heart of his Kingdom, by the loss of places near to Constantinople, which
is the seat of his Empire; Who can doubt, but that Algeers, Tunnis, Tripoli,
and other Towns that lie further off, will suddenly fall, without either pain
or peril, into the Kings power? As on the contrary, there is nothing more
certain, then as long as the Turks shall continue strong, and keep their forces
entire, it will be a very hard matter to get those Towns, and almost impossible
to keep them, of which, we have late and assured experience, since in that
respect, the Emperor Charles the 5th, could never get the City of Algeers,
though he did very much desire it. For it was judged, it would be rashly done,
to attempt any such action in the summer, when the Turkish Fleet would be at
her strongest; and if it should be attempted in autumn, it would prove more
troublesome, more dangerous, and no good would be got thereby, by reason of the
short time, that the Militia could keep in field, and by reason of the hasards
at sea, which the Fleet should be exposed unto. But if such things were
feasible, certainly, greater victories were not to be laid aside for them, upon
such an occasion as this, nor were such hopes to be lost. But time and occasion
must be waited for, to bring things to maturity; and in the mean time, the
preservation of the Kingdom of Cyprus in the power of Christians, and which was
the chief cause of this Treaty, should be endeavored. Wherefore, to make any
particular mention of the Affrican parts, in the present Articles of this
League, would be nothing, but to wrest it from its true end, and vainly to
beget jealousies in the Colleagues. And yet, I pray you, what of tie, or what
of caution is had, by these express words? Is it not clear enough, that the
League being made against the Turk, and against his Dominions, it is to be
understood, that those places which he holds in Barbary, are therein
comprehended; against which, the forces of the League shall turn themselves,
when reason, and the condition of affairs, shall advise thereunto. To do it at
another time would be prejudicial, and not to be wished for by him, who aimed
at what was good. Nor was it to be said, that the Colleagues were at liberty,
to defer the enterprise; it was rather to be believed, that they would all
concur the more willingly therein; the Venetians, in requital of the good they
had received; and the Pope, seeing that now the greatest dangers of Christendom
were over. The King's Agents being convinced by these, and by the like reasons,
betook themselves to other excuses, saying, That they would write to Spain, to
know the Kings pleasure more particularly therein. Hereunto were added other
difficulties; for the Spaniards endeavored, to lay some note of jealousy upon
the Venetians, by obliging the Colleagues, under the penalty of Ecclesiastical
Censure, to observe what should be established by the League; every one seeing
plainly, whither such a condition tended, and how unequal it was in many
respects; chiefly, because the Catholic King was free from any such danger, by
his own grandezza. There were often disputes likewise, touching who should
command the Fleet in chief, the Spaniards craving the prerogative, not only of
naming the Captain General, which was easily condescended unto; but to
substitute any other with the like authority, in the absence of him that should
be chosen: So as diffidence increasing by means of these things, the business
of the League began to cool very much, which was begun with such fervor. At
which, the Venetian Senate being the more troubled, because it was far from
what they hoped for at first, they resolved to send another Ambassador to
Rome, deputed particularly for that Treaty, to show the Pope, how desirous they
were of a conclusion, and their constant resolution to continue the war; and
also to put the more reputation upon the business, by its being negotiated by
two of the Commonwealth's Representatives; and this was the rather thought
fitting, because the Ambassador Suriano, had given occasion of speech, that he
had given way to some of those things, which were yet in dispute; nay, such as
had been always gainsaid by the Senate. Iovanni Soranzo was chosen for this
Embassy, who though he joined very wisely with Suriano, to have the League
concluded, yet meeting with the same difficulties, he could do no good. So as
to the wonder and grief of all men, the time was unusefully spent, which should
have been rather now employed, in executing things resolved upon, then in
resolving upon what should be done.

At the same time, the Treaty of the League was continued at the Imperial
Court, but with no better success; for the Emperor having spent many months
under several pretenses herein, being desirous to keep from declaring himself
as long as he could, said at last, that having made Truce with Selino for eight
years, whereof only three were as yet expired; he thought he was bound in
honor to observe what he had promised. But that though he should be otherwise
persuaded, he neither could nor would do it without the approbation of the
Princes and Hauns-Towns of the Empire; as also without the advice of his own
particular States; so as it behoved him to take time, and to expect the firm
resolution of others, who perhaps might have changed their minds, by reason of
what had happened at Nicossia; that he might not resolve upon a thing of so great
concernment, without great maturity; and so much the rather, for that he not
being the principal in this League, and yet there being a place therein
reserved for him, no respect of his did hinder the others from concluding, nor
did his delay exclude himself: whereby it was evident, that Caesar had no mind
to interest himself in this War. And the like intentions were seen to be in
the other German Princes, and Hauns-Towns: for an other Convention being by
order from Caesar propounded to be called in the Diet at Spire, particularly to
treat of things appertaining to the League; they answered, That when, his
Majesty should be molested by the Turkish Forces, they would not fail to lend
him all their assistance, but that they did not intend to enter into so sore a
War unnecessited. Therefore to keep the Ambassador Soranzo any longer in that
Court, was but little for their honor, and not at all for their advantage. The
Senate recalled him back to Venice, and having destined Antonio Tiepolo,
Ambassador to the King of Polonia, for the same purpose, who was already on his
way: when they received this answer from the Emperor, they quickly sent for
him back, being firmly opinioned, that that Nation, though very warlike, and an
Enemy to the Turks, and which had formerly opposed him all that they could,
though but unfortunately, would not resolve to meddle in that war, without they
were therein accompanied by Caesar's Forces. But there were many reasons, which
made Caesar unwilling to declare himself in favor of this League; For* having
but a little before been unfortunate in the trial of his Arms against the
Turks; and added, by the loss of Zighet, to the prejudice and shame which
Germany had received some few years before, by that Nation at Buda, and at
Essechio, in his father Ferdinando's time; he had resolved not to put himself
upon the hazard of war again, unless much provoked, or rather forced by
necessity: and therefore having made Truce with Sultan Selino, he studied to
continue it. He likewise knew that the Authority and Forces of the Empire were
great only in name and appearance, but that in effect the latter wa^ but weak,
and the former but of little esteem. Nor could the Emperors promise themselves
any assistance from Germany, as well by the so many discords caused in her, by
the diversity of Government and Religion; as also for that their greatness
grew troubleso^^, the Imperial dignity being become almost hereditary in the
Horse of Austria; and the words and exhortations of the King of Spain were not
peradventure such, as that he could ground his hopes thereon: for that King
knew, that when the Emperor, who was not able of himself to withstand the
Turks, should be molested by them in his own Dominions, he must be forced, in
respect of his alliance, and for having exhorted him to the War, to assist him
with moneys, and so to draw a burden upon himself, in a time when he was at
greater expense elsewhere. To these respects the doubt was added which Caesar
had, lest the entering into so tedious and difficult a War, might be a cause of
diverting him from that which he ought chiefly to aim at, to wit, at the making
his eldest Son, Rodolphus be chosen King of the Romans, and at the establishing
the Imperial, dignity in his offspring, who had but little else to trust to:
and yet cloaking these his cogitations, as much as he might, he would not make
the Venetians despair of having him a Confederate in this War, to the end that
they might the more willingly embrace it and break off all Treaties of
Agreement, whereby his Dominions, might be much secured, and h^ might the
better attend his own particular ends, whilst this so formidable enemy being
busied elsewhere, suffered him to live quiet. These were the treaties touching
League against Selino, which were this year begun with much fervency, but ended
fruitless, as you may have seen: Now let us return unto the Fleets.

The Venetian General being returned (as you have heard) to the Haven of
Cania, partly because his Enemies were nigh at hand, and his friends far off;
partly by reason of the season, which was not fit for actions at Sea, thought
it a vain and rash thing to attempt the relief of Famagosta; whither it was
resolved that 1600 Soldiers should be sent in three Ships; and that they
should be secured by a convoy of 12 Galleys, by reason that they heard that
eight Turkish Galleys remained upon the coast of Famagosta to hinder them: but
Commissary Veniero pressed very hard, that that City might have as many more
ships, and as many more men sent thither for the better security and longer
preservation thereof, wherein all the hope of preserving, or rather of
recovering the Kingdom of Cyprus lay; which not being able, by reason of many
impediments, to be effected, Veniero in that respect, and much more of
sickness which befell him, tarried behind in Candia. Marquess Rangone
Pallevesino, was destined for the Captain of these men; but he absolutely
refused to go, alleging, that being sent to go into Famagosta, if Baglione
were not there, and if he should be there, to go into Nicossia; he was now free
from any such obligation, because the last was lost; and it was certainly
known, that an other Commander was in the former: the which being judged not to
be a reason fitting to be given by a Soldier, especially at such a time, he
incurred some note of infamy thereby, in the opinion of the Soldiery; whereupon
he being oppressed with grief, dyed not long after, ^^d Luigi Martiningo was
chosen in his place, to be the Commander of that relief, who was then
Governor of Ca^e, and who with much alacrity offered to undertake that
service. These directions being given in Candia, the General thought fit to be
gone from Candia as soon as he could, so to ease that Island of the charge it
had been at, in feeding so many men, and to free it from the fear of so
powerful an Enemy, since Piali would not then have any occasion to winter in
the Archipelagus: so leaving Quirini in Candia, with the Galleys of that
Kingdom, with some Gally-slaves, and other three great Galleys, he went with
the rest of the Fleet to Corfu, having escaped a great storm at Sea in his
voyage, and with much ado got into the Haven at Vatica, where the General
expected orders from the Senate, either to stay there, or else (as he had
advised) to pass on into Dalmatia, for the better acconchiating of the
Galleys, and for the furnishing of the Fleet, which did already want all
things. But Colonna, and Palavesino, preparing suddenly to be gone, to which
purpose they were got to the head of the Island, were forced by reason of
contrary winds, to keep a whole month in the Haven of Casopo,; from whence
parting at last, they met with great tempests and dangers, particularly
Colonna, whose Admiral was set on fire by lightning, and burnt; and he being
got into Francisco Trono's Convoy, ran almost at once two great hazards. For
that Gally was likewise driven on shore, and split by the same Tempest, so as
the men that were in her could hardly escape. But having escaped that storm,
Colonna came to Zara, and having acquainted the Senate with his voyage, and
with his actions, he went forthwith to Ancona, and from thence to Rome, to give
an account of all that had happened, to the Pope: but Palavesino fell grievously
sick at Liesena, so as he was forced to tarry long in that City. General Zane
fell likewise into a sore sickness at the same time, occasioned by the many
sufferings both of his body and mind, which made him crave leave of the Senate
to lay down his charge, and to return home for cure, which was granted him, and
Sebastiano Veniero was chosen in his place, and orders were presently sent to
him into Candia, to go forthwith with two of those Galleys to Corfu, and to
take upon him the Government of the Fleet, which it was already resolved upon,
should remain all that winter in that Island, and should be there fitted with
all things. But for fear lest Veniero might have taken his voyage toward
Cyprus, before he should receive these orders. The Senate resolved to choose a
Commissary-Generall at Sea, who in Veniero's absence, was to have the same
authority as he had; and in his presence, should notwithstanding keep in the
Fleet, and have the next place under him: For howsoever, it was thought very
fit, that in times of such difficulties, wherein oft-times resolutions touching
the total business, was to be taken upon the place; the Commonwealth might
be served by the Counsel and Authority of more then one. And to this place was
Agostino Barharigo, chosen by general consent, a man of singular wisdom and
integrity, in whose worth the Commonwealth might safely place her hopes. Thus
did the first years war end, which was begun with great, but unsuccessful hope.

He who shall first consider the vast maritime Forces, which the Commonwealth
of Venice was able to raise in so short a time, must confess that her
institutions are excellently good, concerning the Sea-Militia, and that she is
no less accommodated therein, in times of War, than in times of Peace; but he
who shall afterward reflect upon the whole passages of this year, wherein so
great a Fleet, and such preparations for War could effect nothing, either
touching their own defense, or the offending of the Enemy, may learn by what
has been already said, that good orders are not always able to preserve
Dominions, nor to bring what they take in hand to a good end; but only when
they meet with such as do execute them well, or rather when they are attended
on by fortunate Incounters, or by some happy Genius particular to that
Province; without all which, we often see the wisest Counsels prove vain, the
accidents and disorders to which humane actions are subject, being almost
infinite, especially those of war, which are not to be foreseen, nor amended by
humane wisdom, as shall more clearly appear in what succeeded afterward, as
we shall pursue to relate.

THE Venetians were so troubled at the loss of Nicossia, and at the other
successes, which fell out almost in all things quite contrary to their first
conceived hopes, as they knew not well what to do; for on the one side, their
great desire, to recover the reputation of their forces, and to revenge the
injuries which they had received, incited them to renew the war, with yet
greater forces, and to try their fortune once more. But on the other side, when
they considered the power of the enemy, and the uncertainty of being assisted
by other Princes, who were all seen to be bent upon their present and
particular interests, they were put upon other thoughts, and sometimes
bethought themselves of making some fair agreement, which they knew, by
advertisement from their Consul, that the Turks were not averse unto. The
possession which they yet had of Famagosta, the ^ame which was divulged abroad
of the League, and of the Colleagues great forces, and the, as yet, uncertain
end of the whole war, made them hope, they might the more easily obtain peace,
and reduce their affairs into their former tranquillity. And then, the so many
difficulties which they met with in concluding the League; the bad Augury
conceived, by the first so unfortunate beginning of their forces, and by a
certain malign influence of so many adverse chances, made them almost despair
of doing any good by war. The Senators were the more perplexed with these
doubts, not knowing well what to resolve upon; for that they had a fair
occasion offered them, of negotiating peace, with their honor, and with some
hopes of good; for Bashaw Mehemet continued still his first desire, of bringing
things to some accord, not being pleased with whatsoever should happen by war;
which if it should prove cross, the associate Princes wanted not forces,
whereby to trouble and endanger that Empire; and if it should prove prosperous,
the honor and authority of his rival Mustafa, would be too much increased.
Mehemet, moved by these cogitations, had always, in many discourses, kept an
endeavor of peace on foot with the Consul, being very desirous to draw out of
him, whether he had any Commission to treat thereof, or no; and at last began
to promote that of himself, whereunto he found no invitation: He took his
rise, from the complaints which were daily made at Court by such, whose friends
were imprisoned, or had their goods detained in Venice, after the war was
declared. He treated with the Consul, that he would be a means to his Lords and
Masters, that the subjects of the Ottaman Empire might be set at liberty, and
have their goods restored; it being against the justice and dignity of that
Nation, that the Venetian Merchants should be free, and enjoy their goods, in
all the Turkish Dominions, when those that lived under the wing and protection
of so mighty a Prince, should be detained prisoners, and be bereft of their
goods. The Bashaw showing, that the grand Signeur was much scandalized hereat,
did not only give leave to the Consul to write to Venice, but seemed very
desirous, that he would send away an express messenger, who might treat
thereof more lively, and get a speedier resolution therein. And at the same
time, he offered occasion of discourse, by means of Hebraim, wherein he
manifested his intention, of inviting the Venetians, to send an express to
Constantinople, who, together with this business of the Merchants, might
motion some treaty of Agreement. He therefore sometimes wished the Consul to
consider, that the Kingdom of Cyprus was laid so waste by the war, as that no
advantage could be made of it a long time: Sometimes he would exaggerate the
good that was got by peace, and the great mischiefs which war would bring with
it, if the Venetians would continue therein, against the Ottaman family;
magnifying his Master's forces, and his new designs, of assaulting the
Venetian Dominions with his Fleet, and with his Army, both by sea and land. And
offering at the same time, to use his authority, that the ancient friendship
between the Commonwealth and the Ottamans, might be renewed, wherein, he said,
his Masters would find at last, they might more firmly ground their hopes, of
preserving their power and Empire, then in the uncertain assistance of
Christian Princes, who, as experience had oft-times showed, were no great
friends to their grandezza. Thus the Consul, by permission from the Bashaw,
nay, by his express order, dispatched away the Master of his household from
Constantinople, and one of the Dragomani, with Letters, which were dictated to
the Consul by the Bashaw's self, touching the business of the Merchants;
wherein he afterward gave a particular account of all that had past between
him and the Bashaw, and of the Bashaw's mind. At the same time, Grascinan, a
French Gentleman, who negotiated some business in that Court for the French
King, parted from Constantinople, who when he came to Venice, said, How that
the Bashaw Mehemet, had had many discourses with him, about the business of
peace; nay, that he carried Letters from the grand Signior, and from the
Bashaw, to his King, whereby he might find, they would be content, that the
King of France, as a friend to both parties, should intercede in the treaty of
Agreement. Which proposalls, though they were suspected by the Senators, as
made rather, to make them slacken their provisions for war, and their joining
in league with other Princes, then out of any intention of laying down Arms,
and coming to a good peace; yet the various accidents of the present times,
prevailed much with them, to make them listen to these Treaties. For in the
conclusion of the League, to boot with other things, a new difficulty arose,
touching the time when it should commence; the Spaniards being desirous, that
this summer might pass over, and that they might not be tied to the observancy
of the Capitulations therein contained, till the next year, nor that the League
should be of force till then; and the Venetians were afear'd, they should not
have forces sufficient, to withstand so powerful a Fleet, as they understood
the Turks were ready to put forth: Wherefore they writ very earnestly to the
Pope, that he would use his authority, in overcomming these difficulties; they
showed, How that by his advice, they had embraced this war, had sent away the
Chiaus, by whom they might have negotiated their affairs, and neglected other
accommodations, which had often been propounded to their Consul. How that, by
his advice likewise, they had so long exspected the Spanish Galleys, whose
assistance proved afterward more in name then in reality. And that, seeking to
outdo their own strength in all things, they had showed their readiness to
settle such a League, as they conceived should be pleasing to him, and suitable
to the necessities of Christendom. But all this produced not such effects, as
the time required; for the Pope, who of himself was wholly set upon the
general good, and knew, that the Venetians intents were answerable thereunto,
confessed, that their desires were just and honest; and exhorted them, not to
go less, notwithstanding their first had successes. That war did always
produce various effects, but that at last, worth, and a constant resolution,
and the justice of the cause, did prevail. Neither ought they to despair of
help from others, nor yet of their own forces; for neither was there so much
time spent, nor were the difficulties such, but that they might be overcome,
and a Fleet be put together, which would not be only able to face the enemies
Fleet, but to beat it. Yet being a Pope of easy impression, and being
persuaded to the contrary by those, who for their own particular interests, did
adhere too much to the Spaniards, he either leaned toward those things, which
might weaken the League, or retard the conclusion thereof, or else did not
vigorously interpose his authority. But that which the Venetians were
exceedingly troubled at, was, to see, that the Pope was busied in other
affairs, and full of other troubles; for Cesar's Ambassadors having protested,
that if the Pope would not annull the concession of new titles, which he had
made unto the Duke of Florence, the Emperor would be forced to use all
possible means, for the maintaining of his own dignity, and the honor of the
Empire. The Pope being full of jealousy, and fear, and yet not being willing
to retract, that which he thought he had authority to do, and which he had with
reason done, prepared to defend his honor, and the reputation of the
Apostolic See, even with temporal Arms: He therefore was diligent in listing
new men, and provided for Arms, Moneys, and all things else necessary. He made
a general Proclamation be made, which did redound to the particular prejudice
of the Venetians, That no body whosoever should have any soldiers out of the
Ecclesiastic Estate; and this with such severity, as Pompeo da Castella, and
Iovan Aldobrandini, were imprisoned, for having raised some Foot for the
Venetians, in the Churches territories. He proceeded likewise very sparingly,
and only in generalities, in his promising assistance for the Turkish war. So
as it was daily feared, that there would be some commotion of Arms in Italy,
than which, nothing could at that time prove more pernicious. The Senate
resolved therefore, to send Secretary Formenti speedily away to Rome, to
appease the business; but the Secretary's going being a while after stopped, to
shun fomenting such an opinion, the same employment was recommended to their
Ambassadors at Rome, who were to beseech the Pope, to consider well the
condition of the present times, the eminent danger that threatened Christendom,
and that the remedy to so many mischiefs, (if any were to be found) lay only
in him, which should move him to value very little, or not at all any other
respect how important soever, which might disturb the hopes of securing
Christendom from the power of so dreadful an enemy, to which he had already
opened the way, by declaring himself piously and zealously, to be the head and
first Author of the union of the Christian Princes: Whereunto though the Pope
did graciously give ear, yet pleading necessity for his excuse, he spun out
time, and left the success of War in a doubtful condition. Out of these
respects, the Venetians were the better pleased with their coming, who came
from Constantinople, and thought it fit to make use of this occasion, and think
upon the business of Peace: for they saw their hopes grew every day smaller,
and more uncertain; and that reason why for some months past, they had forborne
doing so, was now ceased; to wit, the fear of making men jealous that they
intended an agreement: For they found by experience, that their entrance into
the War with so firm and constant a resolution, had wrought effects contrary to
their hopes, since those who for their own respects, were glad that the
Commonwealth should be busied in this war, did rather cool, then grow fervent
in her defense; and that happily they would have been more forward therein, if
they had seen them less resolved not to lay down the Arms which they had taken
up against the Turks. The Senators thinking therefore, that to fall upon this
treaty of Peace, though no good should come thereon, and that their intentions
should either be suspected or discovered, might rather further then retard the
establishing of the League; they resolved to betake themselves to the treaty of
Peace. The Government and charge thereof was therefore given to Iacobo
Ragazzoni, as one who by reason of his much traffic, was nearly concerned in
the business; and who by reason of his great experience, was thought fittest
for this employment. He was sent to Constantinople, to treat concerning the
restitution of the Merchants persons and goods, which had been detained on
either side; to boot wherewith, he had secret instructions given him by the
Council of Ten, which he was to carry to the Consul, the sum whereof was,
That if any discourse of Peace should be hereafter promoted, he should not
appear averse unto it, but enter further thereinto, if he should find the
business might be undertaken, upon fair conditions, and not detractive from
the dignity of the Commonwealth; to wit, either by re-having the Kingdom of
Cyprus, upon payment of so great Tribute to the Turks, or by the Commonwealths
keeping of Famagosta, or by yielding that up, upon the being possessed of some
other State in lieu thereof, elsewhere; and that the Territories of Albania and
Dalmatia, should be returned to the same boundures as they were before the war.
Power was likewise given to Ragazzoni to treat of all these things, and to put
on the business by the same way; if peradventure the Turks, who seemed
desirous to have one sent over expressly to that purpose, would not treat with
the Consul, because he was a prisoner, or out of any other respect.
Advertisement was forthwith given to all the Princes Courts, of Ragozzoni's
being gone for Constantinople, saying (as it was true) that he was sent to
negotiate the affairs of particular Merchants, and not to exceed such
Commissions as were given him.

But though there was nothing else communicated, every one presently suspected
that Ragatzoni had some other private Commission to negotiate peace; to the
which they were the easlier persuaded, for that it appeared by what has been
said, that the Venetians had great occasions offered them, to think of securing
their affairs by this means; having unfortunately, and in vain, as it now
appeared, taken up arms against so powerful an Enemy. The Pope being therefore
jealous, and the fear which he had conceived of Cesars Forces, beginning
through other new accidents, to be assuaged, began to think upon the treaty of
League more cordially, to which he was also solicited by the Spaniards. He
therefore resolved to send Mark Antonio Colonna, to Venice, to the end that he
himself, who was a man of an acute wit and mature judgment, and one whom the
Venetians thought very well of, might, by word of mouth, by favor, and by
granting some things that were formerly denied, hinder the treaty of Peace, and
make them assent unto a sudden conclusion of the League. Colonna being come to
Venice, and being several times admitted into the College, did in the Prince
his presence, earnestly and efficaciously persuade to the embracing of the
League; laboring to show, that he was more fervent in this business, that he
was not able to bound his affections, nor would he conceal what his reason
dictated unto him, because he knew his persuasions tended to a business which
would prove very advantageous for the Commonwealth; and that therefore his
being able at one and the same time to serve his natural Prince, the Pope, the
King of Spain, to whom he was obliged by service, and also their Lordships* to
whom he found himself no less obliged, for the affiance they seemed to have
of him, then to the rest, made him more fervent in this business.

I am not come, Gentlemen, (said he) to persuade you to embrace war, or to
incite you to pursue it; because this your generous resolution is sufficiently
known by many of your actions; by your dispatching away the Chiaus, who was
sent to set the business of Agreement on foot, by your mustering so many
Forces so speedily, by giving so express Commission to your General to
Garrisonize Cyprus, and to expose himself to all hazard, rather than to suffer
the Enemies Fleet to return safe home; which things, I my self can witness to
others: That which I have to do, is, only to show you how good and firm the
foundations are, upon which you may ground your hopes, and how opportune the
means are, which God has put into your hands, to effect that which you have
proposed unto your selves, in manfully maintaining war against this barbarous
Infidel, by which you are assured to have a glorious victory. The intention of
the Pope, and of the Catholic King, is assuredly such, as I may ascertain you,
you shall never find your selves deceived in anything that you can promise unto
your selves, in this holy and general service, from them or from their forces;
and if you will not credit me, you must believe experience and reason. Has not
the Pope readily granted his assistance, manned Galleys with his own subjects,
made himself the Protector of this League? Has he not been so favorable
thereunto, as freely to grant those graces toward the establishment of this
holy union, which he has always denied to the Catholic King, for raising of
Moneys to defend Spain, against the Insurrection of the Moors; and of
Flanders, against the Rebels both to their God* and Prince? And the King of
Spain, how willingly did he listen to the proposal of this League? how re^dily
did he give Commission to his Agents to conclude it? how affectionately,
without being bound thereunto, has he granted his Galleys for the defense of
your Dominions? What confidence has he showed in you, by trusting them in your
Havens? And now we have certain intelligence, that great preparation of
Shipping, and of Soldiers, is making in Spain, to send away Don John with all
speed into Italy. These things being justly weighed, leave not any the least
place for doubt, of the intentions of this so pious, and so truly Catholic
King. If therefore it shall be thought, that these Princes have been hard in
being brought to any of these things, it must be assuredly believed that it
has happened, partly out of a desire of establishing this union more firmly, and
of taking away all impediments at first, that might obstruct it; partly because
the very nature of the things propounded, has in it somewhat of difficulty, or
peradventure of impossibility; as that the King should set forth a hundred
Galleys this year, when he has not at the present above fourscore. Yet the
Pope and the King labor to overcome this difficulty: Orders are already sent
to the Viceroy of Naples, for the manning out of 20 Galleys with Letters of
Mart in that Kingdom; and those of Savoy, Florence, and of Malta, are
endeavored to be had: nay the Pope has promised, that the number of 100 shall
be made up, and that there shall be Forces enough this year, not only to
oppose the proceedings of the Turkish Fleet, but as I hope, to fight them, and
to vanquish them. But for Gods sake, what jealousy, what danger, can rise from
the League, which will not be found to be much greater, and more certain in
making peace, if it were to be had, now that the Enemies forces are entire, and
stronger than ever? You are very wise, and your Counsels use to be the rule
and example of good Government to other States. You may very well know, that
the Turks can obtain no greater victory, nor that any thing can prove more
prejudicial to us Christians, than that the occasion of so great a union of
Christian Princes, vanishing after so many Treaties, nay after the firm belief
of all men, that the League is already established and concluded; the Turks may
for certain find, that the Christian Princes shall not be able at any time to
raise forces sufficient to prejudice the Ottaman Empire: And that, as not any
one of them is able of himself to oppose their power, so the discords between
themselves, the misfortune of our times, or our sins, secures them from the
danger of their joining together, whereby they will grow to despise the name of
Christian the more, and will be the more encouraged to assault them every where;
but I neither will, nor ought I fear, that this malady should still continue; I
rather hope, that when you shall have duly considered these respects, you will
readily pitch upon embracing the League which is offered you; and that I shall
have the honor and the consolation of having been the instrument of confirming
it; and (if it shall so please God) perhaps of producing some good effect
thereby.

Colonna his authority and eloquence, wrought much upon the Senators; but the
mighty concernment of the business, the experience of the last years passages,
the condition of the proposalls being but in general, and uncertain, and the
hopes, that treaty of peace might produce some good effects, distracted the
Senators, and made them dubious in their opinions. They therefore gave him
general answers, remembering their actions, which might make the world believe,
they were well inclined to the League; and objecting something to what he had
said, but neither narrowed nor enlarged the Treaty, standing resolute upon the
point, that the business might either be absolutely concluded, or absolutely
laid aside. But Colonna having received new orders from Rome, whereby greater
satisfaction was given, in point of the forces, and of the time of using them,
and of recruiting the Galleys, as the Venetians had desired, for this first
year; and particularly, that the Pope did promise to grant three Tenths yearly
to the Commonwealth, for the space of five years, out of the goods of the
Clergy of the Commonwealth; The whole business was discussed in the Senate,
to the end, that knowing on the one side, what was in agitation at
Constantinople, and the directions which they had given to their Consul, and to
Ragazzoni, touching the treaty of peace; and on the other side, the Pope's
conditions, and what was propounded by the Catholic King, for the conclusion
of the League, they might more maturely resolve either upon war or peace, and
do, what might be thought, would bring most advantage and safety to the
Commonwealth: wherein the Senators differed in their opinions. So as
continuing still in the same ambiguitie, they did not resolve upon any thing.
But such answers were given to Colonna's proposalls, as differing more in
words, then in sense, they stood still upon generalities, without declaring
themselves any ways absolutely, touching the concluding, or laying aside of
this Treaty. Whereupon, whilst the business was one day agitated in the
Senate, Paolo Tiepolo, a Senator of mature judgment, and long versed in the
government of the Commonwealth, though he was not then of the order of the
Savii, whose proper and peculiar charge this uses to be, stood up, and said:

If in what is now before us, the glorious fame were only concerned, which our
Commonwealth has purchased with all men, by her generous resolution taken the
last year, of accepting the war, intimated unto us by the Turks, and of
defending our State against their insolency, I might peradventure be silent,
and look for what the end of these our irresolute counsels might at last
prove; though certainly it is no small loss which befalls a Prince, when his
reputation is lost, wherewith States are no less governed, then by forces. But
since I know, that this our unseasonable delay leads us to ruin, whilst vainly
relying upon far distant, and fallacious treaties of peace, we will bereave our
selves of the assistance of other men's forces, and of our selves only,
withstand the violence of such insolent enemies, I must oppose what is
propounded, and speak my contrary opinion. For I think it very pernicious, to
resolve upon nothing, and to spend our time only in speaking^ for by so doing,
we shall at last be deprived of those helps, which we have for some months past
sought, toward the conclusion of this League, though the Colleagues were not
unwilling to assist us. Most illustrious Senators, I find, that our minds are
rather altered by this deliberation, then the condition of affairs. Did not we
know, that we had to deal with a powerful enemy, when with such zeal and
general consent, we resolved upon this war? when we refused all treaty of
agreement, whereunto we were invited, by the coming of the Chiaus, and readily
entertained the confederacy, which the Pope offered us? Were we not acquainted
with the uncertainty of war, and with the usual difficulties met withal, in
the colleagueing of Princes? Yet since we saw no trust could secure us, from
these barbarous Infidells, whose power and ambition does daily increase; and
that the delaying of war did not free us from danger, but did rather increase
it; for we hoped, that the honesty and justice of our cause, might at last,
after several, both good and bad adventures, prevail, and make us victorious;
since we intended, by our dexterity and patience, to purchase the good will of
other Princes, and making them sensible, that their interests were concerned in
ours, draw them to a real and firm confederacy, that the common cause might be
agitated by joint forces and advice. It was these reasons, and not chance, that
moved our Senate to take up Arms, and to undergo the hasard and expense of war,
and to treat upon the speedy conclusion of the League: And shall we now suffer
the first unfortunate success in war, the first difficulties arising amongst
the confederates, as if all our generousnesse and constancy were past, not
only cool our former fervor, and make us forgo our former resolves, but so
to bereave us of all counsel, as involved in ambiguity, we shall not know what
to pitch upon, which whilst we do not, having neither peace nor league, suffer
all conditions to be uncertain, every thing suspected, and all businesses to go
backward: When if we shall duly consider things, as they are in themselves,
uninvelloped in our own affections, we shall find it evident what we are to do.
For all respects concur in prosecuting, and in stipulating a speedy
confederacy: Advantage and Honor advise unto it; our security is great, and
great the glory which we may hope for thereby. And if there shall ever be a
time to think upon this union, certainly the occasion is now offered us, not
only out of necessity, to oppose the formidable greatness of the Turks, but
by reason of the opportunity we have now to do it. Certainly this is the time,
since we find all Princes, not only willing, but in a posture of power to
undertake it. Who finds not an ardent zeal in the Pope, of exalting
Christianity? Do not all the King of Spain 's actions show, how great a lover
he is of peace, how well content he is with what is his own, and only desirous
to abase the Turkish power, that they may not molest his Dominions, nor
disquiet his peace? It cannot be denied, but that the Emperor is sufficiently
desirous of glory, and of recovering the Kingdom of Hungary, whereof he is for
the greatest part at this time deprived, by these common enemies, which he has
witnessed, by his late taking up Arms against Soliman. And if these do not
readily satisfy our desires, we may be sure, the hinderance proceeds from
necessity, and not from want of goodwill. The Pope's Exchequer is exhausted, he
has been forced to impose taxes upon the Ecclesiastics, to procure money for
this war; nay, by the contribution of Monks in our State; wherefore he must
proceed more reservedly, in granting Tenths, and other aids. The King of Spain
is so oppressed, by the burden of governing so many Dominions, as he must
manage his affairs by the hands of several Ministers, and by the advice of
many, which sometimes retards maturity, and is the reason, why his intentions
are not so easily made known, nor produce not con^ormable effects so soon. The
Emperor has not forces enough of himself, and cannot dispose of the German
forces, without the consent of the Princes and Hans-towns; therefore he is slow
in resolving upon what, both his words and reason shows, he is willing to do.
But certainly, the death of the Transilvanian is luckily happened at this time,
which will necessitate Germany to take up Arms, and to embrace this occasion,
unless she will suffer that Province to fall under the obedience of the Turks,
and thereby increase her dangers. These hindrances then, which arise from
usual difficulties, which are inseparable from such businesses, nay, from all
weighty affairs, ought not to beget difficulties or jealousies in us, nor
alienate us from the friendship of those Princes, in whom we find no ill
toward us, but rather many signs of good-wishes, toward the welfare of our
Commonwealth. Whereunto if we were to be persuaded by no other reason nor
arguments, we cannot certainly fail, if we measure the minds of those Princes,
but by their own interests; wherein, how much the nearer they are concerned in
this war, and in our behalf, we ought to rest the more assured, that they will
not abandon us, and, with us, themselves. Does not the Pope see, that the ruin
of this Commonwealth, would draw along with it the ruin of all Christendom,
and that neither his Court nor he should be secure in Rome? Does not the
Catholic King know, that if Candia, Corfu, and the other Islands be lost,
Cicily and Calabria will be the frontiers against the Turks? that if the enemy
grow stronger by the ruin of others, his danger will be the greater; and that
by how much the forces of this Commonwealth are weakened, the withstanding the
Turkish Fleets will light the more heavy upon him. The Emperor can never be
sure to have his Dominions safe, whilst he has so potent a neighbor; and must
know, that how much the later other Princes are in lending us their assistance,
and how much the less they shall be, we shall be the sooner persuaded to
accept of any agreement; which will be nothing else, but to afford time and
convenience to this Common enemy, to turn his Arms against Hungary, and against
the Empire. Wherefore shall we then admit of doubts, without reason, and let
slip those things which are in our own power, to rely upon what depends upon
the will of others, and chiefly of those, whom we have great reason to suspect,
by reason of their accustomed cunning, and of their late deceits? The
conclusion of the League is certain, the event of the treaty of peace
uncertain. And it may well happen, that the prolonging of our determination,
may cause the League prove doubtful, and our peace be never the surer; by
which, in my opinion, we shall get but little advantage, since it bears with
it, only the bare name, not the quiet nor security of true peace; nor do I
think, that any real peace is at this time to be had, but rather, that these
things are proposed to us by Mehemet, to cheat us, not out of any favor to us;
to the end, that we being lulled asleep by the pleasing name of peace, as by
the Sirens singing, may be less careful in providing for war; and that
through these our vain hopes, the confederacy of Christian Princes be
dissolved, which the Turks do not a little apprehend; and without which
confederacy, they promise unto themselves for certain, the possession of our
Dominions. The Turks are by nature haughty, and now grown more insolent by
their prosperous success in Cyprus; they are always perfidious, always our
enemies: What reason have we to believe, that they desire peace now, and are
real in the propounding thereof? And grant, that the first Bashaw may
perchance desire peace, to lessen Mustafa 's greatness, it is most assured, he
dares not mention it to the grand Signior, but upon severe and unjust terms
for us, left he thereby ruin himself. But say, that these things which reason,
not fear, dictates unto me, prove false; ought this Senate to part from its
ancient and laudable custom, of valuing their word, of proceeding still with
all sincerity, of not doing any thing, which, in the sight of the world may
appear to be not altogether so honest, just, or reasonable? Is it not known to
all men (and say it were not, are not we conscious to our selves) how far this
treaty of confederacy is proceeded in? Now that all our desires are yielded
unto, is not our word engaged? The state of affairs is still the same, we ought
not to be changed. What more of ambiguity remains? What excuse can we make for
this delay? what reason for abandoning, what has already been agreed on?
Really, that which troubles me most, is, to think, that as the repute of
constancy and sincerity in this Senate, has prevailed much with these Princes,
to make them the more readily confederate with us; so in the future, this
inconstancy and double dealing of ours, may so alienate us from the friendship
of all men, as either out of anger, or mistrust, they will suffer us to run
upon our ruin. If peace be treacherous, the League is sincere; the success of
the latter most assured, the event of the former most uncertain; the one may
bring us long and true security, the other frees us from danger only in
appearance, and but for a while. Let this Senate then now resolve, not to busy
it self any longer in such doubts, and not to listen to any thing which shall
be proposed, unless to what may terminate, conclude, and put a final happy
end to this business.

Tiepolo was attentively listened unto, and many signs were seen of adhereing
to his opinion. But Andrea Ba^^ero, a man who bore great sway in the Senate,
and who was one of the Savii Majiori, which party did wholly promote delay,
spoke thus to the contrary.

The repute of wisdom (said he) which this Senate has purchased throughout the
world, is now so looked upon by all men, as, though so many and so important
respects did not concur, a just desire of preserving this honorable
reputation, were able to make the result of this business now in hand,
weighty, difficult, and dubious. A League, and a Peace, with powerful Princes,
are both in hand, at the same time, and to the same end, but by very differing,
nay, by full contrary means: The one and the other of them, may make us hope
for a speedy conclusion, but neither of them, with such honor and security, as
may freely invite us to accept thereof, and may ease us of all trouble. So as
if only one of these were to be discust, it would not be easy what to
resolve; but both of them joined together, affords almost inexplicable
difficulties. Therefore you ought not to wonder (Gentlemen) if in a business
of such importance and dubiousnesse, men be not so clear nor resolute in their
proposalls, and if they seek to be more enlightened by time, and by proceedings,
so as they may be safely led out of so many difficulties; and the rather, for
that we need not fear, that the Spaniards will slacken their provisions, for
any such delay of ours, but will be the more diligent in hastening them, to
encourage us, to repose the more confidence in the forces of the League; and
for that, though they did verily believe, we would lay down Arms, they were to
keep in Arms, since the Turkish forces prepared against us, were likely to fall
upon them. And truly, I see not why, having begun a treaty of Agreement, we
should, without expecting the first answer, so oblige our selves with others,
as it may not be lawful for us to do, what may be thereby offered, toward the
securing of our affairs, since we may be loose by their means, not by any fault
of ours, and peradventure upon better terms. What certainty have we of the
event of this war? what hopes? what likelyhoods, that we should so suddenly
(not to say, so precipitously) determine to continue it long, as if we were
sure of glory and triumph? Past experience may teach us, what good we may
expect from war against the Turks; this Commonwealth has always been
unfortunate, in taking up Arms against them, and has been forced, not without
loss of some Territories, to yield unto their greater forces, and to a certain
Genius of their Empire. But if we have forgot things done long ago, how can we
forget the passages of the last year, which are yet fresh in our memory? And
if we shall consider, in how short a time we lost so many men, and so much
money, not only getting not any thing thereby, but losing a noble City; nay, we
may say, a flourishing Kingdom, how can it be thought a wise advice, which puts
us upon the necessity of continuing that war? The mischiefs we may receive
thereby, are great and certain; our hopes of repairing our selves, small and
uncertain. For, happen what will, war is always accompanied by many miseries;
but is more grievious to this our City, then to any other, since it does in a
manner block up the sea, by which it receives its wealth, and abundance of all
things; and does deprive her of commerce, whereby Arts do therein flourish,
which are one of her chiefest ornaments. For my part, I cannot fancy unto my
self those high conceits, as some do, who know not how to measure the present
condition of affairs, the fortune which attends the enemy, and our weakness
and misfortune; who do not consider the strength of those forces, which do
depend only upon one; and the inconstancy of Leagues, by which never any great
enterprise was achieved, or which could continue long, by reason of the
differing, nay, contrary designs of Princes, by reason of the jealousy of
States, and the suspicion which one Prince has always of another. He who
promises unto himself a better end of this League, then was that of late years
made against Soliman, and who does not believe, that what befell us at Pevesa,
and the difficulties we met with at Castle nuovo, be to be renewed, to our
prejudice and ignominy, thinks that the world will alter, and delights to cheat
himself with vain hopes. But some may be persuaded to be for this League, not
moved thereunto by any hopes, but drawn out of a certain consideration, that
this treaty is already far advanced, so as to withdraw from it now, may taste
of inconstancy, and appear a fault, and that thereby we shall debar our selves
ever hereafter, of the aid of other Princes: To which purpose, I would I could
forget, how other Princes have carried themselves toward us, and how little
they have valued our faith or constancy. How can we forget the confederacy,
broken by Lewis the 12fth, King of France, at the same time that he constantly
affirmed, and solemnly swore, he would never foregoe our friendship; whereof
having once made use to his own advantage, he did not only abandon us, who,
not to forsake him, had with great expense and danger, taken up arms Arms
against the Emperor Maximilian, but did mainly conspire against us, that our
ruin might be the reward of our fidelity. I will say nothing of what followed
afterward; the assistance in appearance, but real oppression, plotted against
us by Ferdinando King of Spain; the so various counsels of Pope Julio the 2d.
and Pope Leo the 10th. sometimes for our good sometimes for our ruin. So as it
behoved us in a short time, to change both friends and enemies, because we
found all confederacy fraudulent. And at last, our forefathers drew our
Commonwealth out of so many calamities, and restored her to her pristine
greatness, rather by knowing how to accommodate themselves to the times, and
by wisdom, then by war. These examples would not, peradventure, be to be
praised, if it were not usual with Princes, to proceed with such ambiguity,
nay often, with such contrariety in their counsels, as they must necessarily
tread in the same steps, who will preserve their Dominions: So as not being
sure, that any respects shall be born to them, they must be pardoned, if they
bear but little respect to others. And it is an assured truth, that those
respects are not to be had, where the common good is treated of, the
preservation of a Commonwealth, or a State, as in private actions. We
therefore ought to regard the treaty of League only so far, as we think it may
make for our good, holding it for a certain truth, that those will deal just so
with us, who now seek to join with us in League, whose proceedings, if we will
observe, shall we not clearly see, that their own private interest is the rule
whereby they walk, in all their designs and actions? And I wish to God, that
this were well understood; they would then know, that their welfare is almost
inseparably annexed to ours. For, whatsoever we shall now do, we may both for
the present, and for the future, promise just so much to our selves from the
assistance of others, as will stand with their own advantage, and according as
times shall fall out. But grant, that so great an esteem should be put upon
that; have we, I beseech you, after the engagement of our word, after the
agreement unto Articles, been faulty in our promises? Have we treated upon
advantageous or abusive terms? Much contestation and difficulties have still
been found in this business; we have no sooner yielded to many things, but
that those obstacles being taken out of the way, others have been raised of
greater importance, and more difficult. Which way of proceeding is such, as
ought rather make us forego such a confederacy, though stipulated, then invite
us to observe it now, when we are at liberty, and that the present accidents
advise us to prolong the time, without further engaging our selves. Is it not
too apparent, that we can make no use of this League, save in show, and by the
vain report of great warlick preparations, but never in reality. The hundred
Galleys, which the Spaniards were bound by Articles to Man, would now be
reduced to fourscore, and the time of their joining with ours, is spoken of
uncertainly; sometimes, the whole month of May is taken for it, sometimes no
determined time. The delay of these assistances, are better expressed by effects,
then by words. The last years orders to Doria, are at first not well
understood, afterward worse observed. The Galleys destined for our present
aid, are to go to Barcellona, to bring away the Emperor's sons, the Bohemian
Princes; and we shall hope to find them at Otranto, according to promise, in
fitting time for our occasions. A greater doubt then this does yet occur to me,
when I call to mind, the Kings Agents pressing so earnestly, that the
business of Algiers should be specified in the confederacy, and then meet with
these difficulties. For we must with reason doubt, that the Spanish forces will
go this first year, for the Rivers of Africa, for their own particular
service, pleading for their excuse, that the League has not sufficient forces,
to send the Fleet into the Levant, against the Enemy; and making use of this
occasion to mind that enterprise, whilst they may be free from fear of the
Turkish Fleet, by the Turks being busied in the action of Cyprus, and by the
counterpoise of our forces at sea. These then will be the aids, these the
forces, these the hopes, wherewith we are to continue the war, maintain
Famagosta, defend Candia, and beat the enemy from the confines of Friuli and
Dalmatia, against which, we hear great store of men are raised. But will our
neighbors forces defend us? or the strong opposite country secure us? The
Archduke Charles, who was so forward in the beginning to defend those passes,
does not he now answer our desires, by saying, He can resolve upon nothing,
without the advice of his brother the Emperor? And the Emperor, seeming not
to believe those rumors, which were first raised by his Agents, does now so
neglect his answer, as I fear, when need shall require, he will neglect his
provisions. But it is alleged, that peace will bring with it but a short and
seeming security, since the Turks may violate it the more easily, when they
shall have opportunity or a desire to do so, when they shall see, they may make
peace when they please, and are sure, their injuries shall not be revenged. I
deny it not: But I say, the condition of these things is such, as it is vain to
persuade our selves, that we, by any thing we can do, can alter their usual
and natural fickleness. Therefore what is said of the peace which we are now
in hand with, with the Turks, may be said, of whatsoever other agreement, made
with any other Princes, which is easily broken by several accidents; nor will
there be pretenses of injuries wanting, when men are pleased to take them, and
they are easily made to do so, by the hope of aggrandizing and accommodating
themselves. Wherefore we see, friendship lasts but a while amongst Princes, and
the lesser while, by how much they are the more powerful, and nearer
neighbors. But howsoever, you will say, we must not forbear to use Treaties
oftener then Arms; nor must we refuse a short quiet, because we cannot enjoy a
perpetual tranquillity. There is at least thus much good in peace, as it
secures us from present labors and dangers; and this ill in Leagues, as they,
upon uncertain hopes, expose us to certain expense, and to great dangers; so as
we hasten those evils by these means, which we seek to shun. It has therefore
been the constant purpose of this Senate, for these many years, to do any
thing, whereby the friendship of the Turks might be preserved; and yet there
was not any one that did doubt, when war was resolved on, that such a
confederacy as this which is now proposed, might be had; but all confessed,
that little good was to be hoped for by it, because it was known, that it was
dangerous for us to suffer the Turks greatness to increase so much; this
remedy of a League was not thought very fitting for it, and not to be used, but
upon great necessity, as was now done, when we despaired to allay Selino 's
fury, in the height of his anger. What is now to be done, when we see the
State of affairs somewhat altered, but to temporise with the enemy, whom we
cannot suppress, to make him jealous by this treaty of League, to sweeten him
with a treaty of peace, to keep several ways open, and to follow that, which
time and affairs will show us, shall be most for our good, and as God shall
inspire us to do, for the preservation of our Commonwealth.

These words wrought variously upon the Senate, so as they remained still in
the same irresolution, but most of them being inclined toward the League;
whereunto they were much persuaded, for fear of some scandalls that might be
imputed to them, of inconstancy, for having so soon altered their minds, as if
they were mated by the first misfortunes of war. The question was put, and
carried by many voices, of sending to their Ambassadors which were at Rome, to
stipulate the League, which was the sense of the answer which they gave to
Colonna, who presently after returned to Rome; where the Pope hearing of this
determination, made the Catholic King's Ambassador, and those of the
Commonwealth, be publicly brought into the Consistory, and making what they
had agreed upon be readd by the Datory, he, laying his hand upon his breast,
was the first that swore to observe those capitulations: wherein he was
followed by Paceco, in the name of the Catholic King, Gravella being gone for
Naples; and then the King's Ambassador, and those of the Commonwealth, took
the same oath upon a Masse-book; and the next day, though the
Venetian-Embassadours were against it, saying, That in point of honor, any
such declaration should be deferred, till that Caesar might have notice thereof,
and his pleasure therein might be more expressly known* the Pope, a solemn Mass
being only said, and a Procession made in St. Peter's Church, would have the
League published, whereof these were the particular Articles. That a perpetual
League should be made between Pius the 5th. ( who engaged himself for the
Apostolic See, and for his Successors, by the consent of the College of
Cardinals) and Philip the Catholic King, and the Duke and Senate of Venice;
to abate the power of the Turks, who had lately by force of Arms assaulted the
Kingdom of Cyprus, which lay very fitting, for the enterprise of the holy Land.
That the Colleagues forces should consist of 200 Galleys, 100 Ships, 50000
Foot, Italians, Spanish, and Dutch; 4500 Horse, with a suitable train of
Artillery and Ammunition; which were to be employed, as well in defense of the
associate Princes Dominions, as in opposing the Enemy, particularly in the
enterprises of Algiers, Tripoli, and Tunis. That these forces should meet at
Otranto in May next, or in the beginning of April, so to paste into the
Levant, and proceed against the Enemy as time should advise, and as the
Commanders should think fit. That notwithstanding, these things might be
altered, the provisions of war be increased or diminished, according as the
need or conditions of the enterprises should require, which they were intended
for; which was every year to be consulted upon, and determined at Rome, in the
Autumn. And that if it should be resolved, not to undertake any common
enterprise that year, it might then be lawful for any of the Associates, to
mind their own particular affairs; chiefly the King of Spain, those of
Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli; in which case, if no great Turkish Fleet should be
abroad, the Venetians should be obliged to furnish the King with 50 Galleys,
and the King was bound to do as much for the Venetians, if they should attempt
any thing against the common enemy, within their Gulf: Provided always, that
those who would have any such assistance, should first have greater forces in
readiness. That all the confederates should be bound reciprocally, to defend
each others Dominions, which should be assaulted by the Turks, and particularly
all places belonging to the Church; in which case, they were to give over all
enterprises, that were begun against the Turks. That the King was to contribute
the full half of all the expenses of the war, and that the other half being
divided into three parts, the Venetians should defray two parts, and the Pope
the third, who not being able to contribute so much of himself, the other
confederates should make good what was wanting of that Proportion, of three
parts whereof, the King was to pay two, and the Venetians one; who moreover
should be particularly obliged to give the Pope 12 Galleys, furnished with
tackling and Artillery, which the Pope was to man for the service of the
League; but that generally every confederate should be bound to contribute such
things for the common cause, as he should most abound in, and the others want,
which should be regulated in the accounts according to the aforesaid
proportion; That the exportation of Corn should always be open in all places,
with a limited tax for the carrying out; and that they should be extracted from
such place or places, as lay fittest for the occasion; their needs being first
satisfied who were to give way thereunto, that in all consultations, and
deliberations, the Commanders in chief of the three Confederates were to
intervene, and what the most should determine, should be firmly concluded: but
the execution of what should be resolved on, should remain in him who should be
declared Captain-Generall of the League, which should be Don John of Austria,
and in his absence, Mark Antonio Colonna, with the like Authority, though he
should at the same time retain the name and quality of General of the Church.
That it might be lawful for Maximilian of Austria, the Emperor Elect, for the
King of France, and for the King of Portugal, to join in this Confederacy; and
that all the Colleagues should use their uttermost endeavors to persuade them,
and the other Christian Princes to do so. And in case of addition of any other
Confedederates, it was to be understood, that what proportion of expense they
should be at, should go to the augmenting of the Forces of the League. No
particular mention was made of dividing such places as should be gotten; but it
was referred to what was expressed and declared in the Articles of the League, in
the year 37, if any difference should fall out between the Confederates, the
Pope should be the Arbitrator and Judge: so as that should be no breach of the
Confederacy, nor any impediment in the execution of what was established
therein.

These Articles being sworn unto, as has been said, and afterward signed and
sealed by the Ambassadors, were ratified by the same Princes within the
appointed four months. But because the Confederates were not bound to the
observancy of these things till the next year: there was another writing
stipulated apart, wherein these things were particularly contained, which were
to be done this year; to wit, That 80 Galleys, and 20 Ships, ought to be at
Ottranto by the month of May, to join with the Venetian Fleet: Those of the
Pope, Savoy, nor Malta, not being therein comprehended: And because a
difficulty arose, touching the satisfaction to be given to the Venetians,
toward the expenses pretended unto for having more Galleys, than by the
covenant they were bound unto: It was declared in the same writing, that the
Pope was to be judge thereof, who was notwithstanding to determine
particularly, that their debt being known, it should be made good out of what
they ought, or should owe to the King of Spain for Corn, either formerly had,
or to be had hereafter, the price whereof should be rated by the Pope; who took
upon him likewise, though it was not expressly mentioned in the Writing, to
determine what satisfaction should be given to the Venetians, for their
pretenses of charge for great numbers of Foot which they maintained in his
Sea-Forts, more then the Garrisons of those places, to make use of them either
in the Fleet, or otherwise against the enemy as occasion shall serve.

At the same time that these Treaties of League and Peace were discussing in
Venice, wherein there was some difference in opinions, they all agreed, and
were very diligent in providing for war: It was resolved, that 25 Galleys
should be set out, which should have for their Governors Venetian Gentlemen,
not only of the Venetian Nobles, but many of those of the Cities of Terra
Ferma, to the end that in the common cause, all might be partakers as well of
honors, as of dangers and troubles, and because their greatest want was of
men, by reason of the great mortality, and the apprehension which was had
thereof; safe conduct was granted to the Banditi of the Commonwealth, to come
and serve in the Galleys, either as Mariners, or Soldiers; and all Gentlemen
of the Country, who would come willingly to that service, were exempted from
any personal penalties for four years. 2000 to serve in Galleys, were likewise
ordered from the Cities of the Terra Ferma, though this tax was formerly wont
to be laid only upon the Country. Soldiers were also brought from foreign
parts, to recruit the Sea Garrisons, and for the service of the Fleet. And that
nothing might be wanting to try the fortune of war again, a new General being
already chosen, as has been said, they would also change the two Commissaries.
Quirini, Captain of the Gulf, was chosen in the place of Celsi, and Trono,
Captain of the Ships in Canale's place. But he dying at the same time, Canale
continued in his place, and Quirini was succeeded in his place of Captain of
the Gulf, by Trono, who was then in the Fleet. Iovanni Ven^ramini, and Iov.
Contarini, were afterward made purveyors, who were to have particular care of
the public Moneys, and of all that was to be delivered out in the Fleet. This
mean while, Commissary Barbarigo, having made haste from Venice, was come to
Corfu, where the Fleet then was, as has been said; to whom according to the
order of the Senate, the Government was assigned over by General Zanne. But he
held it but for a few days; for Veniero hearing whilst he was in Candia, of
his election, left such orders as he thought convenient for the arming of the
Galleys of that Island, and suddenly began his journey; and coming to Corfu in
the beginning of April, took solemnly the place and dignity of General upon
him. When General Zanne returned to Venice, there were many faults laid to his
charge; and, as it often falls out upon such occasions, the cause of the bad
successes, occasioned for the most part from bad seasons, and for many almost
inseparable accidents, were attributed to his negligence, and want of
experience: and whereas a kind of happy Genius had formerly made all his
actions be commended and admired, whereby it was thought that the public
affairs recommended to his charge, should have good success, as he was thought
to have been very fortunate in his private condition, by reason of his Honor,
wealth, and Children, and for that he had twice before been General, and so
succesfull therein, as all troubles and dangers ceased as it were with his
election; so now these so many adversities, were taken from off the public
score, and laid to his private misfortune. Being thus accused of these faults,
he dyed two years after, before he could justify himself, proving the saying
true; that, No man can be said to be happy before his end.

The affairs of Cyprus, and preservation of Famagosta, whereupon the hopes of
other events did depend, were not at this time forgotten, but as soon as the
season would permit, Antonio Quirini, who being taken from the Government of
Candia, had this charge committed to him, after Pietro Trono's decease,
departed with four Ships to carry the succor formerly ordered for Famagosta.
Which that it might the more safely arrive, 12 Galleys were given for a convoy
to the ships; for it was heard, that the Turks lay with some Galleys about the
Island, to hinder the supply. Marco Quirini, went with his Admiral along with
this Convoy, who, to boot with guarding the succor, had the opportunity of
doing an honorable action; for as he came to Famagosta, he made the Ships
advance within sight of the Enemy, who were in Costanza, and lay with his
Galleys concealed near Land: and seeing seven of the Enemies Galleys come forth
to assault our Ships, he suddenly came behind them, to keep them from
returning back unto the shore. But the Turks, when they saw our Galleys,
instead of indangering us, sought to save themselves, and to get to the shore
whence they were come: so as the men, to whose assistance many were come from
the Camp, got safe to Land, and abandoned their Galleys; three whereof, having
but few men left in them, were sunk by our shot: the rest, which were gotten a
little further off, escaped. For some signs of foul weather appearing, Quirini
betook himself to get his ships to be towde into the Haven; whereinto when
they were gotten, they might easily Land the supply, which consisted of 1600
Foot, and much Ammunition and Victuals. The addition of these Forces, and the
rest of the recruit, did much comfort the defendants, and encourage them; and
Marco Quirini his gallantry was mightily cried up by all the Famagostans; and
he purchased much more praise and reputation by other prosperous successes; for
whilst he kept in that Haven he took a Ship, and other lesser Vessels of the
Enemies, loaded with Ammunition and Victuals, which were going to the Army,
which were very seasonably turned to the service of the besieged. And going with
his Galleys not long after to shelves of Gam^ella, where he heard the Turks had
made some Forts, he at unawares fell upon them, and destroyed them: which
things being done, he thought he could do no more good by his tarrying any
longer there, and therefore returned with his Galleys to Candia. The Senators
were not less solicitous this mean while, in providing new supply for
Famagosta, whither they had sent two Ships with 800 Foot, and several
Ammunitions, which by relation of the Bishop of Ragozzoni, the besieged wanted.
Honorio Scoto, was made Commander of the Soldiers, and Nicolo Donato had
charge of the Ships, who being come a little before from Cyprus, upon the
occasion that has been mentioned, offered to return himself with that
succor, (for which he was much commended) and to comfort those that were to
undergo so sore a siege; the Senate, thought fit to wite Letters of praise, and
much affection to the communalty of Famagosta* telling them, That they were
very well pleased with their constancy and fidelity, which they would never
forget, but reward them for it, when the times should prove better; and that
largely for their labors, loss, and dangers; wishing them therefore to
discharge their duties, in the defense of themselves and families, reposing
their hopes of safety in themselves, and in the assistance of their Prince, and
not in the words of barbarous Infidels: for the Senate would mind nothing
more, than to provide for all things which should be necessary for that their
dear and faithful City: And that the so many Fleets, so many Soldiers, such
expense, and such warlike preparations, aimed chiefly at the freeing of them
from that siedge. Letters of almost the same contents, were likewise written to
Baglione, exalting his valor, as worthy of those he was descended from, and of
the affection which he and others of his Progenitors had always born to the
Commonwealth, promising him rewards answerable to his merit, and assistance
proportionable to the Forces of the Enemy.

The Albaneses continued at this time in insurrection, many of Dugagini,
Pedana, Ematia, and Sadrinia, came in daily to make several offers to the
Representatives of the Commonwealth: Wherefore Commissary Celsi was ordered to
go to Cataro (whither Za^cheria Salamone was gone before, with the Title of
Commissary-Generall) to defend the City, and to advise of what was to be done
in those parts: but Celsi falling sick by the way, Nicola Suriano, who was left
Vice-Captain in the Gulf, whilst Trono exercised the same office further off
at Sea, received orders to enter the River of ^oiana with four Galies, to
foment the Insurrection of those people, and to inform himself more
particularly upon the place, whether there was any hopes of good to be done in
the enterprises of Burazzo, Beutari, or Alessio, as was propounded and desired
by the heads of the Albanesi. But Suriano having tarried awhile in those parts,
found that effects were not answerable to words; and that no design could be
had by such commotions upon the Towns of the Enemy, but with great uncertainty
of success. Yet that they might not be wanting upon any occasion that should
be offered, the Senate had made Iacopo Malatesta, Governour-Generall in
Albania, who going to Cataro, began forthwith to make several proposals, and it
was at last resolved to fall upon Alessio, which was thought to be more
feasible then the rest, by reason of situation, there being many strong passes
there, which might hinder the Enemy from being succord. But whilst things
necessary for this purpose were a preparing, Malatesta being impatient of lying
long idle, went one day out of Cataro, to pillage some Towns of Risano, which
were not far off; and having overcome the difficulties of the situation, burnt
the Villages, and gotten much booty, as he was returning safe with all his men,
through a valley, the Enemy fell upon him, and not being able to defend
himself, by reason of the disadvantagiousnesse of the place, he was much
endammaged, not only by musket shot, but by stones, so as almost all his
soldiers ran away; and whilst he, with some few of his men, withstood the fury
of the enemy, who came down from the mountains, his leg was broken with a
stone, and he was carried away prisoner into Risano by the enemy. But Almoro
Tiepolo* Captain of the Pinnaces, and Astore Viseconte, Governor of Sebenico,
had better success in Dalmatia; for having assaulted the Town of Scardona,
they made the enemy seek their safety by flight, so as our men had leisure, not
only to take the Town, but also to get great booty in the neighboring
Country. The Turks ceased not this mean while, to plot all the mischief they
could against the Commonwealth; those of Castelnuovo had held secret
intelligence with Trojano Ciciliano, a Foot-Captain in Cataro, that upon their
coming at unawares to the City, by his means, they might get in by the Porta
della Fiumara, where the walls were weakest. But Ciciliano not being able to
procure, that that Guard might be committed to him, out of another respect, for
that treachery was not as yet discovered, the Turks sailed in that their
design; and when the intelligence was known, the traitor was put to death. The
enemy afterward had other attempts upon that City, making some Forts in the
mouth of the Gulf, whereby being able to keep out any vessels from entering
thereinto, Cataro was in a manner besieged, and was in great danger of being
taken: Wherefore it behoved to send some Galleys, to disturb those works, and
to keep navigation open. These things made the Venetians be very vigilant, in
keeping Commanders of authority, and strong Garrisons in their sea-Forts. Thus
Savorgnano, not being able to serve any longer at Zara, the Marquis Baltasar
Rangone was put in his place; and Iacopo Foscarini was made Commissary General
of Dalmatia. Luigi Georgio went to Corfu, and Marino de Cavalli to Candia; the
former in the place of Venier^, who was chosen to be General of the Fleet; and
the latter in Mula's place, who could no longer attend that charge, by reason
of sickness. By reason of these extraordinary expenses, which amounted to
300000 Ducats a month, it became them to use all means possible, for the
raising of moneys: wherefore the number of Procurators were again increased,
sale was made of other public goods, and moneys by several bargains brought
into the Exchequer; wherein, to make the Citisens more willing and ready, Doge
Mocinego encouraged them all he could, and was still the more careful and
diligent, in making all sorts of provisions, as being very ambitious of glory.
He was much afflicted, that his government should begin with the loss of so
noble a Kingdom. Wherefore the great Council being one day assembled, the Doge
standing up, spoke thus.

If ever citisens of any Commonwealth had a noble occasion to show their
generosity, their desire of glory, and of the common good, you now have it, to
show your worth, in preserving the splendor and dignity of this your noble
Country, which the industry and perpetual labors of our Ancestors, has to
their immortal glory purchased. We, through their deserts, and as the reward
of their wisdom, do now enjoy a Commonwealth, which for excellency of
government, exceeds all the most ancient and modern Commonwealths, and is not
much inferior to any of the famousest, for Forces and Empire. And since the
condition of times and place will not permit, that greater perfection can be
added to it, in civil affairs, nor perhaps, that her ancient glory may be
increased by military actions, by enlarging our confines, which are every where
environed by powerful neighbors; yet ought we with like endeavor and
vigilance, mind the preservation of so miraculous a work, recommended to our
care, to the end, that we may leave it such to others, as we have received it
from our forefathers, whereby we shall purchase no small praise. We being now
to govern our selves in a heavy war, against the fury of so powerful an enemy,
whose forces I confess are to be feared, but with wisdom, not pusillanimity;
but so, as fear may make us more diligent, more joint, constant, and firm in
all labor and danger, and not to slacken that fervor, wherewith we undertook
the war: nor to take us off, from our noble and generous resolution, of
defending our Dominions, against the unjust forces of those, that seek to
oppress them. Let us call to mind, with how much praise and wonder to other
Nations, our fathers and grandfathers withstood the violence, of almost all the
Princes of Christendom, who jointly conspired the ruin of our Empire; so as
finally by their worth, the fortune of the vanquishing enemy was overcome, and
by adversity, the Commonwealth wone more glory and honor. And if the loss of
all our Dominions by Terra Ferma, the having so many, and so potent enemies,
and so near at hand, could not prevail over our noble Ancestors; certainly, if
we will imitate their domestic worth, the first frowns of fortune will not at
all prevail over us, nor not only not discourage us, but not make us forego
any thing of our former hopes. The loss of Nicossia is assuredly very sore,
but not such as may not be repaired. The fortune of war at first, is very
uncertain and various; but at last, she associates with true worth; and the
most valiant are at the last the most glorious. Our forces (God be praised) are
yet safe and entire, and such, as had it not been for want of diligence, and
good advice in our Commanders; or, it may be, for want of better fortune, the
enemies might have had no cause to rejoice. Our Commonwealth could at one and
the same time, make war in several Countries; nor did her being assaulted by
Bajazet, Prince of the Turks, make her lay down the Arms which she had taken
up, against Lodowick Sforza, Duke of Millan: fighting on the one side for their
own defense and safety; on the other, for the honor of the Venetian name, and
out of a desire of making new acquisitions. Nor are these things so far out of
our memory, as that we not rather say, we have seen them, than heard of them.
We may hope for these, and greater things, if there be in us the like worth,
agreement, and readiness to maintain and defend the public safety and
dignity. Wherefore though we may assure our selves, that all other Christian
Princes will, for their own interests, favor and assist our cause, against the
common enemy, who is now become so formidable to them all; yet we must repose
our chiefest defense in our selves, constantly believing, that every ones
particular good is inseparably annexed, to the preservation of the liberty and
prosperity of this Commonwealth; which being safe and powerful, whatsoever
else is most dear unto us, wives, children, friends, and goods, will be the
more safely preserved from injuries, and we shall have great rewards of
honors, and many other things reserved for us. Therefore as the charity we
bear to our Country comprehends all other loves to whatsoever we esteem
dearest; so he who is truly set on fire therewithal, knows no danger, shuns no
inconvenience, values no expense, but freely sacrifices himself, and all that
is his, to this his true Mother and Nurse, from whence he must acknowledge, he
has received all things. Then you, Gentlemen, who have still agreed in all
things else, must v^^ and contend only in this generous emulation, who shall
contribute most, and readilie^^, to the service of this his Country, in this
her so great necessity. Let those, who for their age, or experience in the
Militia, or Sea-affairs, are able to serve in person, either by way of command,
or as private persons, put themselves into the Fleet; and such as are fitter
for counsel, let them busy themselves, in thinking upon, in minding, and in
providing for all such things, as may secure the present dangers, and may make
way for better fortune. In this, the thoughts of all true Venetians ought to be
busied; this ought to be the true, and only ^ime and end of all their
discourses and actions, in these so dangerous times. But above all things, let
every man, according to his ability, contribute moneys to the Commonwealth,
which is the very ^inews of war; assuring himself, he can put it forth to no
better advantage; the little that he lays out hereupon, preserves all the
rest, not only his estate, but his honor, children, and life; none of which
will be safe from the injuries, of the insolent victorious enemy; nor can any
thing be dear or delightful to him, the prosperity and pristine greatness of
this city being les^. We see, how wonderful readily, no^ only th^se who live
under the wings and protection of this Dominion, who may be persuaded to
endeavor the preservation of this Commonwealth, out of a desire of living
quiet, and under a moderate government, but many other persons of honor, have
come to serve in this war, from almost all the parts of Italy, and from foreign
parts; making our cause theirs, and concurring with us in expense and danger,
to the end, that this, the glory of Italy, and bulwork of Christendom, (as our
Commonwealth is, by all, reputed to be) may be preserved: Which, as it ought
to rejoice us, and make us thankful, so ought we not by any means suffer our
selves to be outdone by others, in the defense of ourselves, and of our
Commonwealth; but show unto the world, that this city exceeds not others more
in fortune, than in worthy Citisens. Briefly, Gentlemen, we must always have
an eye to the condition of these times, and of this war, which is such, as if
we do but never so little give way unto the Enemy, or s^acken necessary
provisions, we shall not only leave the Kingdom of Cyprus open to him, to be
made a prey of, but all our Dominions by sea, will be exposed to manifest
danger; the grandeur of this Commonwealth, the principality of the sea, which
has with so much labor been for many ages gotten by our Ancestors, will be
lo^^ to the discretion of bitter and powerful enemies. Whereas, on the
contrary, we may through (...) diligence, constancy, and gallantry, hope for
much better things; and, by valiantly withstanding and repulsing the violence
of thi^ fierce enemy, purchase unto our selves much glory and honor* Who
knows, but that this war may prove the exaltation of this Commonwealth, and
of Christendom, and the confusion of the Ottaman Empire? I do despair, but that
a general League may be made by all Christian Princes, whereof the treaty is
already drawn near to a conclusion with (...). If by these forces, and Gods
assistance, our Fleets shall have got the better of these enemies, who are
grown so powerful, more through our home-discords, then by their own valor;
will not the way be opened to their ruin? What may not we hope for, of
prosperous or happy? All our fears and hopes, as also our bad and good fortune,
do for the most part depend upon our selves; who, by change of behavior, may
work a change of fortune. He who does not justly consider these things, who
apprehends not these dangers, who is not cheered by these hopes, deserves not
to be called a Citisen of this illustrious Country, is no man, nor lives not;
since he is not sensible of so many offenses, is not awakened at his own
safety, nor minds not his own good.

These the Doge's words, which were attentively listened unto by all, made great
impression in all noble minds, and encouraged them to continue the war, and to
provide for all things necessary thereunto. Each enheartned other, lessening
the past losses and misfortunes, and comforting each other with hopes of better
success. One showed the necessity of defending themselves, for the maintaining
of the Commonwealth, and public dignity. An other more highly minded, aspired
at greater matters, and to take a double revenge of the enemy, as well for
injuries received, as by becoming Master of their Dominions. All things
requisite, either for Navall preparation, for victuals or moneys, were
diligently taken into consideration. No pains, industry, nor cost was spared,
in muniting the Forts, in recruiting the Fleet, and in adding thereunto forces
sufficient to withstand, and to assault the Enemy. All hopes, thoughts, and
designs, were now busied about Arm^; no more talk of treaties of peace.

But whilst the Venetians were doing these things, the Turks were as solicitous
in providing for war, that they might pursue their prosperous fortune. Selino
was very much gladded, at the news of Nicossia's being taken, which, together
with many other presents, in token of victory, was brought unto him by a son of
Mustafa's; Mustafa's valor being highly esteemed by Selino, he was very ready
to furnish him with new men, and with all other things necessary, to perfect
the enterprise; wherein the Turks were more diligent, because they heard great
fame of the Christian Fleets; yet did it cause no fear in that proud Barbarian,
but did the more incense him; so as, not satisfied with the getting of the
Kingdom of Cyprus, he threatened to beat the Christian Fleets, and to reduce the
other Islands and places, belonging to the Venetians, under his power, which
lay very convenient (as he said) for the making himself Master of Rome, the
head of the Roman Empire, which did belong unto him, as supreme Emperor, and
which, as was foretold by their Prophet, should fall under the Dominion of the
Ottamans. Selino abounding in these vast imaginations, (...) unto himself, that
when his Fleet should have carried sufficient succor to Cyprus, it should
fight ours, and fall upon such other enterprises, as they should see occasion
for. Thus valuing his power the more, by his prosperous success in Cyprus, he
was highly offended with Pioli, for not going the preceding year into the
Gulf, to find out the Venetian Fleet, and fight it; and his fault being
aggravated by Mehemet, who said, he had forborne doing so, out of fear, and that
thereby he had much lessened the reputation of the forces of the Empire, and
not without some danger, leaving all the Maritime places, as it were, in prey
to the Christians, Piali was degraded from being Bashaw, and Pertau was chosen
in his place, who was to have the same authority in the Fleet. In order to
these designs, twenty Galleys put to sea from Constantinople, very early in
the year, under the command of Caiaceleli, who meeting by the way with the
Galleys of Schio and Rhodes, went along with them toward Cyprus, to hinder the
relief which went to Famagosta, and did so; for Nicolo Donato being gone with
the ships of succor from Candia, which Island he had touched upon, to learn
some news of the enemy, he was forced by a violent storm, which had shreudly
torn his ships, to steer his course backwards, and to return again to that
Island, to provide himself of many things which he wanted; where he heard, that
some Turkish Galleys lay in wait about Cyprus, to hinder the succor: wherefore
thinking it became him, to take some new advice touching his voyage, he desired
the opinion of Cavalli, Commissary of the Island, and of Commissary Quirini;
and finding them to agree, he staid in Candia, where he landed his soldiers,
and distributed them into the Forts, to augment those Garrisons; it being
judged, that if the ships should be sent without a convoy of galleys, they
would incur certain ruin, from which they could not be secured by a few
galleys, those of the enemies being many; nor were those of Candia fit to make
such a voyage; or, had they been fit, it was thought, it would not be wisely
done, totally to deprive that Island of the guard of those galleys, wherein
there were as then but a few soldiers; and when it was noised abroad, that the
enemies were very near, and did intend to assault it.

After these first Galleys were gone from Constantinope, Ali went from thence
also with 30 others to Fenica to take up men, and from thence went to Cyprus,
where he tarryed for many days himself, and sent his Galleys the mean while
to Tripoli, to take in more Soldiers, and Ammunition; and when the Army was
provided of all things, Ali, leaving Arum^t with 20 Galleys, ten Mahouns, five
Ships, and many other Vessels to guard the Island, went with 54 Galleys to find
out Bashaw Pertau, who being gone from Constantinople before, and meeting by
the way with the Galleys of Napoli and Metelino, was come with about 100
Galleys to Castle Ruzzo, where the whole Fleet was to make their Rendevouz. Not
long after, Uluzzali, who was gone from Algiers, came to the same place with 20
Vessels, and with many others belonging to particular Pirates; and last of all
Cessan, Son to Barbarossa, came thither with 20 Galleys which had been
battered, and were now new Calkt. The Turkish Fleet being thus all met
together, which consisted of about 250 sail, they went to the Island of Candia,
whither being come, they entered the Haven of Suda, and going soon after toward
Cania, they landed many men not far from the City, who burnt diverse Villages,
and made much prey of beasts, and other goods; for the Inhabitants were all
fled either to the City, or to the Mountains. The Commissary of Cania sent
forth a good Band of the Garrison of that Fort; and with them many of Quirini's
Soldiers, out of his Galleys which were then in that Haven, to suppress the
insolency of these Men, and to prevent further mischief, who made the Enemy to
retreat; and our Soldiers being afterward recruited with 300 Corsick foot, who
were very opportunely come thither a little before, in a ship of Genua, under
the conduct of Colonel Iustiniano, they pursued the Turks; who as they
retreated toward the Galleys to save themselves, were many of them slain, and
durst not accost the Fort, knowing that it was well manned: but they had a great
mind to have pillaged the whole Island, and the Maritime parts, had they not
been diverted by foul weather. Uluzzali forbear not, notwithanding to go to
Rethimo with 40 Galleys, in which City, (for all the rest were fled at the news
of the approach of the Turkish Fleet, not having sufficient Garrisons to defend
themselves) there was none left but Ierolimo Iustiniano, one of the
Counselors, and Captain Ieraldo Alfieri, with 100 foot, who as the Enemy drew
near the City, began to shoot apace at their Galleys, not without somewhat
indamaging them; whereupon the Enemy thinking that there were men enough in the
Town able to defend it, they departed for that time, without making any further
attempt. But afterward landing some men on the neighboring shores, and taking
some Prisoners, they understond by them, that the City had not men enough
within to defend it: So as Uluzzali resolved to return thither, as to a secure
prey. Iustiniano seeing the Enemy returned, and landed, with a full resolution
to assault the City, was forced to abandon it, and to retire into the
neighboring Mountains, to save those few Soldiers; and with them, and some
others that he had picked up in the Country, he betook himself to guard the
strongest passes, to the end that the Enemy might not get further in to do
more mischief. When the Turks were entered the City void of Inhabitants, it is a
sad thing to say the cruelties which they used to that miserable Town; they
plundered the Houses, ransackt the Churches, fired both public and private
Edifices, did not pardon the quiet of the dead, but digging up the graves,
scattered them up and down every where, moved thereunto either out of hopes of
finding some Moneys there, or by that natural inhumanity of dealing with the
dead, as they could not do with the living: For which wickedness they did in
some sort pay, for some of their Galleys were by a great tempest driven upon
the shore, where together with the death of many, they were split; and many
others, who out of a desire of pillage, were gotten further into the Island,
were cut in pieces by the Soldiers, who were gotten out of Cania, and by the
Country people, who came down from the Mountains: So as upon mustering their
men at their departure, they found above 2000 missing. The Enemies being gone
from Candia, went to Cerigo, where they did much harm, and from thence the
whole Fleet past to Giunco, and went to the Islands of Zante and Cefalonia,
burning all the Towns, and laying the Countries waste, all the Inhabitants
being withdrawn into Forts.

Whilst the Turks did this mean while diligently attend their business at Sea,
they forgot not their Land affairs; for they had assembled together an Army
numerous enough, and made Acmat Bashaw Captain thereof, who being gone with his
men from Constantinople, and keeping awhile in Scopio, made men doubtful
whether he was to go for Dalmatia, or for Transylvania; the times being such,
as there was reason to suspect either of them: but soon after, Acmat marched
toward Ducagini, with above 15000 Horse; and it was known, that the Belgerbie
of Greece, raised many Horse to join with Acmats Army, which made it be
believed, that these men were intended against the Venetians Dominions; and
chiefly, since the Fleet was seen to advance so far, which being assisted by
the Land forces, it was thought that the Turks intended to attempt jointly
somewhat in the Gulf. These things being first designed by the Turks, were the
more hotly pursued, for that all Agreement grew desperate, and all treaty of
Peace was broken. For when Ragazzoni was come to Constantinople, it was known
that the hopes had much prejudiced this business; that if the Venetians would
prosecute the Treaty, it might be brought to a good end, the Turks having begun
to hope they might attain those things by agreement, which were not to be had
without doubt, and difficulty, by Arms. For before Ragazzoni came to
Constantinople, a messenger was come thither, sent in great haste by the
Sangiacco of Chersego, Son to Mehemet, which gave notice of the others coming,
with certain intelligence that he brought orders for a treaty of Peace; which
as it caused much joy, so did fill it men with immoderate hopes. So as the
Bashaw entering upon this Treaty, did in a magnificent manner extol the
Ottaman Forces. He said, that Selino was heinously offended* that he had mighty
designs against the Commonwealth, the which he prepared to assault with
powerful Forces, both by Sea and Land; and out of these discourses he took
occasion to propose unreasonable conditions of Peace: but yet proceeding very
cunningly therein, he sought to moderate the severity of what he related in
Selino's name, by his own endeavors full of humanity and affection. In fine,
he advised the Consul, to counsel his Senators, to deliver up the possession
of Cyprus freely, as that which did justly belong to the Ottaman Empire, and
which lay more convenient for the other Ottaman Dominions; and that if it
should be laid waste, it would be of great expense, and of no advantage to the
possessors.

By which words, the Consul perceiving plainly, that there was no hopes of
proceeding in the treaty of Peace with any public honor, or with hopes of
bringing it to any acceptable conditions, thought it fit that Ragazzoni should
depart from Constantinople, as he did: the Treaty in hand, which was formerly
begun by him with great hopes, nay brought to a conclusion, of restoring the
Merchants and their goods, being left imperfect; for when commands were already
agreed upon, and given out to be sent to Soria, and Alexandria, it was found
that through ill offices done with the Grand Signor, his mind was altered, who
had always been very forward therein, saying often, that it was no more then
just; And therefore what had been before concluded, and established, being
again called in question, other proposalls were made; to wit, That the men and
Merchants of all sides, should be brought to Ragugi, or at least to Zara, where
the exchange should be made, that the resolution of the Turkish subjects might
be the better known. But this proving a business of length and difficulty, and
Hebraino dying unluckily at this time, who had the management of this
business, Ragazzoni's journey proved to no purpose. At which time, General
Veniero, that he might not be altogether idle, went with the Galleys that were
then at Corfu, to the shores of Albania, to relieve the Castle of Sopoto, a
place very fit (as has been said) for other acquisitions. And the Fleet being
entered into the Haven of Palormo, he might easily land the Garrison, which
being done, he past on to the Gulf of Vallona, where hearing that the Fort of
Durazzo was very weak, and ill manned, he went thither, hoping easily to gain
it. The whole Fleet, when it came before the For^, was divided into three
squadrons, commanded by three Chieftains, Veniero, the Commissary-Generall; and
the Commissaries, Quirino and Canale. The battery was at once begun on three
parts, for so long a space of wall as contained one whole curtain, and two
great Towers; against which, finding they could no good, though they were
frequently played upon by great Guns from all the Galleys: our men wanting
Ammunition, and having but a few foot to give an assault, dispaired of
accomplishing that enterprise, wherein their fortune had been no better than
their advice had been; for they found the Town stronger, and better manned then
they were persuaded; and not knowing the situation, they left the Enemy some
passes open, which they easily might have hindered, whereby new Garrisons past
in afterward, so as our men were forced to depart, without having done any
thing. The Fleet being returned to Corfu, they betook themselves to relieve la
Parga, and the charge thereof was given to Paolo Orsino, though he was not much
for the business, considering that it was hard to secure that Town, which
might be played upon both by Sea and Land; and that it would be unseasonable to
weaken the Garrisons of Corfu at this time. Yet the desire of replacing those
men in their own Houses, who were very affectionate to the Venetians, and a
very fitting means to make their Neighbors the Albineses rise, prevailed as
then over the reasons to the contrary; but it did no good, for the Town was not
well repaired, when soon after it was taken, and once more destroyed by the
Turkish Fleet.

At this time the associat Fleets, which was appointed to have met altogether
in May, at Ottranto (all great actions being always slower, and more difficult
then is imagined) was neither met, nor likely to meet, when all June was over.
The Venetians, whilst it was not known what would become of the League, fearing
that they should not be able of themselves to oppose and fight the Enemy, which
was said would be stronger, and more numerous than that of the preceding year,
had resolved to maintain a body of 60 Galleys, the best that were in Candia, by
which they might convey relief to Cyprus; or, as occasion should serve, to any
other place, hinder the Enemy from sailing safely on those Seas, fall upon the
fag end of any Turkish Galleys which should lag behind, and be divided from the
rest, (as falls always out in a numerous Fleet, where all the Galleys cannot
be of an equal goodness); and, in fine, to do as they should see occasion.
And to this purpose, Commissary Canale was gone with 15 of the best Galleys of
Candia, to leave them, with as many more of the best manned Galleys of that
Island, under the command of Commissary Quirini; from whom receiving the rest
that were not so good, he was to return with them to find out the Fleet at
Corfu. But this his return was at first hindered by news, that the Turkish Fleet
was gotten very near those Seas; and afterward, by new orders from the
General, who had dispatched away Letters speedily to Candia, desiring that not
only Canale, but Quirini also, should come with all possible speed to Corfu,
with 50 Galleys which they had, that they might jointly proceed against the
Enemy, when all the Confederates forces should according to appointment, be
met. Which order could not so suddenly be obeyed, because Commissary Quirini,
when the Enemies Fleet was past on further, was gone with ten Galleys to
Cerigo, that he might better inform himself of what course the Enemies
steered, and of their intent; to the end that with more caution and safety, he
might carry the Garrison to Famagosta, which was the mean while preparing, in
two ships that were thereunto destined: But the Commissary-Generall, who was
come into the Gulf, to gather together several ships that were there, and to
bring them to Corfu, hearing at Ottranto, that it would be long e're the
Spanish Fleet would arrive, made no haste, lest he might remove the Galleys too
immaturely from doing of several duties to which they were destined; so as of
all the chief Commanders, the General only remained at Corfu, and but with a
few Galleys: This was the condition of the Venetian Fleet, nor was there any
hopes of the speedy coming of that of Spain; for 'twas known, that the Princes
of Bohemia were not as yet come to Barcellona, to embarck therein; and those
men which were first prepared for the Fleet, not being to be made use of, by
reason of an accident that happened; Don Alvaro di Bazzano went with some of the
galleys to Almiria, to take up some other Foot, which were in their steed
destined for that service. Nor could all the pressures of the Pope or
Venetians, get the galleys of Napoli and Cicily, which were in readiness, and
had nothing to do, come to Ottranto; the Spaniards being resolved, that these
also should expect Don John's coming. And Colonna being busied in getting the
galleys of Florence and Malta to join with his, was forced to delay his going
to join with the Venetian Fleet, though he was very desirous to do so. The
Turks being advertised of the not joining of the Christian Fleets, when they
left Candia, proceeded boldly on, having received orders (as has been said) to
find out and to fight the Christian Fleet, ruinating, in the interim, and
destroying, all the Venetian Dominions, wheresoever they came. Wherefore
General Veniero, hearing what way the enemies went, and what their intentions
were, and knowing that he was not able to keep them from advancing, resolved to
go with his Fleet to Messina, which was afterward approved of by the Senate;
fearing, that when the enemies Fleet should be come near them, (as it was
thought they would do) our Galleys might be exposed to much danger: and that
likewise the enemies coming between Fano and Merlere, might hinder the joining
of the Colleagues Fleets. He therefore would not follow the counsel of some,
who advised him to go to Brandizzi, as that which met with the same objections:
wherefore Messina was chosen for the rendevouz of the whole Fleet; and they
resolved the rather upon this, for that this consideration of the uniting of
the Fleets, which was the ground of all their hopes, prevailed over all that
was urged to the contrary, of not abandoning the Gulf. They were likewise
persuaded, that when the Turks should have assured news of the League, and of
the joining together of so great forces as were a preparing, they would not
enter the gulf, and leave so powerful a Fleet of the enemies behind them.

Whilst these things were a doing abroad, the League was proclaimed in Venice,
on the 2d. day of July, with great solemnity and concourse of people; Mass
being first sung in St. Mark's Church, which Don Gusman de Silva, the Catholic
King's Ambassador, did celebrate, the Doge and Senate intervening, and the
Embassadour's of Princes, together with many Prelates; who went out afterward
in Procession, with the whole body of the Clergy, into the Piazza, which was
hung with Tapestry, and other rich adornments. And when the Doge was come to
the place, where Proclamations are wont to be made, it was proclaimed by a
Crier, who had the words dictated unto him by one of the Secretaries, That on
the 20th. of May, in the city of Rome, through the grace of God, and of the
blessed Virgin, and by the means of Pope Pius Quintus, a perpetual league and
confederacy was made against the Turks, the common enemy, between the Sea of
Rome, the Catholic King, and the State of Venice; leaving room therein for the
Emperor, and the most Christian King, upon such conditions, as were
particularly declared in the writing. That therefore every one was to beseech
the divine Majesty, to grant prosperous success to the union of these Princes,
for the exaltation of the Commonwealth, and for the universal good of
Christendom. These words were with silence heard, and afterward confirmed by
great applause of the people, and were accompanied by a great noise of
Artillery, Bells, Drums, and Trumpets, with much universal joy. The League
being thus proclaimed, they began to prosecute the business more fervently,
chiefly in soliciting other Princes, that they might jointly, and with the
greater force, make war against the common enemy. The Pope, to this end,
resolved to send his nephew, the Cardinal Allessandrino, to Portugal, it
being thought, that the forces and territories of that King were very fit, to
give aid and reputation to the League; he having many armed Vessels, and
confining in his Indian territories, with the Turkish Empire. To this purpose,
the Venetians sent Commission likewise to Antonio Tiepolo, their Ambassador
formerly to the Court of Spain, that (when he had dispatched his business with
that King) he should pass on into Portugal, to use the name of the
Commonwealth in the business, which was to be treated of, in the Pope's name;
and this by reason of the ancient friendship, and continual traffic, which
was between the Kings of Portugal and that Nation. That the conclusion of the
League, and the hopes that it would be confirmed, and the forces thereof
increased, by the assistance of other Princes, had so enflamed the Venetians
with a desire of war, as they had not only quite given over all treaty of
peace, but being constant to the resolution they had taken, would not listen to
any agreement. That therefore the King of France had resolved, to send the
Bishop of Aix to Constantinople, chiefly to interpose himself in the business
of agreement; who being come to Venice, showed how zealous the King was, of the
welfare of the Commonwealth; and that he did therefore offer all his endeavors
and authority, to put her into her former quiet condition of peace. That
notwithstanding, these speeches were not listened unto, but that when the French
Ambassador, alleging other respects, would pursue his voyage, the Senate
acquainted the other confederates with what had past between him and them, to
free them of all jealousy, and to incite them to provide for war, as they
themselves did solicitously, taking Foot into pay in several parts, augmenting
their Garrisons, and often wishing their Commanders at sea, to have all things
in readiness; so that as soon as the Fleets should be joined, they might meet,
and fight the enemies Fleet, which was their chief intent and desire.

But in the mean while, General Veniero having received certain intelligence
from the Galleys of Iovanni Lorredado, and Collanne Drassio d^ Cherso, who were
sent toward Cefalonia to that purpose, that the Turkish Fleet, having pillaged
the Islands of Zante and Cefalonia, was advanced further; went from Corfu, as
he intended before; came to Reggio, and so to Messina, having with him 50 small
galleys, 6 great ones, and 3 ships. But the same Chersan-gally, and that of
Francesco Trono, staying behind, to inform themselves more particularly what
way the enemy went, as they went out of the Haven of Iteca, they met
unfortunately with ten of Caragiali's galleys, who tarried to lay waste the
lesser Cefalonia: Drasio's gally making toward land, with much ado, got safe
into the channel of Corfu; but Trono's putting to sea-ward, was taken by the
enemy; who understanding by the prisoners which they took, that our General
was with no great forces in the Island of Corfu, hasted thitherward, and came
to Figaro, and soon after to Butintro, where, after one days stay, they viewed
the Island of Corfu, but not doing any thing more then; they went to the shores
of Sopoto, whither many men were come from land, insomuch as Lazaro Scioni, who
kept the Castle, being mightily afeard at the approach of the enemy, abandoned
it; so it fell into their hands without any dispute. Sopoto being taken, and
garrisoned, the Turkish Fleet made presently for the Gulf of Venice, the
Bashaw being moved thereunto, either ou^ of a desire of making more prey, or by
pride and barbarous boasting, that he might say, He had failed so far
victoriously, and that none daring to oppose him, he was come near the very
city of Venice, making the terror of his Arms be felt every where: or else, as
it was afterward conceived, and as the effects showed, to bring safety and
reputation by these forces, to their affairs in Albania, where the inhabitants
were risen in several parts, who were fierce men, and could not well tolerate
the yoke of Turkish slavery. By which risings, whilst men hoped easily to take
Alessio and Scutari, they hastened the loss of Antiveri and Dolcigno, whereunto
many landforces were already drawn near; for the St. Iac^^^ of Scopia,
Durazzo, and Ducagini were joined together, so as their Army amounted to above
5000 men, bringing with them ten great guns, and many lesser. The
Marcovicchans, who had rebelled against the Turks, had made themselves masters
of some strong passes, which hindered the enemies Army from going to Antiveri;
and on the other side, the garrison of Dolcigno, assisted by the country
people, had possessed themselves of Corno, and St. Georgio, places upon the
Botana, which being very narrow, and very advantagiously seated, a few might
keep a great many out. Nicolo Suriano was likewise very seasonably come at this
time, who hearing what eminent danger Dolcigno was in, had brought with him a
good relief of men from Cataro, with which the guards were made the stronger,
and the passes better secured: And a little while after, entering with two
galleys into the River of Boiana, they disturbed and damnified the enemy, who
were encamped about those shores, by frequent shot; so as for a while, the
Turks were doubtful what to do, and kept aloof off. But hearing that the
Turkish Fleet advanced, the two galleys, commanded by Michiele Barbarigo, and
by Pietro Bartalazzi, of Zara, went from those shores, to go to find out the
Fleet at Corfu, according to orders received from the General, though their
diligence therein proved unfortunate; for meeting with some Turkish galleys,
they were taken by them. The news of the approach of the enemies Fleet, made
those foot be likewise sent for, who (as has been said) were upon the guard of
the passes into Dolcigno, it being feared, that to weaken the garrison of that
Town, which was but badly walled, especially on the side toward the sea, would
make the danger greater. Wherefore the country people who were up, being
terrified, and wanting both Arms and Commanders, did likewise abandon the
passes, leaving the enemy's Army free entrance; by whose advancing, and by the
still continuing news, that the Turkish Fleet was not far off, those of
Dolcigno being sorely afraid, and thinking themselves not able to withstand so
great a power, by reason of their small numbers, and for that the Town was not
strong either by nature nor art, began to think upon their own safety,
propounding the last desperate terms, of taking away the Artillery of the
Town, of embarcking themselves, and all they could of theirs, in some small
Vessels, and of getting safe to Cataro, burning and ruinating the Town
themselves, so to keep it from falling into the power of the enemy, and from
being serviceable unto them. And whilst being yet rather resolved to fly, then
to defend themselves, Nicolo Suriano, and Sciarra Martiningo, returned with
fresh succor, who entering the Town, appeased the tumult, and somewhat
comforting the minds of those, who were confused through fear, they made them
prepare for defense. The enemie's Camp this mean while approached, and
beginning to batter the walls with six piece of Cannon, they quickly deprived
our men of all defense, so as a good band of Janisaries, began already to
prepare to give an assault. Wherefore Martiningo not hoping long to defend the
Town, unless he were suddenly recruited by a great supply, resolved, that
Suriano should return to Cataro with his galleys, and bring with him a good
company of French foot, whom not long before he had conducted into Cataro;
which was very speedily done, all that could being first taken from out his
galleys, wherewith the garrison of the Town was recruited. These helps kept the
defendants a while in heart. But the enemies Fleet still advancing, and Suriano
being forced therefore to go from those shores, they were all seized on by
excessive fear; and the more, for that Martiningo being then ill-disposed, who
standing underneath the walls, had a stone which fell upon him, which bereaving
him of his sense, made him for a while be thought dead, he could not behave
himself so, as the occasion required. Wherefore despairing to be able to
maintain that Fort, which was played upon both by sea and land, where there was
no materials for Rampires, nor sufficient ammunition; after having withstood
battery twelve days, they were forced to yield, leaving the Town in the
Bashaw's possession, which he received, with promise of saving all their lives
and goods, and of allowing them four ships, to carry as many to Ragugi as would
depart thither, and of treating those well that would tarry there; and with
particular permission to the soldiers, to march out with their arms and
colors: Which conditions were afterward but badly observed, for some
contention arising hereupon, between Pertaw, and Acmat Bashaw, were it true or
fained, they took occasion to deal hardly with those miserable people, who had
submitted themselves upon his word, making the soldiers and most of the
townsmen prisoners, and putting many valiant Albanesian soldiers to the sword.
They kept their word only to the Governor, to Martiningo, and to some few
others of the better sort, whom they conveyed safe to Ragugi. Dolcigno being
taken, the Army marched suddenly toward Antiveri, where all, by reason of
their neighbors success, were full of fear, though the Town, being four miles
from the shore, was safe from any fear of the Fleet; but the Governor, not
waiting till the Camp drew nearer, sent the keys by some of the chiefest of the
town to the Bashaw, for which he was afterward sentenced by the Senate to
perpetual banishment. And the Buduani, Agostino Pasquillio their Governor
being already gone, forsook their Country, and endeavoring to save themselves
in Cataro, and other neighboring places, were most of them taken prisoners,
and the town was first sacked, then burnt. All things were now so full of
terror, flight, death, and rapine, as those miserable Inhabitants proceeded
not by any counsel, but by despair, whereby the ruin of their country became
more certain to the enemy. Uluzzali being thus gone with fifteen galleys to
Curzola, after having made much prey in the Island, he drew near the Town, from
which, (though there were but few inhabitants in it) being at first beaten back
by the Artillery, he forbore attempting it any more; so as, by a notable
example, 40 men only, making women put on military apparel, and appear upon
the walls, to cause the number of the defendants seem the more, were sufficient
to save that Town from utter ruin, and to keep off the Enemy. Thus Uluzzali
departed from Curzola, and taking with him some Galleys of Caracosa, went to
plunder the Island of Liesena, which was also void of Inhabitants.

The Venetians were at this time very much afflicted, to understand that the
Turks were entered with so powerful a Fleet into their Gulf, and that they did
still advance further, leaving sad marks of misery wheresoever they went; and to
see so many armed Vessels of the Enemy, sail with such out-ragein those Seas,
whereof they by ancient privilege pretended possession: it seemed a strange
spectacle to all men's eyes, to see what provisions were made for the safety of
that City, which being the only example, which had despised the power of the
enemy, had kept her self for so many ages free from being injured by the
Barbarians; It was thought, that not only her situation, (the miracle of
nature) but the so many forces which she had then at Sea, were sufficient to
secure her from all present danger: the Fleet not being able to tarry on those
shores, which were every where exposed to the fury of the winds, and it not
being likely, that the Turks, having so many Forces of the enemy behind them,
as were those of the Venetians, and Colleagues, would advance any further, nor
busy themselves in any the least enterprise which might detain them longer;
yet since not to fear great dangers, though far off, was thought no rash
advice; the Senators, that they might leave nothing to Fortune, thought fit
diligently to munite their shores, which are as it were the City walls, to the
end that so insolent an enemy might know the vanity of his presumption. Vicenzo
Moresini, one of the prime Senators, was made General upon the shores, and to
him were added six other Senators, who were to assist him upon all occasions;
Daniele Veniero, Maro Iustiniano, Girolimo Contarini, Francesco Michiele,
Lorenzo Soranzo, and Andrea Bernardo. The Washes, or Moorish grounds, whereon
the City of Venice is placed, in the midst of salt water, founded upon, and
every where environed by, an almost perpetual shore, which extends it self
for the space of thirty miles from the mouth of the Adice, to that of Piave,
renders that Creek which is therein enclosed, (which is not now above five
miles over in the broadest parts, though in ancient times it enlarged it self
for above thirty miles, even to the roots of the Euganean Mountains) safe from
the violence of the winds. This shore, is as it were cut through in sundry
parts by short intervalls, by which the Sea-waters come freely into every part
by the Lake, and by which Navigation is also open to ships. That which is
nearest the City, and by which, as being the most commodious, most Vessels
enter and go out, is called Porto St. Nicolo: over against which stands a
Castle of egregious Workmanship and art, wherein much Artillery may be placed,
which shooting continually upon any Vessels which should endeavor to get in by
force, suffers them not easily to enter. Luigi Grimani was made Governor
thereof, and had a good many foot and gunners allowed him. And from this
Castle, to the opposite shore, was drawn a strong chain, which blockt up the
whole channel: Behind which they placed three great Galleys, and some bodies
of smaller Galleys, with great store of Artillery; and the other Ports were
easily secured, by reason of the shallowness, crookedness, and uncertainty of
the channels which lead to the City. Diverse Corpse de Guard, were likewise
placed in several requisite parts of those shores, and 200 Gens d' Arms were
added to a number of foot; all the other Leaders being brought to muster near
the City. There was a large and continued Cawsie drawn upon the shores, by
which men might commodiously pass in all places; Iulio Sovorgniano, who had the
chief, charge given him of managing all that appertained to the Militia upon
the shores, having designed to tarry in the midst thereof himself with 4000
foot, that he might be ready to turn and wind every where. But to the end that
the Soldiers might upon all occasions have a safe and commodious receptacle
upon the shore; and because the preservation of Port St. Nicolo, did secure the
whole; It was resolved to make a Fort there, drawing a line which looked
toward Malamocco, which beginning from the Washes, ended upon the Seashore:
the part within was left open for the convenience and use of the defendants,
and that without, was flanckt and secured by a well woven Palesado. In the
midst of this Travers, there was an entire perfect Bulwork, and at the ends
thereof two half Bulworks. Thus was all that part of the shore secured, which
extends it self from the Monastery of St. Nicolo in an acute form, to the
mouth of the Haven, a place very fit to receive upon any occasion a number of
men. Some other Forts were likewise made in an octangular form, within the
wash in the Velma, whither great Vessels could not come, whereby the Havens of
Malamocco and Chioggia were secured; by the Artillery whereof, and wherewith
they were furnished, the entrance by the mouth of those Ports might be easily
impeded, and the channels, and neighboring shores secured.

The Senate having made these provisions, that they might proceed vvisely, and
with great circumspection, in a business of such importance; and that they
might not by their negligence invite the enemy to do some shame unto the City:
it was soon known, as it was at first imagined, that they were needless.
For Uluzzali when he had sacked the Islands of Liesena and Curzola, turned
suddenly back to find out the Bashaw, who was gone with the rest of the
Fleet to the mouth of the channel of Cataro, where having staid a while, and
demanded the Fort, but made no attempt; were it either, that he never had the
courage to do any important action, or that he grevv more jelaous of the
uniting of the Christian Fleet, hastened toward Vallona, where re-inforcing
the Fleet with many men, having sent several galleys to several parts, to
inform himself more particularly of the confederates Fleet: he went toward
Corfu, and being come to Pazu, the first thing he did, was to view the
Mandracchio; and when the galleys were gone from Butrinto, the Commanders
went several times about the Island, and having diligently considered the
situation, they did not well agree within themselves what to do; but many
soldiers being this mean while gone on land from out of lesser boats, to be
the first that should pillage; they fell upon an ambush of our light Horse,
which was laid by Captain George Mormori, where they were almost all of them
either slain, or taken Prisoners, amongst which Cassan, named Baffo, was one,
a Renegado Candian, famous for his experience at Sea, but much more famous for
his cruelty. At last, the whole Fleet drevv near, and were shot at from the
Fort, but not much prejudiced, by reason of the Cannoneers want of experience.
And being past on about a mile, they landed a great many men at Potamo, who
came to assault the Suburbs; our men, who had possessed themselves of the Passes
upon the Mountains, not being able to detain them. Philippo Roncone, had the
custody of the Suburbs, with 400 foot, part Grecians, part Italians, who seeing
a greater number of the Enemy, were forced to retreat into the plain, where
meeting with a succor of more men, which were sent to them from the Fort, they
made a stand, making the Turks do the like: But the next day, having landed
more foot, together with 600 Horse, which they had taken up at Butrinto; they
attempted the taking of Castle St. Angelo, and finding it a harder business
then they had thought, they gave it over, but not without some sign of their
barbarousness, for they fired many Houses and Churches, destroying almost all
the Suburbs and vineyards about the City, and the third day they quit the
Island. But this mean while, the Magistrates of the City, and the Commanders,
had taken order, that as long as the Enemy should keep about the Island, the
gates of the Fort should always stand open, secured by a good body of men, to
keep the Enemy from growing more bold, by the appearing fearfulness of those
that were within: and they had also forced the Enemy by shot from the Fort, to
change his station more then once.

The Venetians were the more grieved at these miseries, for that having hoped
for aid from the League, they found that they had not only failed in their
expected good thereby, but that they had altered their first design, and
employed their forces much to their disadvantage; for their having ordered the
galleys of Candia, to go forthwith to Messina, to join all their forces with
those of the Colleagues, made them fear the success of Famagosta, not having
any certain intelligence that it had been as yet relieved, as they might very
well have heard; for that there being so many galleys in that Kingdom, and the
enemies Fleet being far off from those Seas, our men could not have been kept
from succouring Famagosta. So also, by expecting the coming of Don John with
the entire forces, and consequently not to hinder the hopes of better affairs;
their General stood idly looking on so many injuries and outrages done by the
Enemy, without taking any revenge. So it being very hard what to resolve on,
amidst so many difficulties, they set themselves wholly to solicit Don John's
coming, which they chiefly did with the Pope; showing him, that by his
persuasions chiefly, they had given over all treaty of peace, and that in time
of adverse fortune, when more mischief was to be doubted, then good hoped for
by continuing in Arms, they had embraced advices which peradventure were more
generous then useful; so to preserve the ancient dignity of the Commonwealth,
to be governed by the Authority of that holy See, and not to seem to distrust
the Christian Princes; but that whereas they had not failed in their part, nor
had retarded the business for any expense or danger, they found that the
Colleagues had not use ^^ like diligence, and that that League which was made
for the good of Christendom, would redound to the shame thereof, and to the
particular prejudice of their Commonwealth: That it was too apparent, how
great a less of honor, and how great a prejudice to all other proceedings the
loss of Famagosta would prove, wherein so many important consequences
consisted, as to preserve her, questionless they were to find o^t, and to
fight the Enemies Fleet, since they had so great hopes to pass victoriously
into Cyprus, and free Famagosta from being besieged, whence the recovery of
that Kingdom would quickly ensue, and the destruction of the Enemies Army,
which would be wasted by its own wants, and way would be made for greater
acquisition.

The Pope held these things to be very just, and was very solicitous therein.
He heard all men willingly, desired them to be mindful of fitting remedies
against so many mischiefs; and interposed his means and authority, in every
thing which might further the League. He dispatched express Messengers to Don
John, and earnestly renewed his endeavors to the Spanish Court, whither
Cardinal Allessandrino was already come, who carried Letters from the Pope to
the King, wherein he told him; That he never desired any thing more fervently,
then prosperity to the League; that nothing had ever been more suitable to the
worth and power of that King, or which might purchase him greater, or more
real glory. That he had much desired to come himself in person to make this
desire unto him, and to acquaint him with the necessitities of Christendom, and
how he might acquire singular merit; but that, since the imperfections of old
age would not suffer him to do so, he had sent his Nephew, Cardinal
Alessandrino to him, whom he loved as his Son, to the end that he might the
more lively represent his person, and perform that office the more effectually.

The Legate was very honorably received by the King, and met by himself and
his whole Court, at the utmost precincts of Madrid, and was sent back with an
answer full of affectionate expressions, and fair promises; wherein the King
labored to show the Pope, That he had been always very ready to be
serviceable to Christendom, and particularly now upon occasion of this League,
toward the prosperous proceedings whereof, he had resolved that Don John
should winter with the Spanish Galleys in Sicily, that he might be the readier
the next spring, to do what should be resolved of in Rome; and that though he
had oft-times used his Authority with the Emperor, in exhorting him to enter
into this umon; yet he would now again send Don Pietro Fastardo to him, to the
same purpose, to the end that Caesar knowing more expressly that this was his
desire, and being sure, that his encouragement would oblige him to maintain it,
^^e might the more willingly resolve to do so. But howsoever the slownesse of
the Fleet's meeting, did much lessen the reputation of the League; made no
belief be given to the speeches, whereby the greatness and stability of its
forces were amplified, and made the other Princes more cool therein; insomuch
as Cardinal Comend^ne being gone into Germany, and afterward into Poland, to
perform his Embassy, his endeavors were less efficacious, and less belief
was given to his promises: for it was most assured, that these Princes would
not meddle in it, unless they should see it firmly settled, that the
confederacy should be long continued. So as (which redounded much to the
prejudice of such a business) it was said by many in those Courts, that the
Spaniards would serve the League only in name, and by giving it reputation,
but that they would not actually concur therein, with forces answerable to what
was needful. These speeches were the rather credited, by reason of Fassardo's
delay. Wherefore Caesar finding himself in the same perplexity, and having
received many Letters and messages from the Bashaw of Buda, which exhorted him
to preserve peace, and promised him good and real friendship and
neighborhood; and on the other side, hearing the preparation of the Turkish
Fleet, which keeping till then in Scopia, made men doubtful whither it would
bend; resolved at last to send the Tribute to Constantinople, affirming, that
it was no hinderance to the League, nor did it bar him from declaring for it,
whenever there should be a fitting time; but that on the contrary, he might
be much inconvenienced, by longer detaining the Tribute; for Selino growing
jealous of him, would be the first to invade him, when he should not be
provided for him, and when his own particular troubles, would increase the
mischief and danger of Christendom.

The Venetians were mightily troubled at these things, knowing, that if the
Turks should be sure, not to be troubled by any commotions of the Northern
Provinces, it would much prejudice the League, and more endanger the
Commonwealth. Wherefore, the Pope and the King of Spain's Agents consenting
thereunto, they offered Caesar to give him 20000 of the Leagues Foot, and 4000
Horse, thinking, that they might be more serviceable against the enemy on this
side; and that the other 30000, which remained by the tie of Articles, would
suffice for those enterprises, which were to be attempted by the Fleet, on the
maritine parts. The Emperor's Ambassador, resident at Rome, had oftentimes
professed, that his Master wanted no good will, but only forces, to make war
upon the Turks; and that if the confederates would promise to assist him, he
would doubtlesly declare for the League; and that whole Germany, being
convinced at last by necessity and shame, would join in this war; and that by
their example, Poland and Muscovia would easily be brought to do the like. Yet
all this would do no good; for Caesar affirming, that it was too late for him to
make use of this assistance, and that the scarcity of corn, which was that year
in that Country, would not suffer him to have an Army, till after the Harvest;
continued in his resolution of sending the Tribute, making all men firmly
believe, that by reason of his last unfortunate success in the war of Hungary,
he thought, that peace was the only way to secure his Dominions from the
Turkish forces. And thus stood the affairs of the confederacy.

But the Venetians continued still, to do what they were able, for the safety
of their State: They resolved to create twenty five Governors, whereof ten
were forthwith to man their galleys, and, with some others, to attend the
guarding of the Gulf, under the government of Filippo Bragadino, who was
chosen Commissary General of the Gulf, and had commission to cease on all
sorts of Vessels, whatsoever were then in those seas, and to attend with all
possible diligence, in conveying victuals and garrisons into such places, as
were needful, to defend the Islands, and to preserve navigation. Wherein, that
he might govern himself the better in the Generall's absence, he had supreme
authority given. But there was much ado at this time to furnish the Fleet with
soldiers, for the which there was already 5000 Foot in Venice, commanded by
Prospero Colonna, Pompeio da Castella, and Galleazzo Farnese; which being
already embarked in three great Galleys, and in other shipping, the passage
being stopped up, by the enemies coming into the Gulf, they could not get
thither. Wherefore to find a speedy remedy for this, Prospero Colonna was in
great haste dispatched away to Napolls, to raise 1000 Foot in that Kingdom, as
he promised to do. And Duke Atri, and some others, that had first offered
themselves to do so, were written unto, to bring as many men as they could to
the Fleet; and the Viceroy was desired to give leave, that men might be had
from thence upon this occasion. The Venetian galleys, and those of the Church,
of Florence, and of Malta, were in this interim brought to Messina; and Don
John's coming was expected by all, who being gone with 27 galleys, and 5000
Catalonian Foot, was at last come about the end of July to Genua, where having
stayed a very little while, and left Doria with 12 galleys, to provide for
several things which the Fleet wanted, he went toward Napolls, where being
received in great pomp, he had the Standard of General of the League delivered
unto him, which was sent him from the Pope; and soon after, making the same
haste, and leaving 30 galleys to accompany the ships, he went with the
remainder of the Fleet to Messina, where he knew he was expected by the Pope's,
and by the Venetians Generals; who, in sign of honor, and that they might be
the readier with all their forces, for greater enterprises, as also to make the
enemy the more jealous of this union, stayed there without doing any thing,
only waiting for Don John's coming; of whom, mention being often to be made,
in the most important things which are yet to be related, I have thought it not
amiss, to say somewhat of his conditions and customs.

Don John was illegitimately gotten by the Emperor Charles the 5th. upon Madam
di Plombes, a Flemish Lady, and was acknowledged by his father for his true and
natural son, and as such recommended to his Brother King Phillip, not indowing
him notwithstanding with the Inheritance of any particular State. Don John was
then about two and twenty years old, of a very noble and gracious aspect, and
who by his words and actions appeared to be greatly desirous of glory; and
excellent hopes were conceived of him; so as every one thought that he would
zealously embrace this noble occasion of acquiring glory, which fortune had
presented him with, and which was fit for his ancient Descent, and for his
generous mind: and some said, that the King his Brother had promised to make
him King of Tunis, and to give him whatsoever he should get in the Levant. Yet
it was observed, that the King being willing to honor him with this Title, and
to use his name and person in a business of such importance, did
notwithstanding not a little lessen his Authority, by giving a great part
thereof to many of his Counselors; not without some doubt whether he had
therein respect only to moderate his youth, or not also not to suffer him to
grow too great. These were Don Bernardino di Requasens, Commandadore Magiore of
Casteille: Don Alvaro di Bazzano, Marquess of Sta Croce; Don Iovanni di
Cardona; il Conte di Piego: Antonio Doria; and Carlo d' Avalos, to which he
afterward added the Duke of Sessa, and Ferrante Loffredo, Marquess of Trevico;
all of them men of great condition, and highly esteemed by the King; and by
whose judgments all important affairs were governed. As soon as Don John was
come to Genua, he dispatched away Michiel Moncada, one of the Kings Council, to
Venice, to give an account of his voyage, and to thank the Senate for the
confidence they had put in him, promising that he would carry himself so as
they should never be deceived in the good opinion they had of him; and showing
great readiness to act any thing against the Enemy, with which welcome news
they were all much cheered and encouraged.

But the Turks going from Corfu (as has been said) with their Fleet, returned
to Butintro, where staying some days to hear some tidings of the Christian
Fleet, and expecting new orders from Constantinople, they passed on to Pevesa,
where the Bashaw had certain news of the taking of Famagosta, and particular
commission to find out, and to fight the Christian Fleet. The Fort of
Famagosta, after having resisted long and valiantly, fell on the 5th of August
into the enemies hands; and because it was one of the most memorable sieges
which has happened in our memory, and peradventure in many former Ages, I have
thought fit, to give a particular relation thereof, to the present, and to
future Ages.

Famagosta is seated on the head of Cyprus, toward the Levant, in a flat shore
upon the Seas, whence it was called of old by the Grecians, Amatunte, as much
as to say, hid in the sands; It stands almost in midst of a semicircle, shaped
out by two Promontories, Carpassio, and Pedaglio, which by the modern are now
called, The one Capo di St. Andrea, the other Capo della Greca; The former
thrusting out, for above 90 miles, and breaking the circle, puts an end to the
Island on the North side, in a very acute point. This Country was formerly
called Salaminia, from the ancient City Salamina, built by Tevero, after the
ruin of Troy, which was afterward called Costantia, of which there are some
signs yet to be seen, which (it may be) in remembrance of the ancient
nobleness of their City, is now by those inhabitants called, Old Famagosta. It
has a Haven lying between the East and the North, made up of certain Shelves
and Rocks, which being a little divided in several parts, and withstanding the
first waves of the Sea, renders that little creek which is between them and the
shore, free from storms; but being but shallow, it is capable of but a few
great Vessels. The mouth of the Haven, which is turned toward the North, and
shut in by a chain fastened in a butting out, which thrusts it self forth 40
paces beyond the Fort; and a little Castle, built after the ancient form with
four Towers, secures the whole Haven. This Fort was reduced into a square, but
in an imperfect form; for extending it self on the part toward the Sea, from
the East to the North, in crooked lines, and with some great spaces, the sides
thereof are in some parts unequal: Of these, two lie toward the shore, and
two look toward the Town, in one of which there was a little Tower, or Keep,
with six fronts, called il Diamantino, and here was the Gate called Limisso; In
the other, there was a large Bulwork, built but of late, with double Flancks, a
good Front, and with Origlions, after the modern fashion. The whole Fort was
little above two Italian miles in compass, all walled about with a wall of
square soft stones, chiefly on the side toward the Town, where it was 20 foot
broad, with a platform of twelve paces, upon which there was a Parapet above
four foot high; the ditch round about was 12 or 15 paces over, dug out for
the most part in the soft stone; and where that wanted, there was a
counterscarfe made ^f Stone. About the walls there were many Towers, but for
the most part so narrow, as but small pieces of Artillery could be made use of
there: and some others, which were greater, and stood between the Gate Limisso,
and the Arsenal, which were, for their shapes sake, called half Moors, wanted
not likewise for many faults; but they were thought to be the safer, and more
commodious for that they were made compass wise, and because they had places to
go out of, on both sides. The parts about the Fort, are all a plain Campagnia,
having only some little houses toward the North-west, which stand somewhat
higher, like so many little hills, not above a mile from the city, where it was
thought the Enemy would have encamped, both for that the Fort was weakest on
that side, and for the commodiousnesse of some caverns under ground, from
whence the Famagostans dug'd out stones for their buildings, wherein many men
might lie safe: But the Turks finding that they could not well incamp there, by
reason of the condition of the Earth, they brought their whole camp to the
opposite plain, which extends it self for the space of three miles, from the
Fort to the Sea, which was full of fine Gardens, of Orange trees, and Cedars,
and of other sorts of fruit trees, which were before much distroy'd by the
Inhabitants, to bereave the Enemy of making use thereof; yet they had the use
of many wells of fresh water, which served for use of the Gardens, and which
were a great refreshment to the Army, afflicted with excessive heat. The Turks
had slackned the siege (as has been said) by reason of the bitterness of the
season, and withdrawn themselves to winter in more commodious places further
off. But as soon as Navigation began to be safe, and that the time fit for
action drew near, great store of Men, Ammunition, and Victuals, were brought
to the camp by galleys, and other vessels, which past continually to the
Island, especially from the neighboring shores of Caramania, and Soria, all
men flocking so fast thither, as it is said above 50000 Turks, came to the
Island of Cyprus, after Nicossia was taken, many whereof were neither paid nor
commanded, but drawn only out of hopes of booty, which the Bashaw had
cunningly given out, should be greater than that of Nicossia, in so much as the
Turks boasting, according to their usual manner, of their numbers, they in a
threatening way sent word to the besieged, by some that were come from the Town,
to treat of the ransomming of prisoners; that the grand Signor had sent so many
men to this enterprise, as if every one of them should throw but one
shufle-full of earth in the ditches about the Fort, they would fill them up,
and level the way to mount the walls. The Army being recruited, and
sufficiently furnished with all things, and some great Guns being brought from
Nicossia: the Turks began about the midst of April to make their Trenches, to
draw near the Town, and to raise Forts to batter it; which Works were really of
much labor, and miraculous industry: for digging the earth from their winter
quarters to the Fort, which was for above three miles; they made some ways so
large and so deep, though in some places they met with Stone Mines, where they
were fain to labor with Picaxes, and Mattocks; as not only Foot, but men on
Horseback marched so well covered, as the tops of their Lances could hardly be
seen; and being thereby safe from the shot of the Town, they drew many Trenches
athwart, raising the earth so high above them, as being able to work safely by
day, they perfected the work. These Trenches were so made, as the Pioners
throwing the earth they dug out very forwards, there remained sufficient
space between the ditch and the bank for the Soldiers to keep in, making use
of the earth that was thrown out, as of a Parapet, behind which they might with
aim shoot at the walls. These Ditches, and these Rampires were so many, and so
disposed of, as the whole Army was safely lodged therein, though very near the
city, being as it were buried between those Mountains of earth, so as from the
walls of the city, nothing of the Enemies Camp could be seen, but the tops of
their Pavillions. In the same plain, the Turks made ten Forts, standing at
several distances, 50 foot broad in the front, which were secured with rafters
of Oak woven together so artificially, and so strong, as the middle being
filled with earth, with bundles, cinders, sacks of wool, and such like things
those Forts were made defensible against any thing that could prejudice them:
and if any of these works were at any time thrown down by shot from the city,
the number of pioners was so great, as they were speedily restored to their
former condition; so as for above half a miles space, from the Arsenall to the
Limison Gate, the walls were played upon by continual shot. These were the
forces, provisions, and designs of the Enemy, by which the defendants being
made more industrious and vigilant, prompted thereunto by their own gallantry,
and by the danger they were in; the soldiers and citisens were not wanting in
any thing that might make for the defense of the city. Thus at first, (though
they were not so many as might counterpoise the Assalliants forces) they
sallyed often out to skirmish with the Enemy, and to disturb their works,
thereby to show their generosity, and to lessen the Enemies confidence. They
were very diligent in securing the Parapets, in making in-works, in making new
Cavalliers, and in mending the old ones, and sparing neither for labor nor
ingenuity; there was not any hour wherein they were idle, nor any day wherein
they had not new inventions. All the Artillery, (whereof some new ones were
cast, and so their number still increased) were brought to that part of the
wall where the battery was expected. Luigi Martiningo, as Captain-Generall of
the Artillery, had the particular care thereof who had six underneath him, who
commanded all the Cannonieres, so as all things were very well ordered. They
prepared likewise many artificial fires, to be used in several manners, which
being made by excellent Masters, did very good service; and that they might not
fight at once against the Enemy, and against their own inconveniences; they
put all useless people out of the city, to the number of above 8000, which not
being any ways injured by the Turks, went to their country houses, and
mustering the rest, there were found to be 7000 men fit for action in the city;
3500 Italian foot, and the rest Grecians, who behaved themselves with much
valor and fidelity in these actions. These were still encouraged to defend the
city out of hopes of glory, and ample rewards; wherein, as in all things else,
Marc Antonio Bragadino, who was then Captain of Famagosta, and chief Magistrate
of the city, was very diligent, and won much praise: and the danger increasing
by the Enemies nearer approaches, Bragadino sought to encourage the Soldiers;
Telling them the time was now come, wherein they were to show their true
valor, which he saw them for these many last months nobly prepared to do. That
no greater glory had happened to any in this our age, then what was now prepared
for them, by preserving a Fort so far from all other parts of Christendom,
against the power of the Ottaman Empire; nay by thereby keeping a flourishing
Kingdom from being inslaved by Barbarians. Wherefore, said he, are you, most
valiant Soldiers, (directing his speech to the Italians) com from parts so far
off, exposing your selves to the certain inconveniences and great dangers of
long Navigation, if not to give good proof of your worth, and by your merits,
to purchase the prime honors of the Militia? You have now met with that you so
much desired; you have a large field wherein to exercise your patience, your
industry, and all military virtues. This City being assaulted by powerful
enemies, and the eyes of all the world being set upon the event of this siege:
Nor is my confidence less in you Citisens, and in all the rest who have entered
into this Militia; who have given so good testimony, not only of fidelity and
constancy, but of true valor; Having performed all military actions as well
and readily now, as ever did any ancient Soldiers. Your generosity is such, as
will not suffer you to let any other advance you in the defense of your selves,
country, wives, children, and estates; every one of you will with a noble
emulation, seek to exceed other in pains-taking, and in exposing your selves to
danger. Let not the number of the Enemy any whit affright you; for certainly it
is less then it is noysed to be, or then their empty Pavillions cunningly make
show of; the most and valliantest of them being wasted, partly by sufferings,
and part of them being gone to their own homes, to enjoy the wealth they got,
at the sacking of Nicossia, the example whereof ought to make you more
vigilant, but not more fearful. For we are certain, it was not the valor nor
industry of the enemy, which gave them the victory, but the defendants
negligence, who thought, as I believe, that it was bare walls, not bodies of
men, that went to the defense of a City. The hopes we have of speedy relief,
may make even cowards valiant; which notwithstanding, none of you ought to
consider, that you may not thereby lessen your courage, but rather place your
hopes in your selves, and believe, that you carry your fortune in your right
hands. Thus ought all valiant men do, whereunto you are persuaded by infinite
examples, where worth and fortitude of mind, have overcome invincible
difficulties. But we have an other greater hope of safety and victory, since we
defend so just a cause, against so wicked and perfidious enemies, whom
peradventure divine providence has permitted to be prosperous hitherto, that
the fortune of war altering, their fall may be the greater. All humane and
divine reason does therefore persuade us, to drive away all fear, and to hope
for good and happy success, from our own daring.

These words were accompanied with great acclamations, and expressions of joy,
every one striving to show confidence, and encouraging others readily, to
undergo labor and danger; and the commanders to encourage their soldiers, not
only by words, but by example, having already excellently well ordered all the
guards, went themselves to lodge upon the walls, at the foot of the rampire,
that they might be present at all actions, and partake in labor and danger. By
this time, half May was over, and all things were ready prepared on all sides,
chiefly the soldiers minds, which were miraculously disposed, as well in the
camp, as in the city, to give, and to sustain the Assault. In which condition
of affairs, one morning, at the rising of the Sun, they might discover from the
walls, all the sorts and trenches of the enemy, furnished with great store of
colors and lances, and a great shout was heard of men, and noise of Cymballs,
and other such like instruments; and soon after, the Turks began to discharge
their muskets and artillery, continuing to shoot all the day-long, to increase
courage in their own men, and to infuse the more fear in ours. The enemy
intended first, to bereave the city of her defenses; wherefore they levelled
their shot against the Parapets, which were speedily re-erected by those
within, and made better then they were, so as they received great security
thereby. But beginning afterward to shoot lower, whereby they much prejudiced
the walls; those within were very diligent, in mending by night, what had been
thrown down by day, which they were able to do, though not without infinite
labor, till such time as the Turks getting into the ditch, disturbed this
their work; for the enemy being already got with their trenches near the
counterscarf, they threw much earth into the ditch, and afterward hollowing
the wall of the counterscarf, they made their passage safe into the ditch, even
to the wall, without being prejudiced by artillery from the half-moons, which
shot on their flanks, and were a little damnified only by some shot from the
Cavalliers. But the city beginning to want powder, it behoved them to be
sparing thereof; so as the cannoneers were forbid to shoot, unless by order
from their captains, which was not given, but upon great occasion. So as the
greatest harm the enemy received at this time, was, by artificial fires; which
were thrown down upon them from the walls, which did disorder and kill many of
them. They used some ironballs full of fine powder, like Grenades, which
breaking into many pieces, did at once give many mortal wounds. So as they
began to make many mines, especially on the side of the Arsenall; whereof those
within found some, and did very seasonably make use of that powder, for their
own preservation, which was intended for their ruin. But the Turks had already
placed many Corpse de guard in the ditch, and lay safe there in their tents,
being secured from harm by the diligence of the guards, which attended the
nearest neighboring trenches; who did so narrowly observe all the motions of
our men, as not any one could appear upon the walls, who was not soon slain by
the enemies musket shot. Mines were not, notwithstanding, this mean while
given over; of which, one proved very prejudicial, which was made in the midst
of the Arsenall's half Moon, which gave a notable example of the soldiers
constancy, or rather, of their miserable condition; for seeing the mine made,
and the bags of powder put into it, so as the danger of that horrible death was
certain, they did, notwithstanding, continue the wonted guard in the suspected
place, expecting hourly, that those that were upon it, should be blown up into
the air, and rent into a thousand pieces by the violence of the fire; as soon
after happened to a company, which was but just then entered to relieve others,
that were upon that guard. The Mine made so horrible a noise, by reason of the
wall's solidity, and of great quantity of powder, as the city seemed to be
shaken with an earthquake; and the Turks began almost immediately to enter,
through the ruins, made by this mine, and to give an assault, which endured
with great fierceness, for above five hours space: Our soldiers were so
desirous to fight with the Turks near at hand, and not to suffer themselves to
be slain, without making trial of their valor, or without taking any revenge;
as every one strove to get into places of greatest danger, every one would be
present at every important action, at all assaults; insomuch as women vuying
for valor with men, came continually upon the walls, bringing many things for
the soldiers use. In this action, our men lost above an hundred and sixty men,
amongst which, Bernandino da Ugubio, who had behaved himself gallantly; and
Pietro Conte, Hercole Malatesta, and other valiant commanders were dangerously
wounded. The defendants retired then from this place, which was broke open by
the mine, to their inward works, which were made with great art; but by reason
of the smalnesse of circuit, were but of little use; for the soldiers being to
defend themselves at push of pike, were much inconvenienced. In these works,
the industry of Mormori, an Ingineer, and of Marco Crivellatore, a Venetian
Captain of foot, was chiefly commended; for by their inventions, two ranks of
hogsheads full of earth, joined one to the other, and upon them, two ranks
likewise of bags of wet earth, well ramm'd in, were placed, behind which,
convenient space was left, for musketeers to stand safely; which proved to be
of notable advantage; for the shot meeting with no solid resistance, took away
some of those bags; the place whereof was suddenly filled up with more of the
like, so as no great hurt was done. By these inventions, and by singular
valor, the enemy were long withstood, and oft-times repu^st, insomuch as they
began to despair, of taking the city by this way: Wherefore betaking themselves
to new inventions, they began to build up other Forts nearer hand, from whence
they might the more easily throw down the inward works, and the cavaliers,
thereby to bereave our men of all defense, and themselves of all impediments.
And at the same time they shot continually into the city, with mortar-pieces,
bullets of great weight, which falling upon the houses, broke down the roofs,
and slew the inhabitants. They shot likewise great number of arrows, shooting
them up on high, that falling down perpendicularly, they might wound the heads
of those, that were upon the walls. They gave many allarums, especially by
night, making, as if they would give an assault; and, in fine, they left the
defendants no hours rest, so to tire them out, and to discourage them, with so
continual labor; danger, and watching. But at last, finding that breaches
made by mines, was not sufficient to make way for their assaults, they fell to
work with their mat-hooks and pick-axes, throwing down the walls, and forcing
them within to yet straiter in-works: So as things being brought to that pass,
as that they might get upon the walls in several places, the Commanders
resolved to do their utmost, and to assault the defendants at one and the same
time in several parts; who being few, and employed in many actions; they
thought they would not be able long to withstand the violence of their assault.
Mustafa made all things fitting for this, to be prepared; he would be present
every where himself, and going about, sought to encourage the soldiers, and
calling all the valiantest and most honorable by their names.

He minded them of their former actions, of their praise and merit got by their
valor, and encouraged them to hope for greater things. As for the rest, he
sometimes threatened their cowardice with severe punishment, promised sometimes
great honor and rewards to their valor. He held forth unto them the booty and
prey they were to get, which he confirmed, by their companions having enriched
themselves at Nicossia. He entreated, he conjured them, not to suffer the
victorious army incur any shame; that they should not fear them, to whom they
had ever been a terror. He ^ad them remember Nicossia, showing them, that they
might get another noble victory, and put an end to the war, with more ease and
advantage; for that the enemy were still the same, weak, and unexperienced in
the true Militia: They therefore ought to be the same, and to be mindful of
their invincible forces, whereby they had got the glorious name of conquerours,
having hardly ever attempted any thing, wherein they were not successful,
teaching the world by their example, that fortune of war obeys true valor.

The Bashaw having much encouraged the soldiers, with these and the like
speeches, would be present himself at the assault, to the end that seeing what
was done, and being seen himself by others, he might by his advice, provide for
all things, and by his presence encourage his soldiers. This assault proved
terrible and dangerous; the Turks fought valiantly, hoping to get the city that
day: but our men keeping together, and resolute to keep what they had, could
not be beaten off; the enemy appeared no sooner, but they were dispersed,
repulst, and slain; their blows proved the sorer to the enemy, for that being
made at a multitude, none of them proved vain. Thus for five hours space, the
third assault was valiantly with stood. But those who defended the Ravelin of
the gate Limisso, being disordered by fireworks, and not being able to govern
themselves well in so little a compass, labored still, when the battle was
almost ended in all other places, and were much endammaged by the enemy; so as
being forced to yield at last, they suffered the Turks to mount the Ravelin;
and all other helps failing, the Captains, by necessary, but dreadful advice,
resolved immediately to give fire unto a Mine, which they* foreseeing the
danger, had prepared in the same place; and the soldiers of the camp, and
those of the city, being intermingled on the Ravelin, those pursuing, these
retreating, both enemies and friends were blown up, and buried in those ruins.
The Ravelin being lost, there was only the thickness of the in-works, made,
as has been said, of bags of earth, between the besiegers and the besieged, so
as the soldiers of the camp, and those of the city, spoke often together; and,
according to the custom of war, the Turks mocked and laughed ^t our men, for
their vain hopes, saying, That the Christian Fleet was sled for fear back
toward Venice; and our men reproached the enemy, for that like country people,
not like soldiers, they used their spades and mat-hooks, not trusting to the
valor of their forces. Amongst which jesting speeches* some serious discourse
was sometimes mingled; the Turks made some proposalls of agreement be put, by
certain slaves that were in their camp, which they had oft-times formerly
endeavored by several Letters, written sometimes to the Governors, and
sometimes to the common people of the city, which were conveyed in by arrows.
But no answers of coming to a parley was ever assented unto, according as was
desired. Wherefore the Turks finding they could not prevail by their craft,
betook themselves to another assault; by the Ravelin which they had already
got. When the combat was come to, it was egregiously fought on all sides, but
chiefly by our men, and to the singular glory of the chief commanders; for
stout Baglione encouraged his soldiers more by his example, than by his words;
and placing himself amongst the foremost, took, as it is said, the Venetian
Standard, which the enemies got at the taking of Nicossia, from the hands of an
Ensigne-bearer; and Luigi Martiningo, who had the particular charge of that
place committed to him, did discharge the part of a wise and valiant commander
in all things, did supply the battle with fresh soldiers often, assisting
those that were wearied, entertaining the enemy where they fought most and
repulsing those that gave back. The Turks having received a repulse, betook
themselves to molest our men yet further, with new machinations; they filled up
all the space which was between the gate and the Ravelin, with wood and
faggots, which they set on fire, throwing in several mixtures, that the
combustion might be the greater; whereby they did much torment our men by the
heat, and also by the stench of that wood, which grows in that Island, and
which is called by those of the country, Tezza, which being set on fire, makes
a very horrible stink. This fire continuing for many days, the soldiers had
much ado, and were greatly incommodited to defend that place, having in vain
tried all things to quench it. Those valiant men, notwithstanding these, so
many, and so grievious perplexities, did still defend the city, all of them
growing so courageous, and being so resolute to maintain the siege to the
utmost, that even old men and women kept continually upon the walls, and
together with the soldiers, discharged the duties, of the Militia. But things
were now brought to the last extremity; the persisting in labor, and danger
afforded no hopes of safety. The Enemies were still recruited with new Forces,
and with all things necessary; the want of men, ammunition, and victuals, grew
daily greater and greater within the Town: a great many of the valiantest
Soldiers were already slain, and many being wounded, were given over for want
of Medicaments, and Physicians: The few that were yet well, were wasted not
only by continual pains-taking, but by sufferings, being forced to feed upon
Asses, Horses, Dogs, and other such nauseous food, and to drink nothing but
water, their wine being all spent: They were reduce^ to such weakness, as they
seemed to live more by vigor of wind, then by strength of body; so as finding
it was now impossible to maintain the city any longer, the citisens resolved to
beseech the Governors and Commanders, to provide for their safety, and not to
wait the utmost extremities. Matteo Gol^^ spoke in the ^ame of all the rest.

Who entreated the Magistrates, in the name of the whole city, that considering
the loyalty and constancy of the Inhabitants, the dangers and sufferings which
they had so patiently undergone: and that since things were now brought to the
utmost extremity, they would not suffer their fidelity to be rewarded by the
total ruin of their country, but rather by the preservation thereof; so as to
the double praise of those who had so long defended her, it might be seen that
their generous minds, which could be wrought upon by ^o fear of the Enemy, had
been moved by the love of their friends, and by a desire of giving them, if not
the reward which they had desired, at least what fortune had permitted them to
do: He said, that if there were any hope of doing good, the same readiness and
courage should be found in them as had been seen hitherto; that if they could
preserve their country from the sore and cruel slavery of those barbarous
infidels, by the expense of their blood, so to maintain it under the just and
moderate Venetian Government, there was not any one that would be sparing
thereof; for that which had now moved them to make this request, was no fear of
death, which they valued not, since that being bereft of so many kindred,
friends, and of whatsoever else was held dear by them, they could not delight
in life, but rather a doubt of living to suffer more heavy calamities, and of
seeing their Country laid waste; themselves, and their children, made
prisoners; and the eternal welfare of their souls endangered. That therefore
he did in all humility desire, in name of the most Loyal City, that they would
give way to a parley, which was daily desired by the Enemy; and by some fair
conditions of agreement, endeavor to preserve those few remainders, which were
yet left of so great, and of so noble a Kingdom.

This the peoples request being heard, the Magistrates and chief commanders
consulted what was to be none; there was several opinions therein, some were
stiff for dying with sword in hand; and that by sallying all of them out by
night, they might assault the Enemy at unawares, and dying, vindicate that
death by their blood, which howsoever was to be esteemed equally certain, but
not equally glorious, by reason of the no trust that was to be given to the
Enemies word; that there was no reason to believe the Turks would keep that
agreement, which they saw necessity, not choice, had brought them to; which
though they should do, it might contaminate, or at least somewhat lessen the
renown and honor, which through so much labor they had gotten.

Others pleaded on the contrary, that it became not them who were deputed to
the Government of that city, to show themselves more cruel thereunto, and to
the people thereof, than did the enemy: For it was clear enough, that nothing
had moved the Commanders in the Camp to motion and Agreement, save only to
preserve the city from sacking, and the citisens from being slain, fearing that
they should not be able to refrain the Soldiers insolence, if it should be
taken by storm. Moreover, as it became men of courage not to do any base thing,
or to be failing in their duty, for fear of death, so to lose their lives
without any advantage, would be rather a sign of foolish ostentatiousnesse,
than of true worth: that the things which they had done for the defense of that
Fort, were such, and so many, as none, unless moved by envy, would dare to
detract from their merit; but that how much greater glory is, so much more does
Envy sharpen her goads: yet virtue had that of privilege, that she could be
satisfied and appaid in her self; that they had sufficiently discharged their
duties in all respects, by preserving that city to the Masters thereof to the
last, that now they were able to do them no other service, then by preserving
those Soldiers for other occasions, who by so many sufferings, and by such
experience, were all become fit to be made Commanders. Neither ought they so
much to distrust the observance of Articles in this case, having had many
examples, as in the taking of Rhodes, and upon many other occasions in the
actions of Hungary; that, though the Turks were Barbarians, yet they love and
honor war like worth, even in their enemies.

These reasons at last prevailing, it was, after a long dispute, resolved to
surrender the city upon fair conditions. Thus on the first of August, it was
concluded, by means of an Italian Ensign, who was prisoner in the camp, that
Hostages being first given to our men, two of the chief of the Camp should
enter the city, to treat of the particular Articles of surrender, and that in
the interim, there should be a cessation of Arms on all sides, and several
white flags being hung out, both within the city, and without, in sign of
Truce, the next day two Cechaia, (who are amongst the Turks as Masters of the
Household) the one of them belonging to Mustafa, the other to the Aga of the
Janisaries, entered the city, and with them only 6 Janisaries on foot, the
Cechaia being on Horseback, richly adorned. On our side, Hercole Martiningo,
and Matteo Colti, a citisen of Famagosta, went out, attended only by four
Soldiers, who as soon as they were out of the city, were met by a Son of
Mustafa's, and by a great number of foot and horse, and were by him brought to
his Father, who having very civily received them, and presented them with two
vestments imbroidered with gold, sent them to lodge in the Aga of the
Janisaries Pavillion. Those who were come to treat of the Agreement, easily
granted all that was proposed, which in fine was, That the Soldiers should be
safely carried in Turkish Vessels to Candia, carrying with them all their Arms,
and goods, and particularly five pieces of Artillery, and three of the three
chief Commanders Horses: That the same liberty should be given to such of the
Inhabitants as would depart, to go with their families, and their goods,
whither they pleased; and that those who would tarry, should be preserved in
their lives, goods, and honors, from the insolency of the Soldier.

Thus in one and the same day, the Articles were negotiated, agreed on, and
concluded. And seeming as if they would speedily and inviolably observe them,
some 40 Vessels were forthwith sent into the Haven, in which those that were
infirm, began to be embarked, whilst those that were well, guarded the inworks,
not suffering the Turks to make any invasion. But as soon as our men came out
of the Trenches, and that they saw the Enemies, and were seen by them, it
cannot be said what wonder arose in both the Armies, but out of several
reasons. Our men marvelled at the vast number of the Enemy, who for three miles
space from about the city, stood so thick, as their white Turbants, like flakes
of snow, seemed to cover the superficies of the earth. And the Turks on the
other side, seeing how few those that defended the city were, how lean and
pale, hardly able to stand upon their legs; they admired their valor, who had
been so long able to make so valiant resistance, not without some obloquie to
themselves: so as being wrought upon by mere natural charity, they gave them
several refreshments, and praising their constancy, encouraged them to hope
well. The Grecians, and Albanians, were this mean while imbarking themselves,
and their families; and some soldiers were already got into other Vessels; so
as on the 4 th of August, the whole city was left in free possession to the
Turks: But as soon as the Enemy were got within the walls, they began to use
much violence against the citisens, wherewith Bragadino acquainted Mustafa,
complaining thereof, and entreating him, that in observance of the Articles,
and of his plighted faith, he would curb the soldiers insolency, and send
other ships to carry away the rest of his men; saying, that he would come
himself, and bring him the keys of the City. This employment was given to
Nestore Martiningo, a spright youth, who being come to Famagosta at the very
beginning of the War, under the colors of his uncle Girolimo Martiningo, had
carried himself gallantly in several offices, and with much praise, showing
great ingenuity and valor. He coming to the Bashaw, got speedy orders sent to
the Soldiers who were entered the City, to keep from doing any injury, and
that two Vessels more should be sent to the Haven to imbarke the Soldiers; and
by commission from Mustafa, brought Bragadino word back, that he should be very
glad to see him, for that he desired much to know his face, as he had already
known his valor, which he would always witness to the world: So as without
any longer stay, leaving Tiepoli in the city; all the chief Commanders marched
out, Bragadino, Baglione, Martiningo, and Antonio Quirino, a noble Venetian,
accompanied by other Captains, and some Grecian Gentlemen, all on Horseback,
with forty Musketeers on foot. Bragadino went before the rest under a red
umbrella, clad in purple, and in his ordinary habit of Magistrate, being
followed by all the rest, who when they were come to the Bashaws Pavillion,
were received with much civility, made to lay down their Arms, and then brought
before Mustafa; who entertaining himself a while with them in several
discourses, concealing his inward thoughts; at last seeking some occasion to
show his cruelty, demanded security for the return of his ships which he lent
them; to the which Bragadino answering, that he was not tied thereto by
Articles, nor had he any with him which were sufficient security: Mustafa,
pointing to Quirino, said, he should stay behind with him: This Youth's
gallantry might be seen in the nobleness of his aspect. But Bragadino said, he
would never willingly give way unto it; wherefore the Bashaw, being no longer
able to conceal his anger, fell to injurious words, accusing our men, for that
contrary to the custom of War, and to all humane Laws, they had put his
Musselmans to death, who were their prisoners: and his anger increasing by
multiplying of words, he commanded that they should all be bound, and making
them be led out of his Pavilion, dismissing the hostages, who were yet with
him, ^e made Baglione, Martiningo, Quirino, and all the rest (a sad spectacle)
to be cut in pieces by his Soldiers; a death certainly mis-becomming so
gallant valiant men, who should have received rewards from men truly military,
though enemies, not punishment for their warlike worth. But Bragadino, who was
reserved for greater torments, must be a spectator of this cruelty, being to
feel the torments of death several times before he lost his life: for making
him reach out his neck, they would not as then kill him, but only cut off his
Ears: and those that were formerly embarked, fared no better then the rest; for
they were put in chains, and condemned to miserable slavery, being to undergo
long and heavy calamity. Fortune was more favorable to some few, who tarrying
last in the City, were made Prisoners by some particular Soldiers, and paying
speedily some ransom, were for fear of losing it, set at liberty by those that
took them; for all men were strictly forbidden to keep any particular
Prisoners: the Bashaw being desirous to make his Triumph the more glorious by
the number of slaves which he should lead into Constantinople. Amongst these,
only Tiepoli found no favor, whose dignity made him the more regardable: He
by order from the Bashaw, underwent the infamous death of being hanged upon the
Mast of a Gally. But it is a sad thing to tell, what, and how many cruel
Martyrdoms these barbarous men made Bragadino suffer: After many revilings, and
scorns, he was brought to the Piazza of Famagosta, and being tied to the
Plllory, he was flead alive; Mustafa standing upon a little ^ill in the Palace
to feed his eyes with this strange and most cruel spectacle; but the courage of
this gallant man showed amidst so many torments, and for which his memory ought
never to be forgotten, is not to be imagined* Mustafa, not having yet satisfied
his anger, gave order, that Bragadino 's skin should be stuffed with straw, and
putting it upon a Cow, with the red umbrella, for his greater scorn, with which
he went into the Camp, made it to be led all about the City, and at last made
it be hung up upon the main Mast of a Gally, to the end that this infamous
Trophy might be seen by all the people on the shore as he past by.

It was not well known, what made Mustafa thus crvel; some said, that having
kept the Soldiers from the reward he had promised them in sacking the City; he
sought to give some satisfaction to his Army, by the death of a few, for the
death of so many as he had lost in that great siege. Others, that being incenst
at their so long and obstinate standing out, and at the loss of some that he
had extraordinarily loved; he had formerly taken some oath, to take some severe
revenge. And others thought, that Mustafa, who was so subject to choler, as
when he was moved he was wont to grow furious, and to be born-mad; being proud
of Victory, was mightily scandalized, when he saw Bragadino and the rest come
to his Pavillion with so many armed men, and so richly apparel'd, as if they
had rather been conquerors, then conquered: which being of it self a slight
occasion for such cruelty, was the less likely, in respect of the time which
past between these severe punishments, and the giving sentence. For moved only
out of his Barbarism, he was cruel even against the dead, and entering into the
Cathedral Church of St. Nicolas, made all the Tombs be thrown open, and the
bones that were within them be scattered abroad; he destroyed the Altars and
Images of Saints, and committed many other cruel and bestiall actions, for
which he was much blamed even by his own men. The city being thus won, they
betook themselves with diligence to cleanse the ditches, to level all the Forts
and Trenches that were without, and to repair what was ruinated within; in so
much, as in a short time, the Fort was restored to its former condition; nay,
made more defensible then it was before: the Bashaw left il Bei de Rodi,
Governor of the City, and went himself from Cyprus, the 24th of September,
returning victorious, and triumphant toward* Constantinople; where he was
received with much honor and joy by all, though this victory was dearly
bought, the Turks having therein lost, as it was said, above 50000 men, among
which many Commanders, and their best Warriers.

But it is time for us, after so long and unpleasing* a Narrative, now to
return to the Fleets, where we shall find wherewithal to make some amends for
these miseries. On the 24th of April, (...) the three Generals were joined
together, as has been said, at Messina, with the greatest part of the Forces
of the League, wherewith they thought at first, to go to Palermo, that they
might by getting nearer the Enemy, cause some jealousy in them: But this
resolution being delayed, Iovan Andrea Doria, and the Marquess of Sta Croce
came thither with some other of the King of Spain's Galleys; and soon after the
two Commissaries, Canale and Quirini, with 62 Venetian Galleys manned in Candia,
which came somewhat late, having met with contrary winds at Sea. When they were
altogether, they amounted to the number of 220 galleys, to boot with six
Galleasses, 25 ships, and other lesser Vessels. These forces being thought able
to grapple with the Turkish Fleet, a council was held, wherein the Commendadore
Majore, Pompeo Collonna, and Commissary Barbarigo met, and spoke their
opinions, and wherein it was by common consent agreed upon, to part forthwith
from Messina, and go to Corfu, as a fitting place to put on such resolves as
they should see occasion for, and to learn tidings of the Enemy. Having
therefore addressed themselves by humble Orisons, solemn processions, and other
pious and religious actions to God; the whole Fleet put from Messina on the
17th of September, the first day, they sailed with a prosperous wind to
Calabria, keeping a good order either for making way, or for fighting, that
they might take all occasions they might meet with, of fighting the Enemy.
Eight Galleys, commanded by Giovanni di Cordona, the Sicilian General went
before the rest, as Vanguard to the Fleet, after which, Giovan Andrea Doria,
went next with 53 galleys, and after him followed the three Generals, with a
greater squadron of 61 galleys; and a little after, followed Commissary
Barbarigo, with 50 other galleys; the fourth and last squadron, consisting of
30 galleys, was commanded by Don Alvero di Bazzano* Marquess of Sta. Croce, the
Neapolitan General: but upon occasion of battle, the Vanguard was to divide
it self into two wings, and to fall into such places as were appointed them;
and the first squadron, lying to sea-ward, was to make the right wing, whereof
Doria's Admiral was to lie outermost, and the Admiral of Sicily, next to the
Battle: the third squadron, recommended to Barbarigo, plying toward Land, was
to make the left wing, wherein were likewise placed the two Commissaries,
Canale in the midst, and Quirini, in the outermost part inward, as Commissary
Barbarigo, first on the outside: The second squadron made the Battle, placed
between the two wings, in the midst whereof were the three Royal Galleys, with
the three Generals, Don John, Colonna, and Veniero; and next these, on one
side, la Patrona Reale, and the Admiral of Genua; and on the other side, the
Commandadore Majore, and the Admiral of Savoy: and this whole battle was
terminated on the right wings side, by the Admiral of Malta; and on the left,
by Lomeli^^es Admiral: and the fourth squadron lay behind, to be a succor to
the rest. The great Venetian Galleys were before the lesser Fleet, about half a
mile, divided so, as Duodoes Admiral was to be placed before the battle, and
that of Iacop^ Guoro: Before the right wing, stood Andrea Pesaro, and Pietro
Pisani, with their two galleys; and before the left, Antonio, and Ambrogio
Brag^dini, with other two. The ships were sent before with the men and
munition, to Corfu, commanded by Cesare Davalos, and Nicolo Donato; but because
the foot destined thereunto, were not yet arrived, being hindered, as has been
said by the Enemies Fleet, whereby the Venetian galleys were not furnished with
as many men as were the Spanish; Don John gave very readily way, that they
should be reinforced with 1000 of the Spaniards Italian foot, and with 4000
Spaniards, which were with as much affiance received into the Venetian galleys.
Two days after, the Fleet being come to the Cape of the Colonne, where, by
reason of contrary winds, and upon occasion of taking in some foot, it staid a
while: Gilandrada was sent with his own gally, and with three other Venetian
galleys, to Corfu, to learn news of the Enemies Fleet, whereof that of Caterino
Malepiero returned forthwith; and brought news, that the Enemy was past by
within sight of Zante, and was entered with their whole Fleet, into the Gulf of
Lepanto; the mean while, seeing the winds would not serve them to make for
Corfu, the Venetian General mentioned going toward Cefalonia, whither they
seemed to be invited by prosperous Navigation, and hopes of meeting speedily
with the Enemy; but this opinion being laid aside, and the first course being
pursued, the Fleet came on the 27th of September to Corfu, and anchored at
Casop^, where having the same news confirmed by several advertisements; and
moreover, that Uluzzuli was past with fifty sail to Mo^^ne, It was thought,
that these things being to be believed, it was now time to come to some certain
resolution. The three Generals therefore called a council; where not only
those did intervene, who were usually admitted, but many other Commanders, and
prime Personages, who were then in the Fleet. Some were of opinion, that they
were to advance, and fight the enemy. But others being of another mind,
propounded other enterprises, seeking to enterpose delays; yet to show, that
they were likewise for trying the fortune of war, but governed by better
reasons, they proposed the expugning of Naverino; alleging, that by taking
this place, which with so great forces they might easily do, Modene would be
thereby likewise much endangered, so as the enemy would be forced to come out
of their strong places, and places of safety, where they were, and to encounter
and hinder them; so as by this means, they might come upon more advantage to
battle. But it was clearly seen by many arguments, that these things were
propounded, not with any mind of putting them in effect, but of opposing such
as were forwardest for advancing; for at the same time, it was granted by
themselves, that the season of the year was unfit for sea-enterprises, and that
this would meet with many dangers; for that so great a Fleet would not meet
with any friend's places, or havens able to receive them. That therefore they
ought to consider well, before they should take any such resolution, as might
make the enemy glory in a victory, gotten without fighting. That those, to
whose care the conduct of the Fleet was committed, and whereupon the whole
business did depend, were to think, as well of coming back, as of advancing,
and not to suffer themselves to be carried so far away, with a desire of
undoing the enemy, as to forget their own safety. That the voyage of the
Western Galleys, to go to where they were to winter, was long and difficult.
Besides, great care ought to be had, in assaulting the enemy at their own
doors, though they should be the weaker: whereas those that spoke the least,
affirmed, that the Turkish Fleet was doubtlesly greater then theirs. That
though Uluzzali was gone, he was not gone so far, as that they might hope to
find the Enemy divided. And that certainly it was more likely, that they
should lose their labor, in seeking to find out the Turkish Fleet, which,
loaded with prey, after having ta^^ the towns in Albania, it being no longer
time to make other attempts, would not stay exspecting them, but would be
already past on toward Constantinople. Which reasons prevailing with some,
they were for making some enterprise in the Gulf, as that which would be
sooner, and with more safety done. And others, mentioned going for Candia,
fearing, left the enemy, when they should see our men busied elsewhere, and
being thereunto invited by the weakness of the garrisons, and the rising of
the country Mountagniers, would turn toward that Island, and endanger it. But
General Veniero, and commissary Barbarigo, with some others, who were constant
to their opinion of fighting the enemy, gainsaying all other proposalls,
considered, that the season was now such, as that alone was enough to make them
give over the thought, of expugning any city, or doing any thing else, that
required length of time; whereas the Turkish Fleet was so near, as that a
battle might soon be had, wherein all the hopes and reputation of the League
did now consist. That Cyprus was already lost, many Islands in the Levant, and
all the Rivers of Albania and Dalmatia were pillaged. That the victorious enemy
insulted every where, threatening the Island of Candia, wherein, it was already
said, they intended to winter, putting themselves, with the greatest part of
their Galleys, into the haven of Suda. Wherefore (said these) has there been
so great a Fleet prepared, and so many soldiers raised? Wherefore has so much
moneys been expended? Why have the people been grieved with so many taxes?
Princes so much troubled? if without so much as seeing the face of an enemy, or
trying our fortune, We, when we are not well got out to sea, should return
home, with so (...) loss, and disgrace to Christendom? Is it not peradventure
sufficiently known, that no war is made without danger; and that not only war,
but no other action is secure and certain? But when the danger is counterpoised
with as much hope, those who esteem glory, or what the world will say, ought
not to shun the trial of their fortune. We have a Fleet so numerous, so well
provided of men and artillery, and artillery, and of all things fitting, (the
Lord be praised) as we want nothing, unless our Commanders want courage and
resolution, to make use of their forces. The Turkish Galleys are usually much
worse then those of Christendom, and at the present, they cannot be well
provided of soldiers, all the best being gone with the Army to Cyprus; the
having been long at sea, their prey, and their present security, are things
which make the Fleet the weaker, and the easier to be overcome. And say, that
the Fleet should now be suffered to return home safe and entire, have we not
reason to believe, that it will be so strongly recruited the next year, as all
lands, and all seas, must lie open to the pleasure thereof, not meeting with
any, that dare any where withstand it? It is wisely done, to spin out the war
in length, when there is hopes, that the enemy may consume of himself, and by
his own sufferings: But our case is clean different, such difficulties being,
out of many respects, rather to be feared on our side, then that we should hope
to see the enemy oppressed thereby. There is no hope of glory or safety therefore
for us now in any thing, but in beating the enemies Fleet; after that, we may
hope for all good success; without it, all our designs are vain, all other
enterprises are to no purpose, or else of very little help to the main
business. Nor are we to despair of finding out the enemy, for being by their
innate pride insolent, and by the negligence, wherein the Christians have
always proceeded against them, they will not hasten their journey for any fear
of our Fleet. But s^y we should not find them, we shall not be said to have
done but little, when we shall have won much honor, by showing, we have done
what in us lay, to find out, and to fight the Enemy.

These things were eagerly disputed on all sides, so as every one standing firm
to their own opinion, nothing could positively be then agreed on: Yet their
judgment beginning to prevail, who advised for the best, it was resolved, to go
to Cefolonia, and there, upon more certain intelligence, resolve what to do.
Thus the Fleet parted from Corfu on the 30th. of September, passing by the head
of the Island, which lies toward the Levan^; and, crossing the Channel with a
brisk south-east wind, they went to Anchor at the Gamenizze, about some twenty
miles from Corfu, where there is a large haven, where being forced to tarry
three days, by reason of contrary winds, they began to muster their men, the
care whereof being given to John Andrea Doria, he went aboard some of the
Venetian Galleys, and making the soldiers stand to their Arms, he seemed to be
well satisfied. But so much powder was spent in these musters, and in
continual salutations, wherein our men, who were but fresh soldiers, took
much delight, as above 200 barrells of powder was wasted in one day, so as
fearing lest they might want is in time of need, the soldiers were forbidden
to shoot without occasion. There happened at this time a slight accident, which
was like to have caused very ill blood. A tumult being risen amongst the
soldiers in Andrea Calergi his Gally, a Candian, wherein there was a company
of Italian foot, who were the Count of Sta Fiore's men, commanded by M^tio
Tortona, one of the King of Spain's Captains; The Venetian General hearing,
that the tumult continued, and that several of them were slain, to prevent
further mischief, sent first his Master's Mate thither, and afterward his
Admiral, who both of them received injurious words from Tortona, and the
Admiral was sorely hurt by Tortona's soldiers. The Venetian General thought,
that if this should remain unpunished, it might cause the greater prejudice to
him, and to his authority, for that it was done before his eyes, who was not
far from thence in his own Gally: Wherefore he gave command, that Captain
Mutio, his Ancient, and his Sergeant, who were the first occasioners of the
scandal, should be apprehended; and being apparently found guilty, he made
them immediately be hung up upon the Mast of his own Gally, to the end, that
they might be an example to others, to proceed with more respect, and to give
due obedience to their Commanders. Don John was more troubled at this, then
became him, as if he and his authority had been therein injured, by whom alone,
as some of his followers sought to persuade him, such justice should have been
done. But Colonna, and others, who were lovers of justice, and who were much
troubled, that the most important business should be disturbed, by so small
occasions, did labor to pacifi^ Don John, showing, that there was no cause of
offense given him; that the place wherein the fault was committed, was
sufficient reason for him to punish it, who commanded there. That the Venetian
General might use his authority in such particular affairs, wherein the common
interest was not concerned; and that that time, and that occasion, did
particularly require it, to the end, that Commanders might not be bereft of
that obedience, which was always so useful in War, but most necessary there,
where there were soldiers of several Nations, and under Commanders of
several Dominions. Wherewith, though Don John's anger was in a good part
satisfied, yet was he not altogether appeased; insomuch as absolutely denying,
to treat of any thing with the Venetian General, the most important businesses
were negotiated by Commissary Ba^berigo, who with singular dexterity and
wisdom, sought to keep upon good terms with the Spaniards, which was then more
necessary then ever; the enemies Fleet was very strong, and very near; the
business which they had in hand with all the League's forces, was of greatest
importance. So as continuing without more dispute, in their first resolution,
of going to Cefaloma, as soon as the wind should serve, they pursued their
voyage; and passing on the 4th. of October by the Channel of Viscardo, on the
5th. the Fleet went to the vale of Alessandria, where many ruins of the
ancient city of Samos are yet to be seen. Here, by the relation of Gita'
Andrea, of Iovan Battista Contarini, and by Letters from Paolo Contarini,
Commissary of Zante, the same things were confirmed, which they had formerly
heard, of the Turkish Fleet; and chiefly of Uluzzali's being gone, though his
voyage was diversely spoken of; some saying, that he was gone with fifty Galleys
to Modene; and others, that he was gone with somewhat a lesser number to
Barbary. Wherefore all of them being of opinion, that they were fully informed
of the enemies forces, and of their condition, and that they might hope to
find them in the Gulf of Lepanto, and fight them upon advantageous terms, the
Venetians met together, to consult what was to be done: On the one side, they
were very desirous to fight, and had great hopes of victory; on the other side,
they were very doubtful what to do, and feared much any good success, by
reason of the Spaniards various and uncertain proceedings, so as they knew not
well what resolution to take. By saying nothing, they did not only give over
their hopes of good success, but suffered their Fleet to be exposed to great
danger, by reason of the enemies being so near; and they were debarred advising
thereupon, (according as the importancy of the news, and the business
required) by reason of the Commander's simulation. In this ambiguity, they
resolved to send Colonna, and Commissary Barbarigo, upon the occasion of the
news which they had received, to Don John; and that without mentioning any
fighting, they should endeavor to persuade him, to continue his first
resolution of advancing, and to think only of doing what was already resolved
on, without any further consultation. Yet some proposed the enterprise of Sta
Maura, and other things; but much difficulty was found in them all. Wherefore
the next night, the Fleet went from the Haven of Alessandria, and steering
toward the Gulf of Lepanto, came to the Cutzolary Rocks the next morning, by
Sunrising, which was on the seventh of October.

At the same time, the enemy hearing by Caracoza, that the Christians Fleet
came forward, and was badly provided of men; Al^, were it either, that he had
received such express orders from Selino, or that aspiring after glory, being
thereunto egged on by the Trophies, which the other Bashaw had wone by
land-enterprises, which made him desirous to do some notable action by sea,
prepared to go out of the Gulf of Lepanto, and to meet the Colleagues Fleet,
with intention to fight them, promising unto himself a glorious victory. And
yet being desirous to have the opinions of the chief Commanders therein, he
found some doubtful, and others of a clean contrary sense. Pertau, as being of
chief authority, and knowing himself out of emulation of glory, to be more
subject to suspicion, did neither give his free consent, nor openly contradict
it. But Siloco, Sangiacco of Alessandria, an aged man, and of great experience
at Sea, dissuading from the proposal, labored to prove, that this advice was
full of danger; and that the advisers thereunto might be the more subject to
blame, for that such a resolution would not only be taken without necessity,
but unseasonably, and without reason.

Our arms (said he) have hitherto been victorious, we have ruined many of the
Enemies Islands, taken so much booty, brought away so many (...) and taken two
Towns in Albania, opportuvely seated, whereby we have much increased the
Ottaman Empire; nor was it to be esteemed less boldly done to have advanced so
far, and approached with their Galleys so near the lery city of Venice, and
scorning the so great preparations of the Enemies Fleet, to have withdrawn
their forces to the defense of their own shores, and made the memory of that
expedition perpetually glorious* What greater prosperity, what greater renown
could be now expected? That some bounds were to be put to the desire of glory,
and Empire; and that they ought not so often, and at th time tempt, nay tire
fortune, which never smiles long upon any body, especially in affairs of War:
that they had made war with the Venetians for the getting of Cyprus, which was
succesfully by force of Arms now reduced under the Ottaman Empire, so as the
cause of that war was now decided. What should now make them hazard the
dubious event of battel^ and not only afford those Enemies a means, but even
force them to fight, whom if they, the Turks, knew how to make use of the
present occasions, they might without unsheathing a sword, force to return with
shame home to their own Havens, for want of bread, leaving them the effect of
victory, gotten without any hazard: so as being confounded and amazed by so
many bad successes, they would not hereafter dare to agree in joining so many
forces together as now they had done: wherein that they had done their utmost,
might be witnessed by their so long delay of putting out together to Sea, and
by their unwanted boldness of advancing so far, knowing that they had so great
a Fleet as might counterpoise their Enemies: therefore it would be much more
wisely done, to keep within that Haven, where they were defended by two Forts,
and had good store of Victuals, and all other conveniences, and where the
enemy durst not approach them: that those things were truly advantageous, which
wrought our intents with real glory, by the vain appearance whereof none ought
to suffer themselves to be led against all reason of War, and whereby they
might incur great blame, committing their reputation, and perchance all that
they had got, to the uncertainty of fortune.

But these reasons, though in themselves of great weight and consideration,
were not able to remove Al^ from his first firmly taken resolution, building
upon so assured a victory, as that when our men should be assaulted by them,
they should only think of saving themselves by flight; by which falling into
disorder, they would the more easily become their prey. Former examples, and
the late successes represented all things so prosperous unto him, and did so
inflame him with pride and audacity, as thinking his men invincible, he could
not be persuaded that his fortune could alter. He therefore cheered up the
Captains and Soldiers with promised of Victory; he minded them that they went
against the same enemies, which had been so often beaten by them, and robbed of
all their military glory; a weak people, accustomed to pleasures, not to pain,
who relied upon the Arms wherewith they were covered, not upon their valor.

Thus all things being ordered to this purpose, and the galleys being well
recruited with Soldiers, by taking 6000 Spachi from the neighboring St.
Iaccbi's, he parted with his whole Fleet from Lepanto, on the ^th of October,
which according to the truest relation, consisted of a 50 sail, whereof above
200 were (...), the rest Fly-boats, and Gallieasses: and in this number there
were about 40 Lanthorns. Ali disposing of the Fleet, as if he had been
presently to give battle, committed the right wing to Mehemet Siloco, an
Alessandrian Captain; he gave the care of the left wing to Uluzzali, King of
Algiers; he placed himself together with Bashaw Pertau, in the midst, the body
of the battle consisting of 100 galleys, 50 on a side. The two Captains of the
wings were placed, the one before, the other behind all the squadrons; and
certain fly-boats were kept for a reserve, under several Captains. The Turkish
Fleet parting in this order from Lepanto, sailed the first day to Galata, where
staying but one night, it steered the next morning before day toward
Cefalonia, where the Turks thought to find our Fleet, and to fight it within
the Haven, having the same design upon our men, as we had upon them; for a
little before the Turkish Fleet hoysted sail, the Christian Fleet was likewise
gone from their Havens, to go meet the Enemy.

Thus it fell out, that the two Fleets were gotten very near one aanother,
before either of them knew what way the other took: they both desired battle,
but yet they met without knowing it, each thinking that the other would not
fight uninforced. But when the Turkish Fleet discovered ours, and was at the
same time discovered by ours, the wonder was great on both sides, and the joy
as much, each of them undervaluing the others forces. The Turkish galleys
sailed in the order aforesaid, with their Trinchet-sayl only, very close
together, in form of a half Moon; but our Fleet, as it past through the
channel, which the Curzolari Rocks make there, was forced somewhat to alter
their order; for the Vanguard being only advanced, and the first galleys of
the right-wing beginning to go out, the rest remained behind those Rocks. But
that all things may be the more clearly represented, the Narration requires
that this situation be particularly described. A Creek is made as it were by
two Arches in the Jonick Sea, which incompasseth about 200 miles; for parting
from the Gulf of Aria, and pursuing the Rivers of Albania, even to the gulf
of Lepanto, for the space of 70 miles: the Land bends backwards, and advancing
as far on the coast of Morea, from the gulf of Lepanto, to the Castle Tornese,
it makes as it were a half Moon. Opposite to the Ferme Land, lies the Islands
of Sta Maura, Cefalonia, and Zante, which being seated in a triangular form,
shape an opposite Semicircle: so as this part of the Sea is, though with a
large intervall, almost enclosed. In this, there are three small Rocks, not
above a mile from the Rivers of Albania, standing but a little divided; on the
East, they look upon Lepanto; on the West, upon Sta Maura, from which places
they are almost equally distant between 35 and 40 miles; on the South, lies the
Islands of Zante, above twice as far off: and on the North, the Albanian coast.
These Islands were by the Ancients, called Echinadi, whereof the Poets,
sabling, said, they were Nymphs, drowned there in the Sea, and turned into
Rocks: for having despised the Deity of the neighboring River Achilos. These
are barren Rocky places, without any humane habitation, and otherwise of no
note; but now made famous through all Ages, for the memorable Naval fight which
insued there abouts. Hither came our Fleet, as you have heard the 7th of
October, a day celebrated amongst Christians, in memory of the Virgin Martyr
Iustina, a little after sunrising; which having dispersed the clouds, and
allayed the winds, brought with it a Calm. Iovanni di Cordona past by the
Curzolari Rocks, who guided the Van with 8 Galleys, and went to Petala, and was
followed by the whole Fleet, to tarry there, by reason of the convenience of
the Haven, and of the River Achiloo, with intention, now that they were come
within 8 miles of the Castle that lies in the mouth of the gulf of Lepanto, to
send some Commander to view it. Thus all of them following the same way, as
they came from out the Cursolary Rocks, upon the point of the Pescharie, called
by the Grecians, Mesologni: the Enemies Fleet was kend by Don John's Admiral
Royal, about 12 miles off. Then the Generals, surprised by an unexpected
necessity of fighting, not being at all moved, sent with all possible speed and
diligence to all the galleys, that they should stand to their Arms, and
hastening their voyage, take the places as was particularly prescribed them
before. It is said, that Don John was then wished by those who were formerly
against advancing, not to hazard himself upon a battle, without new and mature
advice; to which he wisely and generously replied, the present condition of
affairs was such as required courage, not counsel. And thus immediately,
without listening to any thing that might dissuade from fighting, he caused the
Standard to be hoysted up in his Gally, with the Arms of the Princes of the
League, and made the sign of Bat^^l be given, at sight whereof all cried out
with great joy, Victory, victory; and arming himself, and without any delay,
getting into a long boat, He went round about, and solicited every one
presently to make forward, and to overcome the malignity of the place; he
ordered the Galleys, encouraged them all to fight; he acquainted them with the
occasion of battle, with the danger, necessity, glory, and with the rich b^aty
of the Victory.

The Venetian General was no less diligent, in ordering his forces, and in
encouraging his men to fight. When any noble Venetian, Governor of any Gally,
came before him; he desired him to remember, That a public, pious, and
important cause, was to be disposed in that days work. That the total affairs,
and the honor and safety of their Country, lay in their valor; that the
necessity of fighting was unavoydable, which was wont to make even cowards
valiant; but that self worth, and desire of praise, did awaken fortitude in
noble and generous hearts. This mean while the Galleys came still out, and
leaving the Rocks on the left hand, the whole Fleet came into full Sea, and put
it self in order, one gally keeping in a direct line by the others, with
sufficient space for a gally to go between them: The Venetian and Spanish
galleys being every where mingled, the whole Fleet taking up about 4 miles
space. Andrea Doria, who led on the right wing, kept toward the Sea on the
South-East side. Commissary Barburig^, kept with the left wing to landward, the
three Generals keeping in the midst with the Battle, about which there were 4
galleys with Lanthorns; two on the side, the two Admiralls of savoy and Genua,
upon one whereof was the Prince of Parma, and the Prince of Urbin upon the
other, and two on the Poop, La Patrona Reale, and the Commandadore of Casteiles
Admiral. Lomelini's Gally, and Commissary Quirino's Admiral, closing up the
battle on one side, joined it to the left wing; the Admiral of Malta, and
Admiral of Sicily, joined it with the right wing; and the Admiralls of the
wings were the foremost of their squadrons, on the outside. The 6 Galliasses
were placed on the Front of the Battle, about half a mile from it, divided in
the same manner: In the midst before the Battle, stood Duedo's Admiral, and
Iatomo Gauro's Gally, with two others, for every wing, which were all very well
furnished with Artillery and Soldiers.

The Fleet being thus ordered, stood firm, with their Prows turned toward the
Enemy, expecting that they should come on. Ali, not seeing our left wing appear
yet, which was not come from forth the Rocks, thought the Christian Fleet to be
lesser then it was; and seeing Doria, bend toward the Sea, which he did to
make way for the other galleys which followed, he imagined they began to fly;
whereupon the Trumpet, Drums, and Cymballs, sounding, and making great signs of
joy, the Turks advanced, as to an assured prey; but when they had advanced a
little, and saw all our Galleys in order, they grew doubtful; so as, striking
their main Yards, (for the wind began to grow less) they slackned their
course; but not having time to put on new resolutions, they came slowly on,
that they might keep the better order. Ali exhorted his Soldiers, not to forgo
their former courage; if he found fear in any one of them, he stirred them up,
either by promises, or threats, bidding them remember the worth of many
M^sselmans, who would not give over the Battle till either dead, or Conquerors.
As soon as the Enemies Fleet came near the greater galleys, they were played
upon by a great shower of sho^; for those Vessels were well provided (as has
been said) with both great Guns and lesser, and suddenly made many shot as them
every where, on Prow, Flank, and Poop, whereby they prejudiced them much. Those
of the first squadrons made resistance, and made many shots at Duodo's
Admiral, but soon perceiving that they did us but little harm, and received
much themselves, they began to fall off with all possible speed from the
greater Vessels, so as every gally seeking to give way, and to free themselves
as soon as might be from danger, and not being all of equal goodness, nor
able to keep the same course, they fell of themselves into disorder; and to
get out of the reach of the Guns, kept their ranks sometimes closer, sometimes
wider, not according to convenience, or reason, but as they were advised by
Necessity. Hereupon it happened, that the enemies Fleet fought in great disorder
for the wind failed them; so as after they had past the Galliasses, they could
not re-order themselves, before they were come very near our smaller Galleys,
which making use of the fair wind, were advanced, and had by shot defied the
enemy, and begun the fight. This disorder of the enemies appeared most in the
right Wing, for many of them falling willingly toward land, they had straightened
their Squadrons too much on that part. Then Ali, thinking Doria's Squadron the
greater, because it made the greater show, being out at high Sea; and beginning
to doubt, that his taking so great a compass, was done with intention, of
enclosing him in the midst, and by tacking about, to assault him both on the
Flanck and Poop, to his great inconvenience, he commanded Uluzzali, that he
should augment his left wing, and making toward the enemy, should face or
fight their right Wing. But Doria steered his course toward the enemy's
Admiral, which was opposite to him, so as the conflict began somewhat later on
that side, then it had on the left Wing, which being near land, and having but
little way to make, encountered the enemy quickly. But Siloco, who was opposite
to this our Wing, seeing some space by sea, between the last Galleys thereof,
and the land, his Galleys being (as has been said) close together, fell with
them presently beyond ours, to the end, that turning back, he might assault our
left Wing on the rear, and that upon any ill fortune, he might be the nearer
land, and so might provide the better for his safety. And though Commissary
Barbarigo were aware of this his design, yet could he not hinder him time
enough; so as the Galleys of the second Squadron past safely beyond ours. At
the same time, Ali keeping his course straight on, and re-enforcing the Rowers,
that he might be the sooner out of danger of the shot, met with Don John's
Gally, who seeing him come, knew the Imperial Gally by its Ensigns; and not
tarrying to expect being assaulted, advanced immediately, together with the
Venetian General, and both of them gave him a fierce assault. Colonna did the
like to Bashaw Pertaw's Gally, betwixt whom the fight grew the fiercer, for
that these the chief Commander's Galleys, had other Galleys near them, which
assisted them to sustain, and to refresh the fight. But other Squadrons of the
same order, which kept first close together, severing themselves a little,
entered the Battle in several places, and in several manners; some were to
resist many of the enemies Galleys, and some other unfought withal, wound
about whither they listed, to succor their companions that were in danger.
Thus they fought in several places with great slaughter, and dubious event, so
as it seemed not to be one, but many Navall Battles. The soldiers being on all
sides enflamed, not only with the desire of glory, but with hatred to their
enemies, boarding the enemies Galleys, or beating back those, that sought to
get into theirs, exposed themselves readily to all dangers, and were more
intent in wounding the enemy, then in defending themselves. There were but few
that stood idly looking on, nor were these the more secure by their cowardice.
The greatest cowards, and the most valiant, ran often the same fortune, but
purchased not the same praise. The mixed noise of joy and lamentation, made by
the conquerours and conquered; the sound of Muskets and Cannon, and many other
warlick Instruments; the cloud of smoke which obscured the Sun, took away the
use of ears and eyes, and made the Fight the sharper, and the more confused.
They fought with more vigor there where the Generals were, and with greatest
slaughter on all sides; the soldiers being become almost invincible by their
presence, words, and example. So as for two hours space, the business was
hotly disputed between them, with various fortune, and dubious event. Our
soldiers having entered Ali's Gally more then once, even to the mainmast, were
as often valiantly repulst by the Turks. The enemy increased their forces here,
other Galleys coming in to assist the Bashaw, to boot with Caracozzo, Captain
of Vallona, and Mamut Saiderbei, Governor of Matelina, who were already entered
into the Battle with Ali and Pertaw: four other Galleys bearing lant-horns,
came in unto them, which did much augment the Squadron; and others giving over
other employments, came continually in, to where the chief Commanders were
fighting: insomuch as the Marquis of Sta Croce, who was in the rear, being
aware of the danger that our Generals were in, came in speedily to their
assistance with his Squadron; and Iovan Battista Contarini making forward at
the same time, let fly at one of the enemie's Galleys, which was about to
assault the Venetian General, and sunk it. Other Galleys of the Reserve
followed their example, of which, Iovanni Loredeno, and Malapiero, Commanders
of two Venetian Galleys, put themselves boldly in the midst of the enemies, and
after having long sustained their violence, were slain, and their Galleys were
shreudly torn, having, notwithstanding, by keeping the enemies Galleys play,
been very servicable, to the taking of Ali's Gally, which was thereby bereft of
the assistance he expected from others; and Ali's self was slain by a
Musket Shot, which he received in the head: his Gally being at last taken by
those of Don John's soldiers, which were nearest it, had the Standard with the
half-Moons presently taken down, and an other with the Ensign of the Cross was
immediately set up in the place thereof, and the Bashaw's head put upon the
head of a lance, to the end that it might be seen by the whole Fleet. At the
same time Pertaw's Gally, and that of Caracozo, were taken; but Pertaw getting
into a Cock-boat, saved his life, and Caracozza died in the conflict. The
enemies Bataglia being routed, thirty of their Galleys, which were in best
condition, got close together, and wheeling about, fled toward land, to save
themselves, being pursued by Quirini, who forced the enemies to quit their
galleys, and to throw themselves into the water, when they were got into the
neighboring Rivers, so to provide for their safety. They fought with like
valor in both the Wings, but with some differing fortune; for the conflict was
very long and bloody on the side toward the sea, but on the side toward the
land, the day began quickly to appear favorable to the Christians; so as the
shout of Victory which was made from the main Battle, was answered as it were
by way of Echo, from the left Wing, with the same word, Victory. Some Turkish
Galleys were past (as has been said) beyond our left Wing, and assaulting our
men on the Poop, did much endanger them, Barbarigo's Admiral, which was the
first on that part, being encompassed and fought with, by six of the enemies
Galleys, had much ado to defend her self from them all. The Commissary, in whom
(though they seldom are seen to meet) better counsel, and greater courage, was
never known, not being at all dis^^id amidst to great danger, commanded,
ordered, and provided all things necessary; but the misfortune was, that as he
stood on the Poop, with his face toward one of the enemies Galleys, which came
to assault him, he was shot with an Arrow in the left eye, whereby losing
almost all his senses, he was presently carried down* and not being able to say
any thing, he dyed of that wound three days after, being therein the more
unfortunate, for that he could not receive his part of joy of the victory.
Frederica Nani, a valiant person, and well experienced in maritine affairs,
succeeded him in his charge, whom Barbarigo's self, as if he had foreseen his
misfortune, appointed thereunto: And he, accompanied therein by the valiant
Count Silvio da Porcio, and the soldiers and (...) assuming new courage, they
did not only save their own Gally, but took one of the enemies Galleys,
wherein Cawrali was a commander, of great reputation, whom they took prisoner.
But Marin^ Contarini's gally, which, at the very beginning of the conflict,
came in to the relief of Barbarigo's Admiral, was exposed to greater danger;
for Contarini having run the same fortune as the Commissary, who was his uncle,
had done, after his death, his Gally was long fought with, and was excellently
well defended; for having (...) most of her men in the long fight, she was in
great danger of being lost: But Commissary Cavoli coming in, in the interim, he
did so adoperate both his body and his wit, discharging at once the (...) both
of a captain, mariner, and souldies, as the Turks began apparently to yield,
especially when they saw Siloco's Admiral sunk by Canale's Cannon, and
Siloco's self taken in the water, who was brought to Contarini's gally, who had
behaved himself gallantly in this action. But Siloco being almost dead of his
wounds, Contarini, seeing he could not add to his glory, by the longer life of
so honorable a Prisoner, made his head he cut off. At the same time,
Commissary Quirini came in, who having driven away one of the enemies
Squadrons, (as has been said) turned upon the rest, who yet maintained the
Battle in this part; and putting them to ^light, pursued the victory. So as the
Turks being disordered every where, many of their galleys being shattered, and
having no hopes of victory, and less of safety, being dispersed abroad every
where* made for the neighboring stores; and leaving their Vessels in (...) to
our men, exposed their lives to the danger of the waters, where many were
drown, others slain by our forces, and but few of them escaped into places of
safety. Thus past affairs in the Christian Fleet, which in the Battle, and on
the left Wing, were undoubtedly victors: But the fight continued still very
bloody in the right Wing for Uluzzali, seeing that he could not beat the
hindermost part of our right Wing, by encompassing it, as it was thought he
would have done, betook himself to a new resolution; tacking about, he bent his
course inwards, and turned thither, where he saw some of our galleys divided
from the body of the Battle, and from the right so as he had Sea-room enough to
get beyond our Fleet, unprejudiced: 15 Galleys, whereof some were Venetians,
some Spanish, being then furiously assaulted by a great squadron of the Enemies
left wing, they were all of them reduced to despair of safety; and amongst
these, the Admiral of Malta was taken by the Enemy, but was rescued by two
other galleys of the reserve, and through the valor of many Knights of Malta
that were in them: But Benetto Zoranzo's gallie took fire, and was miserably
lost, with all that were in her* Uluzzali had with him the bigger galleys of
Algiers, excellently well armed, and provided for any Action; with which, and
with some other galleys which yet remained entire, of his wing* (for having
fallen much Roome-ward at the beginning of the fight, as you have heard, they
kept aloof from the great gallie); he yet maintained the fight, and prepared to
assault our battle on the flanck. But when he saw his companions disordered in
all other places, and that there was no hopes of victory, and saw John Andrea
Doria make toward him on one side, with a great squadron, and many other
galleys of our battle, come to assault him on the other side; he resolved to
free himself from danger as fast as he could. So as having the Sea open before
him, he steered directly toward the Corz^l^ry and past through the midst of
our Fleet with some 30 galleys, ^ndamnified; but his other squadr^ns which
followed him, not being able to sail so fast after him, being environed by our
galleys of the right wing, and by those of the Battle, who came too late to
hinder the formers passage, were taken by our men without much a do; and most
of those that were fled away with ^luzzali, being followed by our men, gave
against the ground on the Curzolari shores Uluzzali, with some fevv others,
sailing with full sail toward Sta Ma^ra, escaped safe away: and the Enemies
galleys, which were in the reserve, when they saw their Battle broken, and
their wings far off, being in a place fit for flight, were first retreated into
the gulf of Lepanto, where they pr^served themselves safe. After Uluzal^'s
flight, our men pursuing the Victory, fell to take, and plunder the Enemies
galleys wheresoever they found them, and to take prisoners, the battle having
lasted for the space of five hours. It was a horrid sight, to see the Sea
covered with dead men, and with men half dead, who wrestling yet with death,
did by several means keep themselves above water: Sails, Oa^s, Masts, Rudders,
Arms of all sorts, floted upon the Sea, which was become red with blood. The
number of the dead was diversely reported, as it is always seen to be in such
eases* The most agree, that we lost above 5000 men, and had more then as many
more wounded; but those who speak least of the Turk^ loss, say that they had
30000 slain, amongst which, Bashaw Ali, their Commander in chief or Sea, and
the greatest part of their prime Captain^, and men of chiefest authority. The
principal personages that perished in the Christian Fleet, were Agostine
Barba^^go, Commissary-Generall, Benetto Seranzo, Marino, and Ierolime
Con^ari^i, Mark-Antonio L^nado, (...), Ia^opo de Mazda, Katirino Mal^piero,
Iovanti Loredanio, (...) Quirini Andrea, and Giorgio Barbarigi* and besides
these noble Venetians, of other Masters of galleys, of good condition, Ierolimo
Bisanzo, Iacamo Tre^ino, Io^an Baptista, (...) di Cypro, Iacop^ di Mezza, and
Andrea C^lergi, of Candia: and likewise some Chieftains of Authority, as ^^
Bail^ d' Alemgnia, Knight of Malia, Heratio, and Verginio Orsini, Iovanni, and
Bernardino di Cardine, Spaniards; Bernardino Bisbat^ Conte di (...) a
Neopolitan; all whose names I have thought fi^ to men^ion particularly, to the
end that since it was not their fortune, to get any other advantage, or to
receive any other reward by this victory; their memory may live glorious
amongst men, who by their death have secured our lives, and augmented our Glory.

The greatest slaughter and inconvenience the Christian Fleet suffered, was in
the hindermost part of the night wing, which is doubtfully disputed, whether it
happened by chance, (as often times bad effects follow good advice) or whether
out of cunning and ill will: For John Andrea Doria, falling Room-ward, at the
very beginning of the Conflict, as you have heard, went so ^a^ out to Sea, as
some galleys of his squadron, either not being able to keep course along with
him, or it may be, suspecting this his way of proceeding, wherefore they would
no longer follow him, nor to separate themselves further from the fight, were
divided on all sides. D^ria alleged, that the reason of War advised him so to
do, for, to keep from being in compassed by the Enemy, he was to take so large
a compass, as keeping upon advantage, he might be in a condition rather of
affaulting them on the Flank, then of being assaulted by them: yet many did not
approve of this justification, thinking that he had gone further from the rest
than ^e needed; and that keeping out of danger, he would place himself so as
that he might accommodate himself to whatsoever event the conflict might have.
It Is hard to say what his intention herein was, the effect appeared plainly to
all men, that after having taken a large compass, and not being yet fully
resolved what to do, it was very late ere he turned upon the Enemy, and came
not in to succou^ his companions, till they were in great distress.

The carriage of this business being related to the Pope, the Pope said, that
Dor^a had behaved himself more like a Pyra^e, than a Captain-Generall. There
were notwithanding some, who in his excuse, laid part of this sault upon
others; affirming, that Don Iovanni di Cordona, Captain of the Vanguard, whose
place was appointed to him, between the main battle and the right wing, in ^ase
they should join battle, being past on, and entered into the Haven of P^^ala,
not discovering the Enemy, came in so la^e, as that he could not time enough
with his galleys, which were part of the same wing, possess himself time
enough of that place, which was of purpose left open for him, whereby the
galleys that were nearest thereunto, were exposed to the assault of the Enemy.
Others said, that the Marquess of S^^ Croce, who commanded the reserve, minding
only how to succor the main* body of the battle, either for that Dohn John
was there himself in person, or that he thought the victory did chiefly
consist in the good or bad success of that part, did not care for assisting
the right wing, though much played by the Enemy, and others, (so much do men
differ in their judgments and affections in the very same thing) commended
Doria for what he had done; for that as a very expert and well experienced
person in maritime affairs, he had done so, to take the advantage of the Sun,
and to have the opportunity of assaulting the Enemy upon the Flank. But it is
most certain, that by this, either not very sincere, or unfortunate advice, the
victory proved the more bloody, and the booty, and glory, somewhat the lesser,
though they were both very great: For we took 117 of the Enemies Galleys, many
were sunk, and very few of them escaped free away. There were above 5000
prisoners taken, of which 25 of good quality, and degree; a great many
Christians were also set at liberty, who were detained in miserable slavery
in the Turkish Galleys. There were many reasons given for this so good
success, and it may be all of them true; the goodness of our Vessels, which
were strong, and sound at Sea, and wherein our Soldiers being sheltred, by our
waste clothes, fought the more boldly, and more secure: our store of
Artillery, wherewith our Fleet was better furnished then that of the Enemy, and
made better use of them; as well by reason of their skill who managed them, as
also that the Prows of our Galleys being low and eeven, not raised up, as those
of the Turks, the shot being almost level with the superficies of the water,
hit the Enemies Galleys more justly: moreover, the conditions of the Weapons
was of no small consideration: our men fought armed, against unarmed Enemies;
and whereas the Turks did use their Bows and Arrows most, wherewith our men,
though wounded, were yet able to fight, all our Musket shot was mortal; nor
were our men weakened by frequent shooting, as were the Turks, their Bows
growing slacker, and their hands weaker by often dravving. Our greater Galleys
were likewise of great use, by whose shot the squadrons of the Enemies
Galleys being divided, and disordered, they began to lose their courage and
force: But really, the vvorth and valor of the Soldiers was of most avail;
as might be known when they came to grappling, wherein many of our Galleys
boorded by the Enemy, though upon disadvantage, being to resist a greater
number; they did notwithstanding bear away the Victory, by the defendants
valor, in whose Arms all their hopes did then consist. The Italian foot vvon
much commendations, nor did the Spaniards merit less praise; but of all the
rest, the Grecians, shevving both courage and discipline; as those who were
most accustomed to that kind of Militia, and knew all advantages in wounding,
and in escaping being wounded, behaved themselves with great praise and profit.
It was likewise considerable, that the fighting near the Enemies Country, as it
made our men the more valiant; being necessitated to fight, knowing that their
sole hope of safety lay in their forces; so the Turks having opportunity of
getting into their own Country, was the reason of their speedier flight. This
so great Victory was of rare example in all ages, but rather to be desired then
hoped for in ours, by reason of the Turks mighty power, and of the discords
between our Princes; so as it was deservedly acknowledged by the Christians, as
the work of Gods all-powerfull hand, whereof manifest signs were seen; for on
a sudden, the troubled skies became clear, and the wind, which at first stood
fair for the enemy, altered to our advantage. Besides, it was confessed by all
sides, that being moved thereunto by divine inspiration, all the Commanders
agreed in going near the Enemy, when it was least hoped they should do so. The
Victory being thus got; the Christian Fleet sailing very slowly, as well by
reason of towing the galleys which they had taken, as that the sea was covered
over with dead carkases, with shrouds of ships, and other impediments, retired
to Petala, a neighboring place in the Rivers, opposite to the Curzolari Rocks.
But the next day, the Venetian General past with his galleys, for his better
accommodation, to the Dragoniste; where the first care was, to cure the
wounded, and to view all their men, to see who were wanting, that they might
proceed to some further enterprise, answerable to their forces. But finding,
that they were not able to land above 5000 Foot, they thought them not
sufficient, for the expugning of Lepanto, which was proposed; wherefore they
resolved to forbear falling thereupon, lest they might hasard the reputation
they had won in their victory. Whilst the Commanders were intent about these
business, the soldiers and mariners went from one gally to another, to
enquire after their friends and acquaintance; they rejoiced with those that
they found alive, talked of all that they had done, and reflecting back upon
the danger past, they thought it to be greater, then what at first they had
imagined, and were the more encouraged by their good fortune, conceiving the
better of themselves. All men throughout the whole Fleet were joyed, with the
glory they had won, and gladded of the rich spoils of the enemies which they
had got. The mean while, General Veniero knowing, that nothing could be more
welcome to his Country, then the news of so great a victory, dispatched away
Omfredo Iustiniano speedily, in his gally, who making very great haste, came in
ten days to Venice, where it is impossible to say, how all men, of all
conditions, were ravished with joy for this success. This Gally appeared on
the 17th. of October, in the morning, entering by the Haven between the two
Castles, within sight of la Piazza di san Marco, which was t^^n full of people;
and having many soldiers in the Poop, clad in Turkish habits, which they had
taken from the enemy, people knew not at first what to think, by reason of the
novelties: but when they saw some Banners dragged along in the water, and that
after some shot being made, those within the gally cried with a loud voice,
Victory; victory was joyfully ecc^oed from the Piazza: And the news being
forthwith spread throughout the whole City, people flocked from all parts to
St. Marks Piazza, every one embracing other for joy; insomuch as when the Doge
came from his Palace with the Senate, to St. Marks Church, he could hardly get
thither for the croude of people. Te Deum was presently sung, and a Mass
celebrated, as the time required, with all humble and devout thanks to God, for
so great a mercy. Four days solemn procession was ordered, to be observed in
the city of Venice, and throughout all the other* Towns in that State, in Terr^
fe^ma^ and the memory of that happy day was celebrated, with other
demonstrations of joy, as ringing of bells, and bonefires. And it was ordained
by decree of Senate, that that day should for ever after be kept holy, with
much solemnity; and particularly, that the Doge and Senators should every year,
visit the Temple of the blessed Iustina, in remembrance of the singular favor
which they had received from God, under her protection. Their obsequies which
were slain in the fight, were afterward celebrated with much solemnity, and
honored with Verses and funeral Orations. And Iusti^iano, who brought the
happy news, had the honor of Knighthood conferred upon him. Not long after,
John (...) Contar^^i's gally came to Venice, being sent from the Fleet, to give
a more particular account to the Senate, of several particulars; and to
conduct four Gentlemen, who were sent by Don John to diverse Princes, upon
occasion of the victory* Don Lope^ di Figoroa, to the Catholic King, Don
Ernando Mendosa to the Emperor, the Count di Piego to the Pope, and Don Pietro
Zapata to Venice, who landed all of them (...) Otranto, Zapata brought Letters
to the Doge, and to the Senate, wherein Don John gave an account of the fight,
and how ready he was to serve in this so difficult and dangerous businesses;
saying, That he had exposed himself to so much labor and danger, no less out
of a desire of the Grande^za and safety of the Commonwealth, then for the
service of the King his Master, or for his own glory. And that rejoicing with
them at the happy success, he would be ready to serve them hereafter with the
same willingness, and hoped to do yet greater things. All the Princes of Italy
sent likewise their Ambassadors to Venice, to congratulate this their so great
prosperity. And such rejoycings were had in the Courts of Princes, that were
further off, as might show the importancy of the business, and in how great
esteem they held the Commonwealth.

These things did not, notwithstanding, make them forbear providing for war,
but did rather much quicken their desire of prosecuting the victory, and their
hopes of reaping more advantage thereby. Iacop^ Zoranzo was suddenly chosen in
the stead of Agostino Barbarigo, to be Commissary General of the Fleet,
whither fifteen Gentlemen were likewise sent, to be governors of such galleys,
as were destitute thereof. The Senate writ to G^^erall Veniero, praising his
valor much, and willing him to give particular thanks to all the principal
Personages, in name of the public, for their service so readily performed, in
so important a business. And then to rejoice with them, for having ^on so much
glory and merit, throughout all Christendom. But they chiefly desired the
General, to make good use of the victory, and to use all diligence in
bereaving the Enemy, of the remainder of his Fl^et, Tackling, Men, and of all
things else, whereby he might recru^^ his Fleet; saying, That this was the
chief ground work of all other hopes; for if the enemy were bereft of all
Navall preparations, an easy way would be opened for other acchievments. The
Generals seemed very desirous, to prosecute their good fortune; therefore
being all reconciled after the conflict, they had often met to consult, upon
what they should do next; and (...) last it was by common consent resolved, to
equipage 150 galleys, whereof 30 should tarry to guard the galleys which they
had taken; and that the other 120 should scour the Rivers of Morea, and incite
the inhabitants to rebel against the beaten Turks, whose forces and courage
were lost, by that days misfortune. Wherein much hopes being put at the first,
all things were prepared, for passing into the neighboring shores of Romania,
that they might first get ^ooting there, and make themselves Masters of some
fit place, to furnish the Fleet with victuals, whereby they might the better
tarry in those parts, and fall upon greater affairs. But when these galleys
were to steer this course, many difficulties being objected to Don John; that
purpose was suddenly altered, and he would go with the whole Fleet to the
Haven of Calogero, where the taking of Sta Maura being propounded, Gabriele
Cerbalona, and Ascanio della Cornia, were sent to view the Fort, that they
might put on the better resolution: From whom, when they heard, that the
enterprise would be long and difficult, they quitted their former intention,
and concluded, that it was not good to employ the Fleet in such actions, as
might keep them from re-ordering, and re-inforcing it, and from doing greater
affairs the next year. So as many days being spent in these consultations, and
the winter coming on, they bethought themselves rather where to winter their
Fleet, then to make any new attempts. All the Generals came therefore to
Corfu, where Don John making no abode, when with his galleys to Messina, and
Colonna went with the Pope's galleys to Napols, and from thence to Rome. This
course not answering to the conceived hopes, caused much wonder, and no little
dislike, since having overcome, they had not with the same vigor pursued the
victory, then, when the bare reputation of such success, was sufficient to
make way, to further noble proceedings against the enemy. But as it is commonly
seen, men are more diligent, and agree better, in keeping off common dangers,
being by necessity instructed so to do, than in pursuing glory, and greater
power, either out of envy to one another power, or else through the delight of
present victory, neglecting such things as are uncertain and far distant,
though very beneficial. Wherefore some pleaded the example of the memorable
Battle of Sal^mina, wherein, though the Grecians did with incredible valor,
overcome the mighty Prince Xerxes his Fleet, they did not yet reap any more
signal advantage thereby, then of having delivered Greece for that time from
the eminent danger of bein enslaved by Barbarians.

The Venetians staid, as you have heard, with their Fleet at Corfu; and finding
their forces increased by Phillipp^ Bragadino's coming, with ^ galliasseses,
and 10 galleys, which were not in the Battle, several enterprises were
propounded, all of them acknowledging, tha^ to lie idle, must needs diminish
somewhat from the reputation which they had wone. But the sharpness of the
season did very much cross all attempts, which not suffering them to employ
themselves in far-distant and important actions, the Commanders resolved, to
attempt the taking of Malgarithi, whither 30 galleys were sent, under the
conduct of Marco Quirini, with 6000 Foot; with whom there went Francesco
Cornaro, Commissary of Corfu, Prospero Colonna, Paolo Orsino, and other
Commanders: To whom the enemy immediately yielded, not more in respect of their
forces, then for their recent victory. So as without much ado, they took the
Fort, which thinking they should not be able to keep, without much
inconvenience and expense, it was by common consent slighted. By which being
encouraged to greater hopes, General Veniero propounded, the taking of Sta.
Maura, thinking it to be a business easily to be effected, by the relation
which was made by some, that the Fort was weak, guarded then but by only 300
men, and that the Passes to be possessed were but few and narrow; that it was
very easy to cut the Bridge, which joined the Fort to the Terra ferma, whereby
the enemy should be kept from all relief. But Commissary General Soranzo
dissented from this proposition, saying, That the information was not so
certain, as that they might build thereupon, with hopes of getting honor, or
rather without much hazzarding their reputation. Moreover, that they had too
few men for an enterprise, which was always held to be difficult. That they
wanted Commanders of authority, Prospero Colonna, and Paolo Orsino being
presently gone, after their return from Malgarithi. That it was likewise to be
considered, if the business should prove longer then was imagined, (as it
usually falls out in such cases) they should lose honor in giving it over, and
might incur great prejudice by continuing it, since all the Leagues Fleets were
to meet in good order in the beginning of March. He therefore proposed, as a
thing better befitting the present time, and occasion, an attempt upon the
Dardanelli, or that they might go somewhere else, where by depriving the enemy
of their Rowers, and of other things, wherewith they were to recruit their
Fleet, their designs might be disturbed and hindered. Yet Veniero continuing
in his opinion* went in the beginning of February with the whole Venetian
Fleet, to the Island or Promontory of Albania, formerly called Leucade, but now
Sta Maura, which being but a little distant from the firm land, is now by the
Corinthi, the ancient inhabitants of that country, joined by a Bridge to the
land. Our men's first care was, to keep the Fort from being succored; hoping,
that being unexpectedly assaulted by sea and land, and having but a small
garrison, it would soon become theirs. Commissary Canale was therefore ordered,
to advance with 13 galleys, and to break the Bridge; about which many armed
Barks were placed, to keep horses from wading into the Island, ^o as the enemy
might be beref^ of all succor. These things being thus ordered, and many Foot
and Horse being already landed, General Veniero, and Colonel Rancone, who had
the chief command of the land forces in this enterprise, went to view the
situation; but finding many of the enemies Horse, with whom it became them to
skirmish, and wherein they lost some of their men, they were forced to retreat,
not being able to take so good observations as was needful. And finding by
what they conceived at the first sight, that the situation was stronger then it
was given out to be, and the therefore the enterprise would prove the more
difficult; which difficulty was made the greater, by their failing in their
first design: For the Barks which were to keep the Fort from being relieved,
not being able to advance so far as they should have done, by reason of the
shelfs and shallowness of the water, could not keep the enemies Foot and Horse
from w^ding over, and increasing the Garrison. They dispairing of doing any
good, without more ado, embark their men, and went awa^ with the whole Fleet,
whereof 25 galleys, commanded by Commissary General Soranzo, went to Candia,
and General Veniero re^^rned with the rest to Corfu.

This mean while, Colonna was come from Naples to Rome, where he was received
with great pomp, and extraordinary honor, the houses and streets being
adorned, diverse Arches erected, and the ancient Arches of Vespasian and
Constantine, by which he was to pass, enriched with new and proper motions. At
his entrance into the City, he was met by a numerous company of people, and by
the chief Magistrates of Rome, before he came to the Port Capena, now called
St. Sebastian's Gate; through which he made his public entry, accompanied by
5000 Foot, and many Nobles, with attendance in rich Liveries; the pomp being
made the more conspicuous and glorious, by 170 Turkish Slaves, who, clad all in
silk, were led as it were in triumph amidst the files of soldiers. Thus did
Colonna pass by the way of the Campidoglio, to the Palace, where the Pope,
accompanied by the College of Cardinals, stood expecting him, in Constantine's
Hall, whose foot when he had kissed, he presented the prisoners to him, amongst
which were the sons of Bashaw Ali, in token of his victory. At which, Rome was
overjoyed, seeing the memory of her glorious triumphs, and of her pristine
greatness, as it were, renewed, after so many ages, in one of her famous
Citisens.

THe Victory gotten by the Princes of the League, against those Enemies, who
being till now almost invincible, were by reason of their so many prosperous
successes in Battle, become formidable to all other Nations, had awakened great
hopes in all men, thinking it was now an opportune time to take revenge for
past offenses; and that the Ottaman Empire being once abandoned by fortune,
might be overborn by the true worth and valor of Christian Princes, and
Soldiers: and, as it usually falls out, especially when being at the height of
prosperity, men fancy all things feasible which they do very much desire: no
enterprise, no acquisition was so great, as could satisfy their conceived
hopes, or which was thought a sufficient recompense for such a Victory. Nor did
only such, to whom it appertained, either by peculiar employment, or by
experience in War, to talk thereof; but all men, being every where become
Soldiers, did popularly, and oft-times very vainly discourse, how, making use
of so happy an occasion, the Colleagues forces should be employed. Several
Enterprises were motioned against the Turkish Dominions, and especially in
Greece: All men held for certain, that the very same of the approach of the
Christian Fleet, was sufficient to make way for noble acquisitions: For that
the Inhabitants of those Provinces, who were held in cruel slavery by the
Turks, mortally hating their religion, customs, and Empire, would instantly
rise up in behalf of the Christian^; and the Soldiers of their Garrisons,
being possessed with fear, would retreat to the most remote and secure places,
leaving their Towns to be freely possessed by our men, if they would but appear
before them; so as the whole Turkish Dominions would in a short time be in
disorder, and one acquisition would make way for another; and this first
victory would be get more. Others, not content with such things as these, but
flying at all, were of opinion, that as soon as the season should permit, the
Christian Fleet should advance, and entering the Dardanelli, should with great,
and unexpected forces, f^ll upon the city of Constantinople, against which they
might use their maritime forces the better; for that it was said, the Garrison
there were but weak, and the Inhabitants full of fear: That such an Enterprise
would be undertaken with greater preparations, and more readiness by all the
Colleagues because all of them would share in the gain; that this was to be
esteemed the only sufficient reward of the Victory; that other lesser
acquisitions would but increase expense and difficulties, that nothing would be
wanting to so glorious an action, if men's forwardness would equal the
importancy of the occasion, which was now offered them of chasing these new,
insolent, and ^^venous Inhabitants, out of the most noble Countries of Greece,
into the farthest confines of Asia; and of regaining, together with that
Empire, glory to Christendom. But the wiser and more temperate men, suffered
not themselves to be born away by their desires to so immoderate thoughts; nor
nourishing vain hopes, but measuring the event of things by reason, not by
affections; knew, that as long as the Turks Landforces should remain in^ire,
which is the true foundation of their Empire, no attempt which could be made
against them would prove so easy; neither did they think it a good ^oundation
to ground their hopes upon the peoples rising, which often producing other
effects, then what was at first conceived, might prove the more uncertain, and
fallacious in the Ottaman Empire; for that the Inhabitants who are thereunto
subject, being poor and base, wanting Commanders and followers, weapons and
wealth, cannot by their rising do an^ great prejudice to the Turks, nor be of
much advantage to any others* and the Grecians, being long accustomed to
slavery, have much lost their ancient generosity. But grant that such
commotions were to be expected from the late Victory, they had let slip the
occasion, and lost all such hopes, by not pursuing the blow; for the Enemies
fears being by time lessened, and their Forces increased, they might either
appease, or hinder such Tumults, and secure their own affairs. So as that being
every day confirmed by new advertisements, which was at first thought almost
impossible, that the Turks would have a numerous Fleet out that Summer; it was
judged by such as did more seriously, and more judiciously balance the present
condition of affairs, that nothing could be more advantageous for the League,
then to bend all their endeavors and forces, to destroy this new Fleet,
whereby they might so weaken the Enemy, as they might either have more assured
hopes of doing some good upon their Dominions, by continuing the War; or that,
if Peace should ensue, they might secure their own Territories for some time
from the Turkish Fleets, and make use of the happy success of this battle,
rather as of a certain foundation, and commencement of overcoming the Enemy
more easily hereafter, then as a perfect and complete Victory. Out of these
considerations, the Vene^ians gave themselves with all their might, to make new
preparations for War. They increased the number of their Galleys, they
recruited their Fleet with men, and provided for all things necessary, that as
soon as the season would permit, their Fleet might go into the Levant to
encounter and fight the Enemy.

Thus did men think, and thus they did discourse; but the Christian Princes,
being blind-folded by their own affections, knew not the opportunity which was
offered them of abasing the power of a common Enemy, who was become so
formidable; but envying so much good unto themselves, and so much glory to this
their age, neglected the War, as if they had not been therein concerned* though
their common interests lay therein, and refused the greater prosperity,
promised them by their first happy success. For the Emperor being again
earnestly solicited, and many promises being made unto him, by the Pope and the
Venetians, to come into the League, since he was thereunto invited by
prosperous, and all desirable success; so as he might (as he himself had
said) safely do so; and being likewise exhorted thereunto by the King of Spain,
who had sent Don Pedro Faffardo to him, to that purpose; continued
notwithanding in his delays and irresolutions: nay, he propounded new and
greater difficulties; for being averse thereunto, he strove to have place for
excuse, and protraction still left unto him. He desired that the greatest part
of contribution for the foot, should be assigned to him in Moneys; and that it
might be ascertained out of some of the Hauns-Towns in Germany. He further
desired to be secured, that these assistances should continue for some time,
and that therefore some more stricter capitulations should be inserted into the
League; which desires were seen to be made, out of persuasion, that they would
not be granted; for it was known, that the Tribute being already prepared, he
had made choice of one to carry it to Constantinople. And the King of France,
whom the Pope did again solicit by his Nuntio, not to be wanting upon so
weighty an occasion, to the good of Christendom, said, He must first know
Cesar's resolution, who, if he should move therein, he would readily afford his
helping hand, and would join his landforces with those of Germany, under the
command of Monsieur his brother; but that he neither could, nor would permit,
that his sea-forces, which would be much inferior to those of the King of
Spain, should join with his Fleet. At the same time, Cardinal Allessandrino,
having dispatched his Embassy in Spain, was already gone by order from the Pope
to Portugal, who, by Torres his information, (who was sent thither the year
before, to the same purpose) was told, that above 30 vessels might be manned
out of that Kingdom, for the service of the Christian Fleet; and that the King
seemed very willing to employ al his forces in this common service: wherefore
his Holiness hoped, he might get good assistance there for the League. But
though the Cardinal was very honorably and lovingly received, he could get
nothing from the King but general promises, whereby it was discovered, that
that Prince being wholly intent upon the business of Barbary, did not much
mind things at a farther distance. And not long after, Antonio Tiepolo went
thither likewise, with an Embassy from Spain, it being hoped, that the news
he brought of the victory, might persuade that pious Prince, to enter into the
League, wherein an honorable place was preserved for him; he being invited by
the Colleagues so prosperous success, and by his own interests, to quell the
Turks insolent forces, both in regard of his Dominions in the Indies, to the
which, he might know, the so great power of the Ottamans must needs be
prejudicial, by what Soliman had attempted against the City del Dieu, in the
mouth of Indus, and by the Fleets which were assembled together in the Arabic
Creek. Yet was not that King much moved at all this, nor could he be brought to
promise any thing, save that he would furnish out 4000 Foot for the service of
the League, the next year, and add some of his ships to the confederate's
Fleet; which, he said, he was not able to do at the present, by reason of the
French Hugenotes of Rochells incursions; against whom, he was forced to keep
many armed vessels, to secure his Rivers, and the navigation of those seas: As
also by reason of the Moors insurrection, in the Kingdom of Fez, which he was
first to suppress. And hereof he gave an account by his Letters to the Senate,
witnessing the affection and great esteem he had, for the Commonwealth. But
Tiepolo, that he might do some good by his endeavors, showed him, That he
might assist the cause of Christendom against the Infidells some other way,
without inconveniencing himself; to wit, by making his Officers in the Indies
hold some intelligence with the Persians, who are naturally enemies to the
Turks, by informing them particularly, of the union and forces of the Christian
Princes, of the victory which they had gotten, and with their designs: And
then by furnishing them with some Portugesse Harchebugiers, who getting into
the Turkish Empire by the Red Sea, might raise some commotion, whereby the
Turkish forces might be kept employed in several parts, or whereby they might
at least be made jealous. Which the King readily promised he would do; adding,
that he would hinder the Turks commerce at Ormus and Bazzana; and keep them
from bringing the great store of Mettle, which they were furnished with from
China, through the Persian sea. The King likewise assisted the Legate
Alessandrino, in sending certain Briefs from the Pope to the King of Persia, to
Prester John, and to some Arabic Kings; exhorting them to take up Arms against
the Turks; of which, there never came any answer, nor did there any good come
thereof.

But these uncertain and far remote things, were not much considered, as being
able to do but little good at the present, to the conceived hopes. The Pope did
likewise renew his desires to the King of Poland, with whom Cardinal
Commendone was at the present, hoping to make him take up Arms, not only in
respect of the Victory, but for that other accidents had also occurred, which
was thought might work upon the King, and the Barons of that Kingdom. For the
Turks being jealous, that the Polanders had favored the Wallachians, in
prejudice of the Ottaman Empire, that he might revenge the injury, entered at
unawares into the Country that was subject to that Crown; and having made
several incursions into Prussia, Podolia, and Russia, threatened greater
mischief. But the King was unseasonably saln dangerously sick, when he should
have been treated with, touching this business: So as the affair being to be
negotiated in the Kings absence, with other Lords of the Kingdom, not well
inclined to this war; that they might not, contrary to their customs,
contribute to any expense of war, out of their Kingdom; and they having had
advertisment at the same time, that a Chiaus was upon his way from
Constantinople, sent thither to accommodate the differences; the Popes
authority nor endeavors could not work such effects, as were hoped for. Thus
went affairs in the Courts of Christian Princes, and the first so exalted hopes
began to grow less. For sea-forces were not sufficient to suppress the power
of the Turks, powerful land-Armies being likewise thereunto requisite, which
the Christian Princes might at this time have made good use of, taking
advantage of the Turks maritime forces being divided; whereby, and by their
loss of reputation in the Battle at Lepanto, they were become weaker then
formerly, and easier to be overcome. But to this it was primarily necessary,
that Caesar should declare for the League, it being the common opinion, that
Poland, Muscovy, and the other Northern Countries, which were apt to take up
Arms against the Turks, would follow the example of the Empire: Which being
very well known unto the Turks, they sought by all possible means, to preserve
friendship with the Emperor Maximilian at this time, thinking their danger
very great, if the German forces had moved against them. Wherefore Bashaw
Mehemet had writ to Caesar, and given him an account of the success of the
Battle, lessening very much the loss which they had received, exalting the
power of the Ottaman Empire, and exhorting him not to break the Truce, for any
vain designs of others; but to keep inviolably his friendship with Selino,
wherein if his faith should now be seen, it should for ever be perpetuated.

The Turks were so jealous and apprehensive of the commotions, which Germany
might be able to make, as that, when it was after known, that the Emperor
would send the Tribute to Constantinople, that soldiers reward was increased,
who was the first bringer of so welcome news. But that which did most trouble
the Pope, and the Venetians, and which made all men not well know, what to hope
or fear, was, a doubt which was begun to be conceived, that the Spaniards were
not so forward to pursue the victory, as the present occasion required, whereby
the enemy might have means afforded him, of becoming more powerful than ever;
for it was given out, that Don John was blamed by several chief personages of
the Catholic Court, for hasarding the Kings forces to such danger of Battle,
wherein the Kings interest, and that of the Venetians, were not alike; and that
therefore that business ought to have been otherwise handled by him, and by
counsels apart. And afterward it was known, that the Duke of Less, a man of
much maturity and esteem, and who had been verst in very important employments,
was sent to the Fleet, in the place of the Commendadore General, who was gone
to be Governor of Millan. From whence it was inferred, that the King's pleasure
was, that Don John being very well informed by the Duke of Less, and by his
Council, in all things, should not suffer himself to be so far carried on in
point of glory with any thing, as might in the least part exceed his
directions. But the greatest impediment which was thought would befall the
fervent prosecution of the war, in the Levant, was, the bad success of the
affairs in Flaunders, which grew every day worse and worse; it being somewhat
suspected, that the Protestants of Germany, England, and France, did favor
that insurrection, and assist those that rebelled against the King. Which being
added to a certain natural slownesse in the Spaniards, and to other more
cautious circumspections, it was feared, that it would either altogether hinder
the proceedings of the League, or occasion some important delay at this time,
to the business of the Levant, whereof many apparent signs were seen: For the
proper time for actions at sea appearing, and wherein the Fleet were of right
to join, there was but little care taken to put the Fleet in order. And though
the Venetians did mightily mediate it, by the means of their Ambassador
Lunardo Contarini, who was sent to Don John; first, upon the occasion of the
victory, and who tarried afterward with him; yet no resolution was taken, nor
were such actions seen, as the business required. Only the Venetians letting
no time slip, nor sparing either for cost or labor, endeavored to make use of
the victory, were diligent in repairing their galleys, added to their numbers,
and raised new men to recruit the Fleet; that they might both return with a
powerful Fleet into the Levant, and at the same time mind such occasions as
presented themselves, of doing some remarkable thing in the Gulf. And finding
those who were subjects to the Turkish Empire up in several parts, and ready
to rebel, they thought it became them, according to the custom observed by the
Commonwealth, upon like occurrences, to choose another General; to which end,
they chose Iacopo Foscarini, who was then Commissary General in Dalmatia, who
having had the miraculous happiness, to pass some few years before from
private affairs, to the managing of public business, had showed such singular
judgment and wisdom therein, and wrought himself into so good an opinion with
all men, as they thought, they might safely place the hopes of the
Commonwealth upon him. And to obviate any occasion of new dislikes, finding
that Don John, and generally all the Spaniards, no^ well affected to General
Veniero, for what has been said before, the Senate was pleased, that Veniero
should come with some galleys into the Gulf, and that Foscarini should go with
the forces of the League into the Levant: Who hearing of his election, and
having already received the Standard from Luigi Grimani, who succeeded him in
the place of Commissary in Dalmatia, he went away from Zara with 9 galleys, and
came in the beginning of April to Corfu, where he took upon him the charge of
the Fleet, which consisted then of 40 Galleys, and fell diligently to view
those that were in them, to cause Foot be brought from Brandizzi, great store
whereof were already there, under several Commanders, to provide for
Victuals, Arms, and Ammunition, and to dispose of all things excellently well.
And General Veniero came with some galleys into the Gulf, to act as occasion
should serve, keeping the same superiority of command over all the Captains at
Sea, whenever they met. And these were the proceedings of the Christian
Princes.

As for the Turks, they were the more afflicted for the rout given to their
Fleet, because being long accustomed to good success in war, they believed,
their fortune was unalterable; and totally despising the Christian Militia,
thought, that to war with them, was only for assured prey and glory. But after
having received this unexpected blow, they grew capable of fear, and doubting
the worst of evils, that some tumults might arise even in Constantinople;
Selino, who was then at Andr^nopoli, came to Constantinople, and showed himself
to the people, concealing his grief and fear as much as he could: but the
Bashawes were not the less careful, in providing necessaries for the Fleet;
but building upon our men's slownesse, and negligence, in pursuing their
victory, they were the more diligent in all things, for that their labors were
accompanied by hopes, that they might make amends for the loss they had
suffered in their Fleet, and recover their lost honor. They rig'd up their old
galleys, and all those also which had been given over, as unserviceable in the
Mar^ majore, and elsewhere. They built many new ones, mustered mariners, sent
out commands to their soldiers in other Provinces, to come to Constantinople.
And using great speed and industry in all things, not without much wonder, and
mischief to the Christians, Carazzali went out very betimes, out of the straits
of Gallipoli, with 60 galleys, wherewith he began to scour the seas, and to
lay waste the Islands of Tire and Cerigo; whilst Uluzzali stayed, to gather
together as many armed Vessels as he could, designing, as it was said, to
advance, and pillage the Island of Candia, when they should be joined; or else
to face our Fleet, hindering the designs of our Commanders, and securing the
Ottaman shores. By which provisions of theirs, and by the slownesse and
irresolution of the Christian Colleagues, the Turks reassumed courage, though
at first they had begun several discourses of peace with the Bayl^, and
appeared very desirous thereof; yet they put off the more certain resolution,
till Monsieur d' Aix, the King of France his Ambassador, should be come to
Constantinople, who they heard was parted from Venice, and came upon important
occasions to that Court, and who, as they believed, brought with him some
particular Commission about that business; so as by his means, and by his
Kings authority, the agreement might be the more easily made, and the more
firmly established. So as afterward, the face of affairs altering, when they
came to a more particular treaty, they propounded very unjust and unreasonable
demands, and would make peace rather as conquerours, then conquered. So as the
business was as then laid asleep, and the war prosecuted with much fervency;
which though the Venetians did willingly continue, yet were they much troubled,
finding, that their Islands were burnt, and pillaged, and that the vanquished
enemy did insult as victorious, threatening every day more mischief and
ignominy. And that on the other side, their friends and confederates not being
moved at these mischiefs, nor apprehending greater dangers, did proceed so
slowly in all things, as if the enemy had been utterly overthrown, and that
they needed not to fight any more, but only peaceably to enjoy the fruits of
victory. Many reasons were alleged for these delays, and much discourse was
had upon it, all men wondering very much, at this manner of the Spaniards
proceeding. It was much noised, that the French assisting the Flemish now no
longer secretly, as it was thought they had done formerly; but that they were
openly, and by public advice, to assault the King of Spain's Dominions; that
the preparation of 50 armed ships, which was made at Rochel, which Philip
Strozzi was designed to command, aimed at this. That the assembling of men, and
noise of arms, which was said to be made in the Kingdom of Navar, reflected
upon this. That therefore it became the Spaniards to be careful, and to
provide against these important and dangerous commotions, and not to employ
their sea-forces, wherein their greatest strength now lay, in remote
enterprises, where they could not be ready upon occasion to defend their own
territories. Others reasoning otherwise, said, That these French commotions
being in themselves of no moment, were made to appear greater by the Spaniards,
thereby to cloak their truer and more secret counsels, which were seen very
cunningly to aim, at the keeping of the Turks forces and power, and the like
of the Venetians, so equally balanced, as neither of them should exceed their
present condition. That therefore thinking, they had done enough for the
Venetians security, by defeating the Turkish Fleet, and by hindering the Turks
further progress, they were very reserved, in falling upon any other
undertakings, lest if they should prove prosperous, the Venetians power and
reputation might grow too immoderate, whereby the Spanish Fleet might meet with
another weighty counterpoise, and greater, then peradventure might be thought
convenient, for the safety of the territories, which the King of Spain was
Master of in Italy. Nor wanted there those that said, the Grandees of Spain did
envy Don John's glory, and that therefore they had held forth his too great
Grandezza to the King of Spain, as a thing that might cause trouble and danger
to his Dominions. But what the true cause of these proceedings was, is unknown;
for the Spaniards were so close in concealing their counsels, as without
appearing alienated from having the Fleets meet, or from the enterprises of the
Levant, for fear of the French, or out of any other respect, they still
affirmed the contrary, giving daily hopes, that they would go to Corfu, which
they were very crafty in doing: for they knew very well, that if the Venetians
should have any the least suspicion, of being abandoned by the Colleagues, they
would be forced to come to some agreement with the Turks, which, for some other
respects, would be inconvenient for the Spaniards; for then they must of
themselves alone withstand the forces of so great a Potentate, against whom
they had always professed enmity. Thus, and for these reasons, did not the
Spaniards discover their intrinsicall thoughts, but finding sometimes one cause
of delay, sometimes another, spun on time, without doing any thing.

At this time did Pope Pius Quintus die, which caused a general grief, being
taken away very unseasonably, when Christendom was was in so great need; for
he, being a sanctified man, and very zealous of the common good, and
consequently of great authority and reverence with all Christian Princes, was
held by all to be an excellent means, of keeping up the League, and of
increasing the power and reputation thereof: giving also great hopes, of making
way for some notable acquisition by the Christians, and for the suppressing of
the barbarous Infidells. As soon as his death was heard of, the Venetian Senate
wrote suddenly to the College of Cardinals, praying them, that they would not
suffer the affairs of the League to slacken, wherein the late Pope had been so
zealous, since any the least protraction might prove very prejudicial, and
might hinder the happy proceedings against the enemy. They were all of them
very well minded to pursue the war; and that they might proceed the more
resolutely, the employment was presently confirmed to those very Cardinals,
who were formerly deputed by Pius Quintus, to negotiate the affairs belonging
to the League, who were very diligent, in ordering all things necessary. But
the inter^all of Popedom was but very short, for the Consistory of Cardinals
meeting, they, the very first day, chose Hugo Buoncompagno, Cardinal of San
^esto, Pope, who took upon him the name of Gregory the 13th, a Bulligonesse by
Nation, a Doctor of Law, who had lived long in the Court of Rome, and was held
to be a just man, but of a sour and austere nature, well minded, but meanly
witted, and not much experienced in managing of State Affairs. This election
was much favored by the Spaniards, and particularly by Cardinal ^ranville;
were it either, that Hugo, whilst he was Lega^ in Spain, had won the Kings
favor by his integrity; or else, (as some others said) because he was known
then to be so moderate a man, as that it was thought, when he should be Pope,
he would prove such a Prince, as in many respects would make for the advantage
of the Catholic King; particularly, for the safety and preservation of his
territories in Italy. Pope Pius Quintus his death, brought great disturbances
to the uniting of the Fleets, though Gregory, as soon as he was crowned,
confirmed the League in the same manner, as his Predecessor had done. For Don
Io^n, who sought to protract time, began more to scruple his departure,
considering, that he could not of himself resolve to move with his Fleet any
where, unless he should receive new orders from Spain; which he
notwithstanding giving hopes should be suddenly had, according to the common
desire, was the reason, why the Venetian forces did as yet nothing; and
continuing still the same course, he, according as he thought time required his
answer, did continually in^imate his sudden departure, affirming it so
particularly, as that he writ to General Foscherini, he stayed only from
coming to Corfu, in expectation of the Duke of Sessa; who, if he should not
come all the sooner, he would assuredly come away without him, Nay he blamed
Colonna's counsel, who expecting some few galleys from Florence, did so long
delay his coming to join with them. The Senate had commanded General
Foscherini, to wait for the coming of the Spanish galleys, and not to attempt
any thing, nor to employ those his forces in any enterprise, whereby the common
concernment, and further progress might be retarded.

But the Venetians being desirous that their Forces might be somewhere felt by
the Enemy, resolved to attempt Castle Nuovo; S^i^rra Martiningo, being the
chief adviser thereunto, who having been the preceding year at Catarro, and
having had opportunity to inform himself well, propounded it as a thing easy
to be done. This man was born in Bressia, of a noble Family, though
illegitima^ely; and being banished upon occasion of private enmities, had been
long in the French Wars, where he had won much repute for military valor. And
upon occasion of this War, he had no^ only obtained a safe conduct, but was
made (as it is said) General Governor of Albania, every one conceiving well
of him: His advice being embraced, and his speeches believed, all things were
provided, which he desired as necessary for this action.

The taking of Castle Nuovo was very much desired by the Venetians, not out of
mere consideration of the thing it self, it being a little Town, of no great
circuit, not very strong, nor well inhabited; but for the many advantages which
might be had thereby: For it stands almost in the mouth of the Gulf of
Catarro, near whereunto the land thrusts out, and streightens the Channel so,
as they who are the possessors thereof, may hinder any from passing further
into the Gulf, which winding toward the Levant, makes an other great Creek,
which is safe from storms, wherein any Fleet, how numerous soever, may upon any
occasion ride safely, and in the utmost part thereof, stands the City of
Catarro, which cannot be by any other way supplied with Garrisons, Victuals,
or any other necessaries, it being environed every where on the Lands side, by
the Turkish Territories. Sciarra, having imbarkt himself at Chioggia with 5000
foot, whereof many were French, gallant men, and very well disciplined, went
with great expectation of success toward the Gulf of Catarro, bringing orders
with him to General Veniero, from the Council of Ten, by whom this business
was negotiated, to assist the Enterprise; so as meeting him near Liesena, they
joined together, and went to the mouth of the Gulf of Catarro, and passing a
little forward, tarryed in a narrow place, which by reason of the straightness
thereof, may easily be shut up, and is commonly called Le Catene, or the
Chain. Here they thought they might most safely land their men, all that coast
of Castle- Nuovo, being full of Flats, which in bad weather are very dangerous:
Whence it happened, that a shallop wherein Colonel Alessandro Castracani's men
were, not being able to keep at anchor, was by the fury of the wind driven on
ground, which the Turks being aware of, they got upon a little hill not far
off, and by Musket Shot slew some of those that were in her, who were not able
to make any defense; so as enforced by necessity, they went on land, though in
an enemie's Country* and finding themselves backed by some of our Galleys, they
were the better encouraged, and did for a while withstand the Enemy, though
they were far inferior to them in number, till such time as some Boats were
sent out unto them, wherein most of them saved themselves. After this, the rest
of the men were landed without any opposition; which being done, Martiningo
ordered his Brother Silla, to march immediately with a band of 200 French
Harchibugiers, by the way of the Mountain which stands on the right hand of
Castel-Nuovo, and that he should endeavor to make himself Master of some
important Passes, whereby he apprehended the Enemy might be relieved: and he
made as many more French Soldiers march toward the Town, conducted by Captain
Santa Maria; and for the rest of his men, he gave the charge of the Battle to
his Sergeant Maiore, Carlo Frisone, a Bergamas Captain; the reereward to Latino
Or^in^, and put himself in the Van, and marched thus in three squadrons, the
one a little after the other: In this order, he drew very near the Fort, the
land Forces being still backed by the Galleys, which coasted along the shore,
and observed what way they went: Then Martiningo having placed Corpse de Guards
in several places, fell presently to make Trenches, having brought good store
of Pioners to that purpose from Catarro, and began to plant Cannon: But these
works were mightily disturbed by frequent shot from within the Town; so as
being to use more time then was imagined, the news of our men's arrival, and of
the expugning of Castel-Nuovo, was noysed in the neighboring places, whereby
many came from several parts to the relief thereof, by ways unknown to our
men: and chiefly on that part whither Silla Martiningo was sent to guard the
Pass, the enemy grew so numerous, as though Silla was furnished with more men
from his Brother, it was clearly seen no such succor could be sent him, as was
able to make good that Pass, which whilst it was open, they had great
convenience of bringing Garrisons to raise the siege, and free the Fort from
danger; which when the Captains considered, and found that the business grew
every day worse on their side, they began to think they should not be able to
get the Town so quickly as they had imagined, it being much better furnished
with defendants than they thought. Wherefore it was resolved, to recall the
Soldiers which were sent to guard the Passes, who could not retreat without
some danger, and at the same time to reimbark the Artillery, and the rest of
their men, it being then the opinion of all men, that whatsoever they should
attempt would prove unsuccesfull, and not void of danger: So as raising the
siege, General Veniero came to Zara; and Sciarra with his French Soldiers,
returned to the custody of Catarro. Thus ended this Enterprise, not otherwise
then was foreseen by many before, who thought it a vain design to be able to
storm Castel-Nuovo, in so short a time with so few men; it not being likely
that a Fort esteemed very much by the Turks, and which they had used so great
warlike preparations to get some few years before, should in so dangerous a
time be left with a small Garrison to the discretion of the Enemy; nor yet,
that being placed in a Country so full of Soldiers, the succors would be long
a coming, which might be brought from the neighboring parts. This success
being therefore answerable to the advice, made Martiningo lose much reputation,
who was formerly well esteemed of by many, rather for courageous daring, than
for military wisdom. This afforded just occasion to Mehemet Bashaw, of
upbraiding the weakness of our Counsels and forces, as he was discoursing with
the Venetian Baylo.

These were the Christians actions, which were not answerable to the reputation
they had won by so famous a Victory; the Fleet lying at Corfu and Messina with
all their Soldiers, idle spectators of the Enemies insultings at Sea, vvanting
forces to make any important attempts elsewhere; and the worst was, that the
forces lay not then only idle, but did much lessen, vvasting their Victuals,
and losing many men daily through sufferings, and want of action. Wherefore
there being no appearance of Don John's departure from Messina, General
Foscherini, infinitely weary of such delays, was still thinking of several
affairs. He propounded to attempt something by himself alone; he discoursed
with such as were skillful in the Enemies forts, and in their inhabitants in
those parts: nothing troubled his mind, which was full of aspiring thoughts,
and greatly desirous of glory, and of maintaining the good opinion which he had
won, more then quiet. But at last, tempering his bolder counsels with mature
wisdom, he got the mastery of himself. He knevv it became him not, to attempt
any thing with small forces, left if the Enemies Fleet should advance, he must
be forced to let it pass, and lessen much the reputation of the League, to
their great prejudice;* especially to those Christians who were subjects to the
Turk, and who being encouraged by the happy success at Lepanto, were risen: but
he chiefly shunned doing any thing which might be displeasing to the Spaniards,
or which might give them any just excuse of being faulty to the common
obligations, which he did the rather, for that all other acquisitions were held
poor, all enterprises to no purpose, in respect of what might be hop^d for by
fighting the Enemies Fleet, with the whole Colleagues forces, which was always
the Senates intention, greatly endeavoring this union, and hoping therein very
much. Foscherini being much troubled with these difficulties, and finding no
better remedy for the sore loss of time, he thought it expedient to send the
Commissary Soranzo, (who was now returned from Candia) to Messina, hoping that
this wisdom and dexterity, together with this demonstration of honor, might
work much with Don John, and might make him hasten his journey. Soranzo parted
thus from Corfu, with 25 Galleys, being to make the whole voyage with bad
winds, so as he could not avoid all inconveniences; some of his galleys being
driven by a great tempest upon Regio, and that of Antonio Iustiniano's being
driven on land by a furious wind, could not be saved. But Soranzo being at
last got to Messina, he was honorably received, and welcomed by Mark Antonio
Calonna, who lay there, who excused himself, for not having come further to
meet him, laying the fault upon the tempestuous winds: And then coming aboard
the Commissaries Gally, they went together to Don John, who making Soranzo be
met at the entrance into the Palace, by his chief Major Domo, and by other
principal personages, he received him with much honor and grace, and seemed
to be very glad of his coming. Then Soranzo began to acquaint him with the
reason of his coming; he acquainted him with the present condition of things,
saying; That his Highness's coming to Corfu was much desired by all, where all
their forces lay now ready, 25 galleys, and 6 galliasses, all of them well
fitted, with all things necessary; a great number of soldiers, abundance of
victuals and ammunition, whereof there were 22 ships loaded. That all that was
now expected for their going forth, to prejudice the enemy, was the joining of
the Fleets, which believing that they were in readiness, by reason of the
great diligence, which they knew was to be used in business of so great
concernment, he was come thither, to give him an account of the Venetian Fleet,
and to wait upon him so Corfu. That the Venetian Commander would not venture
upon any attempt, with those forces which they had in readiness, without his
presence, and fortunate conduct, though they had been by many occasion invited
so to do, and by some others almost enforced, by reason of the news they had
of the enemies weakness, and of the injuries that they had done to their
Islands. That it was the Senates desire, and the desire of every particular
man, that all things should be referred to him, and that the prime glory of
^ll^^er pri^es should be reserved for him. That for this cause, they had till
now kept their whole Fleet within their own havens, being confident, that it
would not be long before he would come thither. That he was now come to
Messina, rather to wait upon him, then to hasten his departure. That it was too
apparent, of what importance every minutes loss was, wherein occasions of
greatly prosperous success might be lost, or whereby at least, the reputation
which they had won might be much lessened, which could not be upheld, but by
speedy and generous resolutions; the expectation which the world had conceived
of the Leagues forces, being very great, and particularly of his worth and
fortune. That the last year, one day was sufficient to beat the enemy, and to
make way for other victories; that no^ much more time would be required to
vanquish them, to bereave them of all their maritine forces, and to make
themselves Masters of their Forts. That they were certain, these considerations
would make him use all possible speed and diligence, in making the Fleet ready.
And that if his departure must be somewhat later, then the business required,
doubtlesly it would be occasioned by the usual difficulties, which accompany
great actions. But that this small time which was let slip by necessity, might
easily be recovered by his ardent zeal, toward the good of the League, toward
his own glory, and toward the satisfaction of the Colleagues. Colonna said
almost the same things in the Pope's name, showing, that he was very ready to
favor the League, and very desirous to hear, that the Fleets were united. All
these things Don John seemed to take in good part, as answerable to his
intentions; he excused his past slownesse, out of several impediments, and
promised to use all possible diligence, in putting 100 galleys speedily in
order, and 24000 Foot of several Nations, which were assembling for the
service of the Fleet. But the effects were not answerable, for there were not
then above 64 galleys at Messina, and there was no news of the Duke of Sessa,
who was to bring those of Spain; and the old soldiers, who were ready to
embarck, being in arreers for pay* refused to come on board, unless they were
satisfied for their former service; for which, there was no course taken. Yet
the Venetian Commissary was held in hand with several hopes and promises, from
day to day; the which, that they might appear the more real, 3000 Italian Foot
were embarcked in 30 galleys, which were given in charge to the Neapolitan
General, it being given out, that he should go with them to Corfu, and there
expect the coming of the rest of the Fleet. Thus time was spun on till near
the end of June, nothing being all this while done against the enemy, nor was
there any thing resolved what should be done; the Pope's endeavors having
prevailed herein no more, than those of the Venetians. For Don John being often
solicited by Briefs, and by an express messenger, which was the Bishop
Odiscalco, sought to satisfy the Pope with good words, and hopes, affairs
being brought to that pass, as the Fleet was hallowed by the Bishop aforesaid;
and Processions and Orisons were made, and a certain day appointed for their
departure. But at last, Don John not knowing how to justify his so long delay,
or to gainsay so many pressures, wherewith he was hourly solicited, the
Marquise of Santa Crose being come with the Neapolitan galleys, and Don John di
Cordona, with those of Cicily, and his Admiral being already ready prepared,
which things had served before for some excuse, he was forced ^o discover the
truth; That he could not remove with the Fleet toward the Levant, by reason of
new orders that he had received from Spain, out of the fears which were had of
the French commotions, which had caused the keeping back of the Commissions,
and had made him keep those forces, where they might be ready to defend the
Kings Dominions. This order being made known, and the reason of the Fleets
suspension; whereby Soranz^ found, that it was in vain to persuade Don John, to
depart with his whole Fleet; and yet finding him well inclined to the good of
the League, that he might get as much good thereby as he could, he thought it
became him to endeavor the getting, at least some part of the Fleet, which
joining with the Venetians, the honor of the League might be preserved, and
the forces which were ready at Corfu for any enterprise, might be increased.
But to shun assenting that, without breach of League, those forces might be
detained, which were obliged to serve the common interests of the associates,
he wrought it so, as that proposal was made by Colonna; upon which, many
consultations being had, it was resolved, that 22 galleys should be permitted
to go to Corfu, and 5000 Foot, part whereof being to be had from Calaria, was
yet a further cause of delay. These galleys were given into the charge of Gil
d' Andrada, Knight of M^lta, with title of the King's General, Vicenzo
Tuttavilla having the command of the soldiers. With these, and with the
galleys of the Church, which were 13 in number, 11 of them belonging to the
Duke of Florence, and 2 to Michale Bonello, brother to Cardinal Alessandrino,
did Commissary Soranz^ return to Corfu, the whole Fleet coming along in
company to the Straits of Messina, from whence Don John past to Pa^ermo; and
when they were parted, Mark Antonio Colonna set up the Standard of the League,
supplying the place of General thereof. ^^is the Spaniards resolution being
published, every one firmly believed, that the enterprise of the Levant would
be no further proceeded in this year, by all the forces of the League: And the
Spanish Ambassador at Rome did already say, that the affairs in Flanders could
not be settled time enough, for the going of the Fleet into the Levant; and that
therefore the King would turn his forces into Africa, that they might not be
altogether idle, and to case Cicily of them for a while. This opinion was the
rather believed, by reason of many things that happened; and especially, for that
much provision was made upon the Spanish coasts, for refreshing the Fleet; and
because it was known for certain, that Muley Assam, King of Tunis, was
willingly listened unto, who then was with Don John, and affirmed, that those
people were very well disposed toward the Crown of Spain, and were ready to
rise, and put themselves under his subjection, if they should find any forces
to back their rebellion. This the Fleets suspension, afforded subject for
several discourses; some said, That the King, in making this League, had
respect to his own peculiar interests, since otherwise he could not have
obtained from the now present Pope, the confirmation of what was granted him by
Pius Quartus, of raising moneys from the Ecclesiastic goods, for which he was
bound to keep 100 galleys, to guard those seas; and that moreover he was
persuaded thereunto, out of other weighty considerations: For if the Venetians
only were to withstand the Turkish forces, and should peradventure make any
acquisition, they would get so much reputation at sea, as they might (...) with
him for power; and on the other side, if they should fare ill, and should
suffer in their Dominions, the Turks power would be so much the more increased,
and become infinitely formidable. And then again, if the Venetians should fail
in their hopes of such assistance, it might be believed, they would easily give
way to some agreement; and so those forces which were prepared against them,
might be turned Westward upon the Kings Dominions. That therefore having taken
upon him the common cause, upon these reasons, and bound himself out of these
respects to maintain it, he could not with any justice, turn those forces to
his own private and, which were before obliged to the common service of the
League. That the w^^s of Flanders was not any thing of new, whereby the King
should put on such a resolution; for that war was already begun, when the
League was stipulated. Nor were there even then wanting suspicions of
commotions in France; for the Agreement being made being made between the King
of France, and the King of Navar, and the Admiral, there was reason to
believe, that the French, who are naturally lovers of novelties, and who were
then long verst in Arms, would not keep quiet, but would betake themselves
thither, where they should find best opportunity to make war. Th^^ it was very
clear, that by the conventions of the League, each Confederate might of right
claim interest in the forces of the rest, upon requiring observance of the
Articles agreed upon. That before the League, it was in the Kings power, to
employ those assistances where, and when be pleased, but since he had freely,
of his own will, bound himself to limited time, and forces, he could not
regulate them according to his own occasions, (...) alter them, without the
Confederates consent. Others affirmed the contrary, that the Catholic King had
abundantly discharged the duty of a Christian Prince, and of a friend to the
Commonwealth of Venice, since, unobliged thereunto, he had readily assisted
the first year of this war, with all the sea-forces he was then master of, the
common service of Christendom, to the particular advantage of Venice. That it
wa^ in his choice, whether he would engage himself in this war or no, not being
thereunto enforced by necessity, or at least, that being unlimited, either in
point of time or forces, he might have governed himself according to his own
peculiar interests. That notwithstanding, he would engage himself with the
League, to make the Confederates confide the more in him, and that they might
have the better foundations, for designing their enterprises, which they were
to make against the enemy. That this had been the cause of very great good,
since the Colleagues forces being fastened together by this bond, and to the
same end, had gotten so great, and so famous a victory over the Turks. That
since the Kings interests were not like those of the Venetians, it was to be
highly valued, that he would suffer the Fleet to run the same has^^ds. That i^
ought not to be wondered at, if the King, having had so great a sha^e in this
victory, should endeavor to reap some particular advantage thereby, by sending
his Fleet, now that he had bereft the enemy of their power at sea, and that he
might safely do it, to the enterprises of Barbary, which were specified in the
Articles of the League, and which were so much desired by his poeple, to
bereave the Pirates of their receptacles, from which the Spanish Seas could by
no other means be secured. That it was much more lawful for him to make use
of his own Forces for the defense of his peculiar affairs, at a time when his
Confederates the Venetians, were in a great part free from being offended by
the enemy. What reason, what wisdom was there, that he should abandon his own
Dominions, to assault those of other men? and to suffer the like, or greater
dangers increase at home, that he might carry them to the Enemies? That it was
true, the Wars of Flanders was no new thing, but that the accidents were new,
which forced the King to think upon the preservation of those Countries,
wherein disorders, were multiplied, and the Enemies Forces increased.

These, and such like things, were alleged according to the variety of men's
judgments, and much more of their affections; but to the end, that the cause
of a business of such importancy, whereby the hopes of much good to
Christendom were interrupted, may be made known, it will not be far from our
purpose, that we acquaint you a little more particularly with the present
condition of affairs, and with the occasions of jealousies which arose between
the two most powerful Kings of France and Spain, in a very unseasonable time.
In the very beginning of this year, the Town of Mons, in Flanders, was lost,
and not long after, Count Nassaw took Valentiennes, with foreign foot, the most
whereof were French. And a little before the Duke of Alva had chased, and
routed a great many both foot and horse, of the same Nation, which went to
Garrisonize the Town of Mons.

These things, as they did much increase the danger of losing those Countries;
so did they beget great jealousy in the Spaniards, that so many French
Soldiers were brought into Flanders, not only by permission, but by order
from the King of France, which was the rather believed, for that the Duke of
Alva giving notice of these passages, to the Spanish Court, to Rome, and to
Millan, had much amplified the business, and caused many fears of greater
Commotions. Whereupon the Governor of Millan, the Spanish Ambassador at Rome,
and Cardinal Granville, exclaiming very much, and appearing to be full of
jealousies and fears, were the first reason why Don John staid at Messina,
openly discovering themselves to be so ill satisfied with the French, and the
French growing as jealous of the Spaniards, by reason of their speeches, and
proceedings, and fearing lest the Catholic Fleet might turn upon Provence to
their prejudice; they betook themselves to fortify Marcelles, and increased
the Garrisons thereof. It was also noysed abroad, that the Duke of Alva should
have said in public, that he held the War to be already begun between the
Crowns of France and Spain; at which speeches, the King of France being very
much troubled, he mediated by his Ambassadors, not only with the Pope, and
with the Venetians, but even with the King of Spain himself, complaining
partly, That a thing of such importancy should be affirmed by one of his
majesty's chief Ministers of State, which as he was very far from thinking of,
he thought he should find others to be so too; and partly seeking to justify
some of his actions, which might seem to have given occasion to these the Duke
of Alva's speeches. He therefore constantly affirmed, that those French with
whom the Count Nassaw had taken Valentiennes, were all of the Hughenot faction;
his subjects, but (as it was well known) co^^umacions, and rebels to the Crown
of France, that he had been always much displeased at the commotions of
Flanders, as one who was sensible of the peoples rebellion, in his own Kingdom,
and whom it became to obviate, not to (...) by such examples, the darings of
subjects against their Prince* and as one also who did at much desire the
exaltation of Christendom as did any one, though his particular troubles would
not permit him to act therein with others at so opportune a time. But though he
could not (...) therein with his Forces, he was far from hindering the good
actions of others; that he had armed some Vessels, not with intention to
prejudice any, but for the safety of his Seas, which were mightily infected by
Pirates; neither were those hit armed Vessels so many, as could make it be
suspected that he either could, or would fall upon any enterprises.

And that these his words might be the better believed, he published an Edict,
upon pain of punishment, prohibiting all his subjects to go armed into
Flanders, and placed guards in all places to hinder them if any contumacious
people (as he termed them) should be so bold as to countervene his orders: Nor
being herewithal content, he began at the same time to do several things,
whereby he seemed as if he himself would also enter into the League, making
the Cardinal of Louvain hold many discourses thereupon, with the Ambassador of
the Commonwealth, then resident in France, wherein he strove to make it be
believed, that the King of France was well inclined to the Peace, and to the
good of Christendom, and chiefly to the Crown of Spain: So as laying at last
all other respects aside, he would side with the League; and proceeding to
particular Agreement, he propounded several conditions; and chiefly to ratify
friendship and good intelligence, between him and the Catholic King, by
Marriages.

Though these things came to the Spaniards knowledge, yet were they not
satisfied therewith; but gave out, that the French did this, to work their ends
the more easily, by assaulting the King of Spain's Territories in several
parts, which were unprovided for them: that for certain, the Admiral, and the
King of Navarre, did publicly persuade the Christian King to this Rupture,
whose he would be forced to please for some other particular interests of his
own. That it was said by all the chief of that Court, that there could be no
quiet in France, till the King should resolve to fall upon some important
foreign Enterprise, wherein the Catholics and Hugenots were to be jointly
employed; and that it was clear enough, that the French thought this the
easiest of all other Enterprises, by reason of their convenience of assaulting
Flanders, and of strai^ning the Spanish Army in point of Victuals, as also in
respect of the difficulties the King of Spain should meet with, in relieving
his men. That the King of France might make this War, upon some appearing
pretentions of right, which the Crown of France has to these Countries,
wherein doubtedly the Queen of England would join both with mind and might; nor
was the League treated of by Monsieur de Mom^rancy, nay concluded (as some say)
with the English, to any other end, but that being free from all other
jealousies, they might the better mind the molesting of the Catholic King,
and therewith assault Flanders. That the Queens mind was sufficiently known by
her many no friendly actions, and especially for that the English did at this
time flock over in so great numbers into Holland and Zealand, wherein they had
already taken some Towns: That the ill will of that Queen, and of that Kingdom,
could be no longer concealed now, by whom, and from whence, though with much
secrecy and cunning, the Kings Rebels had been many ways assisted, and those
insurrections nourisht and fomented with several hopes, and some sums of Money.
Moreover, that the friendship which the French held with the Turks, afforded
more just reason for these suspicions; it being very likely that the French
might be now as much solicited to turn their Forces upon the Catholic King, as
they had often formerly obtained, that the Turks Fleet should proceed to the
prejudice of the said King: nay, that it was given out, that the more to invite
them thereunto, the Turks had granted the City of Tunis to the Crown of France,
upon being preserved by their forces from the Armies of Spain. The Pope was
much troubled at these things, as well for the great Concern of Christendom, as
in respect of his own credit, which seemed not to suffer a little, since the
conventions of the League were violated by the Fleets suspension, and therewith
his authority, who as Head thereof, had a little before established and
confirmed it: and he was the more scandalized thereat, for that many things
were in hand, which showed but little respect toward the Pontificiall Majesty,
whereof he was zealous above all other things, that it was not lawful for Don
John, being General of the League, to obey those orders of the Catholic King,
which did countervene the said League, not only without the Popes consent, but
without his knowledge, nay contrary to his express will: after having been so
often pressed by his Nuncio's to go from Messina, and join with the Venetian
Fleet; that it was to be considered, that that Fleet, being raised by moneys
drawn from the Clergy, or from others by the particular concession and
authority of the Apostolic Sea, as destined against the Turks, could not with
any reason be by the King turned elsewhere: Wherefore the Pope being anxiously
solicitous to have the Fleets join, he sent reduplicated Briefs to Don John, to
make him speedily depart, and exhorted the Venetians to dispatch away their
Ambassadors forthwith, to the Courts of Spain and France, to appease the
jealousies, and take away the diffidences which were risen between those Kings;
and particularly to move the Catholic King to grant them his Fleet, and not to
forgo the Articles of the League. To the same purpose, he sent Antonio Maria
Salviato, Bishop of St. Papolo, to the King of France, and dispatched away
Nicolo Ormaneto, Bishop of Padua, as his Nuncio to the Catholic Court. Caesar
interposed himself likewise herein, using his Authority with both the Kings,
to preserve peace and concord between them; being moved thereunto, either that
he might do what became a Christian Emperor, or else, knowing, that if these
commotions should go on, Peace with the Turks must ensue; whereby he, who lived
then secure and quiet, by reason of the dangers and troubles of others, might
have reason to suspect that the Turks might fall upon him: But the Venetians
were more fervent in these endeavors, than all the rest, as well because their
interest was most therein, as also not to make the Pope jealous, lest by their
not stirring in accidents of such concernment, they might rather intend Peace,
than War, which might make him grow cooler for the concerns of the League, who
knowing that by these proceedings, the Venetians might have reason to think of
agreeing with the Turks, encouraged them with many hopes, and exhorted them to
use the accustomed wisdom and moderation of that Senate, which would overcome
all difficulties; that they might not totally deprive themselves of the
advantage which they might receive the next year (in case the Fleets could not
conveniently join this year) by the more speedy provisions for War, and by the
King of Spain, who would then be free from troubles, and from such suspicions.
Iovanni Michiele, was chosen to be sent Ambassador to the King of France, and
Antonio Tiepolo, to the King of Spain; both which used all diligence, in going
to the Courts of those Kings.

Michiele said, how that the Venetian Senate had always greatly desired the
common good and peace between Christian Princes, which they did now the more,
for that the war undertaken against the Turks, the danger wherewith the
Commonwealth was threatened, as also all Christendom, made them the more
desirous to procure peace, and good intelligence between the Christian Princes,
that they might jointly turn upon the common Enemy. That for this cause, they
were much troubled at the insurrection of Flanders, and at the King of Spains
troubles; that their displeasure was not a little increased by the report which
was given out, of some suspicions, and State-jealousies, which were risen
between the Crowns of France and Spain; by which it might be feared, that if
these thoughts should take deeper root, an open breach might from thence
proceed, to the great prejudice of Christendom; which (if it should meet with
no impediment) might be in a gallant and safe condition. But by how much the
more grievous, and of greater importance the business was, the less was it
believed by the Senate, who very well knew the wisdom of that King, and his
well-wishing toward the common good. Yet because the persuasions of such as
are no friends to peace, and for their own interests seek to disturb it, do
often divert Princes from their good intentions; the Senate would not be
wanting in making use of that favor, which they persuaded themselves they
partook of from his Majesty, in exhorting him not to listen to such discourses,
when they should be propounded; or that if he had had any such intentions
hitherto, that for the good of Christendom, and for the particular advantage of
their Commonwealth, he would lay aside all such thoughts, and totally convince
the Catholic King, so as being free from all such jealousies, he might mind
the business of the Levant, and observe the Articles of the League. The King
listened graciously hereunto, and took it in good part; saying, That the Senate
was not at all dec^ived, in the good affection which he bore to the
Commonwealth, nor in their belief of his well-wishing to the good of
Christendom. That he had been always troubled at the commotions of Flanders,
and that he had still endeavored, to keep those insurrections from being
fomented by his subjects. But that the condition of those times was such, and
the state wherein his Kingdom then was, as be could not curb the insolency of
such, as were desirous of novelty; who having endeavored to work confusion in
his Kingdom, it was no wonder, if contrary to his orders, they were gone into
other States, to perturb the affairs of other men. And some Court Lords, to
free men from such suspicio^s, were of opinion, that he should wink at these
things, which did not now concern the Crown of France, which was sensible of
the prejudice which Princes receive, from the unbri^led licentiousness of
people, cloaked under the name of just liberty; which could no otherwise be
hurtful to him, then violent exercise is to an infirm body. That he knew this
might be prejudicial to the Catholic King, without any advantage to France;
way, not without fear, of putting her into new troubles and dangers; for that
these commotions might very likely make the King of Spain agree with the
Flemmish, with intention peradventure of assaulting Dolphine, or the Kingdom of
Navar: So as, instead of carrying the war to other men's doors, they might be
enforced to make war at home, at a time, when the forces of the Kingdom,
through so many* and so long civil dissentions, were divided and weakened. But
of all others, the Queen Mother (who bore then almost the chiefest authority in
the Kingdom) seemed greatly desirous to preserve peace, and would therefore
with her own hand write to the Pope, attesting this her desire, and professing
her self ready to follow his good advice. And that though there were some
provision of Arms made, they were never intended to make use of them, to the
prejudice of others, but only in their own defense; fearing lest the
Spaniards, for the injuries which they causlesly affirmed they had received
from the French, might invade his Kingdom. Where it is worth consideration, how
great the jealousies of States are, and how easily Princes are more subject
then other men, to every impression of various affections. The Catholic King
feared, that the French would make war upon him, and desired peace. The
Christian King desired to keep fair with the Spaniards, but apprehended, lest
their forces, which were prepared against others, might be turned upon his
Kingdom. Both these Princes were busied in other affairs, and were therefore
better pleased with Agreement, and each of them feared, the other would break
it. And yet those vain jealousies, which seemed to tend to the quiet and safety
of their affairs, did in a manner afford occasion of many troubles, and of
great prejudice.

But the Catholic King was resolved, before the Ambassador Tiepolo came to
his Court, to send to Don John, that laying aside all other respects, he should
forthwith go, with all the galleys that he had with him, and join with those
of the Venetians; and when the Fleets should be met, that he should immediately
pass on to the Levant; being hereunto moved, either that he might the better
know the King of France his mind toward him; or that he did fear his forces
the less, after the recovery of Valentiannes, and other prosperous successes,
which ensued in Flanders; or that he better understood the inconvenience and
prejudice, which upon other occasions might arise to his affairs, it having
made much for the reputation of the French amongst the Turks, by his seeming to
be so concerned in all they did, as that he was thereby enforced to abandon his
other enterprises; or else, for that as a just and wise Prince, he thought it
did in no way become him, to abandon the Articles of the League. But were it
one, or more of these reasons, that moved him thereunto, it was then said for
certain, that this resolution arose from his own mere will; for he had
dispatched this order away to Don John, before he communicated it to his
Counselors, fearing lest they might have propounded somewhat, which might have
diverted him from doing so, as had formerly happened. But when Antonio Tiepolo
was come to that Court, being now no more to speak of the jealousies of France,
nor of the joining of the Fleets; he, according to his Commission, desired the
King only, That since the best season for actions at sea was now well nigh
over, he would give Don John leave (in case the occasion of affairs should so
require it) to winter abroad in the Levant, showing, that great advantage might
be made thereby; for their Islands would by this means be eased of the burden,
which was now become grievous and insupportable, of having so long nourished so
great a Fleet; which burden would be laid upon the enemies countries, from
whence they might easily be furnished with abundance of victuals. Moreover,
they would the sooner, and more easily, prosecute any thing, which they should
either have beg^n, or should intend to do. The courage also of those which were
risen, would thereby be augmented, and others would be invited to do the like,
the enemy would be driven to within the straits of Constantinople, and they
would be hindered from coming forth early, to prejudice Christians, as they had
done the preceding years; and, in fine, the League would thereby get great
reputation in all things, and the enemy dishonor. But he concealed somewhat
from the King, which moved the Venetians as much as any other reason, to desire
this, which was, that by this, the Spaniards would be made forgo their so
highly vallued interests, in the African enterprises, and by laying aside those
thoughts, would be brought to mind the common affairs in the Levant the more.
But all this did no good; for the King alleging many reasons to the contrary,
would not give way thereunto, following therein either his own inclination,
which was, not to hasard too much to fortune; or else the persuasion of those,
who liked not the League. But howsoever, this advice was not much liked, it
being thought, that thereby occasion for great good successes, if they should
be favored by fortune, would be taken away; and that Don John ought not to
have been limited, in his Commissions granted him, as General of the associate
Princes; which were, that he should endeavor to do, whatsoever might make for
the advantage of the League, which was questionlesly known, would be very
great, by wintring in the enemies Countries in the Levant. Don John had been
persuaded formerly to this very thing, wherein the Pope likewise interposed his
authority. But he, not being willing to determinate it of himself, had referred
the consideration thereof to Spain, which was an evident sign that his common
Orders were limited, and restrained by particular Commission.

Whilst Christian Princes were thus employed, and whilst the League pro^^eded
very slowly, the Turkish Fleet was already very numerous, and powerful at sea;
for Uluzzali, who was declared General at sea, had with great diligence rig'd
up 100 galleys, besides those former, which (as has been said) were gone under
the command of Carozzali, wherewith he likewise parted from the straits of
Galipoli* And when the whole Fleet was met, he made forward, with intention to
pillage the Island of Candia, and to do other prejudice to the parts belonging
to the Venetians, according as he should hear news of the Christian Fleets
proceedings* At which time, certain word being come to Venice, of the
suspension of the Spanish Fleet, great sorrow was seen in all men, their wonder
increasing together with their sorrow, that the Spaniards, who seemed at first
to desire the League, should, when it was concluded, and so many difficulties
were overcome; nay, when they saw their hopes were great, deptive themselves of
the present, and assured advantage, which they might have by the League, for
fear of dangers which were uncertain, and far off; and that they should give
occasion of dissolving it, when they ought to have confirmed it, and establish
it with more forces and confidence. So as, seeing they could not penetrate into
their secret designs, nor thinking it fit to ground any thing upon such helps,
the Senate resolved, to order General Foscherini, that waiting no longer for
the joining of the Fleets, he should, as soon as Commissary Soranzo should be
returned from Corfu, advance with their own forces, for the consolation and
safety of their subjects and affairs; and that proceeding with caution and
circumspection, he should do as he should see occasion, for Gods glory, and the
good of the Commonwealth. Therefore when Foscheri^i had received this order,
being impatient of lying so long idle; as soon as Colonna, and Commissary
Soranzo were come to Corfu, he began without any further delay, to endeavor
the Fleets departure toward the Levant, that they might approach the enemy:
Wherein finding all men willing, a Council was called, wherein, to boot with
the three Generals, P^mpeo Colonna, Lieutenant to Mark Antonio, and Commissary
Sor^nzo, did intervene. Mark Antonio, with much freedom and affection, declared
himself to be very affectionate to the League, and particularly to the good and
greatness of the Commonwealth, showing his sorrow for the time they had lost,
and for the forces which fell so short of what was hoped for. He,
notwithstanding, encouraged them to hope well; saying* Th^^ the Catholic Kings
good intentions were very well known to him, as also the Popes ferven^y in
soliciting him: Wherefore, if the jealousies of France should cease, they might
be sure Don John would come, and join with them, with the rest of the ^leet.
But that howsoever, though he were the Pope's servant, and the King's vassa^l,
he was ready to fall upon the enterprise, which might rend to the particular
service of the Venetians, whose interests and dangers ^e knew was most
concerned therein. Hereupon General ^oscherini said: That the Pope's and the
Catholic King's good will, was sufficiently manifested likewise to his
Commonwealth, as also the like of his Commonwealth toward those Princes, and
toward the League, as might be witnessed by the way she had proceeded in, and
did still proceed in, as concerning this business: And that Colonna 's
gallantry, and his affection to the Commonwealth, as also his desire to be
serviceable to Christendom, was manifestly known, not only in particular to
the Venetians, but throughout the whole world, by the so many services he had
don the Commonwealth, to the honor and advantage of the League. Yet he could
not but be sorry, that fortune had advanced such occasions, as that effects
answerable to this general good intention, were not seen to be continued. But
that since it was in (...) to lament what was past, and which could not be
recalled; and that likewise it was not in their power to remove the
impediments, which detained Don John in Sicily. The only remedy for such great
mischiefs, was, to seek to outdo themselves, (if it were possible) in hasting
to what they had to do; which be it what it would, he put them in mind, and
did advise them, it could not be of more advantage, then to go and encounter
with the enemies Fleet, which doubtlesly for number, as also in many other
considerations, was much inferior to theirs. And that peradventure it had
happened by divine providence, which oft-times brings our actions to their
predestined end, by ways unknown to human wisdom, that the Colleagues Fleet
should be so separated, to the end, that being therefore less min^full of
their affairs, and apprehending no encounter, the enemy should afford them that
means of finding them out, and fighting them; which if they had known they had
been to withstand the whole forces of the League, they would easily have
prevented. And if it should so fall out, as, that upon the approach of the
Christian Fleet, the Turks should retire, it was not to be lightly esteemed,
that they had so confirmed the reputation of the League, and secured the work
which they had undertaken, and were resolved to do, whether the rest of the
Catholic Fleet came or came not. Colonna soon yielded to Foscherini's opinion,
giving many reasons, why nothing of more profit could be attempted, then what
was now proposed. But he was of opinion, and did desire, that being to proceed
against the enemy, they should go with all their forces joined together, the
greater and lesser galleys keeping still together in company, which the season
of the year afforded them great convenience to do, by reason of the Northern
winds, which do blow almost continually at that time of the year. But
Gelandrada did neither totally commend, nor totally discommend this advice; he
told them, They were to proceed with much circumspection, and not to hasard a
business of such concernment, unnecessi^^ted, or at least, without great
occasion. Adding, that they should first endeavor to have some news of the
enemy, of their forces, and what way they steered; and then to put on that
resolution, if they should be persuaded thereunto by more certain information.
But he chiefly commended the counsel, of carrying the ships along with them,
as well to increase their forces, as also not to be distressed for want of
victuals, and not to leave them at the discretion of fortune, and the enemy.
At last he concluded, that he would not dissent from the opinion of the rest,
showing himself to be very well inclined to do any thing, which might be for
the common service. So as it was agreed upon, by general consent, that the
Fleet should forthwith part from Corfu, which consisted then of 126 smaller
Galleys, 6 Galliasses, and 20 ships; and every Gally had in them 150 Soldiers.
The whole Fleet was divided into three parts; the three Generals kept in the
midst with 45 Galleys, the other were equally divided into two wings.
Commissary Soranzo led on the right wing, and Canale the left; the Van, and
re-leefe, was reserved for the Candy Galleys, which were hourly expected. Two
Galliasses, and part of the Ships, did tow on each squadron of the lesser
galleys, with order to guide them to the front of the Fleet, whenever it
should be needful; it being resolved in Council, that without these, they
should not join battle.

At this time, when the Fleet was ready to hoist sail, a Frigate sent speedily
from Palermo to the Venetian General, from Placido Ragazzoni, who dealt
concerning Corn for the Commonwealth in Sicily, arrived, by which he sent
news, that a Spanish Gally was come to Messina, which brought positive order to
Don John, for the joining together of the whole Fleet, which was not long after
confirmed by Letters from Don John's self, to Mark Antonio Colonna, whereby he
gave him notice of this new Commission received from the King, and of his
readiness to obey it; and that he would come forthwith with the rest of the
Fleet, to find him out: But he desired, that in the interim, the news of his
coming should be published, to keep the Grecians who were up, in their
Loyalty, and that without undertaking any thing wherein the reputation of the
League might be endangered, they should only mind the thwarting of the
Enemies designs, and the securing of the Venetian Territories: though all were
much joy'd at this news, yet they thought it ought not to hinder or retard the
departure of the Fleet, which was already resolved on: So as on the 28 of July,
the three Generals parted from the Gomenizze, where they staid, awhile, to
expect Commissary Canale, who was gone with 16 Galleys to Ottranto, to take in
3000 foot, who were there ready for the Fleet, under the conduct of Colonel
Horatio Aquaviva, Son to the Duke of Atri; which when they were come, were
distributed into the Spanish Galleys, into those of the Church, and into the
Venetian Ships. Before they went from this place, Iovanni Mocenico, one who was
diligent, and well practiced in Sea affairs, was dispatched away with his Gally
toward Candia, to give notice of the coming of the Christian Fleet, and to
learn some news of the Enemy, of whom nothing of certainty was as then known,
neither concerning their numbers, nor their voyage. The Leagues Fleet being on
their way, 13 Galleys came in unto them, as they entered into the channel of
Viscardo, which Commissary Quirini brought from Candia, and pursuing their
course from thence, they came with a prosperous wind in two days to Zante: No
assured advertisment of the Enemies proceedings being brought thither (as they
hoped for) and they being to tarry there two days to take in fresh water; they
dispatched away three other Galleys, to find out where the Enemy were. Uluzzali
was at this time come to underneath the fort of Malvasia, and had with him
about 200 ^ail, his number being increased by the access of many Pirates
Vessels, which came in unto him in his voyage. Wherefore after having for a
while scoured the Archipelagus, he was come to this place, wi^h an intention to
pillage the Island of C^ndi^, and then to pass to Br^zzo di Maina, to curb
those people which were risen up in favor of the Christians. But hearing that
the Christian Fleet did advance, which he thought would not have departed from
Corfu, (for he had been informed, that it was divided) he recalled some
Galleys, which in pursuit of his first design, he had sent to Cupo M^li^, and
returned together with his whole Fleet, to underneath the fort of Malv^sia,
where he staid expecting more particular information of our Fleet. But when he
was told, that it still advanced, and was already got near the Island of
Cirigo; and that it came shore of ^his Fleet for number of lesser Galleys,
though it were very strong in great Vessels, he resolved to put to Sea, and to
encounter it. Having therefore called together his Officers, and other chief
persons which were in the Fleet; it is said he spoke thus unto them.

We have great occasion offered us, to win much favor with the Grand Signor,
and glory with all men, if we know how to acknowledge it, and to make use
thereof. We are informed, that for certain, the Christian Fleet is divided; and
that the Venetian General comes forward with a very small number of Galleys,
being drawn by shame, and by necessity to succor we Kingdom of Candia; but
(for as far as may be imagined) with a mind far from fighting; bringing along
with him so many great Vessels, to keep himself from being assaulted by us;
whose forces it may easily be known, by their delay, and by their irresolute
counsels they are afraid of* I am therefore of opinion, that without further
delay, we put to Sea, and go where we may meet the Enemy, and may have means to
give them battle. This ad^^ce, as it is full of Generosity and Glory, so may it
be very advantageous: nor does it want such assuredness, as a wise Commander,
in the condition which we are in, ought to have regard unto, it will doubtlesly
redound much to the reputation of the Ottaman Empire, to the honor of her
Commanders, and of our whole Nation, that after so great a rout at Sea, happened
by misfortune, we have notwithstanding retained so much worth and courage, and
preserved so many forces, as that we have come forth the very next summer, with
so powerful and gallant a Fleet, as has not been afraid to face the Enemy,
and to ^ight them, as being desirous once more to make trial of every man's
valor, and of the fortune of War. None can deny, but that, great praise and
glory is to ensue from hence; and certainly the profit, nay the necessity
thereof, is no less, nor no less evident, which persuades us to this
resolution, or which (to say better) does thrust, and force us upon it. For if
we keep here idle, it is no doubt but that our enemies, grown insolent by their
victory, and being the bolder by our fear, will either come to find u^ out, to
try whether they can fight us upon advantage, and to increase their reputation,
boasting that they are come to fight us at our own doors; or else they will
fall upon some of the grand Signors Dominions, wherein the defendants being
discouraged by our cowardlinesse, they will the eastier prevail: but if we go
boldly to meet them, (a thing which peradventure they look not for at this
time) who sees not that this their beat being cooled by our unexpected
encounter, they will tack about, and losing courage, will rather think of
securing themselves, and their own affairs, than of indangering those of other
men? ^hus will all the shores of these Seas be kept from being injured by the
Enemy, all whose designs we shall frustrate; for seeing us come forth to follow
them, they will not dare to fall upon any Enterprise, lest we should assault
them. All the experience in Sea-affairs, which I have got in so many years,
tells me, that we may get this honor, and this advantage safely, and without
hazarding our Fleet: for the Enemy have not dared to advance and approach us,
out of any confidence they have in the number of their Galleys, or in their
soldiers valor, wherein they come far enough short of us: but only confiding
in those great Galleys, and many ships which they bring along with them;
behind which they think they may keep from being assaulted by us, as sheltred
by so many strong Bulworks; so as it is clear enough, the matter of fighting
will always be in our po^er, they not being able to force us to fight, unless
we will, though we may force them: for they not being well able to govern those
great Vessels at their plea^ure, and for their convenience; but being to be at
the pleasure of the wind, and at the discretion of fortune, and being
unwilling to part from them, so to be deprived of that stout and safe defense;
who is not aware with what advantage we may face them, and offer them battle;
and then do, not as chance, or necessity shall enforce us, but what the reason
of War shall persuade us unto? nor ought we be any whit terrified, or removed
from doing this, by the last years unfortunate success: for it is well known,
that it was not the valor of our enemies, but our own disorders, which
occasioned that ruin; and (if I may be permitted to say so) the rashness of
our Commanders, who by hasting too much to fight, made us expose our selves
inconsiderately, to the great shot of the Galliasses, so as we entered the
Battle, being divided, and in confusion; by which example being now taught, we
shall the better know how to govern our Fleet, and to know our advantages, and
disadvantages, and not commit our selves foolishly to the will of blind
fortune. Let us then forget that ill luck, and all fear that may arise from
thence* and if we will be mindful of that had success, why should we not
likewise call to mind, the so many, and so famous victories which the
Musselmans have bad both by Sea and Land, over the Christians? in so much as
there is not any part in Europe, which has not been noted for calamities
caused by us, and for the glory of the Ottaman Empire. We ought assuredly to be
confident therefore, that fortune which does accompany the valor of our
Nation, and which is always a friend to this happy Empire, has suffered it to
receive this one blow, not to imbase it, but that by governing it self well in
adversity, and showing the excellency of its orders, and its soldiers worth,
it may rise to greater glory. These reasons are sufficient to make you applaud
and embrace this my proposal, certainly a generous longing to revenge the
injuries received from these insolent and ignoble Enemies, and to recover that
reputation which they boast they have berest us of, scorning, reviling, and
dispising us, as if by one bare victory they had quite overthrown the powerful
Ottaman Empire, must be of some force with military men. He who does not resent
these things, merits not the name of a Soldier: but methinks, I see you all so
inflamed with desire of carrying the Fleet from out this Haven, and so full of
good hopes, as prosperous success must needs accompany us. Therefore let us,
without any further delay, put our Galleys in order, and not suffer the Enemy
to prevent our designs.

Uluzzali accompanying these his words with action, made all things fitting be
immediately prepared, and sailed toward Cape Malio. In this interim, two of
the Galleys which were sent out to that purpose, brought word to our Fleet,
which was already gotten to the Island of Cerigo, that Uluzzali was with about
200 sail under Malvasia. This news being come, and it being thought, that since
the enemy was so near, they could not without going less in honor, pretermit
the opportunity which was given them, of finding them out, and of offering them
battle; the three Generals did jointly resolve to steer their course toward
Cape Malio; and that when they should come within sight of the Enemy, they
should advance and present them battle. This advice being followed, the Fleet
came to the head of the Island Cerigo, to the place called, le Dragoniere, that
they might be the nearer Cape Malio, the better to observe the proceedings of
the enemy, and make use of any occasion that should be offered. For they could
not design to assault them in a place of safety, where they were strong, as
well for the shot that might be made at our Galleys, out of the Castle of
Malvasia; as also for the difficulty they should have of bringing the greater
Vessels thither, and in ordering them, wherein our chiefest hopes of victory
lay, if the enemy ought to be fought with.

Whilst they were in this place, the Turkish Fleet was discovered on the
seventh day of August, in the morning, by the guards which were placed upon the
Mountain: which Fleet being already past the point of Cape Malio, a Promontory
of Morea, anciently called Malea, and following the coast of the Vatica, sailed
toward the channel of Cerigo: which way of theirs not being above ten miles
from our Fleet, it was thought they advanced with an intention of fighting;
which our Generals hearing, they caused the sign of battle be given to the
whole Fleet by the sound of Trumpet, and by setting up their standards in their
galleys; being very diligent in disposing of all things, in ordering their
squadrons, and in making the ships and greater galleys advance forward, that
they might withstand the first encounter of the Enemy. And though a contrary
wind began to blow a little from the North, the whole greater Fleet was by
force of towing, brought to the place designed, and very well disposed of. In
which order the Fleet being come from fort^ the Rocks of the Dragoniere, it
sailed toward the coast of Cape Malio, taking a fitting place to present
battle to the Enemy; who at the first seemed not as if they would refuse it:
But as soon as the Fleets drew nearer, were it either that the Enemy thought
the number of our Vessels to be more, which being distended in good order, took
up a great space, and made a terrible show of Battle; or that the Enemy were
terrified at the courage of our men: (if it be not truer, that Uluzzali had
neither Commission, nor mind to fight, seeming only to desire it, that he
might gain reputation) altering their course, they made toward the Island de
Cervi, which is a Rock not far from that Promontory, from whence they were last
come; and sailing in a close order, and drawing still nearer Land, they went
further off from our men; which it was thought Uluzzali did, for that (being an
excellent Mariner) he would stay for a western wind, which usually in that
season blows in those parts, that so he might afterward have the advantage of
a forewind, to assault our Fleet: Which the Commanders of the Christian Fleet
foreseeing, they designed that their ships (which lay over against the great
galleys on the left hand) as soon as the enemies galleys should be past by,
they should hoist all their sails, and assault the Enemy with a ^ore-winde: But
the wind blowing at South-East, Uluzzali was forced to take an other course;
and making toward the Western point of the Island of C^rigo, he crossed the
channel which runs between the Islands of Cervi and Cerigo: So as the one end
of his Fleet reaching to Cerigo, and the other to Cervi, it enclosed all that
space of Sea, which is about ten miles in length; and turning their
fore-Castles toward our Fleet, they stood expecting it, having put themselves
in order for battle, in three great squadrons, all of an equal number of
Vessels; which delay of the Enemy made much for the advantage of our men, for
they had thereby opportunity to order themselves the better; so as the wind
becoming good afterward, they made forward with the whole Fleet to assault
the Enemy: And they were already come so near, as they made many shot at each
other, it being undoubtedly thought that the battle would be that day fought,
and that that action would decide what the fortune and end of the whole War
would be. But the wind beginning to slacken, our men could not advance,
without severing the greater Vessels from the less, and so part from their
first firm resolution. And on the other side, Uluzzali, keeping constant to his
opinion, not to come near the Ships nor Galliasses, stirred not from the place
where he was. There were then in the Turkish Fleet, above 200 sail, of which
160 well armed Galleys, very yare and fit for action; the rest were lesser
Vessels, mixed together with the Galleys in the battle, and in each wing. There
were not above 127 small galleys in the Christian Fleet, but they had six
Galliasses, and 22 Ships, excellently well manned, and furnished with Artillery:
so as each Fleet exceeding the other in some kind, and coming short in some
other, the Fleets were justly counterpoised. This advantage, and disadvantage
being very well known to both parties, was the cause why the Fleets, though
they were so near, did not join Battle; since the greatest and most certain
hope of victory was reduced to industry, and to endeavoring to draw each other
to fight upon the advantage of such forces wherein each did exceed the other.

Uluzzali endeavored therefore by several means, to shun incountring with the
greater Vessels, and to deprive the lesser Galleys of their assistance; and
taking the advantage of the Lee-shore, he intended for as much as was
conceived, to keep himself from shot of the greater Vessels, and to assault
our left wing either on the Poop, or Flank: But Commissary Canale, who
commanded that wing, preventing him, blockt up the passage, and deprived him of
that opportunity: Wherefore Uluzzali trying to work his intent by some other
means, commanded 25 of his yarer galleys, to go from the part that was nearest
the Island of Cervi, and to assault our right Wing, which was commanded by our
Commissary General, hoping to disorder it; and by drawing other of our galleys
to defend it, to engage all our lesser galleys in fight, far from the ships and
galleasses, which being totally becalmed, lay unmovable. But Commissary
Soranzo, resolving valiantly to withstand those that came to assault him,
before they should be come nearer him, repulsed them by frequent shot; and
making them retire toward their other Squadrons, began to pursue them close,
and to endanger them, and was followed by the Fleet; but they were forced to
proceed slowly, by reason of so much towing: So as many hours being spent, and
our men not being able to advance faster with their joint forces; and the enemy
not willing to accost them, before he had divided them; when the Sun began to
set, Uluzzali, secured by the coming on of night, and by the great smoke of
the Artillery, began to make his galleys be towed back by little and little,
yet turning their Prowes; but at last, he took the advantage of the point of
the Island Cerigo, and turning his Prow, he launched out into the sea, and got
quite out of the sight of our men, and out of danger; our men not being able to
follow them any further, by reason of the slownesse of towing, and of the
weariness of their men; nor could they well discern then what course he took,
as well by reason of the obscurity of night, as also by a stratagem which he
used in his flight, having sent one Gally, with a light in the lant-horn, quite
another way, than whither he went with his whole Fleet, to make it be believed,
that he was gone the same way. But the next morning, the enemy was kend to be
toward Brazzo di Maina. Our men having kept the most part of that night at
sea, went to the North Cape of the Island of Cerigo, to take in water, and to
afford some rest to their wearied Rowers; where having tarried that day, and
part of the next (for they understood by their Guards from land, that the
enemies Fleet was discovered to be not far off) they speedily embarcked their
men, and went to where they heard the Turkish Fleet was; which not being to be
found any where that day, our Fleet kept all that night at sea in very good
order. But on the tenth of August, the enemy were discovered to be upon the
Cape Matapan, who keeping their Galleys with their Forecastles toward land,
kept about the coast on both sides the Cape. Uluzzali seeing himself found out
by our Fleet, gave warning by shot of Cannon to his Galleys which lay furthest
off, to come closer together, and suddenly put himself in order, being
especially cautious, not to put himself in such a place, as he might be forced
to fight with our greater vessels; wherefore he took a great circuit, keeping
his two wings half a mile distant from the body of the Battle, wherein he kept
in the midst: He faced our Fleet which came toward him, in somewhat a closer
order, expecting that our Generals, allured by hopes of an easy victory,
should pass forwards, beyond their ships and galliasses, to fight his Squadron,
whilst it was divided, and severed from his other galleys. And in the mean
while, the two Wings of the enemy, taking a large compass, seemed as if they
would encompasse our men, and assault them on the back, out of danger of our
greater vessels, so as they should not be able to assist our Generals, if
they should come to conflict with their middle Squadron. Which design being
found out by our Commanders, orders were forthwith sent to those that were in
both the Wings, that observing vigilantly what course the enemy should steer,
and keeping their Forecastles still turned toward them, they should not suffer
them to pass beyond our Fleet. Thus each Fleet facing the other always in all
parts, they were already come within Canon-shot. At this so great a pinch,
General Foscherini, being ambitious of praise, and of doing somewhat, which
might be answerable to the opinion of his conceived gallantry, took a small
boat, going sometimes to one place, sometimes to another, and endeavoring to
be every where; he ordered, commanded, provided for all things necessary: He
desired the governors and captains of the galleys, to be careful of
themselves, and to remember the last year's happy success; saying, That these
were those very enemies, who, not many months ago, were with so much glory
overcome by them in Battle; nay, that they were the poorest, and least
courageous amongst them; for all the ables^, and most generous, were slain in
the last Battle, and those that escaped were full of fears. That the very
reputation of the late victory, would assuredly be sufficient to fight for
them, against cowed people, and who had lost their courage by the bad success
of the last Battle; whose Admiral would be the first that should teach them to
fly, as it became his trade of Pyracy, and as he had done in the last fight.
That there was not any, who had not earnestly desired, to have an opportunity
of fighting the enemy, believing, that therein lay the chief difficulty, of
getting another no less famous victory. That this opportunity was by divine
Providence now offered them, when they did most desire it, and looked least for
it. That if they should now again suffer the enemy to escape away safe, when
their forces were so weak, they might in vain seek an occasion hereafter, of
suppressing them; for growing in time more powerful, and more bold, they would
bereave them of the occasion, or of the easiness of other victories; nay, they
might deprive them of the fruit of that victory, which they had already gotten.
Therefore the end of that war, and the fortune of the Commonwealth, for some
ages, did depend upon that days success. If they valued their own glory, the
good of their country, the exaltation of Christendom, let them now fall boldly
upon the enemy, since they had that now before their eyes, which was able to
inflame poorly spirited men, much more such as were noble and generous. But
that if any one should be otherwise minded, let him know, the enemy was so
near, a^ there was neither time nor means now left, of shunning the Battle,
wherein their safety and glory did wholly consist. With these and the like
speeches, did General F^scherini strive to encourage all to Battle: And in the
mean time, our Fleet advanced jointly together, with much courage, hoping to
fight the Squadron wherein Uluzzali was, and to beat him, before he could be
succored by his other Wings, which were gone far off. But we were forced to
proceed very slowly, and not without some disorder, as well by reason of towing
on the ships, the wind being wholly ceased; as also, that our Wings could not
be well adjusted, being to stand opposite to those of the enemy, which (as has
been shown) had taken a large compass. Yet the Fleets drew still nearer,
especially on the side toward the sea, which answered to our right Wing, and
to the enemies left. Commissary Soranzo, who was the foremost of his Squadron,
against which the enemy came, advanced speedily, with some of the yarest
galleys of the first Squadron, to fight the enemies galleys, before they should
be able to join with their companions. These, not seeming as then to shun the
encounter, kept on their course, and came within shot of ours; but finding
afterward, that Soranzo did valiantly advance to fall upon them* they stayed a
while, expecting relief from some other galleys of their Squadron, which were
already got very near them; which made Commissary Soranzo do the like: so as
the enemy, who (as was palpably seen) did abhor the conflict, had time to
retreat, being much endammaged by shot from our Galleys, giving way manifestly,
and being driven from their first station. But our left Wing, the enemy being
fallen further off on that side, had likewise taken a larger compass, so as it
was neither so near as to fight the enemy, nor could it so soon return to its
place, and join with the body of our Battle, as was requisite, for their
advancing jointly against the enemy. Things being reduced to this condition,
and the North-west wind beginning to blow, which was contrary to us, it was
clearly seen, we could not possibly come to Battle that day, unless we should
advance with our smaller Galleys, and leave our greater Vessels behind. The
Venetian General desiring very much to fall on, speaking aloud to the other
Generals, whose Galleys were near him: What mean we, said he, that we do not
boldly advance? Why do we not forego this impediment of the greater vessels,
whereby we must always be guided by fortune, and by our enemies pleasure?
Shall we suffer the victory to escape as once more? Occasion invites us to
alter our resolution, let us make use thereof whilst we may. We must be bold,
and hope well. Foscherini thought it was the best and safest way to advance,
for that they might make advantage of the cunning, which the enemy sought to
use against them, by assaulting their middle Squadron, before the rest could
come together, and put themselves in Battle array. And if the enemy should
continue their first intention, their ships, which the enemy would never dare
to approach, would secure them from the danger of being assaulted on the back.
But the rest of the Generals, neither totally consenting to, nor dissenting
from this proposition, saying only* That it was contrary to the resolution
which they had maturely taken; and that the time would not permit new
counsels; the Fleet continued to advance, though but slowly; and the smaller
galleys and galleasses passing by the ships, went boldly forward toward the
enemy: but the wind growing stronger, not only the ships, but the galleasses,
which did before advance without towing, were forced to ^arry behind; so as
making very slowly forward, Uluzzali had opportunity to retire with leisure,
and in good order, with all his Squadrons joined together. And the better to
dissemble his retreat, he for a while made his gally be towed backward by the
Poop, till being gotten out of our sight, he thought he might safely wheel
about, and launching out into the sea, get (as he did) into a place of safety.
These successes might, as it was thought, teach a new and useful lesson,
concerning the Militia of the sea; That as greater vessels are of much safety,
by reason of their strength, so they may occasion great inconvenience and
prejudice, since they who are to make use of them, must always depend upon the
pleasure of the wind, and upon the Enemie's will. For this cause, Uluzzali,
who had been long accustomed to sea-exercises, when he came from Malvesia, made
use of the men only that were in his Maone, or ships of burden, to recruit
therewith his lesser galleys, leaving the vessels themselves behind, to shun
the necessity, either of abandoning them, or of governing himself according to
the will and convenience of others. The Christian Fleet, the Turks being past
beyond Cape Matapan, and they not being able to pursue them any further, by
reason of the contrary wind, and weariness of their men, retired to the
Island of Cerigo, where lying at sea the first night, it came the next morning
underneath the Fort, the ships lying a little without.

Whilst our Fleet stayed here, news came, that Uluzzali had taken one of our
Frigates, by whom having notice of Don John's coming, he prepared to go to
where the Spanish Fleet was to pass, intending (as being much stronger) to
fight it. At which, Colonna, and Gil d' Andrea being very much troubled, they
propounded, that all other respects being laid aside, they might immediately go
with all their lesser Galleys, to meet Don John, and to free him from danger.
But the Venetian Commanders were absolutely against this, considering, That to
avoid an uncertain danger, that Fleet must be exposed to manifest
inconvenience, to the hasard of the whole forces of the League; for the greater
vessels not being able to part from Cerigo, by reason of the contrary winds,
nor having any haven there, wherein they might be safe, they must be a certain
prey to the enemy. Nor could the lesser galleys be free from the like fear,
their number being lessened, and want^ng the assistance of the ships and
galleasses, wherein they had so far placed the security and safety of that
Fleet, as they thought all opportunities unseasonable without them, though
accompanied with much hope of overcomming the enemy. They urged moreover, that
it was very like, that they, keeping all their forces joined together, and
observing Uluzzali's way, they might, by following the same trak, keep him in
such jealousies, and apprehensions, as he might rather fear to be taken in the
midst by the League's Fleets, then intend falling upon any part thereof. They
called to mind also, that the artillery, ammunition, and victuals lay in the
ships, to deprive themselves of which so necessary things, was no better, then
to draw upon them such disorders and mischiefs, as they could not receive
greater from the e^emy. Besides, that the wind was very contrary to the course
which they were now to steer, if they should return to Corfu; whereas it was
very good for Don John to come into the Levant, who bringing 50 galleys with
him, he might easily and safely come to them; and that when they should be all
met together, they were likely to meet with some occasion of attempting some
enterprises in the Levant, which might become the name and preparations of the
League, whilst the season of the year, which was already well advanced, might
permit them to do so. These reasons not being allowed of by Colonna, no^ by
Gill d' Andrad^, they were full of doubts and difficulties. These thought they
might go safely with 100 galleys toward Zante, and thereby secure Don John's
voyage, and send the greater Vessels the mean while to the Island of Candia,
whither they might soon and easily get, and be free from all danger: They said,
no other course could be thought good, sav^ what made for the conjunction of
the Leagues Fleet. For whilst their forces should be divided, so as they should
neither have small galleys enough, nor men of War, to follow the Enemy in all
places, or to fall upon any other enterprise; nor yet being able to force the
Enemy to fight with their greater Vessels; it appeared clearly, that their
longer tarrying in those parts, would be totally to no purpose, which being
well known to Uluzzali, had been the cause why he was gone (as it was reported)
to Brazzo di Maina to keep the Fleets from meeting; which if he should be able
to do, it would make much for the safety of his own affairs, and would
frustrate all their designs.

Whilst this important resolution remained yet undecided, a Frigate arrived
very seasonably from Don John, which brought word, that he would not take his
voyage before the first of August. Which news, though it afforded occasion of
accommodating the Commanders first disputes more easily, yet did it not free
them from all trouble; for they therewith understood, that Don John would not
advance much with his galleys, but that he by express Orders, and Letters,
willed the Generals to return and meet him: which by reason of the contrary
winds, they being to bring along with them so many great Vessels, could not be
done without great loss of time, without much danger, and without much
dissatisfaction to the Inhabitants of the Islands, subject to the Venetian
Dominion, if they should abandon them at a time when the Enemy was so strong at
Sea, and so near them: but howsoever they jointly resolved to obey Don John's
orders; and because it was thought almost impossible to do so, and bring the
greater Vessels along with them; they resolved to go first to the Island of
Candia, and there leave the Ships and Galliasses, as in a place of safety, and
to cross the Sea toward Zante, with the lesser galleys. But this was not
done, by reason that they heard the Enemies Fleet was discovered upon the
Vatica, and that it made toward Cape Malio; wherefore thinking they might
safely pursue the nearer way, to meet Don John, the whole Christian Fleet went
to Brazzo di Maina, from whence Uluzzali was gone but a little before. The
wind turning fair for them into the North-west, they sailed in three days from
hence to Zante, where not meeting with Don John, (as they had well hoped to
have done) but with new orders from him, whereby he desired them to come to
C^falonia, they were necessitated to leave the ships there, though in apparent
danger; the Enemy not being gone so far, but that upon notice thereof, they
might return, and possess themselves of them: and being told that they did do
this, as was suspected by many that they would do, some of those that bore
chiefest authority in the Spanish Fleet, moved, that since it was so hard a
thing to succor the ships, they should give order for firing them; but
General Foscherini detesting this advice, resolved to send Commissary Quirini,
with 25 galleys, to free them from danger, and to bring them to the Fleet, as
he did, safely. At last, they past from Cefalonia to Corfu, whither Don John
was come himself in person with 55 galleys, 33 ships, and 15000 foot, on the
ninth of August; Who though at first he did not conceal his displeasure, for
their not having waited his coming, he being thereby necessitated, (as not
having sufficient forces of himself to pass into the Levant) to lie so long
idle, and little to his honor at Corfu: yet he was pleased to say, he would
speak no more of what was past, and strove very much to make it be believed,
that he was greatly desirous to do any thing, which might be for the reputation
and advantage of the League. And herein he did the more expatiate himself, and
showed the greater affection, because he heard it was publicly said in the
Fleet, that he was come only to make a certain kind of Appearance, but not
with any intention, or commission to do any thing; and that therefore he had
cunningly prolonged the time, seeking excuses, and avoiding any occasion of
incountring the enemy, or to fall upon any enterprise: Which suspicions did
notwithstanding still increase the more, since after so many delays, he came
to no settled resolution, because he expected the Duke of Sessa, with the
Spanish Galleys. But at last, it being thought jointly by them all, that their
forces were sufficient (for all of them being numbered together, the Leagues
Fleet was found to consist of 194 galleys, and 8 galliasses, and 45 ships,
whereof 30 were Spanish, and 15 Venetians) they were all mustered at the
Gomenizze, before they advanced, and resolved in what order to proceed, if they
should have occasion to join battle. The three Generals were placed in the
midst, with 72 galleys; the Marquess of Santa Croce* led on the right wing,
Commissary Soranzo took care of the left, and each wing consisted of 52
galleys: the Van, wherein were 6 galliasses, was committed to the charge of
Fra. Piet^o Iustiniano, General of Malta, and Iovan di Cordona, and Nicolo
Donato brought up the reere with 22 galleys. The Galliasses, which were
commanded by il Duado, and placed before the smaller galleys, according to the
first orders, stood four of them in the front of the battle, and two before
every wing. The ships were commanded by Don Roderigo Mendosa, and by Adriano
Bragadino,; it being resolved to carry them along to Zante, and then to leave
them there, that they might be the readier for any whatsoever design, but with
intention to make use thereof only, for the conveiance of victuals, and
ammunition, which they carried along with them, and not for any use of War, in
point of fighting.

All things being thus ordered, the Fleet parted from Paru, on the eleventh of
September, not having resolved upon any thing as yet, save only to advance,
and then do, what they should be invited unto by the Turks proceedings; which
by the relation of the galleys which were sent before, to spy out their course,
and designs, were quickly known to be at Modone, and at Navarino; and that
their Fleet was divided, and in want of all things that were necessary, and
especially of men, whereof many were fled, and many dead; and that for certain,
the occasion that made them ^arry in those parts, was for their security, till
such soldiers should be sent unto them as was intended. This was thought a fit
opportunity to suppress the enemy, and all of them were the more rejoiced at
it, for that they had almost dispaired of it; it having been certainly
believed, that the Turks, having understood the joining of the Confederates
Fleets, (which doubtlesly were stronger then theirs) they would have made
towa^^^ Constantinople, and return to winter their Fleet, as usually (...) did
within that strait, after having won much honor, by facing the Christian Fleet
twice, and showed, at least a great willingness to fight: and when they
thought they had now no longer reason to apprehend, that the Commanders of the
League were to fall upon any important enterprise; which some of Don John's
Counselors made use of afterward, to discredit the information, though it was
confirmed by many clear evidences. Whence it happened, that much credit being
given to their opinion: the Fleets departure was very unseasonably retarded,
and the execution of what was resolved by the Generals, deferred; though it was
confessed by all, that being to find out the Enemy, the chief hope of good
success lay in the quickness of the Enterprise; whereby not to afford them
time, neither of flying, nor of joining together; and that the unexpected
assault, might cause more terror in them, and put them in disorder. The
Commanders therefore designed, to part presently away, and sailing from the
Island of Zante, not to suffer themselves to be discovered any where, but to
come on the sudden to Sapienza, which is a Rock lying in the midst between
Navarino and Modone, and so to block up the passage, as the Enemy which was at
Navarino, could not join with their companions, nor shelter themselves under
the walls of Modone. But this advice was so long delayed, and they sailed so
slowly, as our Fleet, which as it was intended, should have been on the 16th
day, before sunrising, at Sapienza, got but to Prodano; so as being soon
discovered from the Castle of Navarino, that part of the Turkish Fleet which
lay in the Haven, had leisure to get safely to Modone, passing not above three
miles before, within the sight of our Fleet; our men thinking, that since
Uluzzali had had the opportunity of getting all his forces together, he would
fight them, they put all their squadrons into order; and after having staid a
while to arm themselves, the galleys of our Van advanced, which being got near
the Enemy, gave fire to their great Guns, to try whether they had any mind to
fight, or no; but the Turks meaning nothing less, as knowing their
disadvantage, retired to underneath the Fort of Modone. Thus it fell out, that
a few hours delay (of such importance is dispatch in point of War) made the
Christians lose a gallant occasion of suppressing the Turkish Fleet, without
almost any hazard unto themselves at all, which occasioned a great change in
all the ensuing War. The Enemies galleys being retired to Modone, great doubts
and difficulties arose amongst our Commanders, touching what they were to do;
it being thought very dangerous, and almost impossible to fight the Enemies
Fleet within the channel of Modone. For the mouth of the channel being of it
self very straight, and being yet made more narrow by some shelves, was
excellently well fortified on one side, by some Galleys which were placed to
guard it; and on the other side by a hill, which butting out over against the
Rock Sapienza, is as it were a Flank, whereon were many pieces of Artillery;
and just over against the mouth thereof stands a Rock, called San Bernardo,
upon which likewise many great Guns were placed: But moreover, when our men
should have past all these dangers and difficulties, and passing (...) in,
should have been gotten near the Town of Modone; they should have received more
prejudice both from the Town, and from the Castle of San Nicolo; from whence,
(it standing in the Sea) our galleys might be drilld through by shot, upon the
superficies of the water. Wherefore knowing they could not force the Enemy to
fight, the Generals of the League resolved to retire to the point of Sapienza,
that they might get into Porto Lungo, whither two wings, which were the first
that were to move, being already on their way: Uluzzali issuing out of the
Channel of Modone with 50 galleys, came to assault our Battle, which was
tarryed behind. But as soon as he was discovered, Don John gave the sign of
Battle, and made them all turn their Prowes toward the Enemy; so as the right
wing became the left, and the left the right. But Uluzzali, who was not come
forth with an intention to fight, when he saw our men stand in Battle array,
began forthwith to retreat, from whence he was newly come; the which he might
the more safely do, for that night was already come on, and therewithal a
great storm of rain, which forced our men to fall Room-ward, and to launch into
the deep, having the Enemies shores on all sides: But the next morning, the Sea
being become more calm, the Confederates Fleet went into the Gulf of Corone,
to take in fresh water at a clear and plentiful River, which runs along four
miles from Corone, through a most pleasant Country, full of woods all of Cedar;
from whence the River takes the name of Lungo, which in the Greek Idiome,
signifies a Wood. But to secure those that went for fresh water, they being to
go far from our Galleys, and in an enemies Country, it behoved them to land
many foot, whereof Francisco d^l Adriano had the charge; and this danger was
seasonably foreseen, and provided for; for Uluzzali observing which way our
men went; were it either to disturb them, or to keep them from carrying away
water, or else for the safety of the Town of Corone, he sent 1500 Ianisaries,
and 200 Horse thither, with whom our soldiers were forced to skirmish more
then once* in which actions, Charles, Marquess of Eumena, who was then a
volunteer, together with many other French Gentlemen in our Fleet, won much
praise: as also Iovan Battesta Contarini, Master of a gally, who was ^anded
with the rest* for meeting with a company of our men, who were running away,
he made them stay, and bringing them boldly on, he repulsed the Enemy. The foot
being re-imbarck'd, the whole Fleet parted from those shores, being shot at as
they past by the Fort Corone, whereby they received no great prejudice. Our
Fleet being got out of that Gulf, as it sailed between Cape Gallo, and the
Island Caprara, it passed within sight of the enemy, in three Squadrons, one
in the rear of another, by reason of the narrowness of the situation, and came
again to Cape Sapienza, on the South-west side, and lay at Anchor almost over
against Modone; so as the two enemie-Fleets were divided but a little. But
finding clearly, that to tarry long in that place, and expect the enemies
coming forth, whereby they might have opportunity to fight them, was but to
spend time to little purpose, with much indignity, and not without some danger,
they being to keep in open sea, and being often deluded by the enemy, who being
sure quickly to save themselves, sent some few galleys often out to molest
them; The Venetian General propounded the landing of 10000 Foot, whereby to
make themselves masters of the Hill, which lay upon the point of the Channel,
from whence, if they intended to make any attempt against the enemy, they were
likely to receive most harm; it being to be hoped, that this place being
defended by a few men, and not in condition of being relieved by Uluzzali, who
having the enemy before him, ready to fight him, he would not bereave his
Galleys of soldiers, and incur a greater danger. But the Spaniards approved
not of this proposal, saying, That being so near the enemy, they were not to
land so many men, whereby to weaken the forces of the Fleet, and expose it to
much danger. Wherefore Foscherini, finding so many difficulties, in whatsoever
they should pitch upon* and considering, that they must be forced ere long to
be gone, without doing any thing; his opinion was, That in a business of so
great estimation, and where the hopes of doing good was greater, then the
danger that might be incurred, they were to adventure, and forceably to enter
the Channel of Modone, and assault the enemy. He therefore propounded this to
the Council, offering to be himself the first, that should expose himself to
danger, and to make way for the rest: Which though it were at first approved
of, and that every one seemed to strive, who should have the honor of
atchieving glory by the first danger, yet they came not to the trial thereof.
So as without making any attempt as then* the Fleet went to the Haven of
Navarino, which is very spacious, very convenient for water, and for other
accommodations, and also a safe receptacle for any Fleet; it not being to be
injured by shot from the Castle, which is seated very high, and far off; where
whilst they should tarry, the enemies Fleet was as it were besieged underneath
Modone; so as by reason of the many inconveniences which it underwent, it grew
into a bad condition of returning to Constantinople, and also was in great
danger of being driven upon land, and split against those shores by South-west
winds: And if they should be forced by these necessities and dangers, to
depart from thence, they must afford our men opportunity to fight them, The
Turks this mean while sent many Harchebugiers, who being well skilled in the
scituations, falling down from the mountains near Navarin^, did disturb our
men, and sought to deprive them of the convenience of water. Wherefore our men
were forced to land 5000 Foot, commanded by Paolo Giordo^o Orsino, by which the
enemy being driven away, the country remained safe. So as our men keeping there
with much safety and convenience, things seemed to be reduced to that pass, as
it was hardly to be doubted, but that the Confederates would soon have the
victory: whereupon such advertisements were sent throughout all Christendom, as
men rejoiced thereat, not as at a hoped-for happiness, but as at one already
certainly had. Yet many days were idly spent, without any appearance of
adva^tage, save what time might produce. Wherefore so long delay waxing
tedious, the enterprise of Navarino was proposed; but it being afterward
considered, that though it was feasible, yet it could not be much advantageous
for the main affair, they gave over any further thought thereof, and bent
themselves to the expugning of Modone, in the getting whereof, the obtaining of
their chief intent did consist; for the enemies Fleet being driven from thence,
might be fought by our men upon very advantageous terms. It was therefore
resolved, to assault the Town and Castle of Modone, both by sea and land, at
one and the same time; and Giovan M^cenic^ was sent to Zante, to bring Foot in
all haste from the ships. In the interim, a certain Ingine was invented and
made* by Iuseppe B^nell^, in Florentine-Ingineer, by fastening four Galleys
together, upon which, ten pieces of Cannon were placed, and some kind of
Pa^apets raised, intending to bring it to the Castle of Modone, and to batter
it; and at the same time, to secure the coming of other Galleys, which being
sheltered by this Ingine from the Enemies shot, might enter the Channel, and
give an assault. But when this Ingine was made, many contrarieties (as usually
happens in these new inventions) were found to be in it, which made it be but
of little use; for it neither could be well guided upon the water, nor was it
very safe; for having a very great weight upon it, and the sides of the Galleys
being narrow, it might sink as the going off of the Cannon; and the sea being
there very deep, it was not known, whether it could have firm Anchorage or no.
There was also great difficulty found, in bringing it to the intended place,
for it was to be towed by other Galleys, which by reason of their slow motion,
were exposed to the danger of being shot through, and sunk, by the Artillery
which lay in the mouth of the Haven. So as dispairing of getting that advantage
by this invention, which was at first hoped for; and it being given out, that
the Belgirby of Greece was coming with 2000 Horse, to impede that enterprise,
the business was given over. But tha^ which did exceedingly afflict the
Venetians, and cut off all hopes of doing any good, was, the news which was
divulged through the whole Fleet, that the Sp^^iards had bread but for a few
da^^s; wherefore they said, They could not busy themselves about any long
affair, being, by reason of that want, to bethink themselves of (...).
Wherefore (being still de^irous to leave some sign of victory, which might
encourage the people of Morea, and make them hope for better things) they
resolved to besiege Navarino, which thing had been proposed several times
before, but still rejected; it no^ being thought, that the getting of so small
a Castle was worth the while, incomparison of that their great preparation. The
Castle of (...), which was anciently called Pilo, is sea^ed upon a point of
land, which th^^sting out on the South-east, shapes the Haven almost into the
form of a Bow: It is strong rather by Nature, than by Art, being in an eminent
place, and hard to be clammer'd up: it is very diligently guarded by the Turks,
for the convenience of the Haven, and for the situation thereof, which is
almost in the midst of Morea. There are two ways which lead to the Castle; the
one on the left hand, which lies not far from the shore; and the other
backwards, lying toward the firm Land; which incompassing a neighboring
^^anding Pool, is very narrow, and almost hidden. The Prince of Pa^^^ had the
chief charge of this enterprise; who when he had landed the men that were
destined thereunto, which were 1000 Spanish foot, and as many Italians, and ten
Cannons of Battery. He took the first way, which was openest, that he might
keep the Enemy from being relieved; but as for the other, he either was aware
of it too late, or did not much value it: so as Iovan di Moncada, and Mor^^t^
Caliaurese, going afterward to possess themselves of that Pass, they were
unexpectedly over-powred by many of the Enemy, part whereof came to bring
succor, and part came out of the Castle to meet, and back their men: they had
much ado to save themselves, which they did not without some loss. Whereupon
the Turks, who were above 2000 in number, put a Garrison into the Castle, and
having the way open, did also possess themselves of all the most eminent Passes
which lay nearest the Town, whereby they had opportunity of succouring those
that were within again, and of molesting our men that were without by
continual musket s^ot, whilst they were busy in planting their Cannon,
intending to begin the assault in that very place; and they were at the same
time prejudiced and damnified by Artillery from the Castle, so as in three days
space they could hardly plan^ two pieces of Cannon against the place where
they had designed them: and this mischief and danger grew daily greater, for
our soldiers lay open, without any manner of shelter, by reason of the want of
Earth: and the enemies which were without, with whom we were continually to
skimish upon disadvantage, grew daily stronger and stronger. These things did
very much trouble the Colleagues Generals, knowing that to r^^e too soon from
this begun-enterprise, would reda^nd too much to their dishonor; and yet they
could have no certain hope of good success by continuing the siege: But the
want of bread was that which did most molest them, which was daily more and
more complained of by Don John and his Counselors, who showed a necessity of
departing. But many thought it very strange, and not easily to be believed,
that the Spanish Fleet being come with so many ships from Cicily, which is
accounted the Granary of Italy, should want bread in so short a time. Others
thought, that if the want were indeed such as it was given out to be, it might
easily and speedily be provided for, by sending to bring some ships away which
were loaded with Biscuit, and which the Spaniards themselves said, were left at
Taranto. But the Venetian General, to remove all occasions of the departure of
the Spanish Fleet, whereof there was no hope left, nor any thought of good
success either then, or in the future; offered part of his victuals to Don
John, entreating him to accept thereof, and showing that he daily expected some
ships with Biscuit, wherewith to supply his necessity.

But whatsoever the reason was, the Spaniards did not accept the proposal, nor
would they listen to any thing which might retarde their departure; which
being resolutely bent upon, they went from Navarino, permitting free and safe
passage for Uluzzali, to return with his whole Fleet to Constantinople, with
the name of an expert and valiant Commander, having got so much reputation and
favor, as it might be feared he might be an instrument of more mischief to
Christendom. Don John endeavored by all the means he could, that this his
departure might be by the consent of General Foscherini, and the Venetians,
laboring to show his ardent desire of acquiring glory and reputation; his
condition being such as thrust him thereupon, if he had been otherwise
inclined, since be wanted power and Estate answerable to his birth. He minded
them of the last years Victory, of his forwardness therein, and of the
satisfaction he had since received thereby. He accused fortune which had bereft
him of the opportunity of fighting the Enemy, which had been so often offered
them and so much by him desired. He also promised, That if he should meet with
the ships in his voyage, he would willingly embrace any occasion that should
offer it self of doing some signal ser^ice to the League, before he would
return with his Fleet into the West; but that if he should not be permitted to
do so now, he would make amends the next year for the loss of that time which
necessity had now enforced him upon.

The Venetian General finding his resolution fixed, thought good to give way
unto it, lest he might make the Enemy believe that the League was broke; and
because he knew he was not able to do any good of himself alone. Many did
firmly believe, that the King had always, and particularly at this time, been
very well inclined toward the League, and Don John no less; but that effects
had not ensued answerable to the good intention of these Princes, and to the
opinion which was had of their forwardness, by reason of several impediments
and disorders which had occurred by negligence, or false rumors, or by the bad
affection of some State Ministers. And it was more particularly affirmed, that
the Orders for requisite victuals, had been badly observed, and that those
provisions which were prepared for the Fleet, for the business of the Levant,
were made use of upon other occasions, which was the reason why the Catholic
Fleet was necessitated to give over the Enterprise, and return to her Havens.
But it so fell out, as our men happened to be nearer giving battle to the Enemy,
than they had ever yet been, when they lest thought of it* for just as the
Leagues Fleet was ready to be gone, news was brought, that a Spanish ship which
was come from Corfu, and was already got to the Sapienza, was set upon by some
Turkish Galleys; wherefore all things being put in order, the Fleet parted
speedily from Navarino, to fall upon the Enemies Galleys, and to rescue the
ship, which was reduced to utmost danger. The Leagues Fleet was not got wholly
out of the Haven, when Uluzzali began to come out of the Channel of Modone
with 60 other galleys, to assist his former Galleys, which were gone to take
the Spanish ships, and were 25 in number. Whereupon Don John gave order, that
Commissary Soranzo should go with a squadron of Galleys on the left hand, to
keep Uluzzali from advancing farther; and that the Marquess of Santa Croce, and
Commissary Canale should go with their squadrons to pursue the 25 Galleys
belonging to the enemy, which when they spied our Fleet from afar off, quitted
the ship, and began to fly; and Uluzzali, when he saw himself faced by
Commissary Soranzo, haulted a little, being desirous to know better what our
men intended to do. And when he saw the Commissary ply his Oars, and come
vigorously to assault him, he wheeled about, and returned to underneath the
Castle of Modone, being so closely pursued by our men, as coming very near the
Town of Modone, they made many shot even to within the walls. But the Galleys
which fought the Spanish ship, having got the start much, and meeting every
where with friendly acception, escaped all of them, except one that was
commanded by the St. Iacco of Metiline, Nephew to the famous Ariadeno
Barbarossa, which being the last that tarryed to fight the ship; and for that
the slaves, hoping to get liberty, slackned their rowing, was taken by the
Marquess of Santa Croce.

These actions continued so long, till the night came on, which bereft our men
of making any other attempts against the Enemy. Wherefore Don John gave order,
that the whole Fleet should return to the Haven of Navarino, being unwilling to
abandon the Engine of 4 galleys, which might afford occasion to the Enemy, to
turn his departure* flight, if he should leave his Instrument of war behind
him. But the great ships being also out of the Haven, and a favorable wind
blowing a little at the South-east, he ordered the ships to go presently
toward Zante, and he the next morning went with the whole Fleet the same way,
being so desirous to return speedily* as steering his course through the
Channel of Viscardo, contrary to the opinion of his most skillful Mariners,
who advised him to go to Cefalonia: the Fleet run a great hazard about the gulf
of Lart^, and one of the Popes galleys was split against the shelves of Paru.
Uluzzali, when the Leagues Fleet was gone, being free from fear of meeting any
impediment in his voyage, went with all his galleys carelessly, without any
order, to C^pe Malio* where, by reason of a contrary North-winde, he staid some
days; but afterward* the wind turning fair, he came with 100 galleys to
Constantinople, and was received with much joy and honor; the Turks holding
themselves absolutely to be conquerors, because they had defended Morea, and
all their other Dominions, having offered battle several times (as they said)
to the Christians, and at last chased them from their Territories, and made the
Sea safe and open. But the same difficulties and desires continued still in the
Christian Fleet, (which came on the 20 of October. to Corfu) though their forces
were increased by the Duke of Sesse's coming to them with 13 galleys, and John
Andrea Doria, with some ships laden with Corn. Several undertakings were daily
propounded in Council, but none approved of. The Enterprise of Santa Maura,
was chiefly had in consideration; whereunto Don John seemed to be well
inclined; yet it was hindered by the Duke of Sesse, who being of a contrary
opinion, did absolutely oppose it, affirming it was not time now to beleaguer
Forts without Tents; nor to cross the Sea with numerous Vessels, and in an
Enemies Country. All designs being therefore laid aside, the Spaniards resolved
to turn Westward, the Leagues Fleet having been but 50 days together. Don
John went first to Messina, where leaving part of his galleys, he returned to
Naples with the rest; and dismissing the Italian foot, he sent the Spanish and
Dutch foot to their Garrisons. But Colonna, by Commission from the Pope, went
to the Court of Spain, to give the King an account of what had been done, and
to treat how the War was to be carried on the next year, and what provisions
would be requisite thereunto. Colonna was very glad of this occasion, that he
might satisfy the King of some doubts, which he feared might have some
impression in him, by the relation of those who envying his glory, and seeking
out some occasion to blame his actions, and of putting the King in an ill
opinion of him, had accused him, for having gone into the Levant before Don
John's arrival: though it was very clear, that those things could not be done,
which were ordered by Don John's self, without the Fleets departure from Corfu.
Colonna having dispatched the public business, and justified himself very
well, went from the Court, and returned to his employment, with increase of
honor and merit. The Spanish Galleys, and those of the Church being gone,
only the Venetians remained, and they almost idle at Corfu, where they lay
armed all the Winter, that they might go out to prejudice the enemy, very early
the next spring.

These were the successes of the year 1572. wherein Christendom had good hope
to repair her self in part for the so many mischiefs she had received from the
Turks, and to recover her pristine dignity, since the so famous victory which
God had miraculously granted her, seemed to have made way for other noble
Achievements; and that they might have so quel'd the forces of the Ottaman
Empire, as that the Christian Princes might have been free from fear of being
injured by them a long time: But really, our posterity may have just cause to
blame the Princes of this Age, for not knowing how to make use of the
opportunity which was offered them of suppressing the insolency of the common
Enemy, which was grown so formidable to them all: and all future Ages will
grieve for the misfortune of this our time, wherein, to the greater infamy
thereof, the occasion of so much hoped for happiness was lost. The Leagues
Fleet being departed, those of Morea, and of Brazzo di Maina, who were risen up
in favor of the Christians, and who waiting for the success of the Fleets, as
neither having field forces, nor strong holds to defend themselves, were
retired to the mountains to save themselves from the violence of the Turks,
were forced to surrender to their power, and to return to greater slavery,
being deprived of all hopes of ever getting quit of it. The Venetians
complained grievously to the Pope by their Ambassadors, (who at this time were
sent upon a solemn Embassy, according to custom, to render obedience to his
Holiness, in the name of the Commonwealth) of these irresolute Counsels, and
of the Spaniards slack provisions, and chiefly of the departing from Navarino,
so much, and so unseasonably at this time pressed by them: wherefore to gratify
them, the Pope sent his Chamberlain, Iovanni Claudio Gonsaga, forthwith to Don
John, to persuade him to tarry where he was, in expectation of receiving orders
from Spain, to winter in the Levant: which resolution they hoped the King had
already put on, being persuaded thereunto, jointly both by the Pope and the
Venetians; and the affairs in Flanders having had prosperous success; to
facilitate the which, in case the King should not be already resolved
thereupon, the Pope sent Monsignor di Lanzano speedily away to Spain. But all
these endeavors proved to no purpose, for having already given a positive
answer to the Popes, and the Venetians other Ambassadors, that he would not
keep his Fleet so far from his Dominions, he would not be brought to alter his
mind: and Don John not valuing the Popes desire, as knowing peradventure the
Kings, and his Counselors mind, pursued his voyage (as has been said) to the
West: and in the interim, General Veniero, finding himself indisposed, by
reason of his great Age, and much labor, having got leave from the Senate,
returned to his Country with much glory, being met by many of the Senators in
the Butcentauro, and received very honorably by the Nobility and People.

The affairs in Dalmatia were not at this time altogether quiet; for though
there were no settled Armies there, yet the neighboring Saniacki overran, and
pillaged the Country with their Turkish Horse, much to the prejudice of the
Venetian subjects: to hinder which, the Stradiotti went often forth on
Horseback, and the foot Garrisons; so as they had continual skirmishes, but
without any notable effects on either side. For both the Venetians and Turks,
proceeded but slowly therein, both of them thinking that it made not much for
them, to use powerful forces in Dalmatia. The Turks feared, that to send a
strong Army into that Province, to attempt any great enterprise, might make the
Emperor more jealous of their forces, whereby he might the more easily embrace
the offers made him by the Colleagues, and make War with them in Hungary: and
the Venetians, whose designs lay altogether in the Levant, where all their
forces were employed, did forbear busying themselves in other enterprises, for
that they thought, that whatsoever of importance might be then attempted,
either in Dalmatia, or in Albania, was to depend upon the success of the Fleet,
as also the fortune of the whole War. They knew also, that they were not likely
to do any good with, but small forces; the enemy being very strong in that
Country, by reason of their usual Garrisons, and that they were apt to
assemble together great numbers of men. Whence it was, that having gotten the
Town of Macarsca, by the advice of Luigi Grimani, and of Iulio de Pompei, which
was a place of some consideration, and formerly much frequented by Merchants,
being both fortified and garrisonized; they were notwithstanding quickly forced
to abandon it; our men being much inferior in numbers to the Enemy. The like
befell them at the Fort of Clissa, which being gotten by our men, by
intelligence held with them within, they kept it but for a very short time; for
the Soldiers of the Garrison hearing that the Turks were coming to assault it
with great forces, were so terrified at the very news thereof, as they fled all
for safety to Sebe^ico, before the Enemy were come. The Turks let slip no
occasion, whereby they might prejudice the Venetians; wherefore not having at
this time sufficien^ forces assembled to storm their Towns, they plotted
otherwise against them; particularly against the Town of Catarro, which they
designed to take by siege, there being no way left to victual it by land:
Therefore to block up all access also by Sea, they had gone about several
times to build a Fort in the mouth of the Channel, wherein that City was
placed: but they were always disturbed therein by our men. But the Saniacco
del Duca^o, being at last come thither with a great many of men, he perfected
it, and built a Fort upon the point of Vorbagno, about three miles distant from
Castel-N^ovo, where the Channel is not above forty paces over: Whereof when the
Senate heard, they had reason to think that the City of Catarro was in great
danger: wherefore they sent particular orders, to General Foscerini, that he
should send to destroy that work. So Commissary Soranzo, having no other
occasion of employment at that time, it being in the midst of winter, wen^ with
22 galleys, and 6 galliasses, to the mouth of the Channel of Cattaro. He had
with him Paolo Orsino, Pompeio Colonna, Morett^ Calaures^, and other
Commanders, who conducted 4000 Foot to this Enterprise. And as they were on the
way, Nicolo Suriano, Captain of the Gulf, came in unto them with 4 galleys;
being all of them come to Gianizza, they landed many men, part whereof went
with Pompeio Colonna, to possess themselves of a neighboring hill, to keep the
Soldiers of Ca^^el-N^^vo from succouring those of the Fort: and part went with
Nicolo da Gambara, ^o a place not far off, whither Zacharia Salamone, who had
been formerly adverstised with the whole design, was to come at the same time
from Catarro, with some soldiers of that Garrison, and with some other people
that were raised in the Country of Za^c^eria. Then Zoranzo entered the Channel
with 18 of his best Galleys, and going foremost himself, he pas^ beyond the
Fort: from which though many shot were made, yet did not the Fleet receive any
harm; but passing on safely, he put himself into a fit place, where he might
batter both by Sea and Land. The Fort was made of great Oaks, very artificially
fastened and chained together, so as they made a double rank, and encompassed a
great Platform; upon which, some Parapets were raised, for the safeguard of
the Defendants. The whole Fort was 150 paces in compass, the shape thereof
quadrangular, without any flanks; but so placed, as one of the Fronts played
upon the Galleys, as they entered the Channel, and the other, when they were
past on. It was well furnished with Artillery, and had 200 soldiers to defend
it. Wherefore our men resolved to batter it both by sea and land, at one and
the same time, to the end that the defendants being busied in several places,
and confused through fear, might abandon it the sooner. The next morning, after
their first arrival, they began to batter apace both by sea and land; and soon
after, our soldiers came with ladders to assault it. After a short defense,
the enemy was forced to yield, leaving the way open for the assailants to
enter, and to make themselves masters of the Fort. There were many small guns
found therein, and eighteen great ones, which the Commissary sent to Venice,
and blew up the Fort. This business being speedily and prosperously performed,
and ^^^ufficient garrison put into Cattaro, they returned to Corfu, with their
galleys, and with the rest of their men, where the Fleet still lay.

During the winter season, many things were treated of in Rome, about
provisions of war for the next summer: They knew, that dangers were much
increased, the enemy having had so much time given him to repair himself, for
the losses he had suffered in the battle, and to gather together greater
forces. Wherefore they resolved to increase the forces of the League also, to
the number of 300 galleys, and 60000 Foot. It was likewise propounded, to send
100 galleys very early into the Levant, not expecting the union of the whole
Fleet, which would require more time, that the enemy might be prevented, who,
as it was said, would put to sea very betimes, to hinder the relieving of
Candia, to pillage the Venetian shoars, and to infuse fear into all. Yet they
came not to any settled resolution, of obviating these dangers; either for that
they did not value them so much as they ought to have done; or, as some said,
fearing, that when their forces should be divided, and part of the Fleet should
only be advanced, the Turks might possess themselves, with their joint
forces, of some convenient place, between the one and the other part of the
Colleagues Fleet, and so keep them from joining, and hinder all their designs.
The first heat being, out of this reason, allayed, affairs proceeded very
slowly; and whilst they thus endeavored to take safer courses, it was clearly
found, that they incurred greater dangers: For whilst the Spaniards
endeavored, that the time for the uniting of the Fleets should be put off,
till the beginning of May, the Venetians territories, especially the Kingdom of
Ca^dia, which was of such importance to all Christendom, was exposed to be
assaulted by the Turkish Fleet, with very little hopes of being timely
relieved. Wherefore the Venetians, that they might not wholly rely upon
fortune, were more diligent, in garrisoning all their Forts, sending many Foot
thither. And being to continue at this great expense of Garrisons and Fleets,
they pressed the Pope, (who still solicited the increasing of the Leagues forces)
to help them with some moneys: They desired they might have leav, to sell the
goods of Ecclesiastics, and to use other means, which were used to be
permitted in much lesser necessities, by his Predecessors. But the Pope, not
assenting to any of these things, did only promise, that 100000 Ducats might
be raised by the way of Tithes, from the Clergy belonging to the Commonwealth.
So as the war behoved to be maintained by the Revenues of particular men,
contributions which were paid into the Exchequer being daily multiplied, and
new moneys being paid into the common Bank; by which the Commonwealth grew
more indebted. Nor for all this could the Venetians obtain any resolution,
touching the reparation which they pretended unto, for the contribution which
they had given in a greater measure, then they were obliged unto, to the
League's service, in number of Galleys and Foot; which being referred to the
Pope, could never be brought to a^^nd, who interposed several delays, and
wished the Venetians to be contented, that this business might be proceeded in
by composition, not by decree. From whence the Venetians took occasion to say,
that the Pope favored the Spaniards too much, either in memory of the great
and recent obligation, he had to them, having received (as has been said) that
supreme dignity by their means, or for some other concealed ends. Others
conceived, that the Pope proceeded with much zeal to the public good, for that
he thought, (as he often said) that in all things which concerned the League,
businesses were to be carried on with much dexterity, to shun giving any
occasion of breaking, or of any whit lessening the good intelligence between
Princes, whereby to deprive himself of the good which might be hoped for, by
the forces of the League, the next year.

At which time, there had been many things handled at Constantinople, touching
the composing of affairs: For the Turks hearing of the uniting of the Christian
Fleet, and being doubtful of the event of war* caused several discourses of
peace be often made, to the Venetian Consul. The chief Bashaw was still more
and more desirous of agreement; who, after the defeat at Lepanto, did increase
much in authority and reputation, being esteemed to be wise by all men, because
he had foreseen that, or the like ruin, and had therefore advised against the
war, contrary to the opinion of other men. He therefore thought this a very
fitting time to come to some agreement, whilst Selino, who being at the first
puffed up by his own greatness, and by the adulation of his other Bashawes,
would not listen to any such discourse: But his courage being now somewhat
cooled, by the unexpected event of the Battle, he seemed more inclined to
peace: Whilst it might be believed, that the Venetians would not be averse
thereunto, that they might upon such an occasion treat, upon composing their
affairs upon better terms. This Selino's inclination being known by Mehemet,
and hopes of agree^^^t being publicly discoursed of by the people, who were
now (...) desirous thereof, by reason of the many inconveniences which they had
undergon by war: Much news was spread abroad throughout Constantinople, of the
great forces of the League, and of the Confederates designs; which things
being amplified by those of greatest authority, who wished well to peace,
Selino was contented, that the business might be treated of with the Venetian
Consul. Mehemet began therefore, to discourse more freely with the Consul,
making use therein of Orembei, the chief Interpreter, and of Rabbi Salamane, an
Hebrew Physician; who being gotten into intimate acquaintance with Mehemet, was
often employed in affairs of weightiest importance. Whereof, though the Consul
had sent particular notice to Venice, yet the propounded Treaties were not
embraced; for the Venetians desired to continue war, being encouraged by hopes
of other prosperous successes, and having a better esteem of the League's
forces, by reason of their late victory. But when they found, they had lost
great opportunities of suppressing the enemy, so much time being spent to no
purpose, and all their former designs being totally broken, they were forced
to alter their minds, and to listen to proposalls of peace, endeavoring to
secure their affairs, which were exposed to the uncertainty of fortune, the
best that they could. The business was propounded in the Council of Ten, to
the end that it might be negotiated with all possible secrecy, and be the more
speedily dispatched, as time, and the condition of affairs seemed to require.
But the Senators we^e not well resolved in the point at the first; the first
desire of war being re-inkindled in them the rather, for that the Christian
Princes, apprehending this Treaty, began now to be more forward, and
efficacious in their promises, of favoring and assisting the League: Insomuch
as Lorenzo Priuli, being gone Ambassador to Spain, in the place of Leonardo
Donato; Secretary Peers, and Doctor Velasco, through whose hands businesses of
greatest importance did pass, did frequent his house oftener then was usual;
and that they might make the better impression in the new Ambassador, labored
to show him, that the King, who had been always well inclined toward the
League, was now more desirous then ever to prosecute the war, and would add
much to the forces of the League; saying, That express orders were sent to his
Agents in Italy, to be diligent in making greater provisions, lest they might
incur the like delay and disorders, as they had done the last year. And on the
other side, Don John promised, that he would not tarry to expect the coming of
the Spanish galleys, but that he would come and join with the Venetians,
having only the Italian forces, to the end, that he might be gone betimes into
the Levant. The Emperor also, who could not be drawn from his first
resolutions, neither by the so many offers made unto him several times, by the
League, nor by the assistance lately promised him, by the Princes of Italy, of
1000 Horse, and 7000 Foot; made it known to the Ambassador of the
Commonwealth, then resident with him, (no reason appearing to move him
thereunto, save only his fear, that the Venetians would come to some agreement
with the Turks) that he would adhere unto the League. Out of these reasons, the
Venetians proce^ded doubtfully and irresolutely, in the business of the Peace.
Whereupon Doge Mocenico, who had always been more inclined to peace, then to
the League, upon a day, when the Council of Ten were met, spoke thus.

It was not the thought of any one, (as I believe) to perpetuate, or to
continue this war, which is intimated to us by Selino, too long, when we did
first resolve to take up Arms for our own defense; but with a noble and
generous mind, to make trial of the fortune and gallantry of the
Commonwealth, of the good will and forces of Christian Princes, for the
greater safety of our State, and of all Christendom, against the power of the
insolent common Enemy. And it is certain, that war is in order to peace; and
quiet security ought to be the thing aimed at, by all troubles and dangers.
Experience of what has passed of late years, may sufficiently teach us, what
our condition may be, if we shall continue war any longer, what the end thereof
may be, what reparation we may expect for so great expenses, and what reward
for our labors. We lost the noble city of Nicossia the first year, by vainly
trusting, that our forces would be accompanied by the like of others, whereby
to relieve the Kingdom of Cyprus. Losing no courage, we continued making
provisions for war, flattering our selves, that we might repair our losses, by
joining in a straiter confederacy with the other Christian Princes. God was
pleased to give us such a victory over our enemies, as almost none could hope
for; and yet I know not, through what fault or misfortune of ours, Famagosta
was miserably lost; and we were compelled to yield up the peaceful and secure
possession of the whole Kingdom, to the enemy: But the pleasure of having begun
to overcome, suffered us not to be sensible of our great loss. Wherefore we
as readily and boldly betook our selves to make great provision of Arms the
third year, and to increase our Fleet and Soldiers, not sparing for any cost,
nor passing by any inconvenience. We now see too clearly, what good we have
got ^hereby. Our Galleys lay long idle at Corfu, expecting aid from the
Confederates; and when we hoped* that having overcome so many difficulties, all
forces would be joined together, that we might go jointly against the enemy; we
must leave our Islands in prey to them, and let our Fleet return, with more
loss of time and reputation, the^ any advantage we got by the forces of that
union. And when at last, fortune afforded us unexpected occasions, of beating
the enemy, we must abandon them, by reason of being abandoned by our friends,
parting unseasonably from the haven at Navarino, unnecessitated, and
dishonourably. But what need I relate things of so recent memory? We are
reduced to such a condition, as assuredly we cannot maintain war of our selves
alone, against the Turks forces, too disproportionate for us. And we know by
experience, that the company of others, which ought to be a help and ease to
us, is an encumbrance and impediment; it fills us with great hopes, which it
afterward makes not good, but suffers us to precipitate, and does rather
increase, then secure (...) evils. We were persuaded, that good intelligence
might not only be had, between the Pope, the King of Spain, and our
Commonwealth; but that this our confederacy might make all other Christian
Princes, to take up Arms jointly against the common enemy; especially after
that great victory, which was always thought, would have conduced much to the
suppressing of them. But now we find we built those our conceptions more upon
desire, than upon well-grounded a truths. Shall we then continue still in the
same error, and place the preservation of our State, and all our welfare, upon
such uncertain grounds, upon hopes wherein we have been so often del^ded? It
was certainly a generous, p^ous, and laudable resolution, not to yield to
Selino's insolent demand; not to abandon the cause of Christendom, not to
degenerate in the least point from our Ancestors, who did always with much
magnanimity undertake such things, wherein they might hope for praise unto
themselves, and for glory and grandezza to this Commonwealth. But now, after
having courageously taken up Arms, and been fortunate in battle, and that we
see clearly we cannot (by what cross destiny I know not) reap any further good
by other prosperity, that we hazard all by fighting, and that we get nothing by
overcoming; To continue in this fame mind, and in the same troubles and
dangers without any reward; and when the opportunity of great effects, which
was given us by victory, is already vanished and escaped our hands, to grow
worse and worse, and not rather to wait for the advantage which we may hope for
from time, and from other occasions; may rather appear to be rash obstinacy,
than good Christian zeal, or desire of true honor. If we shall consider the
condition of our forces, and of our Commonwealth, it is too manifest, that
nothing can be more unseasonable, (...) more prejudicial, than to prolong the
War. For the condition of affairs grows daily worse for us; the forces of the
League which depends upon variety of Counsels, and oft-times upon contrary
respects, become vain and useless, though they be great in themselves; and yet
the inconveniency of maintaining them is great on our side, by reason of the
excessive expense we must be at, and for the want of men, especially of Rowers,
whereof these wars have consumed so many, as now we must with much expense,
have recourse for them to Transalpine Nations, and not be sure of being well
served. But if we consider the particulars of our State, and seek not to
deceive our selves, we may clearly know, that though our forces be great of
themselves, yet are they but weak to sustain the weight of war long against so
powerful and fortunate an Empire, a^ i^ that of the Turks* and, (which is of
no less importance) our Territories by Sea lie far from this city, are divided
amongst themselves, and exposed to the injuries of the Enemy, and more easy to
be assaulted by them both by Sea and Land, than to be relieved by us; and
therefore they require so many soldiers to Garrison and defend them, as we are
enforced to maintain at one and the same time, as it were two Armies, to
furnish the Fleet, and to guard the Sea-Forts: and I wish we be not
necessitated to raise a third, to oppose those who threaten to a^sault Friuli.
What reason have we then to hope, we shall by length of War be able to defeat
the Enemy? It might peradventure have been done* if we had known at first how
to make use of our Victory* and therefore our endeavors have still been to
raise a great force, wherewith to put a speedy end to the war: What effects
have ensued thereupon, and for what reasons, is sufficiently declared by the
necessity and dangers which we are in. Our hopes now (if ^e do weigh them
arigh^) are changed into fear of being rained by a powerful Empire; which for
the extent thereof, and orderly Militi^, is ^pt to maintain war long. Why
should any one doubt then, but that we should listen to proposals of peace,
made and propounded by the chief Bashaw to our Consul, as we have been informed
by many of his Letters? since we have in vain endeavored to secure Candia, and
our other Dominions, by other ways; wherefore shall we not use that course
which is afforded us of f^eeing our selves from the present eminent dangers we
are in? We know that Bashaw Mehemet (as one that has always been desirous of
peace) laying the doubtful event of war before Selino, has made him give way
to agreement, from which he seemed to be at first much averse, If we let slip
this occasion, truly for my part, I fear we shall hereafter desire it in vain:
and that our affairs will lie long fl^ting, before they will be brought into
the Haven, and to our former condition of Tranquillity, for which we were
peradventure more to be envied by other Princes, than we had reason to envy
them, who were environed with so many troubles and dangers. Who would ever
have imagined, that the Turks would have been able to put together a new, and
so powerful a Fleet, the very next year after so great a ^out, as they should
dare to put to Sea, therewith to defend their Rivers? and yet we see they have
done that with ease, which was by all men thought impossible. They have put to
Sea; have much prejudiced our Dominions: they have faced our Fleet, defended
all their own Territories, and are safely returned with their whole Fleet unto
Constantinople. What greater proof can we have of their power? What more
certain tokens of the next years successes? if after having been so beaten,
they have resumed so much courage, and been able to put together so great
Forces, we may very well imagine what they will dare, and what they will be
able to do, after having had so long time to recruit themselves, and having in
a large manner recovered their former reputation and greatness. But let them
who are of a contrary opinion, say, I beseech you, if the Turks shall come
forth the next year so powerful to our prejudice, both by Sea and by Land too
(as some affirm); and that the King of Spain, moved by some more particular
important respects of his own, by reason of jealousies which he may have of the
French, or Germans, which is already spoken of; or that for any other such
occasion, he resolve to employ his Forces destined for the service of the
League, for the safety of Flanders, as he did the last year: or if he shall
purpose to effect his old and chief design about the business of Africa;
which, as we know all, is the thing chiefliest desired by the Spaniards, and
which we may have just reason to apprehend by his not suffering his Fleet, ^o
winter in the Levant; how shall we be able to defend Candia, Corfu, and our
other more important places, against so eminent danger, whilst we rely upon
one who is not steadfast in his resolution of adhering unto us? so as by vainly
trusting to such a leaning-stock, our forces shall become the weaker, and less
able to with-stand the enemy, or to do any thing against them. When they shall
besiege our Islands, play upon our Forts, we shall then send our Ambassadors to
Spain, Portugal, and Germany, vainly imploring and soliciting the assistance
of other Princes, acquainting them with their own and our dangers, (which they
value but little) as we did the late years. And our enemies, when they shall
see ^s deserted by our friends, and not resolved what to do our selves, will
become more insolent than yet they have been, will scorn all conditions of
agreement; and that which we now refuse being offered, shall not be listened
unto, nor granted when it is propounded by us. My opinion then, Gentlemen, is,
that the occasion of achieving more generous and noble ends, as might with
reason have been hoped for, after so famous a victory, being to the great
misfortune of our selves, and of all Christendom, let slip, we may at least
reap thereby what advantage we may, to the end that all our dangers rest not
wholly unrewarded; nor that the blood of so many of our well deserving citisens
be shed in vain. We ought not to recommit the total of our Fortune, for any
slight cause, to the uncertain event of Battle; and experience teaches us,
that we ought not to hope for any great enterprises. Let us then be rational,
let us free our selves as soon as we can from the Dominion of fortune, and let
us let this malign influence of the Heavens, which does but badly befriend our
Commonwealth, pass over. Nor ought this to be a badge of infamy to us to the
world, nor unsatisfactory to the Confederates. Our actions have been too
evident, our good wills therein have been sufficiently seen therein by all men;
none can deny, but that we have readily concurred to the observancy of the
League; that we have desired, solicited, and endeavored the suppression of the
enemy; and to make good use of victory. But since all our endeavors prove
vain, who can blame us, if being advised thereunto by reason, or rather
compelled by necessity, we have thought upon securing our Dominions, by peace,
as well as the Spaniards endeavored to secure theirs the last year by
detaining their Fleet, which by the Articles of the League, was destined to the
common service in the Levant. These our just reasons are known to all men, the
Spaniards themselves know not how to gainsay them; nay, (as we have been
lately informed) a State Minister of the Kings, seeming to have* some jealousy
of this Treaty, said, the King would not be displeased, that the Commonwealth
of Venice, to the preservation and dignity whereof he had always been a
well-wisher, as all Christian Princes ought to be for the good of Christendom,
should treat with the Turks of peace upon honorable conditions. And say, that
this peace which shall now be established, be not likely to be of any long
security to us, through the enemies per^idiousnesse; we may notwithstanding get
advantage of time by it, a thing very seasonable in doubtful and dangerous
accidents, and which always ought to be endeavored by those that are weakest:
for humane things are governed with much of change, and not only men's opinions
are seen to be altered in a short time, but the whole state and condition of
the most important affairs. Let us now endeavor to find out some remedy for
our instant dangers. God, who has always taken this Commonwealth into his
particular protection, and who will peradventure correct her by this scourge of
War for some error of hers, but not ruin her; will open some more certain way
to her safety and greatness, which is as yet hidden and unknown to human
wisdom.

The Doge's words bore great weight wih them; his gravity and authority,
accompanied by reason, became more efficacious: wherefore his advice being
approved, new Commission was given to the Consul, to attend the Treaty of
Peace, and to indue him with authority to conclude it, upon the conditions
which shall be hereafter related. Several accidents made much for this
resolution: many difficulties which were found for recruiting the Fleet, by
reason of the great number of men that were consumed, by labor and hardships,
and through great fear which had possessed all men, and which was made the
greater, because it was not now tempered, as it was before, with hopes of prey
and reward. Moreover, the pains and danger did now increase, by the reason of
fresh commotions in Flanders, and of assistance which was preparing for them in
Germany: wherefore it was said, that the Spaniards being thereupon chiefly
intent, had wholly bent themselves upon the augmenting of those Garrisons, and
upon making the sorer war the next year in Flanders. It was also understood,
that a Chiaus was come at the same time to the Cesarean Court from
Constantinople; who (though it was afterward known, that he was sent to treat
of things touching Moldavia) was suspected to be sent to demand passage for the
Turkish Army, which was said to be prepared for assaulting Friuli. Their
forwardness being out of these reasons somewhat allaid, who were at first for
continuing the League, they all unanimously resolved upon the Treaty of Peace.
Monsieur d'Aix, the French Ambassador, was presently made acquainted with these
resolves; who being returned from Constantinople, was then at Venice, and who
had received new orders from his King, to return to Constantinople, that he
might, as often as he should be requested, be ayding to the treaty of Agreement,
to the which the King of France had both formerly, and at this time, often
exhorted the Venetians. The Consul Barbaro, was therefore acquainted with all
these proceedings, to the end, that when the French Ambassador should be come
to Constantinople, he might consult with him touching the Treaty of Peace, and
according as he should see occasion, make use of his mediation and authority.

But the Turks, as soon as they heard of Monsieur d'Aix, returning to
Constantinople, hoping that he had brought new conditions for the stipulation
of Peace, and which might be more advantageous for them, cooled in their
negotiations formerly held with the Baylo, endeavoring cunningly to spin out
the time, without declaring any resolution in the point. Which delay did much
prejudice the business; for several difficulties were falsely promoted by
such, as for their own interest, desired to disturb it, chiefly by telling
Selino, that great provisions being already made both for the Fleet and Army;
it was neither advantageous, nor honorable, to treat of Agreement: so as the
condition of affairs grew daily worse, and unreasonable proposalls were made;
the Turks appearing to be totally alienated from thoughts of peace. They
imprisoned the Baylo closer than they had done formerly, made all his windows
be shut up, set more guards upon him, and dealt more severely with him in all
things, thinking thereby to make him discover his latest, and most secret
Commissions; or else to keep him from sending notice to Venice of their
provisions for War; or rather, as appeared by the sequel, to keep him from
communing with Monsieur d'Aix, who was come just then to Constantinople,
imagining, that by this means, they might the more easily draw the new
conditions from him, which they conceived he had brought. But when beginning to
treat with him, they found that really he had only general orders concerning
peace. And the chief Bashaw growing jealous, that the French would interpose
themselves in this business, for their own particular interests; as if the
Turks, esteeming these endeavors, as tending much to their service, would be
the readier afterward in lending their assistance, for the election of
Monsieur d' Anjou, brother to the King of France, to be King of Poland, he
cared not to continue the business by this way; but having recourse to the
former means, and to those who had formerly negotiated therein; to wit, to
Orembei and Salamone, he reassumed the Treaty with the Consul; and after
several proposalls and replies on all sides, The Agreement was at last
concluded, and established about the midst of March; all things contained in
the former Capitulation being now again confirmed, but with a particular
declaration, that the Castle of Sopoto, which was yet held by the Venetians,
should be restored to the Turks: But that all the other Towns of Albania and
Slavonia, together with their confines and territories, as they were
constituted before the war, should remain possessed in whose hands they then
were. That all the goods which had been taken in time of war, from the
Merchants of either side, should be entirely restored. And moreover, that the
Venetians should be bound to send yearly, for the space of three years, 100000
Ducats, to the Court at Constantinople: which was stood upon and endeavored
by the Turks, more then any thing, as a token of their grandezza, and
reputation. The Consul dispatched away his son Francisco to Venice, with these
capitulations, confirmed and signed under Selino's own had, who came thither
about the midst of April. The news of the conclusion of peace being published,
at young Barbaro's arrival, people discoursed thereupon variously, every one
according to their own particular sense and affection; many thought, their
interests were concerned herein; others persevering in their first hopes, that
Christendom might have been much advantaged by war, blamed the Venetians, for
having laid down Arms, and abandoned the League, But those of wiser and more
mature judgment, who measured things to come, by what had been past, did
constantly affirm, that this action deserved praise, or at least justly to be
excused, the reason of State requiring it, for the preservation of the
Commonwealth's Dominions, which without this only remedy of peace, would be
subject to great inconveniences and dangers. But of all others, the Pope was
chiefly scandalized hereat; to whom, when the Venetian Ambassador went to
acquaint him with the whole business, the Pope, not being able to moderate his
anger, would not as then, not for many days after, give ear to any thing that
might be said, in the justification thereof, nor admit the Ambassador to his
presence. This so great anger of the Pope's, made the Cardinals, and chief
personages of the Court, and* by their example, all the people, speak very
freely of it. Wherefore it was doubted, that the Pope, moved chiefly out of a
desire, of giving better satisfaction to the Spaniards, whom he thought would
hold themselves much injured hereby, would show himself so severe; and that
some Cardinals, imagining, that by so doing, they might please both the Pope
and the Spaniards, for which they daily expected thanks, and remuneration,
would aggravate the business, more then they themselves believed, it deserved
to be. But the Catholic King, who was accustomed to govern, and knew by
experience, how very rational it is in Princes to desire, that their Dominions
may be preserved by wisdom and moderation, not being at all troubled at the
news, that peace was concluded, seemed not to be displeased with what the
Commonwealth had done, for her own interests; saying, That assuredly they must
be weighty and important occasions, which had moved the Venetians to put on
such a resolution. And that as he had been ready to lend his forces to the
service of Christendom, and particularly to the good of the Commonwealth; so
he did assure himself, that they being sensible of his good will, by his
actions, would do the like to him, when occasion should require it. And the
Spaniards generally, both in the Court of Rome, and in Spain, using much
moderation, made no outward show, either of dislike, nor resentment. Some said,
They were rather sorry for the occasion, which had necessitated the making
peace, then for the peace it self. They confessed, that those respects, which had
persuaded to this resolution, must have been very great, but not so well known
to them, by reason of the distance of their Dominions, and of their Kings
power. And the Spanish Ambassador who was at Rome, understanding that the
Ambassador, who was chosen to go to Constantinople, to confirm the
Capitulations, was not yet gone from Venice; propounded new endeavors to
enliven the League. This way of proceeding, regulated by the reason of
interest, not of affection, was much wondered at, as a thing but little known,
or practiced by Italians. Wherefore some said, that the Spaniards were thus
moderate, lest by blaming the Venetians, they might provoke them to justify
themselves, by complaining of the actions of the Colleagues, the last years
past. Others said, That though they had lost the advantage of the League for
that time, they would not forego the friendship of the Commonwealth for ever,
which they might make use of upon other occasions. But, it may be, the truest
cause was, that following therein their natural custom, of maintaining their
dignity, it became them not to value much the dissolution of the League, as if
they were not sufficient of themselves, to give a just counterpoise to the
Turkish forces. But the Pope continued still unsatisfied. Wherefore the
Venetians, not being willing to be held contumacious, resolved to send an
express Ambassador to Rome, that the Pope might be the more easily pacified,
and admit of their true justifications, by this sign of their reverence and
respect. Nicolo da Ponte was chosen for this employment, a man of reverend
years, and of great esteem and authority in the Commonwealth, being a
Procurator of St. Marks. This man going speedily to Rome, and having obtained
audience of the Pope, showed him, that the Commonwealth had just cause to
accept of the peace, which was offered by the Turks, That all their territories
by sea, were exposed to very great danger, by reason of the enemies many
preparations made to offend them, and through the slow proceedings of their
friends and confederates to defend them. That the weight of this war was become
so grievous, by reason of the expenses which the Commonwealth had been at, for
the space of three years, and through the many inconveniences, whereby her
subjects were prejudiced, as it became now unsupportable. That as long as the
hopes of prosperous success, and of future quiet, did keep up their hearts in
the bitterness of war, and did a little consolate the present evils, the
Venetians had outdone what they were bound to by their Articles, in providing
for war, and exceeded their abilities. But that the best occasions being now
unseasonably let slip, what reason had they to continue at such expenses and
dangers? since it was now clearly known, that the Commonwealth could not
preserve her Dominions better, then by peace. That the Pope should be well
pleased, it being for the common service of Christendom, that accommodating her
self to the times, she should temporise with so powerful an enemy, that she
might employ the remainder of her forces upon some other seasonable occasion,
for the good of Christendom, and of the Church, as she had so often formerly
done. That in this respect, Paul the third, when he knew that it was in vain to
take up arms against Soliman, did himself exhort the Venetians to make peace,
though they had the same obligations of League upon them, as they had now. That
the Senate did not communicate this their resolution to their considerates, out
of just and sitting respects, governing it self by that rule, by which all
other States govern themselves, and by which the Catholic King, a powerful
Prince, had walked. For, that he might not break the League unnecessitated, if
the condition of affairs should alter (as they did) and not to seem to distrust
his forces, whereby to encourage his enemies. He did not acquaint the Venetians
with the reasons, which moved him to keep back his Fleet; nor did any thing,
but the effect it self, discover his intentions, and the jealousies which he
had of the French. That it became the Venetians to do the like now, who, at the
beginning of the treaty of peace, which was as then doubtful and uncertain,
basarded the loss of the uncertain advantage of the League, and of encountering
many inconveniences, in following that advice, which reason did dictate unto
them, or rather necessity; though it might be more truly said, that peace was
much nearer, being concluded, then was imagined; it being thought, that an
Ambassador was to be sent expressly for that end to Constantinople, as had been
done formerly; and that such resolutions might be communicated in fitting time.
But that that which was much desired, and much to be desired, being proffered,
it ought not to be refused or deferred, for any respect whatsoever, the damage
not being to be repaired by any mediation, which any delay, though never so
short, might occasion in a business of such importance; they being to treat
with a barbarous Nation, insolent, and full of jealousies. That they had also
considered, that to advise in a thing, which was judged by those that demanded
counsel, not to be avoided, seemed to be unseasonable, and to no purpose; the
rather, for that it would not have been lawful for the Pope, though he had
known the true reasons, which had caused the Venetians to make peace, to
dissuade them from it, or to hinder it; nor would the place which he held,
permit him, to advise or give way thereunto. So as since their occasions forced
them, to act contrary to his declared will, and not to be governed by his
exhortations, their offense would have been made the greater. That lesser evil
was occasioned hereby, since he knew nothing of the treaty of peace, before it
was concluded. The Pope being convinced by these reasons, was indifferently
well pacified, and began to treat with the Venetian Ambassadors upon all
occurrences, in a quiet and peaceful manner.

The Senate had in the interim dispatched away Francisco Barbaro with much
expedition, with the confirmation and stipulation of the peace, to
Constantinople, till such time as Andrea Badoaro, who was chosen Ambassador to
that purpose, might go thither, for the solemn settlement of the Articles, and
bring with him accustomed presents. Barbaro used great diligence, answerable to
the importancy of the business; and having ended his journey in fourteen
days, came very opportunely to the Court at Constantinople, on the first of
May. For news being daily brought thither, of great preparations which were
made at Messina, the Turks began to suspect, that the Venetians had made use of
this treaty of Agreement, merely out of cunning, to keep them from providing
for war, that so they might suppress them the more easily. And they were the
rather confirmed in this opinion, because the Ambassador was so long in
coming thither, which for these respects was thought might be delayed. They
therefore began to be more diligent in making ready their Fleet, though the
season was far advanced; Mehemet having, by interposing several difficulties,
endeavored to keep the Fleet from going out, to obviate any occasion that
might disturb the Peace; but at last, Uluzzali, and Piali Bashaw, put to sea
about the midst of June, with 150 Galleys, 30 Fliboats, and ten Mahones,
wherewith they passed to Negroponte, where they tarried a while, expecting what
would become of the treaty of Peace. For Piali hearing soon after from the
Saniacco of Chersego, that the Ambassador, and the new Consul, were already
come to Dalmatia, on their journey toward Constantinople, he forthwith went
with his whole Fleet to Modone; and finding the Agreement concluded with the
Venetians, he turned his forces to prejudice the Catholic King; so as coming
to the Rivers of Puglia, he committed much pillage, and burnt the Town of
Castro. But the Venetians, by reason of the news of the Turkish Fleets being
put to sea, and of many speeches which were given out, that the Turks would not
observe the Articles of Peace, and that all their Treaties were treacherous,
grew almost as jealous of the Turks, as the Turks had been of them. So as
though the Ambassador was gone, and come already to Dalmatia, they were
notwithstanding doubtful, what the success of that Embassy would be. And
General Foscherini being gone, by order from the Senate, to Sara, with
intention to disarm all the Galleys, save six, which he left at Corfu, did
delay doing what was resolved upon; nay he was enjoined, to take all the men
out of ten of the worst furnished Galleys, and to reinforce the rest with them;
which being done, there remained yet 92 Galleys in the Fleet, fit for action.
These things being done by the Venetians, and known by the Turks, did much
increase their jealousies. But when the apprehensions of these jealousies were
vanished, and that the Senate thought, the affairs of the Commonwealth were
now in a safe condition, they, to the end that they might be no longer at so
great expense, gave order to the General, that he should by degrees disarm the
Galleys; which when he should have done, that he should then return home, and
lay down his Commission. At the same time, the Ambassador Badoaro, who was come
to Constantinople, had delivered his Embassy to the grand Signior, wherein, in
a few words, (as the custom is, not to use many with that Prince) he told him:
That the greater the grief was, which the Duke and Senate of Venice had
conceived at the occasion of breach of amity, which had for so many years been
had, between the Commonwealth and the Ottaman Family; the greater was their
consolation at the present, to think, that all past differences being
accommodated, they were to return to their former condition, whereby the people
on both sides might enjoy tranquillity, and free commerce. That they hoped, the
peace which was now renewed and established, should be preserved for many ages;
which the Venetians, for their parts, would always carefully endeavor,
assuring themselves, that Selino would do the like, as became a great Prince,
and a lover of what was just and honest. To which Selino made no other reply,
save, that he did approve of what the Ambassador had said, and that he did
ratify and confirm the Capitulations, which had been formerly agreed upon with
the Consul.

Thus after the space of almost four years, and after so many and so sore
adventures, as you have heard by our narration, Peace was renewed and
established with the Turks, and the Commonwealth was restored to her former
quiet: Wherein we pray God that she may long continue, in better and more
fortunate times, since we see, she has so often, with much generosity, but
still with great misfortune, taken up Arms against the Ottaman Empire.

FINIS.
