At a Meeting of the Vice Chancellor and the Heads of Colleges and Halls of the
University of Oxford on the 25. Day of November in the year of our Lord 1695.
WHEREAS in a Sermon lately preached before the University of Oxford in the
Church of St. Peter in the East on the Feast of S S. Simon and Jude last past,
these Words, amongst others, were delivered and asserted. viz. [There are Three
Infinite distinct Minds and Substances in the Trinity.] Item [ That the Three
Persons in the Trinity are Three Distinct Infinite Minds or Spirits, and Three
Individual Substances.] Which gave just cause of Offense and Scandal to many
Persons:

The Vice Chancellor and Heads of Colleges and Halls, at their general Meeting
this Day assembled, do judge and declare the said Words to be False, Impious,
and Heretical; Contrary to the Doctrine of the Catholic Church, and
particularly to the received Doctrine of the Church of England:

And do therefore strictly forbid all manner of Persons, under their Care and
Charge, to Preach or publish any such Doctrine for the future.

By Order of Mr. Vice Chancellor and the Heads of Houses. Ben. Cooper Notarie
public and Register of the University of Oxon.
