THE SPEECH Of the Right Honorable Sir John Moore, Knight. Lord Mayor Elect, At
Guild Hall, Sept. 29, 1681.
Gentlemen, and Worthy Citizens,
I Give you all my hearty thanks for the great honor you have done me this
day, in choosing me your chief Magistrate for the Year ensuing.

It is a very great Trust you have reposed in me; and a high and honorable
Employment to which you have called me. It shall be my great Care, to the
uttermost of my Power, with God's Blessing, and your Assistance, to discharge
it faithfully. It is a Work I never did, and requires that strength I never
had, which I hope the Lord will grant me. God by you has called me to it, and
I trust will carry me through it.

Magistracy is an Ordinance set up by Divine Authority, and Government is
appointed for the good of Mankind, to keep the World in Order, to which is due
great Reverence and Obedience; I wish all Men did their Duty.

I am sorry to hear and see such great Divisions amongst us; certainly they are
in a great Error that are promoters of them. It Is the Design of Rome to divide
us; it will be the wisdom of Protestants to prevent and disappoint them, by
living together as Brethren in unity amongst themselves. And my Request to you
all is, to exercise Christian Charity, to forbear reproaching and backbiting
one another; to study quietness among your selves, to discourage Sin and
Wickedness, to promote Piety and Godliness: which will bring Glory to God,
Honor to the King and his Government, Peace, Happiness and Prosperity to this
City; which God Almighty grant, and let all the People say, Amen.

LONDON, Printed for Jonathan Robinson, at the Golden Lion in St. Paul's
Churchyard, 1681.
