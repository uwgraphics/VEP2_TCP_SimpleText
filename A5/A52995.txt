A New SONG.
To the Tune of, A Beggar I will be, etc.
PRay listen well, while I describe a Trimmer in the Church,
Who Preaches often, but for the Prayers he will leave you in the lurch;
For a Trimmer He will be, will be; for a Trimmer he will be.
And here in the Pulpit, a Trimmer you will find
With Trimming coldness in his Mouth, but Treason in his Mind;
For a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer, to play the Rogue with a better Grace,
Chose, out of the whole Land, to marry into Cromwell's Race;
Thus a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer the Engagement took during Cromwell's Reign,
But at the Restoration he spewed it up again;
Yet a Trimmer, etc.
Thus this Trimmer, when uppermost, he chose the Rebels side;
But when the King came in again, he strait swam with the Tide;
For a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer so profits by his Prince's coming in,
That from a Non-Conformist-Preacher, up he starts a Dean;
Yet a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer, as soon as he Preferment gets,
Immediately discovers he has not left his Cheats,
But a Trimmer still, etc.
What worse could this Trimmer do, his Function to disgrace,
Than being got into the Church, the Altar to deface?
Thus a Trimmer, etc.
No sooner is a foolish Lord for a Traitor known,
But he justifies his Loyalty, and confirms it by his own;
For a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer instructs this Traitor how to die;
But when he is questioned for it, he sticks not at a Lie;
T^us a Trimmer, etc.
This Trimmer has a Brother Scot, as great a R -- e as he,
Supporter, and Speech-maker chief, to the whole Conspiracy;
For Trimmers they, etc.
This Trimmer Scot to stay to swing was loath,
But has left his Brother Trimmer here, I hope will hang for Both;
For Trimmers They will be, will be; for Trimmers They will be.
FINIS.
