Moderate Caualier OR The Soldiers Description of IRELAND AND Of the Country
Disease, With Receipts for the same:

FRom Gloucester Siege till Arms laid down
In Trewroe fields, I for the Crown
Under St. George Marched up and down
And then Sir,

For Ireland came, and had my share
Of Blows not Lands gained in that war
But GOD defend me from such fare
Again Sir.

Take heed to thy self, lest theu make a Covenant with the Inhabitants of the
Land whither thou go, lest it be for a snare in the miast of thee, Exodus: 34:
12, Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest theu forget
the things which thi^^ eyes have seen, lest they depart from thy heart all the
days of thy life. ^hus teach them thy sons and thy sons sons. Deuteronomy: 4. 9, A
Book fit for all Protestants houses in Ireland* Printed Anno. Dom, MDCIXXV

To the Protestant Nobility Gentry and Soldiery of Ireland, but more especially
to the Woshipfull the Major Aldermen Sherriff, Citizens and Inhabitants of the
City of Cork.
A Soldier for the KING (great Sirs) to you
Humbly presents this little book to view
Which speaks of Stories old, and not of news
Things to most of you known: may be of use
In after ages, when wee're dead and gone
And amongst all Protestants worth thinking on
He styles his book, The Moderate Cavalier
Which who so reads, will find him so appear
He Is no Incendiarie, to blow the fire
Of discension amongst Factions; or desire
VVarres: being content with his low estate
But's sorry that (too true) he can relate
No more of good encouragement from friends
To the poor Soldiers; who deserved amends
For their past Service, nere to be forgott
Whilst in Ireland's, an Englishman or Scott.
Be pleased therefore (brave Sirs) to Patronize
The Soldiers work, that to his Enemies
He be not made contemptible, whose drift
For a poor liveing's only to make shift
Which being granted, the Soldier I say
For you and yours Eternally shall pray.
The Author upon his intent to have presented three dozen of these R^ks to the
Major of Cork and his guests at his Feast when he first comes into his Office.
GAllants, to Crown this Feast, you're here presented
With a New dish of Poetry, Invented
By a Soldier, and brought from Camp toth' City
Which speaks of serious things more than of witty
Yet if in reading, it beget a smile
I hope (dear friends) you're pleased well that while
Behold three dozen Servitors appears
Which are six files of Moderate Cavaliers
All private Soldiers of the Forty Nine
Revived with lost Arrears, byth' grand design
Who come to make up a new Convivium
Aut Fabulosum, Aut Historicum
Their Root is Six, which makes a Battle square
Their Front* their Flanks, their Rear, all equal are
Silence once said, then they in Posture stand
Till they receive the next word of Command.
They will not Plunder, For you may your pockett
Or Tru^k, leave to their charge and never lock it
Be pleased to hear them speak, or you may find
By lookeing on them, what is in their Mind
If you don't like their Story, you may clap-em
Byth' heels, Cashier or ^eare, or you may wrap-em
About your Sweetmeats, or they will light your Pipe
Or at the worst, they will serve your -- to wipe
If you do like their speech which is but Rustic
They Will tell the Feats they 've done with Pike and Musket
How they have chased Teige, through woods and Boggs
And frightened him, more than a Hare's with Dogs
They Will tell how all Ireland, was at their cost
Of Blood and Sweat, regained when it was lost
Thus have I told you, what they are, and how
They may prove serviceable unto you:
It only rests that I Now for my pains
No loser be: if that I get no gains
Then, what you please, toth' Poet, or the Printer
'TWill be an help to keep, a Fire in VVinter
MY Country Conscience, prompts me not at all
'On feigned Gods, but oth' true God to call
T'inspire my Muse, and help me to relate
The poor English Protestants case and State
In Ireland, and to show how they grew poor
And why so now, and then, let us God implore
To be their aid, and pray him to enlarge
Our Rich Countreymens hearts, for to discharge
Their duty natural: For I conclude,
To Help their Helpers is but gratitude.
These poor are such, whose mishap made them so
And not their Sloth, as plainly here I Will show,
Four hundred years, this venomless fair Land
(Except the Natives hearts) was at Command
Oth' English Scepter, and Imperialll Crown,
Whose often Conquests kept Rebellions down
Till Forty one, when Hell broke loose: the Devil
And Popish Priests, all plotting the uncivil
Late bloody, barbarous and Inhumane war
I want apt words, their malice to declare
That Authors, Actours, and Contrivers were
To kill and spoil the English every where
Then spread abroad throughout this Isle in Peace
At home, and in their beds a sleep, did these
Hell-taught Furies, in one black dismal night
One hundred thousand Murder, e're 'twas light
(Except the light, they made by setting fire
Oth' English dwelling houses) But t'inquire
Of all the Tortures, and unheard of deaths
(Till then) the tongue of any man that breaths
Cannot express; much less then can my Pen
For Burned, Hanged, Drowned and Whipped to dath were men
Women with Child, and Babes but newly borne
Alive ripped open, and to pieces torn
Stripped naked forced to run through Furs and Thorns
And hunted were with Dogs (having set Horns
Upon their heads, to make them seem strange beasts
VVhreof they boasted, amongst themselves at Feasts
All this was nothing to their Cruelty
Which to escape, for England they must fly
Where Men in have are raised to suppress
Those Caniballs, and help, these comfortless
Who soon arrived (by Gods blessing) here
And dared the Slaves to Battle every where
Twenty to one, Nay ^en, they judged no odds
To give the Butchers, where the cause was Gods
And in short space, a handful of Sick men
This Bloody Nation had almost again
Quite Conquered: But oh, alas! the War
Twixt KING an Parliament, our Trophies mar
Those Warlike spirits Quashed by a Cessation
Of Arms; the bloody Rebels, take occasion
To gather strength whilst our weak aids do scatter
They seem, themselves with Victory to flatter
Taking advantage of the time, their Train
Is brought with speed, their lost Forts to regaine
All Is now their own, except some Seaport town
And that is Besieged, and almost battered down
Wherein letts leave them, praying for some aid
And cross the Seas for England let us wade
Where Agents do address themselves toth' King
And Parliament, more forces thence to bring
But all in vain, their own turns first they will serve
Let Ireland sink or swim, or yield or Starve.
When Youghall was besieged, and Cork blocked up
Kinsale, and Bandon bridge dreading the Cup
The Rebels had prepared for them to drink
Of Irelands sad estate, what could men think?
The vast Estate of him that's now a Lord
One bit of bread to him did not affoard
Would he not Promise much, but think ye then,
To Warlike Officers and all their men
That durst adventure but to fetch a Prey
From his lost Lands; what promises I say
Would he not make? should not the Soldiers share
Be the one half at least, oth'gaine by war?
Would he not Promise much, but think ye too
If ere came Peace, what he for them would do?
They should have Farms, to live on, at such Rates
As if the same, had been their own Estates
And, in all Cities, and the Markett towns
They should be Freemen, if not wear Furre Gowns*
Have ye not heard, how the Mouse in a Kieve
Of good Ale drowning, promised to give
Her self, toth'Cat, if she would help her out
Of that same danger; whereof (there is no doubt)
The Cat was glad; and forthwith lent her hand
And brought her forth: The Mouse then at a stand
What she should do; at length espied a hole
Wherein she crept: the Car, seeing her stole
Away; said, Faithless Mouse perform your word
Or never again such help 'Ile you affoard:
The Mouse secure, tells her a pretty tale
We keep no promises made in our Ale;
So here I say, Soldiers were promised fair
While to regaine Ireland, most did despair
But now* the work is done, they like the Cat
Paid by the Mouse, are even laughed at.
In England now the broils are grown so great
Some for the King and others for the State
That men grow scarce, the Father's up in Arms
Against the Son, the Son again Alarmes
His Fathers Quarters, Roundheads and Cavaliers
They call each other in despite, and Iears
They turn their Colters to sharp Spears, and Swords
And fall to fighting, more with Blows, than words
There is no room for Cowards, all will fight
It Is old men's glory, and the Youths delight
It was long doubtful, which should overcome
Sometimes the Crown prevailed, and other some
'Its Enemy: and to promote each cause
For bounden Prentices they make new Laws,
To take up Arms, and serve their times, in the war
No Corporations, may their Freedoms bar
This liberty proclaimed, like cursed Charms
Emptyes the Shops, and fills the field with Arms
Some borne by Men, but more, by Boys they are Soldiers
That can but Musquetts carry on their shoulders.
Most hurtful proved this Act, toth' Age Fifteen
And there abouts as now is plainly seen.
For those that saved their lives, they lost their trades
And learned to swagger amongst the Roreing blades
They, knew no Parents, but were Sons of Mars,
Soldiers of Fortune, bred up in the VVarres,
Yet Novices they were, and spendthrifts too,
Hott-mettled blades, they did themselves undo:
Who was too greedy for the Upper hand,
Which when it is got, then Soldiers must disband
Buffe Coats grow out of fashion, voted down
And Arms must then give place unto the Gown
Had they but fought, at the Low Country rate
They Would better pleased the King, if not the State.
But herein, letts not blame, the Victors have
To end, those Civil Broils nor let us cast
The name of Cowards* on the Royal bands
Who were outwitted, not or'ecome with hands.
Though we cannot Judge, whose numbers were at first
The Greatest; yet now we know who'de the worst
The Statesmen, strove to weaken, still the King
Whose, Project took effect in this one thing
They, Ransomed still, their Prisoners of War
Whereof the other Party, took no care
But sufferd theirs, to fill the Prisons, so
That half their men, in field they could not show*
Our English Irish Agents then addresses
Make, for those Soldiers, and to them expresses
Great Love, pity their present case, and then
Do show the odds, 'twixt Prisoners and Free men
They, further Urge: the Justnes, of the cause
It Is, for their Country, King, and all the Laws
Of God, and Nature, against a Common Foe
That they should fight, and into Ireland go
Whilst here, they fought, but Brother against brother
And dearest friends, were killing one another.
The State consented, and the Prisoners yield

To be at large, once more in the open field
They cross the Seas, and have, to Irish Shore
Where getting foot-roome, soon do make it more
They raise the Sieges, that before, was laid
Against the Ports, where first to land they made
Their Cause thus changed, a doubtful, for a Just one
Toth' midst of all their Foes, they boldly thrust on
Where let us leave them, bravely making way
For all the good, that is here enjoyed this day.
The Royal Party, now in England, sees
What it is, to lose such men: for by degrees
They are overcome merely, for want of men
And are past hopes, except, that one, beat ten
Whereof, they do despair, knowing their Foe
At Equal numbers, fought them, long ago
Thus, weaker still, they grow, the other stronger
They needs must yield, nor can they hold out longer.
The War thus ended, the Agents do Petition
For fresh supplies, and show the sad condition
Their friends are in, in Ireland; who do want
Both Men, and money, and their Men Provant
That are already there; a Comitte
Reports their case, toth' House, then they decree
The Supernumeraries, to disband,
Or send them over Seas into Ireland
They give Commissions for to beat up Drums
Throughout all England, and list all that comes
For Soldiers; both Roundheads, and Cavaliers
All are accepted. so they are Volunteers
They promise them large pay, and it is no wonder
The Rebels goods, shall be to them free Plunder
Each private man shall there, be a Frecholder
And Gentleman to boot, is every Soldier.
These Baits prevailed, with such as lost their trades
In the late War, and could not get by Spades
Their living; and of such, an Army's raised
VVbo soon came over, and made the Rogues amazed
They quitt their weaker holds, fly to their stronger
where they are Stormed, or else are Starved with hunger
To Mountains, VVoods, and Boggs, they are chased then
(Not there secure) they are beaten out again
In Loughs, and Islands then, they seek to hide
Themselves, and villains; where to abide
In safety, and unsought for, they suppose
But they are deceav'd: for on dry land, such shows
Of New built Shallops, Ships, and Boats appears
Brought by these men, that out they pull byth' ears
Those Murdering Runawayes: yet give them Quarter
Who at the first, put the British to torture.
Here, by the way (Reader) I thee advise
To take notice, that I in any wise
Do not ascribe, the glory oth' Conquest
To Men* but God; and where it is expressed
The English suffered, or such seats did do
Protestants I mean; English and Scotch too,
Who British are; for diff'recne I make none
Between them, in any Service that is done
For if I should, Mountroes brave Army then
Would be forgott; who were deserving Men
Episcopants, and Presbyterians
Independants and such Sectarians
I give the Name of Protestants, to all
That joined, against those that we Papists call
Nor was the Conquest made* by Cavaliers
Alone; Nor yet by the Parliamenteers:
The Earl of Ormond, Noble was in the war
And so was Inchyquin; who went as far
In danger, for the time they both Commanded
As any men, could do till Cromwell Landed.
Now when he came (to give the Deel his due)
In Ireland he praiseworthy was; though true
It is, for all his Acts, in England done
Against both Kings, the Father, and the Son
I count him base: But here some one may say
His Irish Service too's, condemned this day:
Well if it be, (I think) it is without cause
For Ireland then, was in the very Jaws
Of Death, and had been swallowed up, no doubt
It the Irish, then had not got the Rout.
But 'twas not He, nor his Army did all
The Service, that was since done: as I shall
Now make appear: for then, brave Sir Charles Coot
Had been exempt, who so Nobly stood to it
Maintaining of the Common cause; Gods just
Revenge against Murder; whose very dust
I honor, who in's Fathers stepps so trod
As to the Rebels, was the Scourge, or Rod
Of the Almighty: He (by good advise)
Did kill the Nitts, that they might not grow Lice
The Lord of Broghill too, herein ought not
Amongst the VVorthyes, once to be forgott.
General Jones, Reignolds, and many more
Brave things in Ireland did, but (as before
I said) These were Instruments; now the praise
To God alone, let us return always.
And left that Teige should say, He, for the King
Did fight (which to me is a hateful thing)
And pretend, that these Worthyes, were his Fees
My mind, and conscience, I will now disclose
I think, they served God, the King; and State
That were most Active, in breaking Teigs pate,
Nay more I say; I think Broghil, an C^ot
Against the King, never lift hand, or foot
Whereas, the Irish Rebel-like, ran out
Against the King, and Law: and meant (no doubt)
To set the Pope above his head, whose right,
Before the Kings, they did prefer, in spite.
Could ever they, then (though deceitfully
They seemed reformed) have claim to Loyalty
I answer nay: God would not them permit
To go unpunnish'd, for all their subtle wit
They used: when vanquished, and quite overcome
Then Teige, is for the King forscoth: for whom
They Banished were, and with him were partakers
In sufferings, imposed by his forsakers.
No* they did the King much wrong: and great harms
Pretending, for his right they took up Arms
Yet* was not able him for to restore
No: that is a work for those I named before
Broghil, and Coot, with the Irish Brigade
(So called) with Monk, their helping hands so laid
That after subduing the Rebels here
His Majesty in Peace, they brought in clear
And re-established him, in his Throne
Over whom on Earth Superior there is none*
All this premised, the Rebels vanquished quite
Fairly in Field, the Remnant put to flight
Thus Ireland was reduced: But letts see how
Our gallant Soldiers are requited now
And whether they that have escaped their Graves
By their own Country men are not made slaves
And first I will begin with those (they say)
Did Cromwell serve, who for Arrears of pay
Had land sect out to them in satisfaction:
You Would think them well: But truth is no detraction*
Some private Soldiers, were by their Commanders
Choused of their Land, and Packed away to Flanders
And he that would not go, but thought to stay
And live on's Land, they sound another way
To make him weary of it, by Law Suits
Against him to commence, whereby the fruits
Of all his hopes, his labor, and his Land;
He spends at Law, his Capraine to withstand
VVeary'd at Law, to purchase Peace, at last
He sells his Land; and then that danger's past*
Now while his money la^ts, or some short space
His Captain makes him Seargeant of that place
But this nere holds for he with Cap in hand
To's Captains wife at all turns cannot stand.
Nor can he, Irish speak to buy and sell
Nor tennants, can procure with them to dwell
Then out he is turned, and in comes teige, in's room
Whose double diligence, like a new Broom
Sweeps all clean: is just toth' Captains mind
What e're, his Master says, he will swear: so kind
Besides, he proves toth' Children, of his Master
That, when the Maid chides them, he swears he will basther
With, Vo^rneen glagal, and Agra the crea
He takes his Masters Son upon his knee
And Streap^h granah, learns the Child, to call
the Maid, Buddah a Man, adding taw Brawl:
And then, teige laughs and swears by's gossips hand
His Fathers son's, the best in all Ireland
Thus filthy words, are taught the child in's Cradle
Which seldom are left off, when come toth' Saddle
This pleases so the Mother of the child
that, all teig does, is well: she is so beguiled
With flattering, that now Teigs wife must Nurse
The next Child she shall have: Teige swears his purse
Shall be the Child's; Now, he is a Fosterfather
Not for his own, but for this Child he will gather
He Will give the Child, a Coat I Bawn, of Bandle
And buy it, Erogel gaulda, and then dandle
The babe in's Arms, crying shane Poge, Cade Poge
^ic a me Vaister, Nab ^ousa Shane Oge?
Yo^ tow Lawnah: This pleases, more and more
Teigs now of Kin that was not so before.
Who now but Teige? His counsel so prevails,
That all the English Servants, by his tales
Are threatened to be turned away: his Cozins
Come flocking round about him, by whole dozens
Donnough the groom steps in, in Richards place
And Sbevane Oge, does turn out gentle Grace
Then Gilla Patrick, Hugh, and the Mac Roryes
Are sent for home, who are out amongst the Toryes
With them their Morter-pieces: Owna, Sive
And Moar great beastly Drones; creep intoth' Hive
Who so bewitch the Captain and his wife
That these must be Followers, all their life.
The English Neighbors (undegenerate)
These Furies cause their Fosterer to hate.
Do Trespass on their land, and drive to Pound
The honest men's Cattle, off their own ground
To Law they go, now all things suit in fitnes
And Right or wrong, Teige is the Captains Witness*
But may we think that Teige and his salse Crew
To their Fosterer, will always prove true?
No: you may swear it; for* what is bred in the bone
Will not out of the flesh, when all is done.
It Is known too well, in Ages past, how they
Behaved themseves in peace; and how in the day
Of war, their friendship, was but feing'd, in peace
Which gave them great advantage, to increase
Rebellions: Then, would show their Cruelty
To Gossips, and their Fosterers: and why
Should any think, that these, who are the seed
And offspring, of a Murdrous Bloody breed
Be otherwise than they? Had these but power
Both Root and Branch, of English in one hour
They would destroy: are we not Heretics?
Say they, and was not that one oth' old tricks
Their Priests did use, to stir them to Sedition
And Protestants to kill, would they not give Commission*
Yea: Would they not absolve; the breach of Oaths
Against King, and State: their Church, and Pope so loathe
A Protestant? Their Antichristian Spirit
Bi^'s Murder us, and Saints them too for Merit
What confidence in oaths, then may we have,
Of Papists taken, I would of you crave?
Do we not see, It is their chief Ambition
Amongst the Protestants to make Division?
'Twas they, invented names, of Separation
In our Religion: which by imitation
Of them (for distinction sake) we did use;
But in the Tract of time, did so abuse
Our friends, that at length, they were held as Brands
Of infamy: and weakened so our hands
That amongst Protestants, grew as much strife
As Papists e're could wish: except the Life
Of every one, that did not go to Mass
VVhereat they only aimed to bring to pass
For when distinction was, 'twixt Old and New
Protestants then such hatred grew
As if Turks* Jews, and Infidels combined
Had been byth'ears, for what each one designed,
And 'twixt the standing Army and disbanded
Grew jealousyes, which was the better Landed
They caused the Forty nine for to suspect
The Fifty three, as though through their neglect
They was not satisfied with them: that they
Remember might, their Christmas-box this day
And I believe nothing has drawn a Curse
On English New Interests, or proved worse
Than that the Forty Nine had no Arrears
Who served faithfully, in want Eight years
Against the Common foe: which thing reflects
On the Estates now, of the greedy Sects.
Nor is it mended yet, since private men
That well deserved, are now deceived again
By their own Officers; pretending they
Of Cromnell since had Arreares of their pay
Yet many of them, never since did serve
And those that did; they must do so or starve*
But it is all one, Cromwell and Forty Nine
Those private Soldiers Arreares did design
Sold never be paid: God grant it prove no Rott
To the Estates the Officers have got
Again Betwixt the Old and New Intrest
To move Law, Has not Teige done his best?
In brief they would hand in all the hurt was done
Amongst the English, since the world begun
But here some may object, that the whole Nation
Of Irish to this Charge, has no relation.
For some, have proved their Innocence so clear
As it is not fit to criminate them here,
And others have been faithful all the wars,
Whose bodies can their valor show by Scarres.
All this is granted; but oath first, I say
One in ten thousand, is the most that may
Be so supposed: whose Constant good affiction
Did prove: though others (Living in Protection
Durst not run forth) Penned up in the English Quarters
Did Newters stand, who feared to dye Martyrs
As some, would bragg, they did (who had betrayed
The place they lived in) when suff'rers were made
And for the last, though Irish by Extraction
I count them English for that very action.
This answered thus, another may again
Object: what though the Irish did in vain
Their own Religion strive for to advance*
They had President for it our of France.
But being overcome; should Cruelty
Be measured back to them? that I deny*
And leave to him, who said, Vengeance is Mine
I will repay: To whom let us confine*
Our selves: yet while we thus resolve, shall we
Unto our Countrymen, ungrateful be?
In showing Mercy, forget to be just,
Prefer our Foes, before our friends and thrust
The Protestants, that helped us in our need
Out of Employments, Papists put in stead?
I answer, Nay: For that there is no reason.
Ye don't we see it is just so at this season
Begin at Dublin, the chief Regal City
And mark how squares go there (the more's the pity)
Though English, be the Judges, Irish Clerks
Do there abound, With confidence like sparks
Oth' world they Domineer: and who but they?
With Cap in hand to them, brave Soldiers pray
In The Court they will be seen; But go to Church
There Teige and D^rmot leaves you in the Lurch.
In Customs, Excize, Offices for Cloth
Leather, Measures, Chimneys and to say troth
In all Money-matters, they are Projectors
And most on end employed to be Collectors
Let Us down into the Country come and see
How all things there do go, whos'ever be
High Sherif an Irish man is the Under
Then for the Bailiffs to be so's; no wonder
Apparatours in the Bishops Court who are they?
But Irish: and Who are Atturney's pray?
And Proctours, are not they the very men?
For one English, of them is there not ten?
Is not the Army stuffed, with such like trash
They Are Ala mode de France, each one with his Sw
A dirty Crevate, or a Fox-Furre Mufs
And some of them brave fellows are in Buffe
^ooted and Spurred, have cast off their old ^roges
And wear great Breeches, that were Trowz'd like Rogues
With Vest and Tunicke, stead of Blew Frize Je^kin
Can now tell tales of Madam and her Rhyme toot -- Merkin
An Irish man was seen in days of Old
But with a Skean, while now we do behold
Him with a Rapier or a good Back sword
A cross his Arse, with Damme at every word.
These are the Propps that now support this Nation
God grant they hold if e're come alteration,
All things thus ordered makes the English poor
And poorer needs must be, while they are crow'd over
By e'vry Snap: For the Irish wait upon
Our Gentry, where they do but keep a man.
Now here (perhaps) some would themselves excuse
It Is not for love, they do the Irish use
In all Employments, spoken of before,
But cause their konwledge is therein far more
Than English have: But I say that surmise
Is false, and will not pass Muster, with the wise,
Who know the little skill the Irish have
They learned it of the English; yet none (save
Some few of them) that are in any art
Their Crafts-Masters: although for th'botching part
Degenerate English, and their own Nation
Will them employ, against which there is no persuasion
And here again (methinks) I hear some grumbling
Against my last Assertion; and much mumbling
Concerning Scholarship: all Uulgar mouths
Are open* affirming this Country youths
In Latinc far exceed our English who
Feign Common consent: gave them long ago
Pre-eminence, For Schoolmasters therefore
They will have Irish: oh! who, than we, more
Stupid? Good God! since this, so long has past
For Current with most men, now at the last,
Help my blunt quill, and my duller brain
These foolish dreams, and fictions to restrain
Amongst my Countrymen: open their eyes
And let them see, what they believed were lies
Remove that plague, which does so many seize-on
And grant, they may at length be ruled by reason.
I say of Learning the Irish may not boast
For any thing yet seen in all their Coast
No Art, or Science, have have they yet found out
No Treatise of Religion, and I doubt
No History: or good Romance worth reading
Was yet by any of them writ, and spreading
In any part oth'world: what they do call
Philosophy (wherein their boast's not small
Is skill in Sophistry: wherewith to wrangle
They are well verst who do sor Trifles Iangle
And with a Pack of learned Cow-boys they
May with the world compare: none says them Nay
On the other side, Whole Volumes, English works
through Christendom havegone: yea'mongst the Turks
It Is true, some Irish speak good Latin: though
The most of their Schoolmasters do not so
But none of them can speak one word of Greek
or Hebrew; in those tongues they are to seek
Where all the English that do bear the name
of Scholars; are good linguists in the same.
And such as through the Gramar scarce have read
In England, are Doctors to them here bred.
The Padagog^es here cried up Humanists
May blush (if shame they had, to come ith'Lists
Of our half-Gramarians; All but the blind
And obstinate, this truth can easily find.
Nothing has done more hurt toth' English Nation
Than Irish Schoolmasters by all relation
The Fosterer, the babes, the Schools the youth,
Do English turn to Irish: of a truth
Their Speech, and Manners, are corrupted so
That Mongrell-English may for Irish go
As in all Ages past, they had an hand
In all Rebellions hatched within this Land
So will they still, it much is to be doubted
Join with the Irish; if they be not Routed
For many of them, who were well to pass
From Church have lately turned: now go to Mass,
So then the Nurse, Schoolmaster, and the Priest
Do foster, Teach and Preach up Antichrist.
The Cannons of the English Church forbid
Such Schoolmasters; yet of them wee're not rid
And diverse Statutes were in Ireland made
Against them, Fostering and Priests, now laid
Behind the backs of such as rule the roast
For amongst the Great ones they are connived at most
Though some of them are free from Imputation
Of such like deeds, It is my chief persuasion
Some Justices of Peace for their own ends
To my own knowledge have bespoke their friends
To send their Children to an IrishMaster
A Papist, and but a Gramaticaster
And seded him within an English town
Wherein were English SchoolMasters, and down
Have voted them; whose skill (if not exceed)
Did equal his: of whom there was no need
Unless it were to teach an Irish smack
To such as did it in their English lack.
This ill Example gave occasion to
The Common people for the like to do
And by such means the Bread is taken away
Out of the English mouths, now at this day
A good requital, for their comeing over
Soldiers into this Land: and it is more
Than Probable, 'twill prove an Invitation
To other English, for planting of this Nation
Shibboleth. Iephthah's word recorded stands
Which tried the Rebel Ephraimites, whose bands
Were scatterd, when Forty and two thousand
At ^ordan, Passages fell by his hand
Though they themselves Ephraimites denied
By Sibboleth pronouncing they are descried.
So here I say the tongue will soon discover
Which is the man that is an Irish lover
Bid him but say, This thing in Mouth A Third
He Will fairly say, Dis Ting in Mout A Tird.
Some say the water of St. Patricks well
When English drink thereof, like to a Spell
By Magic Art procured makes them forgetful
Of English Manners: others hold deceitful
Is the Irish Clime transforming Men's minds
Toth' Country Customs, turning with all winds
But not the Water, nor the Irish Clime
Have power over Noble minds Spirits sublime
Contemn the Elements: there is no mutation
With them, Nor subject are to alteration.
It Is he who has an evil eye, whose mind
Is not with Virtue but full fraught with wind
And such as place their chiefest happiness
In things below the Sun* whose thoughts are less
To be good than great feign would have excuses
For unjust actions: and father abuses
Done to their Neighbors on the land or water
When their base hearts are guilty of the matter*
He well observed in writing Irelands Story Sir John Davies

Since first the English Conquered it the (the glory
Whereof he gave to Strongbows Martial hand
Who then made Englands King Lord of this Land)
How that the great Estates some Chieftaines had
Within three Ages, made them prove as bad
Or worse than the Wild-Irish were before
For they did much oppress, and Lord it over
Their followers, that helped them for to gain
The Country: So that these poor souls were feign
For England, from their Tyranny to fly
Here quitting their Estates, when by and by
Broke forth Rebellions; for the strongest hand
was all the Law they would have in this Land.
Then England would be forced again to send
More Men to make new Conquests, and defend
The Title, which to Ireland it did claim
For the first Conquerers, were scarce in name
English; Degenerating so in manners
That they did March under the Rebels Banners
And it was harder to suppress that crewe
Than the Wild Irish; who was beat by few.
Nay it is supposed the Major part this day
Of Irish, are but Mongrells such as they
For many of Queen Elizabeth's men
In these last Wars were Rebels, But it is ten
To one, that they were Papists, or my life
For it, they Married had an Irish wife
Which were grand Causes of degeneration
Ever observed to happen in this Nation.
'Twas not for want of wholesome Laws still made
So long it was e're Ireland could be said,
To be an English Plantation: but 'cause
There wanted Execution of those Laws
For, had Oppression been but peeped into
The meaner sore had lived here as they do
In England, where Yeomen, and Tradesmen dare
Demand their debts oth' best not standing bare
And if the statutes against Fosterers
And those made, against Irish, SchoolMasters
And Priests, had been observed: this Land had then
Been well planted, with perfect English men
Such as to flatter, are ashamed: or turn
From English principles, would sooner burn
Who love their Country speech, be it never so broad
Beyond an Irish Tone: though their abode
Be in the Country, choose to be untarght
Rather than learned (esteeming that so naught)
If none but Irish Teachers they can have
They Would Latin Jack their Native tongue to save
And rather than marry an Irish wife
Will Batchellers remain for term of life
And for Religion, had rather than Papists
Be any thing: the Heathens and mere Athists
Did never hold, To Murder men was Just
Because, not of their Sect. As Papists must
Believe: to kill an Heretic is Merit
Monsters in Nature! that is their Divlish Spirit*
The English Custom's, not to put to Nurse
Their Children, until Gold have filled their purse
Or esse the Mother cannot give suck, and then
They claim no Foster-kindred, being Men
Nor are they Fostered up in Idleness
Although, their Parents do great wealth possess
But they do bring them up at such a rate
As is most suitable, to their Estate
Some, shall their Youth at School and College spend
Others, at Inns of Court, their Studies end
Some go to Trades, others their Stately Teams
Are wont to drive: Whilst here all is in extremes
A Gentleman or Churl, Scholar or Cowboy
No Trade but Merchant serves for every Plow-boy.
He that can reckon but his Pedigree*
Twenty descents from a Gentleman, He
I say as a poor gentleman will beg
All over the Kingdom, till he has one leg
Ith 'Grave rather than he will so disgrace
His far fetch Kindred, and their Gentile race
By being of a Trade, though never so good
He will be Hanged first, and not stain his Blood.
Another Evil in Ireland we see
Which happens most to such as English be
Farmers cannot live unless their Wealth be great
Or be befriended by some Potentate
A Freehold worth ten pounds a year's no more
To live on: than to make the owner Poor
Who must attend all Sessions and Assi^es
And Turns and County Courts, and all devices
That may be if his land do Bound, or's near
Any Great Man's: He dares not but be there
Or else hee' s Fined, a Quarters Rent at least
That in short space, he shall not have a Beast
To ride on, or a Garran for to Plough
'Twas ever fo in Ireland: and so it is now:
Then fain he would set his Land, But who dares take it
For he must Sell't out right, or quite forsake it
'Cause this Great man, does only aim to Ha'te
He Sells it to him, even at's own Rate.
Then if he is Wife, for England he will away
Before all is gone; where that in Peace he may
Of a small Stock, or by a working hand
Live better there: than here on's Freehold Land*
To go, or stay, now doubtful is the matter
For live he cannot here well, if he cannot Flatter*
And if therein, he get not the right knack
He shall have Teige and Dermott on his back
With Mongrell Sheorge, and his appostate friends
To sit on's skirts ('against whom good Lord defend's)
Who will back-bite him, and traduce him, so
That though he is poor, yet poorer he shall grow.
Ill sed, Clothed, and Lodged, the man falls sick
And (weary of the world) cares not how quick
Death summons him unto the silent grave
Who trusts in Christ, that he his Soul will save
He lives not long, but yet he does survive
His neighbors Charity, which he alive
Amongst his Countrymen, long since saw dead
Who unto Dogs, do throw the Childrens bread
And will use means, to save an Ox, or Cow
Of their own, but their poor Countryman now
They have no need of* for he looks for Cates
They say; is too fine mouthed, and at the rates
The Irish de, cannot live: give them Potatoes
They Will Boil, and Roast, and stroke up their Mustachoes
This makes them Teige employ, *cause he will serve
For l^sse than English can; so they must starve.
Thus Irish fare, must serve the man that labors
Which has destroyed, many poor English neighbors.
The honest man thus deed, now goes to wrack
That family* his widow at her back
Getts up their youngest child: the rest byth' hand
She takes and goes to him who has much Land
(An English man suppose) and tells her grief
And for her, and the children, beggs relief*
From thence, they strike over, to an Irish Village
Where Stacks of Corn they see, and store of tillage
But when they are there, the people of the place
Come round about them, stareing in their face
And call them Clan Igauda's in disgrace
That without Alms, from thence they trudge apace
Then do they go, to such another man
Though ten miles off (if one such find they can
As was the Childrens Father) though no kin
With whom they do make bold; he takes them in
And setts such meat before them, as he eats
Condoles their case; and gives advise (not threats)
To go for England, amongst their own friends
And (when refreshed) a Garrane to them lends
To bring them to some town, with English planted
Who have not yet forgot that they once wanted
Such men as was these poor souls Father* and
They make a purse, to send them for England:
Where (we suppose) they shall some comfort find
Amongst Christians there, who will relieve their kind
And where I leave them, sadly to report
How our Grandees, Oppress the meaner sort
Which to confirm, and to make Assidavit
I Would bring Tea thousand, if need were to have-it*
But now, 'cause this poor Man, does personate
The major part oth' English: who of late
Were Soldiers; let me not begrudge my breath
To tell how it was sound, he came by's Death.
The Crowner being called (one Mr, Justman
Whom, if I may not believe, I Will never trust-man)
In pannelled a JURY, whose Foreman
Was Mr. Reason, next him (if I can
tells name) I think was Mr. Look-sharp, who
With three more such was sworn, and next unto
Them* Mr. Experience: with his Pair-Royall
And three with Mr. Tell-troth, passed oth' Trial.
First Reason he began the Corpse to view
He passed byth'old wounds, and looked about for new
But finding none; he Judged him to die
O^^ Countrey-Disease, or some malady
Inward; which mastered had, his vital part
And did suppose Oppression went to's heart,
Next, Mr. Look-sharp with his three espied
OId wounds that were on's head, and some *on's side
Which looked like Cutts, and Thrusts or Stals with Skeans
The least whereof might well have been a means
To have brought him to's end: for such like Scarres
Had many Killed, the first day of the Wars*
But 'cause they saw them whole, they passed them by
And on his meagre face, they east their eye
Which did denote he had been hardly used
And (to say truth) was over much abused
They spied his neck to bend, his Sholders black
As if he would borne Oppression on his back
Which made them judge, that gave the man his Bane
VVhereat the Corpse, did (as 'twere) Sneeze again
Then said Experience, and his three Friends
The Countrey-Disease in three kinds extends
Itself: first Murder, then the Blondy-^lix
Which has consumed more men, by three* in six
Than did the Sword, in the late Bloody War
The last's Oppression whereof lett's take care.
Oth' First and Last Ireland was never free
But to the Last, letts Death ascribed be.
At length comes tell-troth who brings up the Rear
And his companions, all speak without fear:
That this man had been long sore sick: But never
Had any comfortable thing whatever
To cure his grief: the man was Brokenhearted
E're since the day, that he with his Land parted
They said, he faintly spoke on his Deathbed
Not all the Wounds he had received on's head
And in his body: Some at Knocknonosse
Some at Conmell, at Lymrick and at Rosse
No nor the Bloody Flux: but 'twas Oppression
That did him Kill: to God he made's Confession
And did declare toth' World; it grieved him more
To see the English make the English poor
Than all the hardships, he did e're endure
And 'twas too late then, to prescribe him cure
He prayed God to forgivetheir Sin, and turn
Their hearts: for who^ to's Death, he needs must mourn
Cause Evil they had done for Good, and did conclude
They was most guilty of Ingratitude.
Though it is but some English (I Will not say all)
Are so: and those too now, I hope mend shall.
This said; it was the Vote oth' whole Enquest
The man had lived, had he not been Oppressed
Which is one kind of the Countrey-Disease
Infectious and Mortal in times of Peace
When bred of Wealth grows envious and haughty
Good men's enemy, and friend to the naughty.
Now since the Disease is found out; the Cure
(To take it in time) may be effected sure;
The Learned say, whose sayings lett', respect
Remove the Cause, that takes away The Effect.
I Am no Physician, but (by chance) have got
Three good Receipts, which (in my mind) may not
Be much unfit to be prescribed here
To cure this Countrey-Disease; far and near.
The first Receipt.
AGainst the first kind, cre while called Murthor
Never trust an Irish Papist, further
than you can throw an Ox: and if he flatter
Suspect deceit, to be the end oth' matter.
Let him not wear a Sword, nor yet a Sk^an
Nor be too intimate with him if mean
You do to sleep in a whole skin: Put not
A Gun into his hands Powder or Shot
To kill the Dawes, Nor give, or Lend, or Sell
To such as he, though he shoot never so well
Let him not be your Fowler, if you can
In Ireland find, but any English man,
For by such means they Armed themselves at first
And after that into Rehellion burst
And with the Weapons of the very Owner
Have Murtherd him: their hearts as hard as stone-are.
Let him not ride in the Militia-troops
Nor in a Man of War (whose stately Poops
Was not ordained for Shamrogeers) to serve
Lest they Betray or else, do from you swerve.
Whereby the English, may at Sea, and Land
This Deare-bought Kingdom, keep under command
Let not the want of Numbers e're invite
The Ppaists aid, to Join with you in fight
But, Trust on God, to Help you in your need
Not Isr'el-like on Egypts broken Reed.
The Scriptures do declare, Armies have been
Too great for God to lead: and that was seen
By David, and valiant Jonathan
Said, God could save by few; the arm of man
He did despise: so says the Sacred Story
Lest to themselves, Men should a scribe the glory.
If any private Murder chance to be
(As from such like, this Nation's seldom free
Let not the Murderer escape, whose blood
Shall be on his own head, and reason good
GODS Law does warrant it* let not affection
Favor or fear, or any man's Protection
Save the Offenders life: Who sheds man's Blood
By Man shall his be shed: though never so good
Let not pretense of Valor, or a Duel
Have countenance in Law, or to the cruel
Murderer, be hopes of pardon; this sure
against all Murder (if not to say cure)
Is a good Antidote taken in season
This Kingdom to preserveith' eye of Reason.
The Second Receipt.
THis second kind, does only bear the name
Of the Countrey-Disease: in war, this same
Does use t'outvie the Sword; the cause is want
Of wholesome diet, and good Lodgings scant
From whence this Disease does proceed: Fresh men
Are subject most to this; scarce one, in ten
But at some time or other, has been sick
of this very Disease: it is not so quick
As is the former kind; yet more have died
Of it, than of any other beside.
Med'cins for th'Flux are plenty; some will drink*
New Al^ over the Kieve for it: some think
The leanest flesh of a Buttocke of Biefe
Fresh, and half broyl'd, Griskin-like's the chief*
As forth' Ague-in England, so we here
For this, Receipts have store; that I Will for bear
Now, any more to name: 'cause I intend
But this one preservative to commend.
First keep Rebellions down, which causes War
War brings Scarcity, and that Hard fare
Hard fare, and cold, causes the Bloudy-Flux
Which Thousands English, into their Gravesplucks*
Now if War happen, to be counted wise
Better than heretofore, your Soldires prize.
Let them have constant Pay, to buy them food
And see their Provant, be wholesome and good:
And let their Garrisons unto them yield
Good Lodgings; and when out they go toth' Field
Let them have Tents, and pitch on Champaign ground
Where Fire and Water, may be easily found
All things so ordered, will doubtless prevent
The Bloudy-Flux* to Armies incident
This last in War; the rest in simes of Peace
Are Medicines, against the Countrey-Disease.
The Third Receipt.
AGainst Oppression, thus runs my Receipt
Take out of Holy Scripture, every Threat
pronounced against that Sin: spread them upon
A fine cloth of Understanding: let none
Of them be lost; and if your Plaster crumble
Or stick not fast; your Understanding humble
By dipping it ith'Oyle of Grace: then cling
(As'twere a Cere-cloath) 'twill toth' V^^'rous thing
That done, apply the Plaster to the part
That does Oppress (which most on end's the Heart
Thence never remove it, till it make you say
(Like Samuel) behold I Am here this day
VVitness against me now, before the Lord
And before his Anointed; (say the word)
Whose Ox have I taken? whose Ass? or whom
Have I defrauded? let the Oppressed come;
Of whose hand, have I any Bribe received
To blind mine eyes therewith? be not deceived)
And I will it restore to them. I doubt
If some Men here, should say the like; then out
Would come an answer, not like his: the Poor
English would say; then first our Arms restore
Which you unjustly took away, by force
Not paying what they cost us out of purse
Wherewith (by Gods blessing we did regaine
This lost Kingdom, and made you Lords: in vain
Have we ventured our Lives, and lost our Blood
To get Estates for you: if this be good
Requital Judge ye? sure it was not so
That Israel answered Samuel: No, no,
They said, thou have not us defrauded, not
Oppressed us: neither did thou take for
A Babe, ought of any man's hand; the Lord
And his Anointed witness, it is our word.
This Medicine may be fit for the Trustees
Oth' Forty-Nine; who (by their licking Fees
I Will not say Bribes) have got such vast Estates
Makes Wise Men think, of what the Vulgar prates
The Green-Chamber business, was but a Cheat
Not well perceav'd, (their Juggling was so neat)
Till now; we see, theirs was an Army strange
All Officers, No Soldiers, could they range
In Muster-Rolls: it seems, they all were Slain
And their Dead-Pays; toth' Trustees now remain.
This Med'cin's for the use of such as have
A mind like Ahabs, to whom, his Wise gave
Naboths Vineyard; because it was so near
The Kings: let such the Prophets Judgment fear
And (if the Courts of Claims have done amiss)
T^^^ Medicine for their Cure prescribed is.
Yet I for my part can no Man accuse
And (if I could) I should be loath to use
^^y pen against English, they too my Superiors
To whom, is Honor due; from all inferiors
Some ^old the want of Money, and bad Tradeing
Somes of Oppression; nay there is no wading
In this great Sea, where that a Ship may ride
Not Sound the Depth, at lowest Ebb of Tide.
Oppression, is so various that I
Can only Hint, what is obvious to each eye:
The Wearer of the Shoe, he best does know
Whether it wring his Instep or his Toe.
Then briefly where to do, Men make profession
As they would be done to, that does cure Oppression.
The Authors Prayer.
NOw thou O God, who did the Heavens make
The Sea* and Land: when first the word thou spoke
Let there be Lihgt; 'twas so; to thee alone
We poor Distressed English, make our moan
O God, who art the Scarcher of all hearts
Tryest the Reins, and in the inward parts
Of Man, has writ thy Law; Reveal I pray.
Thy will On Earth, that our Governors may
Know that they Rule for thee: the Kingdom's thine
And in thy hand, all Power is Divine
Make them to dread thy Name, that sit at Helm
Lest by ill Steering, they at length over whelme
This floating bottom Ireland, spoiled of Rigging
Since the English lost the Wells of their own digging*
Their own, say I? 'twas. thou did take this land
From a Barbarous People, and in our hand
Have given it: that we should not do like
The Nations, whom thou did in fury strike
O let, our Rulers see, that they alone
Were not the men, that has this Kingdom won
Nor, that they can defend the same, from harm
By humane policy, or fleshly arm.
When Israel did all the abominations
Of the Heathen, and round about the Nations
Thou did drive out, whose Land thou did them give
Thou made them flee before their Foes, and live
Captives in a strange Land: so let us sear
That our Backslidings, make us not appear
Like them: then, what may we, from thee expect
But that our punishment, may in effect
Be like to theirs? good God, take thou away
From our Great Men, their stonyhearts I pray
And give them Hearts of Flesh: that every one
May do, but as unto, he would be done.
Remove O Lord the spleen, and take away
The Gall that is in men's hearts, now at this day
Who Persecute their Brethren, without Cause
Wresting the Old, and inventing New Laws
To punish Anabaptists, and the Quakers
And make the Cov'nanters, turn Cov'nant-breakers*
Grant this Good God, and whatsoever more
Thou know needful for us, we implore
Thy Divine Goodness, to bestow it on us
And answer every Lord have Mercy 'pon us
Pronovnc'd at Church, at home, or other place
With tokens of thy Favor, and thy Grace.
The KING, his Counsels, and his Kingdoms bless
And all his Subjects, the Great ones, and the Less
The Reverend Clergy, each man in his station
The Layman too, which comprehends the Nation*
Yea, and the Irish, that are honest hearted
Gods blessings be amongst them all imparted*
And last of all O God, Bless, and defend
Both me, and mine; and so I make an END.
The Conclusion.
ALL things that e're beginning had
Must have an end; be it good, or bad
So has this Book, a Story sad
that is come sir

To see you and some special friends
And pray's you give your recommends
To those in power that may defend's
from some sir

That would abuse the Cavalier
For writeing what he has done here
Though it is not half, I Will make appear
he could sir

Who is so Moderate, that drives
At the amendment of men's lives
And that Peace be amongst them, strives
there should sir.

Now, if the Soldier favor find
Amongst his friends, to be so kind
As to Imprint his Book: my mind
to you sir*

I Will tell; is that the Kingdom over
It go, to show what some before
Never knew: and I Will say more
IT IS TRVE SIR
