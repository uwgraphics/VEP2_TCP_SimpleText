A NEW BALLAD UPON DR. OATS HIS Retreat from White Hall, Into the City.
To the Tune of, I Will tell Thee Dick where I have been.
I.
Can tell me, Ceres, What cursed Fate
Hangs over the Head of Oats of late?
Or what Cross Planet Reigns?
That Oats, the Noblest Thought at first,
And Best, should now be held the Worst,
And Vilest of all Grains?
II.
Oats, that same brave and swagg'ring Blade,
Which the other Day, with lofty Head,
His Fellows all o're-top't;
Should for a Roguish Weed be thrown
Out of the Court, and now full blown.
Be in the Blossom Crop't?
III.
Oats, that was whilome thought to be
For the King's Horse, fit Company,
( God bless him evermore!)
Should now by every Groom be spurned,
And for a Rogue in Grain be turned
Out of the Stable-Door?
IV.
Had these Oats musty been, or stale,
Or had they any Noisome Smell,
They had of Blame not failed:
But These (as Musk it self) were Sweet,
With Coat as Black as any Jet;
But somewhat too Long-Tail'd.
V.
That Tyrant's Jades, that Oats and Hay Diomedes,

Refused for Man's Flesh, I dare say,
Never such an Oate did taste:
And, pity 'twas, his Worth to show,
That He had not been long ago,
Into their Maunger cast.
VI.
The Case is hard, that Oats, that fed
The Noblest Beast, that lived in Mead,
On Pastures Green, or Heath well;
Should be, at last, Himself turned down
Into the Common of the Town,
To feed the Calves of Bethel.
VII.
But cheer up, Oats; it is no Disgrace:
These Calves are of the City Race,
(There are none such at White Hall;)
And freely will their Milk give down,
(And thou can stroke them well, it is known)
To feed Thee in Requital.
VIII.
Some have the Pedigree, and Strain
Of Oats, derived from that Blessed Grain,
Which Egypt's Famine freed:
And I believe, what they aver;
For, without doubt, these (Our) Oats are
Of the true Gypsy Breed.
IX.
Nay, others have his Parents blamed,
They had the Brat not Joseph named;
But they herein had erred:
For that Good Man at Court, at last,
For his Deserts was highly grace't;
Not for a Rogue Casheir'd.
X.
Yet, I doubt not, but of such known
Divinity had Oats there grown,
He would have with a Rope,
Amongst their Leek, and Onyon-Gods,
(As more deserving it by odds,)
Been long ago Trust up.
XI.
Shall We, who boast true Gospel Light,
Instead of doing Him that Right,
Then treat Him worse than Pagan?
And Excommunicate Him clear
Out of our Courts, as if he were
A Minister of Dagon?
XII.
This sure is a New Popish-Plot;
Who seeing now we in a Knot,
Begin to hang together;
Think It the best way, (which Heaven defend!)
Is to untye us, and to send
Our Doctor, God knows whither.
XIII.
You Charitable City-Dames,
If now you will set up your Names,
Preserve Him like Sweetmeats:
He flies to You, to be Secure;
Keep close your Fore-Doors; but be sure,
Guard well your Posterne-Gates.
FINIS.
