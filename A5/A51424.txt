VTRIVSQVE ACADEMIAE CANTABRIG. and OXON.
Praeclaris Luminibus ac Ornamentis, caeterisque Sacrae Theologiae Candidatis,
and sincerioris Literaturae Studiosis Gratiam and Salutem in CHRISTO IESV.
SI quanto amoris studio Vtramque Academiam prosequor, tanto Honoris testimonio
adornare eas possem (Viri Clarissimi) certe quidem hoc qualecunqne Opus meum,
vestro praesertim Nomini inscriptum, usque adeo excellens and singular
fuisset, ut nec ad conciliandam gratiam, nec ad culpam deprecandam Praefatione
ulla indigeret. In quo tamen si quae forte Vobis occurrant (ut sunt sane
plurima) a nullo hactenus, ex nostris partibus, Authore praevio in medium
prolata; vestrae perspicacitatis erit, quanti momenti illa fuerint, dijudicare;
quorum duntaxat Apices aliquot saltem attingere operae-precium esse duxi.

Sacramento Eucharistiae Resp. Christiana nihil unquam sublimius, nihil
sanctius habuit atque Augustius, quo Christiani quodammodo in Christum ipsum
transformamur. Huic Institutioni in frontispicio libri, ex aliorum Placitis,
MISSAE cognomentum adjicio: quam vocem aliquis fortassis omissam nimis velit.
Quin esto tu bono animo, quisquis es pius zelotes, and Papisticae Missae exosor
vehemens. Etenim nomen [ Missa] secum omen suum apportat, quod cum a
Dimittendis ijs, qui Eucharistiae participes esse nolunt, ortum suum traxerit,
Romanam Missam plane jugulat, quae (veluti Amasios suos) Spectatores meros
omnibus lenociniis ad se allicit atque invitat; ac si in illo uno Theatrico
spectaculo Religio ipsa Christiana fere tota consisteret: quos tamen (modo
Eucharistiae capaces) Antiquitas Catholica apud Graecos (...), apud Latinos
Discedere jussit; et in persistentes, ut in homines praefractos and impudentes,
graviter acerbeque invecta est. Haec de Operis Titulo praefari mihi libuit, ne
in isthoc vocabulo, Missae, veluti in ipso vestibulo, impegisse videar.

Ex part Operis prima, quam Practicam dicimus, constat Institutionis Christi
Canones december, per Tridentinos Canones, in Romana Missa, perfringi (tantumnon
jugiter) et violari; sed majorine impude^tia, an impietate, difficile est
dicere: nam Depravationibus istis sufflaminandis mill annoru^ Consuetudini
universali anteponu^t sequioris aetatis Diutissime, scilicet, retentam (ut
aiunt) trecentorum annorum modernae Ecclesiae Romanae (en!) sapientioris usum
contrarium. Deinde Praeceptum praximque Apostolicam a Pontifice Romans Abrogari
posse garriunt: quin and adversus Exemplum Christi, multis retro seculis vel ab
ipsis Romans Pontificibus sancte religioseque observatum, obtendunt Consuetudinem
contrariam habendam esse pro lege: quin porro hoc quoque parum est, quia,
quamvis de contrario Praecepto Christi constaret, nihilo-minus Ius ipsum
divinum a Pontifice Romano relaxari posse, Iesuita blasphemo ore pronunciat.

Sequitur pars altera, quam Dogmaticam nominamus, in multa Membra se
diffundens, ita tamen ut horum verborum Christi [ HOC EST CORPUS MEVM, etc.] *
Qua quidem Particusa integram Institutionis Christi narrationem (
Institutionis, inqua^, non autem Romanae, ut dicitur, Consecrationis formam)
disertis verbis significavi. Ex qua tamen mirum quantos clamores excitavit
Papista quidam, vit sane nobilis: cujus Postulatis justo quodam Tractatu (qui
Anglice inscribitur A Discharge) ^atis superque factu^ est. *
etc.] Expositioni literali Mysterij Romani de Eucharistia moles tota nitatur.
Quanquam dum in istis explicandis Adversarij nonnulli, Fridentinorum Patrum
spiritu afflati, Tropum omnem ab eisdem long exulare jubent; Alij tamen Tropos
saltem Sex, velint nolint, coguntur agnoscere. Porro, in una Particula [ HOC]
totius Controversiae cardo vertitur; de qua cum quaeritur, quid ea proprie
designet, Pontificij Doctores in duas, easque contrarias Opiniones distrahuntur
Alij enim per, Hoc, Christi corpus denotari volunt; Alij ad aliud (quod ipsi
commenti sunt) Individuum Vagum Pronomen illud referunt: ita tamen ut utrique
Andabatarum more, a se invicem vapulent, dum hi priorem sententiam prorsus
Absurdam, illi posteriorem Absurditatum plenam non dicunt modo, verum-etiam
solidis Argumentis evincunt. Iam igitur, hoc uno fundamento ipsorum
Pontificiorum Contradictionibus (ut olim Turre Babel) diruto atque dejecto,
alia de Transsubstantiatione, de Corporali Christi Praesentia, Conjunctione que
cum corporibus Communicantium, de proprie dicto Sacrificio, and de divina
denique Adoratione, superstructa portentosa Dogmata omnia corruere and
labefactari necesse est. De singulis, si placet, pauca delibemus.

Primo in loco Transsubstantiationis non Dogma modo, sed and vox ipsa (contra
quam pisces) novitate sua foetet. Ecquid habent, quod opponant? nonnihil,
nempe, Patres antiqui (inquiunt) de Conversione hujus Sacramenti verba
facientes, Transformationis, Transitionis, Transmutationis, Transelementationis
vocabula frequenter usurparunt: unde ipsissimam suam Transsubstantiationem
dilucide probari gens Romana clamitat and vociferatur. Cum tamen Adversarios
nostros minime lateat, eosdem Sanctos Patres pari liberate sermonis judicijque
synceritate easdem voces singulas ad alias conversiones transtulisse, ut
(Exempli gratia) nunc Verbi praedicati in Auditorem, nunc Corporis Christi in
Ecclesiam, nunc hominis Christiani in Christum, nunc denique Corporum
Christianorum in ipsam Christi carnem. Vnde sequitur, ut qua ratione praeclari
isti Disputatores unam duntaxat Transsubstantiationem astruere conantur, eadem
ex ipsa lege Parium (o homines misere fascinatos, aliosque miserrime
fascinantes!) quatuor alias teneantur admittere.

In Membro tertio partis Dogmaticae quaestio de Corporali praesentia Christi in
Eucharistia agitatur, quaeque huc pertinent omnia ad hoc unum Caput reducuntur;
Quid sit illud, quod, juxta Christi institutionem, jam intelligitur [ Corpus
meum?] Hoc Catholica Ecclesia per multa Secula, ab Apostolicis usque
temporibus, nullum aliud esse credidit, quam quod a B. Virgin Natum, Vnum, Vno
in Loco Definitum, seu circumscriptum, Organicum quoque, and demum Sensuum
omnium absolutissima integritate juxta and Gloriae perfectione cumulatissima
praeditum. At quod Romanenses Carbonariis suis Discipulis obtrudunt, Deus bone!
quale Corpus, and quam minime illud MEVM? Primo (id enim natura
Transsubstantiationis necessario exigit) Corpus, quale Pistores pinsunt, ex
pane confectum; mox Corpus (namque hoc discontinuitas locorum per se postulat)
multiplex, quale Geryonis illud fuisse fingitur: post, Corpus, (quia non
definitive in loco) quale esse nullum potest, Infinitum: dein Corpus, (quia
totum in qualibet part Hostiae) quale quis vix somniare potest, Paraphysicum:
insuper Corpus (ut ipsi aiunt) omni movendi, sentiendi, intelligendique
facultate destitutum, id est, coecum, surdum, exanime: Corpus denique nullis
non sordibus cuiusvis sterquilinij, and locorum, quae honest nominari non
possunt, inhonestissimoru^ obnoxium. Qualia Opinionum portenta, ut omnino
Haeretica, veteres Patres semper execrati sunt.

Verum enim vero diversarum aetatum subrancidas Historias, si numeremus,
Tredecim proferunt, in quibus memoria de verissimae carnis, verissimique
sanguinis Christi in Eucharistia Apparentia verissima Lectoribus co^mendatur.
In quibus Miraculis, tanquam in Dei testimoniis omni exceptione majoribus,
Adversarij nostri mirifice gloriantur; et dici vix potest quantopere miseros
mortales hac una Persuasione sua dementarint: cum tamen haec verissima,
scilicet, si ponderentur, vanissima esse singula cuivis liquere possit. Quem in
finem bonis illis Historicis valedicentes, recta Scholas petimus, exploraturi
an Scholastici eandem insanierint insaniam. Hi tantum abest ut istis
Legendariis fide^ assensionem ve praebeant, ut in ejusmodi Apparitionibus vel
veram carnem Christi, vel omnino veram carnem inesse ausint non pernegare modo,
verum-etiam contrariam hanc suam sententiam exquisitis Rationibus defendere.
Quanqua^ quid horu^ probatione opus est? quandoqude^ nemo fere est tam mucosis
naribus (modonon sensus suos prorsus obstruat) cui non suboleat, imo qui non
eas lege^do plane odoretur, et persentiscat has fabulas a maleferiatis
hominibus aniliter esse confictas.

Quarto, In Corporali sua (ut vocant) Christi conjunctione cum Corporibus
Communicantium nihil aliud cernere licet quam Capernaiticam quandam
stupiditatem; quoties Pontificios audimus antiquas suas canere Cantilenas: se
nimirum Dentibus terere, gutturibus deglutire, hoc est, ut nos quidem
interpretamur, vere devorare; atque insuper hominum visceribus permiscere; and
tandem (adsit verbo reverentia) in secessum egerere; imo tam canum, muriumque,
nec non vilissimi cujusque animalis intestinis, quam ullius etiam sanctissimi
viri, qui illius particeps esse potest. Quis deinceps miretur fuisse olim, qui
Philosophos se dicerent, qui asserebant, Nivem sibi atram videri, Coelum
consistere, and Terram motione sua eaque perpetua rotari?

Hosce scopulos praetervecti, in Contentionum labyrinthum dilabimur, de
Sacrificio Missae, tot Amphibologiis and verborum involucris, tot Opinionum
Antilogiis, ceu viarum anfractibus, and sinuosis Maeandris undique implicitum,
ut absque commoda aliqua Distinctione difficiles, imo impossibiles habeat
explicatus: eoque magis, quod apud veteres Patres (ut quod res est libere
fateamur) de Sacrificio Corporis Christi in Eucharistia Incruento frequens est
mentio: quae dici vix potest quantopere quorundam, alioqui Doctorum hominum,
ingenia exercuerint, torserint, vexaverint; aut econtra quam jactanter
Pontificij de ea re se ostentent: cum tamen hic nodus uno hoc Distinctionis
quasi cuneo facile diffindatur. Vox, Corpus Christi, dupliciter sumitur, vel ut
Subjectum Celebrationis Eucharisticae, vel ut ejusdem Corporis Objectum. Si
Subjective accipiatur pro eo, cui externa Accidentia insunt, tum non potest non
Corporalem Praesentiam Christi designare: sin vero Objective tantum, habita
Relatione ad Christi corpus, vel ut olim in cruce pendentis, vel ut nunc in
coelo regnantis, Praesentiam duntaxat Symbolicam declarat; quoniam Objectum,
licet rei cruentae, ut in Scena, ipsum est tamen Incruentum. Id quod sex
Argumenta, e veteru^ Patrum testimonijs deprompta, dilucide demonstrant. Eade^
igitur Distinctione quivis poterit ita prorsus (...), ut non habeant quod
contra mussitent. Quid? quod praeterea etiam Romana Missa Grandis Sacrilegij
rea arguitur.

Ad extremum, extremae and nefandae Idolomaniae Romans (...) ipsum, quae est
Sacramenti Eucharistiae divina Adoratio, in medium protrahitur; ubi id, quod
adorant, Posse esse adhuc Panem, propter fere infinitos Defectus, ipsi
Adversarij ultro concedunt: and Nos, Non posse illud non panem esse, juxta
Veterum sententiam, Rationibus circiter sexdecim evicimus: atque etiam quas
Adorandi Formulas, ceu Praetextus, excusationis ergo, sibi tanquam larvas
induxerunt, illis detraximus, ut vultus eorum deformes horridique appareant;
usque eo ut illi Idololatrica impietate Ethnicos aequare, Excusationis vero
futilitate long superare videantur. Quid tandem? tota fere Missae defensio
Manichaeorum, Eunomianorum, Marcionitarum, Eutychianorum, aliorumque multorum
Haeresibus scat et passim, ut in postrema nostra Synopsi, veluti in speculo,
contemplari quivis poterit. Dum ista literis consigno, ostenduntur mihi, inter
alias, Theses duae, quas Isaacus Casaubonus: (...) in Adversarijs suis, propria
manu scriptis, post se reliquit. Prima; Iusta Causa est (inquit) cur
Transsubstantiatio rejiciatur, ut evitentur Absurda. Altera haec est; Veteres
nunquam dixerunt destrui Symbola, sed semper de Signis locuti sunt, quasi de re
ipsa. Quae quam verae sunt, and juxta Veterum sententiam ad Causam nostram
oppido necessariae, nostri muneris erit suo loco copiose ostendere. Priusquam
vero perorare mihi liceat, vos orandi estis (Viri ornatissimi) ut de
Adversariorum nostrorum Iniquitate, de meoque erga vos studio ac Benevolentia
nonnihil attexam.

Bellarmino, Alano, Maldonato, alijsque Romanae Missae Assertoribus suum, ut
par est, ingenij acumen, exactum and perspicax judicium, omnium denique tam
humanae quam divinae literaturae accuratam cognitionem facile tribuimus; ita
tamen ut in ijs, dum nostros Theologos criminantur, veritatem; dum suas
opiniones defendunt, constantiam; dum Patres, Patres crepant, objectant,
inculcant, fidem modestiamque desideremus. Vt nihil de Eorum Iuramentis
dicamus, quibus se obstrinxerunt, non sine aliqua nota Perjurij; quod Synopsis
nostra Secunda satis superque declarat.

Ad nostram quod attinet Sacratissima^ Eucharistiam; quia a Ministro Elementa
consecrantur et benedicuntur, non minus Sacramenta sunt, quam est aqua
Baptismatis; quae tamen istos non pudet probris suis contaminare, dum partem
alteram merum Pistoris panem, alteram Oenopolae vinum nudum appellant nequiter.
Deinde (ut alias eorum Calumnias praetervolem) quod eorum de Corporali Christi
Praesentia in Eucharistia fanaticam Opinionem, tanquam Impossibilem, propter
implicitam Contradictionem, oppugnamus; Isti, quasi hoc esset Dei Omnipotentiae
detrahere, in nos impotenter debacchantur. Si cui lubeat singulas Operis hujus
Sectiones percurrere, vix in aliquam incidet aut Objectionem Adversariorum pro
sua Missa, aut Responsionem, aut denique Scripturae expositionem quam non
facile observet ab aliis Pontificiis Doctoribus aut luculenta ratione solutam,
enervatam, explosam; aut denique (quod majus est) per receptas Ecclesiae
Romanae doctrinas oppugnatam. Nae illae praeclara est istorum hominum
constantia, qui si minus viribus nostris, sua tamen imbecillitate and
dissensione vincuntur, atque succumbunt.

Praeterea de Pontificiorum Doctorum Versutia Obstinaciaque satis queri vix
possumus. Versutia eorum cernitur cum in rebus aliis, tum praecipue in
abutendis veterum Patrum Testimoniis, sive per falsas Editiones
Translationesque ea depravando; sive novo excogitato Commento illudendo; sive
denique adversis frontibus oppugnando: quorum omnium Exempla plurima Libri
singuli sequentes vobis exhibent. Obstinaciae vero eorum specimen nullum potest
esse illustrius, quam (quod in altera Synopsi nostra videre est) ex Veterum
sententiis facta Collatione Eucharistiae cum Baptismate. Illi ad sua Dogmata
stabilienda, de Praesentia Corporali Corporis Christi in Eucharistia, ipsiusque
adeo Adoratione Latreutica, objiciunt Nobis, Patres negasse Eucharistiam esse
nudum Panem. Nos reponimus, eosdem Patres pariter negasse, in Baptismate esse
Aquam nudam. At opponunt, Veteres Eucharistiam Sacrificium vocasse. Nos rursus,
Baptisma quoque Sacrificium nominant. Illi, At apud Patres Eucharistia
Sacramentum Terribile, and Venerabile dicitur. Regerimus nos, a Patribus moneri
homines ad Baptisma, utpote quod Venerandum sit, cum Tremore accedere. Pergimus
dein, and per sexdecim (...) par pari referimus, quod Adversariorum nostroru^,
nisi animos obfirment, Conscientias mordeat and lancinet; sed manu tamen
medica, ut sanet. Eant igitur Antagonistae nostri, and, cum de Antiquitate
agitur, nos (ut solent) Novatores appellitent, nunquam tamen efficient, quin
ipsi (ut praeclare olim Clariss. vir Josephus Scaliger) Veteratores habeantur.

Redeo ad Vos tandem (dignissimi Viri) quorum intimos animorum conceptus audire
mihi videor: quibus quoad possim, and liceat, occurrendum esse duxi. Primo in
loco; Fateor equidem me jamdiu in istiusmodi Polemicis negotiis exercuisse
calamum, non quod nesciverim a Detractione neminem esse immunem, nisi qui nihil
scriberet: sed quod abunde noverim cum pro salute Patriae, tum vero maxim pro
patria Salutis, atque adeo pro Fidei synceritate nullum non laborem esse
subeundum. Secundo, multos alios multo majore cum profectu munere hoc defungi
posse agnosco: veruntamen, quatenus praestare quicquam valeam, illud S.
Augustini aures mihi vellicat, animumque stimulat: Qui mendacium docet,
(inquit) and qui veritatem tacet, uterque reus est; alter quia prodesse non
vult, alter quia nocere desiderat. Nec profecto hanc Romulei stabuli (cum
purgandi non datur) exagitandi provinciam, in re Missatica, alio animo suscepi,
quam ut omnes (quibus veritas cordi est) intelligant, Nos Anglicanae Ecclesiae
Alumnos Causam nactos esse Divinis literis consentientem maxim, Catholicae
Antiquitatis suffragijs comprobatam, mill omnis ordinis Martyrum sanguine
testatam; imo etiam (addendum est enim) cujusvis Christiani, si fieri posset,
vel mill mortibus obsignandam. Praeterea, Romanae Ecclesiae Tyrunculis
omissis, Antesignanos ipsos libentius aggredior, duplici ratione adductus; quia
primo, his profligatis, illi non possunt consistere: deinde, ut clarius
constet, in illam Ecclesiam quadrare illud Christi; Si lumen, quod in te,
tenebrae, ipsae tenebrae quantae? Quos tamen, dum Argumentis persequor, non
probris insector; quia in hoc altero Certaminis genere vincere vinci est: nam
praeclare olim Artaxerxes Rex militi, hostem convitijs proscindenti, Non ut
maledicas te alo, (inquit) sed ut pugnes.

Cur vero Vobis potissimum has meas Lucubrationes dedicarem, plurimae me Causae
impulerunt. Antiquitus plurimi dicebantur Episcopi Catholicae sive Vniversalis
Ecclesiae, non solum quod Catholicam tenerent fidem, sed etiam quod suam pro
incolumitate Ecclesiae Vniversalis curam Scriptis and laboribus testarentur.
Egone igitur ut non illud studium erga utramque Vniversitatem profitear meum,
quod ipsi (ut ita dicam) Vniversalitati debeam? Huc accedit (nam quidni fidorum
Amicorum literis fidem habeam?) quod cum vos Opus nostrum aliud, tribus abhinc
annis publici juris factum, non vulgari animorum vestrorum significatione
approbasse intellexerim; hocque, quod nunc ad umbilicum perduxi, non minori cum
desiderio expectasse (quorum illud GRANDEM ROMANAE ECCLESIAE IMPOSTVRAM
detexit, hoc ROMANAE MISSAE IDOLOMANIAM, tanquam immane monstrum, confodicat)
non committendum putavi, ut non grati animi meum hoc testimonium Vobis
referrem. Quid? quod Causae ipsius necessitas quoque id a me exigere videbatur,
quae profecto in hac Causa homines Academicos nihil minus quam Academicos and
Scepticos esse sinet; ne quis vestrum (quod detestabile omen Deus obruat!) in
Romans Artolatriam prolabatur, quo vel Aliis scandalo, Majestati divinae odio,
Sibi ipsi denique certo exitio esse possit.

Postremo, in hanc spem adducor, nunquam defuturos ex utraque Academia viros
plurimos, Theologici juris consultiss. omnibusque armis instructissimos, non
modo ad hujusce Causae patrocinium sustinendum, verumetiam ad Mataeologiam
omnem Romanensium expugnandam. Pergite igitur o macti antiqua prudentia and
veritate, pergite, inquam, and Amantissimum vestri diligite; quod rectius
noveritis impertite, and precibus vestris adjuvate. In Christo Jesu valete, qui
vos conservet in gloriam Gratiae suae! AMEN.

An Advertisement
To all Romish Priests and Jesuits of the English Seminaries, concerning the
Necessity of this ensuing Treatise; as also of the Authors Sincerity, and his
Adversaries unconscionable Dealing in their Allegations of Authors.
Grace, Peace, and Truth in CHRIST JESUS.
AMong all the Controversies held against your Romish Religion, none were ever
more hott, to draw Protestants violently into the fire, than these two; First,
the denying your Roman Church to be The Catholic Church, without which there
is no Salvation: Secondly, the affirming the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament
of the Altar to be Idolatrous. Therefore have I especially undertaken the
discussion of both these Questions, that seeing (as Saint Augustine truly said)
It is not the punishment, but the Cause which makes a Martyr; it might fully
appear to the world, whether Protestants enduring that fiery trial, for both
Causes, were indeed Heretics, or true Martyrs: and consequently whether their
Persecutors were just Executioners of persons then condemned, and not rather
damnable Murderers of the faithful Servants of Christ. And I doubt not, but
as the first has veverified the Title of that Book, to prove your Doctrine,
of the Necessity of Salvation in your Romish Church, to be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE:
So this second, which I now (according to my promise) present unto you, will
make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish MASS is a very Mass, or
rather a Gulf of many Superstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Positions
and Practices.

And because the very name of ROMAN CHVRCH is commonly used as (in it self) a
powerful enchantment, to stupifie every Romish Disciple, and to strike him
deaf and dumb at once, that he may neither hear nor utter any thing in
Conference, concerning the Mass, or any other Controversy in Religion; be the
Protestants Defense never so Divine for Truth, or Ancient for Time, or
Universal for Consent, or Necessary for Belief: I therefore held it
requisite, in the first place, to discover the falsehood of the former Article
of your Church, before I would publish the Abominations of the Mass; to the
end that (for I^^latrie in Scripture is often termed spiritual Adultery) the
Romish Church, which plays the Bawd, in patronizing Idolatry, being once
outted, your Romish Mass, as the Strumpet, might the more easily either be
reformed, or wholly abandoned.

This may satisfy you for the necessity of this Tractate. The next must be
to set before you your own delusorie tricks, in answering, or not answering
Books written against you; especially such as have been observed from mine
own experience. One is, to strangle a Book in the very birth: So dealt Master
Brerely long since, by a Letter writ unto me, to prevent the publishing of my
Answer against the first Edition of his Apology, when he sent me a second
Edition thereof to be answered, which both might and ought to have been sent a
twelve month sooner; but was purposely reserved not to be delivered, until
the very day after my See the Protestants Appeal in the beginning.
Answer (called An Appeal) was published. Of which his prevention I have
therefore complained, as of a most unconscionable Circumvention. Another device
you have, to give out that the Book (whatsoever,) written against your Romish
Tenants, is in answering, and that an Answer will come out shortly. So dealt
Master Parsons with me, In his Sober Reckoning.
Certifying me and all his credulous Readers of an Epistle which he had
received from a Scottish Doctor, censuring my Latin Apologies to be both fond
and false; and promising that his Answer to them, Printed at Gratz in Austria,
should be published before the Michaelmas next following: whereas there have
been above twenty Michaelmasses sithence, every one giving Master Parsons his
promise the flatt lie. A third Art is a voluntary Concealment; And thus
Master Brerely, who having had knowledge of the forementioned Book of
Appeal, manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absursurdities in doctrine,
his ignorances and frauds in the abuse of his Authors; as in other passages
throughout that Book, so more especially the parts concerning the Romish
Mass: yet since has written a large Book, in defense of the Romish Liturgy
or Mass, urging all the same Proofs and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely
concealing that they had been confuted, and his Falsehoods discovered. Only
he and Master Fisher singling out of my Appeal an Explanation, which I gave
of the Testimony of Gelasius (in condemning the Manichees, concerning their
opinion of not administering the Eucharist in both kinds) did both of them
divulge it in their Books and reports also in many parts of this Kingdom, as
making for the justification of their sacrilegious dismembring the holy
Sacrament, and for a foul Contradiction unto my self notwithstanding that
this their scurrilous insultation (as is Bo^ke 1. cap. 3. Sect. 7.
here proved) serves for nothing rather than to make themselves ridiculous.
The last, but most base and devilish Gullerie, is a false imputation of
Falsehoods in the alleging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of Master
Parsons; a man as subtle for Invention, as elegant for Expression, for
Observation as dextrous and acute, and as politic and persuasive for
Application, as any of his time. He in an Answer to some Treatises, written
against your Romish black Art of Aequivocation by mental Reservation, and
other Positions fomenting Rebellion (to wit) in his Books of Mitigation and
Sober Re^koning, does commonly leave the principal Objections and reasons,
and falls to his verbal skirmishes, concerning false Allegations: and (as
turning that Ironicall Counsel into earnest, Audacter and fortiter calumniare,
etc.) he charge me with no less than fifty Falsifications All which I
spunged out in a Book entitled an Encounter, and retorted all the same
Imputations of falsehood upon himself, with the interest, discovering above
forty more of his own. Which may seem to verify that Cognizance, which your
own Brotherhood of Romish Priests in their Quodlibets have fastened on his
sleeve, calling him The Quintessence of Coggerie.

As for mine own Integrity, I have that which may justify me; for howsoever
any one or other Error may happen, in mis-alleging any one Author, yet that I
have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my Conscience. Hereof I
have many Witnesses; One within me, a witness most Domestical, yet least
partial, and as good as Thousands, mine own Conscience: a second is above
me, GOD, who is Greater than the Conscience. A third sort of Witnesses are
such as stand by me, even all they who have been conversant with me, in the
Perusal and Examination of Authors Testimonies, by me alleged; men of
singular Learning and Judgment, who can testify how much they endeared
them-selves unto me, when any of them happened to show me the least error in
any thing. (He that shall say, Non possum errare, must be no man; and he that
will not say, Nolo errare, as hating to err, can be no Christian man.) The
last Witness, for my integrity, may be the Books of my greatest
Adversaries, Master Parsons, and Master Brerely, whose many scores of Falsehoods
have been laid so open and published for above sixteen years past in two
Books (one called An Encounter against the Foreman, the other an Appeal
against the Second) yet has not any one appeared out of your Romish
Seminaries, for the vindicating of them herein.

*Since this Part of this Advertisement thus given, there have some of your
Engineers sought to undermine the whole Structure of this Treatise, by the
odious Imputation of Falsification; One was a L: Baron, and his Suggestor:
Another, a notable Seducer, in his Letters to a noble Peer of this Kingdom:
the Third, a Romishly inspired Detractor, who are, in this Second Edition,
defeated by a Countermine of just Vindications, against their False and
frivolous Exceptions. To say nothing of a late Hobgoblin his feigned Letter to
a Lady, upbraiding me with such Taxations of some Falsities, which about six
and twenty years since, were falsely charged upon me by Master Parsons, as I
proved in a Book of Encounter. By which your Practice is confirmed that which
I have often averred, That none may expect from you any Satisfactorie
Confutation of this, or the like Treatises, seeing that instead of Shot, you
answer only with Squibs. Go on in the same Course, to make me thereby a true
Prophet, and (by my Vindications against your Calumniations) to occasion
greater Advantage to our Cause, and just Defense thereof.*

By these Advertisements you may now easily conceive with what confidence I may
proceed in this Work, wherein is displayed and laid open, in the discussing of
these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed Sacrament of the
Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE; GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EAT; DRINK,]
your ten Romish Prevarications, and Transgressions. Afterward, in the
following Books, are reveiled the stupendous Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnesse,
and Idolatry of your MASS; together with the notorious Obstinacies, some few
Overtures of Perjuries (out of that great Sum, which may afterward be
manifested in your swearing to the other Articles of your new Roman Faith) and
the manifold Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also their indirect and
sinister Objecting and Answering of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers

Conscience Sake.

To Conclude. Whosoever among you has been fascinated (according to your
Colliers Catechism) with that only Article of an Implicit Faith, let him be
admonished to submit to that Duty prescribed by the Spirit of God, to Try
all things, and to Hold that which is good. And if any have a purpose to
Rejoyne, in Confutation either of the Book of the Romish Imposture, or of
this, which is against your Mass; I do adjure him in the name of Christ, whose
truth we seek, that avoiding all deceitful Collusions, he proceed
materially from Sed surdis canimus.

for before the Judgment seat of Christ. Our Lord Jesus preserve us to the
glory of his saving Grace. AMEN.

FINIS.


Concerning the Active part of Christ his Jnstitution of the Eucharist; and the
TEN Romish TRANSGRESSIONS thereof.

That the Original of the word, ^ASSE, nothing advantageth the Romish Mass.
SECT. I.
Diverse of your Romish Nomen antiquissimum, Missa, (quod quidem fides
Christiana profitetur) ex Hebraica vel Chaldaica nomenclatura acceptum esse
videtur, Missah, i. e. spontanea oblatio, conveniens instituto Sacrificio.

Doctors would have the word, MASS, first to be (in the first and primitive
Imposition and Hebrew word Missah, which signifies Oblation and Sacrifice;
even the highest Homage that can be performed unto God. And all this, to prove
(if it may be) that, which you call, THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.

CHALLENGE.
SO have these your Doctors taught, notwithstanding many other Romanists, as
well Jesuits as others of principal Note in your Church, enquiring (as it
were) after the native Country, kindred, and age of the Word, MASS, do not
only say, but also prove, first, that It is no Hebrew-borne. Secondly, that

Thirdly, that it is a plain Latin word, to wit, Mass, signifying the
Dismission of the Congregation. Which Confessions being testified (in our

It is the same with (...) in the Greek Church: and with Ilicet amongst the
ancient Romans.] See the Testimony following at (c.)
Margin) by so large a Consent of your own Doctors, prooved by so clear
Evidence, and delivered by Authors of so eminent estimation in your own
Church; must not a little lessen the credit of your other Doctors (noted for
Neotericks) who have vainly labored, under the word MASS, falsely
Sacrificing MASS.

*And left Any might object that the same Word, MASS, (as signifying the
Dismission of the People) had no good foundation, because it was not at first
prescribed by the Church, but taken up of the People; your Jesuit Gordon
quitteth this, saying, Iac. Gordonus Scotus lib. Controvers. Controv. 9. cap.
6. Quamvis appellatio Missae originem accepit a populo, tamen divina
providentia factum est ut populus hanc appellationem huic mysterio tribueret:
vulgo enim dici solet, quod vox populi sit vox Dei, nec dubitamus quin Spiritus
instinctu hoc factum sit. Page 313.
The voice of the People is the voice of God: and that you are not to doubt but
that it was infused into them by the instinct of the Spirit of God.

That the word, MASS, in the Primitive Signification thereof, does properly
belong unto the Protestants: and justly condemns the Romish manner of Mass.
SECT. II.

[As for the disraissing of the whole Congregation after the receiving of the

Penance-sake, to see themselves excluded from the Communion of the faithful.

Confession of Jesuits and Others, and that from the authority of Councels,
Fathers, and all Latin Liturgies) is therefore so called from the Latin phrase
[ Missa est] especially, because the company of the Catechumenists, as they
also which were not prepared to communicate at the celebrating of this
Sacrament, after the hearing of the Gospel, or Sermons, were Dismissed, and not
suffered to stay, but commanded To depart. Which furthermore your Ies.
Maldonate, out of Isidore, of most ancient authors, and of all other the
Liturgies, is compelled to confess to be the Most true meaning of Antiquity.

Which Custom of exempting all such persons, being every Priests manner of
celebrating your Roman Mass, without communicating thereof, contrary to the
Institution of Christ; contrary to the practice of Antiquity; and contrary to
the proper Use of the Sacrament (all which See Chap. 2. Sect. 9.

WHereas there is nothing more rife and frequent in your Speeches, more
ordinary in your Oaths, or more sacred in your common Estimation, than the
name of the MASS; yet are you, by the Signification of that very word,
convinced of a manifest Transgression of the Institution of Christ: and
therefore your great boast of that name is to be judged false, and absurd. But
of this Transgression more See below, Cha. 2. Sect. 5.

says) Christ said Mass. And how often do we hear your vulgar people
talking of Christ his Mass? Which word MASS (in the proper Signification
already specified) could not possibly have been so distasteful unto Us, if you
had not abused it to your fained, and (as you now see) false sense of your kind
of Proper Oblation, and Sacrifice. Therefore was it a supersluous labor of Mr.

Institution of the Eucharist, Matt. 26. Luc. 22. [ And Jesus took bread, etc.]

What Circumstances, by joint Consent on both sides, are to be exempted out of
this Canon of Christ his Mass; or the words of his Institution. It is no less
Christian wisdom and Charity, to cut off unnecessary Controversies, than it
is a Serpentine malice to engender them; and therefore we exempt those Points,
which are not included within this Canon of Christ, beginning at these And
Jesus took bread, etc.] To know, that all other Circumstances, which at the
Institution of Christ his Supper fell out accidentally, or but occasionally
(because of the then-Iewish Passover, which Christ was at that time to finish;
or else by reason of the custom of Iudaea) do not come within this our
dispute touching Christ his Mass; whether it be that they concern Place, (for
it was instituted in a private house:) or Time, (which was at night:) or Sex,
(which were only men:) or Posture, (which was a kind of lying down:) or
Vesture, (which was we know not what:) no nor yet whether the Bread was
unleavened, Wine mixed with water: two points which (as you know) Protestants

This point of mixture of water with wine was not commanded of Christ: but
afterward enjoined by the Church. This being (as Jesuits and others do
witness) a Doctrine generally consented unto by your Schoolmen, and they
themselves giving their Amen thereunto; as also alleging, for their own
better confirmation herein, the judgment of two late Romish Councils, Florence
and Trent; besides their dint of Reasons; whereof one was the ground of my
Assertion (to wit) Because if it had been commanded by Christ, or ordained by
necessity of a Precept of Christ, it should be likewise of the necessity, or
Essence of the Sacrament; which Necessity the Church of Rome universally
excludes. The Consequence therefore is evident; for whatsoever was instituted,
as the matter of a Sacrament, was ever held to be of the necessity of the
Essence of the same Sacrament. Wherefore we may reckon this Mixture amongst
those Circumstances of Christ's Actions, which were Occasional, by reason of
the use and Custom of that Country of Iudaea at that time, for the tempering
and allaying of their Wine with Water. Iac. Gordon lib. Contr. 9. cap. 7.
Praeterea in calida illa regione omnes solebant miscere aquam vino: vinum autem
merum bibebat nemo page 320.
That region being so hot (says your Jesuit) that none drank mere Wine, but
mixed with water.*

The Points contained within the Canon of Christ his Mass, and appertaining to
our present Controversy, are of two kinds, viz. 1. Practical. 2. Doctrinall.
SECT. V.
or Active is that part of the Canon, which concerns Administration,
Participation, and Receiving of the holy Sacrament, according to this Tenor,
Matthew. 2^. (...) [And Jesus took Bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave
it to his Disciples, and said, Take, eat, etc. And Luc. 2^. 19. ^^. Do this in
remembrance of me. Likewise also after Supper he took the Cup, and gave
thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this.] But the Points,
which are especially to be called Doctrinall, are implied in these words of the
Evangelists; [THIS IS MY BODY: And, THIS IS MY BLOOD of the new Testament, We
begin with the Practical.

Command, for the first part, is [ Do this:] and concerning the other likewise

CHALLENGE.
THis Command of Christ, being thus directly and copiously acknowledged by the
best Divines in the Roman Church, must needs challenge on both sides an
answerable performance. Upon examination whereof, it will appear unto every
Conscience of man, which Professors (namely, whether Protestants or Romanists)
are the true and Catholic Executors and Observers of the last will and
Testament of our Testator Jesus: Spouse of Christ, which does more precisely
obey the Command of the celestial Bridegroom. We, to this purpose, apply our
selves to our business, by enquiring what are the Active Particulars, which
Christ has given in charge unto his Church by these his express words [ Do
this.] All which we are to discover and discuss from point to point.

that the Consecration, used by our Savior, was performed by that his Blessing
by Prayer, which preceded the pronouncing of those words, [HOC EST CORPUS
MEVM:] [ This is my Body, etc.] To this purpose hec is bold to aver that
Thomas Aquinas, and all Catholic; before Cajetane have confessed that Christ
did consecrate in that his [BENEDIXIT, that is, He^h essed it.] And that Saint
James and Dionyse the Areopagit^ did not Consecrate only in the other words,
but by Prayer. Then he assures us that the Greek Churches maintained, that
Consecration consists in Benediction, by Prayer, aforesaid. After this he
produces your subtilest Schooleman Scotus, accompanied with diverse others, who
Derided those, that attributed such a supernatural virtue to the other form
of words. After steppeth in your Lindan, who avoucheth Justin (one of the
ancientest of Fathers) as Denying that the Apostles consecrated the Eucharist
in those words, [HOC EST, etc.] and affirming that Consecration could not be
without Prayer.

Be you but pleased to peruse the Marginals, and you shall further find
alleged the Testimonies of Pope Gregory, Hierome, and (to ascend higher) The
Liturgies of Clement, Basil, Chrysostom, and of the Roman Church it self; in
gainsaying of the Consecration, by the only words of Institution, as you
pretend. And in the end he draws in two Popes, one contradicting the other,
in this point; and has no other means to stint their jarre, but (whereas the
authority of both is equal) to think it just to yield rather to the better
learned of them both. Whosoever requires more, may be satisfied by reading of
the Book it self. *And yet we would be loath to pretermit the (confessed)
Testimony of your Jesuit Gordon, out of Saint Augustine, attesting that in
this Sacrament Iac. Gordon. Scotus lib. Contr. 6. cap. 2. number. 6. Sacramentum
hoc sit non per sumptionem, sed per consecrationem, quam alibi S. Aug. (Tom. 3.
lib 3. de Trin. cap. 4) vocat precem mysticam, [ His words;] Illud quod ex
fructibus terrae acceptum, and prece mystica consecratum, rite sumimus, etc. *
The fruit of the earth is consecrated by Mystical Prayer.*

It will not suffice to say, That you also use Prayer, in the Romish Liturgy:
for the question is not merely of Praying, but where in the form of
Benediction and Consecration more properly does consist. Now none can say, that
he consecrateth by that Prayer, which he believes is not ordained for
Consecration. We may furthermore take hold, by the way, of the Testification of
M^. Tra^tat. of the M^sse, page 105.
Brerely a Romish Priest, who, out of Basil and Chrysostom, (calling one part

All this Army of Witnesses were no better then Meteors, or imaginary figures
of battles in the air, if that the Answer of Bellarmine may go for warrant,
to wit, that the only Pronuntiation of these words [Hoc est corpus meum] imply
in them (as he Verb^ haec [Hoc est corpus meum] pronunciata a Sacerdote, cum
intention con. cer^ndi Sacramentum, continent implic^e Invocationem Bellarm.
lib 4 de Euch. c 1^.. Qunt. arg.
says) in Invocation, or Prayer. Which words (as any man may perceive) Christ
spoke not supplicatorily unto God, but declaratively unto his Apostles,
accordingly as the Text speaks, [ He said unto them.] as is also well See the
former testimony, letter ( g)
observed by your foresaid Archbishop of Caesarea, out of Saint Hierome. But
none of you (we presume) will dare to say that Christ did Invocate his
Disciples.

*This might Bellarmine have learned from Antiquity, if he had not rather
affected to have been a Doctor over all others, than a Scholar to Primitive
Fathers; who teach that Christ reveiled not unto any his words of See (...) B.
7. Chapter 3 at the letters, ( i. k.)
Invocation by Prayer, wherewith he consecrated: which they would not have said,
if they had judged these words [THIS IS MY BODY] to imply in them an
Invocation. * These words therefore are of Invocation.

Which (now) Romish Doctrine of Consecrating, by reciting these words [ This is
my Body, etc.] your Divines of Colen Vehemens prorsus insania est, quod nunc

have judged to be a Fierce madness, as being repugnant both to the Eastern
and Western Churches. But we have heard diverse Western Authors speak, give
leave to an Eastern Archbishop to deliver his mind. Quod autem ille sermo

No Apostle, or Doctor is known to affirm (says he) those sole words of
Christ to have been sufficient for Consecration. So he, three hundred years
since, satisfying also the Testimony of Chrysostom, objected to the contrary.

This Sacrament is not made as soon as these words are uttered, but afterward,
by certain prayers of the Church. And why these Greek Fathers should not
rather resolve us of the ancient Greek tenor of Consecration, than any of your
late Italian or Latin Doctors, who will make question? As for your other
Greek Patriarch Bessarion, who was made Cardinal by your Church, on purpose,
Prayer, besides these words, [ This is my body] did thereby testify that they
held these to be words of Invocation.*

you answer that some Fathers did use such speeches in their Sermons to the
people, but in their secret instruction of Priests did teach otherwise. Which
Answer (besides the falsity thereof) We take to be no better than a reproach
against Antiquity; and all one as to say, that those venerable Witnesses of
Truth would profess one thing in the Cellar, and proclaim the contrary on
the housetop. It were to be wished, that when

We conclude. Seeing that Form (as all learning teaches) gives Being unto
all things; therefore your Church, albeit she use Prayer, yet erring in her
judgment concerning the perfect manner and Form of Consecration of this
Sacrament, how shall she be credited in the materials? wherein she will be
found, as well as in this, to have Transgressed the same Injunction of Christ,
[DO THIS.]

It was Mr Brereley his error, Liturg. p. 101. in alleging Irenaeus lib. 5. c.
1. Quando mixtus calix, and fractus panis percepit verbum Dei, fit Eucharistia.
[ Here by verbum Dei, is not meant the words of Hoc est, etc. but Prayer, and
the word of Blessing, commanded by the Word of Christ, who blessedit, and
commanded his Church, saying, Do this: as appears by. Iren. lib. 4. c. 34.
when he says, Panis percipiens vocationem ( for Invocationem) Dei, non est
communis panis.] In the next place Ambrose l. 4. c. 4. de Sacr. Consecratio
igitur quibus verbis fit? Domini Jesus, etc. Ergo ^ermo Christi conficit hoc
Sacramentum, nempe is, quo facta sunt omnia, jussit, and factum est. [ This is
the Allegation; whereas if he had taken but a little pains, to have read the
Chapter following, he should have received Saint Ambrose his plain
Resolution; that they meant the words of Prayer. Vis scire quibus verbis
coelestibus consecratur? Accipe verba, Dicit Sacerdos, Fac nobis hanc
Oblationem acceptam, etc. Then he proceeds to the Repetition of the whole
institution, as the complement of Consecration, in the words [Take, eat, This
is my body:] but not only in these words, [This is my body.] We see then that
the Latin Church had this form (Fac) even as the Greek had their (...): both
in Prayer, but neither of both without reciting the form of Institution.]
Mr. Brerely) to exclude, out of the words of this Celebration, the Repetition
and pronuntiation of these words [ This is my Body: and, This is my Blood of
the new Testament.] Far be this from us, because we hold them to be
essentially Christ; and are used in the Liturgy of our Church: for although
they be not words of Blessing and Consecration, (because not of Petition, but
of Repetition) yet are they Words of Direction; and, withal, Significations
and Testifications of the mystical effects thereof.

*A Vindication, against the (possible) adverse Conceits of Some. For a
further manifestation, hearken you unto that which is written; 1. Tim. 4. 4.
Every Creature of God is good, if it be sanctified with the word of God, and
with Prayer. Wherein we find a double acception of Sanctification; the one of
Ordination, by The word of God: the other of Benediction, namely, by For
example, The eating of Swines flesh is sanctified to the use of a Christian,
first by Ordination, because the word of God in the new Testament has taught
us the lawful use of Swines flesh: and secondly by Benediction by Prayer, or
giving of thanks, in which respect it is, that the Apostle calls the one part
the Cup of Blessin. 1 Cor. 10. 16. Both of these are to be found in our
Sacramental food, wherein we have the Sanctification thereof, both by the
Word of Christ in the tenor of his first Institution, He took bread, etc.
adding [ Do this:] as also by public blessing in Prayer, which is more
properly called Consecration.

And although in our Domestical feasts, the second Course is blessed in the
grace, which was said upon the first service; so the second supply of Bread and
Wine (if it shall inordinately He took bread, etc.] be applied to every
oblation of new Bread and Wine, for accommodation-sake, as they are referred in
our Liturgy; wherein they are necessarily joined together with the words of
Prayer and Benediction. Therefore, where you shall find in the Fathers the
words of Christ's Institution, Consecration; * Chrysostom. Tom. 3 Hom. 30. de
Proditione Iud^ [Ioc est Corpus me^^.] ^ubus verbis res productae Consecrantur.
and Anthros. lib ^ de Sacram. c. 4. Verba Christi faciunt hoc Sacramentum.
Ibid. c. 5. Vis scire quibus verbis Secramentum consecratur? Sacerdos dicit:
Fac, Deus, hanc nobis oblationem. [ Then he repeateth the words of Institution.]
(as it is in Chrysostom and Ambrose) it must be understood as joined with
Prayer, as the Benediction it self, which has been See more in the Margent
above, in the beginning of this Section.*
already copiously confessed; as well as it is furthermore acknowledged by your
Jesuit, that Cressollius les. lib 1. Mystag. cap. 19. Diaconi vocati sunt
Consecrantes in gestis S. Laurentii in hunc modum, [Cui commisisti Domanici
sanguinis consecrationem.] Illa etiam vox, Consecratio, reperiebatur apud S.
Ambros. lib. 1. offic. c. 41. Qui locus non esse mendosus existimandus est,
quia Ambrosius summa side narrationem suam texuerat ex actis S. Laurentij;
neque hic Consecratio proprie et definite sumitur, quasi Diaconus hostiam
consecraret, sed ex communi Ecclesiae usu totam sacram actionem significat.
Sometime the whole sacred Action was called Consecration, insomuch that the
Deacon, who does not meddle with the words of Consecration, is notwithstanding
called a Consecrator in Saint Ambrose. So he.*

The second Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass;
HE brake it.] So all the Evangelists do relate. Which Act of Christ plainly
notes that he Brake the Bread, for distributing of the same unto his
Disciples. And his Command is manifest, in saying as well in behalf of this,
as of the rest, [ Do this.] Your Priest indeed Breaks one Host into three
Consecration thereof: but our Question is of Fraction or Breaking, for
Distribution to the people.

The contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass. Ecce, in coena Christus fregit
panem: and tamen Ecclesia Catholica modo non frangit, sed integrum dat.
Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34.. Nam. p. 275.
BE HOLD (say You) Christ brake it; but the Catholic Church (meaning the
Roman) now does not break it, but gives it whole. And this you pretend to
do for reverence sake, Lest (as your A multo tempore non usurp^^r fractio, sed
singuli panes seu minores hostiae consecrantur, ad evitandum periculum
decidentium micatum. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 2. 42.
Jesuit says) some crummes may fall to the ground. Neither is there any
Direction to your Priest to Break the Bread, before or after Consecration, in
your Roman Mass; especially that, which is distributed to the people.

CHALLENGE;
But now see (we pray you) the absolute Confession of your own Doctors,
whereby is witnessed, first, that Christ the bread into twelve parts, Fregit.]
Nimirum in to^ particulas quot erant Apostoli manducaturi, praeter suam, quam

according to the number of Communicants. Secondly, that this Act of Breaking
of bread is such a principal Act, that the whole Celebration of this Sacrament
has had from thence this Appellation given to it, by the Apostles, to be
called Breaking of Bread. Thirdly, that the Church of Christ always observed
the same Ceremony of Breaking the bread, as well in the Greek as in the Latin
( and consequently the Roman) Church. Fourthly, that this Breaking of the
Bread is a Symbolicall Ceremony, betokening not only the Crucifying of Christ's
body upon the Cross, but also (in the common participation thereof)
representing the Union of the Mystical body of

We add, as a most special Reason, that this Breaking it, in the
distribution thereof, is to apply the representation of the Body Crucified,
and the Blood shed to the heart and soul of every Communicant: That as the
Bread is given Broken to us, so was Christ Crucified for us. Yet,
nevertheless, your Church contrarily that although Christ did break bread,
yet (BEHOLD!) she does not so; what is it else, but to starch her face, and
insolently to confront Christ his Command, by her bold Countermand (as you now
see) in effect saying; But do not this.

A SECOND CHALLENGE.
AS for that truly-called Catholic Church, you your selves do grant unto us,
that by Christ his first Institution, by the Practice of the Apostles, by the
ancient and universal Custom Church of Christ, as well Greek as Latin, the
Ceremony of Breaking bread was continually observed. Which may be unto us more
than a probable Argument, that the now Church of Rome does falsely usurp the
Title of CATHOLIC, for the better countenancing and authorizing of her novell,
Customs, although never so repugnant to the will of Christ and Custom of the
truly-called Catholic Church. Howbeit we would not be so understood, as to
think it an Essential Ceremony either to the being of a Sacrament, or to the
Sacramental Administration; but yet requisite, for

In the next place, to your Pretense of Not-breaking, because of Reverence, We
say; Hem, scilicet, Quanti est sapere! As if Christ and his Apostles could not
foresee that your Necessity, (namely) that by the Distributing of the Bread,
and by Breaking it, some little crummes must cleave sometimes unto the beards
of the Communicants, or else fall to the ground. Or as though this Alteration
were to be called Reverence, and not rather Arrogance, in making your-selves
more wise than Christ, who instituted; or than all the Apostles, or Fathers of
primitive times, who continued the same Breaking of Bread.

Therefore this your Contempt of Breaking, what is it but a peremptory breach
of Christ his Institution, never regarding what the Scripture says; 1 Samuel 15.
22.
Obedience is better then Sacrifice. For, indeed, true Reverence is the mother
of Obedience; else is it not Devotion, but a mere derision of that Command of
Do this.]

The third Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass; contradicting
the sense of the next words of Christ's Command, viz. [ -- GAVE IT UNTO THEM.]
SECT. V.
IT follows in the Canon of Christ his Mass, [ And he gave ] even to THEM,
to whom he said, [ Take ye, eat ye.] By which plurality of persons is
excluded all private Massing; forasmuch as our High Priest Christ Jesus (who in
instituting and administering of this Sacrament would not be alone) said hereof,
as of the other Circumstances, [ Do this.]

The Contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass. This holy Synod ( says your
Miss^s illas, in quibus solus Sacerdos sacramentaliter communicate -- probat
atque adeo commendat. Council. Trid. Sess. 22. cap 6.
Council of Trent) does approve and commend the Masses, wherein the Priest
does Sacramentally So your Church.

CHALLENGE.

your Priest? which we may justly condemn by the liberal Sunt qui in Miss^

the Legitimate Mass; do wonder how your Priests sole-Communicating ever crept
into the Church; and also deplore the contempt, which your private Mass has
brought upon your Church. Hitherto (see the Marginals) from your own
Confessions.

Let us add the Absurdity of the Commendation of your Council of Trent, in
saying, We commend the Priest's communicating alone. A man may indeed
(possibly) talk alone, fret alone, play the Traitor alone: but this
Communicating alone, without any other, is no better Grammar, than to say, that
a man can confer alone, conspire alone, contend, or covenant alone. Calvin
says indeed of spiritual Eating, which may be without the Sacrament (as you

thereof.

A SECOND CHALLENGE.
Against the former Prevarication, condemning this Roman Custom by the Roman
Mass it self.
We make bold yet again to condemn your Custom of Private Mass, and
consequently the Commendation given thereof by the Council of Trent. For by the
Canon of your Mass, wherein there are interlocutorie speeches between Priest
and People, at the celebration of this Sacrament, the Priest saying [ Dominus
vobiscum: The Lord be with you;] and the People answering the Priest, and
saying [ And with thy Spirit] your Claudius Espencaeus, sometimes a Parisian
Doctor (one commended by Claudij Espencae^ Theologi Parisiensis Tractatus de
utraque M^ssa: q^arum alteram publicam, alteram privatam appellant. (...)
Gilberti. Theologi Parisiensis. Genebrard.
Genebrard for his Treatise upon this same Subject of the Private Mass) albeit
he agrees, with the execrable Execration and Anathema of the Council of Trent,
against Solitary Masses to be unlawful; yet after the expense of much paper,
to prove that some private Mass must needs have anciently been, because
Primitively Mass was celebrated almost in all Churches every day; and that
Saint See below at the letter ( p)
Chrysostom did complain of the absence of the people: yet coming to
determine of the point, Haec and similia pro privatatu^ Mislarum usu and
vetustate probabil^^ quidem sunt, sed minus ^perta, nec n. qui oblatum dicunt,
communicatum negant, etc. Espen. Tract. de utraque Missa fol. 226. [ where also
had been objected the complaint of Chrysoslome, so. fol 222.]
This Reason (says he) is only probable, but not evident; for although they
affirm a daily celebration of the Mass, yet do they not deny a daily
Communion.

Afterward he seeks the Original and beginning of private Masses out of
private Monachos, plus alioqui jam satis gravatos invid a primos privatarum
Missarum Authors fuisse, quida^^ faciunt. Espenc. ibid. fol. 227. Non est quod

were then perplexed, to wit, how it could be said by a Priest, being alone, [

Answers, which I refer to your Choice; whether you will believe, with
Gratian, that the words [ Dominus vobiscum: The Lord be with you] spoken by the
Priest, being alone, may be thought to have been spoken to Angels: or, with
^ameracensis, unto Stones: or, with the Heremites in their Celles, unto Forms
and Stools: or else, with the Deane of the Cardinals, teaching any Heremite
being alone, to say, [ The Lord be with you] as spoken to himself. All which
imaginary fooleries are so unworthy the Conceptions of but reasonable men,
that we may fear to be held inconsiderate, If we should endeavor to confute
them. Only we can say Apostle did condemn them, who speak with strange
languages in the public assembly (although they that spoke understood
themselves) because that in such a Case 1. Cor. 14. 23.
If (says he) there be none to interpret, and there come in an Ignorant or
Infidel observing this, will he not say, you are mad? how much more extreme
Madness must we judge this to be, where men either talk to themselves, or
else (as if they were metamorphosed into the things, whereunto they speak)
unto forms, stones, stools, and the like?

For Conclusion, hear the said Deane of the Roman Cardinals (from whom a
Sacerdos dicit [Pax omnibus vobis:] quoniam autem pro se-invicem precari est

the Correspondencie of Priest and People, was to unite the hearts of both
Priest and People together. We say, with him, to unite them, not (as you do)
to separate People from Priest by your solitary Masses; and yet to confound
their speech by your [ Dominus vobiscum.] And if this may not prevail with
you, yet methinks the authority of Pope Gregory, surnamed the Great, might
command your belief. He, upon the form of the Roman service, by an
interchangeable speech between Priest and People, concludes that Greg. Papa.

tecum, The Lord be with thee? O, this forsooth, was spoken to the Clerk in
civility, according to the ordinary Custom of entitling singular persons in
the plural number: and this Answer he called Salving of a Doubt.

But any may reply, that if it were good manners in the Priest, to call upon
the Clerk with [ Vobiscum] in the plural number, for civilitie sake, it must
then be rusticitie in you^ Church, to teach your Clerk to answer your Priest
[Et cum Spiritu tuo: And with thy Spirit.] And again, the answer is
impertinent, for where the Priest is found thus parling with the Clerk, he
cannot be said to be Alone. And so the answer of this man must be indeed not
Salving, but (as the rest of his manner of answering) a Quack-salving rather,
and a mere Delusion. The Lord be with you] does furthermore declare, which was

A THIRD CHALLENGE.
Against the same Custom.
A Custom Commendable, say your Fathers of Trent; Condemnable, say we, even
from your own Consciences, because you were never hitherto able to produce
either any Commendable, yea or Tolerable example, expressly recorded Eucharist,
without a Communion; no, not in that only objected place of Chrysostom. in
Ephesians. Hom 3. Frustr^ habetur quotidiana oblatio, frustra stamus ad altar, cum
nemo est qui participet. Ob. a Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap 9. [Not that in
these daily Celebrations None at all did communicate with the Priest: for he
was accompanied, at least, with some Ecclesia-stickes, as is employed in the
words, ( Stamus ad Altar) And it is no rare Hyperbale in Chrysostom to use
the word, (...), for, a Paucitie.]
Chrysostom, whose Speech is not a Grant, that absolutely All were absent from
his administration of the Eucharist: but certainly it is a vehement Invective
against all wilful Absents. So far was he from allowing, much more from
Commending Communicating alone, who elsewhere, against such as neglected to
Communicate with the poor, taking his Argument from the example of Christ,

more obligatorily) Hieron. Coena Domini dicitur, quia Dominus in coena tradidit
Sacramenta. Dominica coena debet omnibus esse communis. In 1 Cor. cap. 11.
The Lords Supper ought to be common to All. Such Reverencers were the
Primitive Fathers of the Ordinances of Christ. And as touching [For again, if
it should be strictly racked, so should he himself not have participated, and

Invective against the carnal security of men, even in the word, Nemo: Nemo

Now, none is so senseless as to think hereby that Chrysostom thought
himself absolutely to be wholly alone.]
[ Nemo, No man] in the testimony of Chrysostom, it is known to be taken
restrainedly, for Few: and so [Frustra stamus, etc.] Ex quibus verbis apparet,

THE SECOND CHALLENGE.
In respect of the necessity of a Loud voice, especially by the Romish Priest,
in uttering the words of Consecration.
THe greatest silence, which is used by the Roman worshippers, is still in the
Priests uttering, or rather muttering the words of Institution [HOC EST CORPUS
MEVM: and, Hic est sanguis meus:] albeit here is the greatest and most
necessary words of Consecration, the just pronuntiation whereof you hold to be
most necessary: because if the Priest, in uttering of them, fail but in one
syllable, so far as to alter the sense of Christ's words (which as you say may
happen by six manner of Defects) then the whole Consecration is void; and the
thing which you adore, is in substance merely See Book 7 c. 5.. 2.
Bread still. If therefore the People shall stand perplexed in themselves,
whether the words, which are concealed, be duly uttered by the Priest to
himself, how shall it not concern them to hear the same expressly pronounced,
lest that (according to your own Doctrine) they be deluded in a point of
faith, and with divine worship adore Bread instead of the person of the Son
of God? Whereof we are to entreat at large in due Ibidem.

granting that The Apostles in their times required a known Language, Greek
in the Greek Churches, and Latin in the Latin Churches: because first that
this made for the Edidification and consolation of Christians. Secondly,
Mangaineth more both in mind and affection, who knows what he prays. As for
him that is Ignorant, you say, He is not edified, inasmuch as he knows not in
particular, although in general he does understand. Thirdly, that the Apostle
commands that all things be done to edification. Fourthly, that the known
Service is sitter for Devotion: and thereupon some of you have furthermore
Concluded, that It were better that the Service were used in a Language known
both to the Clergy and People. And again, that People profit no whit by
praying in a strange language. So your own Writers, as you may observe in the
Marginals.

Now what more extreme and intolerable Injury could you do to the souls of
Gods people, than by imposing a strange language Edification, Consolation, and
Devotion, the three chief Benefits that man's soul is capable off, in the
service of God? Thus in respect of your Injury against Man.

A THIRD CHALLENGE.
Touching the Injury done, by the same Decree, against
YEt all this notwithstanding, you are bent to cozen Christian people with
palpable Sophistry, by your Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16. De Canticis
Spiritualibus tempore Primitivae Ecclesiae Tert. Porro consuevisse. -- Quoniam
igitur ista Cantica fiunt ad Populi consolationem, vult Apostolus, ut siant
lingua quae intelligatur: ut Idiota, etc. Ibid.. Quoniam -- Praeterea tunc,
quia Christiani erant pauci, omnes simul psallebant in Ecclesia, and
respondebant ^^nis officijs: at postea, crescente populo, divisa sunt magis
officia, and solis Clericis relictum est, ut communes preces and lauds in
Ecclesia peragant. Ibid. Respondeo negando. -- Demque finis praecipuus illorum
Canticorum erat instructio and consolatio populi, -- and nisi lingua nota facta
fuissent -- perijsset praecipuus fructus ipsorum. At Divinorum officiorum nec

Denique finis.
Cardinal, who confesses that the Psalms in the days of the Primitive
Church, were sung jointly of the people, Because they were ordained for
instruction and consolation of the people, as the chief end. But as for the
Divine Service, The Principal end of it (says he) is not the instruction and
consolation of the people, but the worship of God. So he. Whom when we ask,
why the people then did all Singing of Psalms, and Answering the Minister in
Divine Service, and Prayer? He says it was because of the Paucitie, of the
people, and rareness of the Assembly. Whereby it seems he meant to
maintain Your Degenerate Romish Worship with Paradoxes. First, As if Psalms,
publicly sung in the Church to Gods glory, were not Divine duties and Service.
Secondly, As if the Primitive Church, using both Psalms and other Prayers in a
known tongue (as he confesses) did not hold a necessity of the common
knowledge of both, for Instruction and Consolation. Thirdly, As if the
Assemblies of Christians were of such a Paucitie, in the days of Tertullian;
when those Psalms ordained for Instruction and Consolation were in use. And
fourthly, as if People now adays had not as much need of Instruction and
Consolation, as they that lived in Primitive times; yea, and more, especially
such People, who being led blindfold by an Implicit Faith, have reason to
crave Instruction; and having their Consciences tortured and perplexed with
multiplicities of Ceremonial Laws, have as just cause also to desire
Consolation.

As for your objecting the Worship of God by unknown prayers, that may be
sufficient, which your own Catechism ( authorized by the Council of Trent)
teaches you; where answering to that question, why God, although he know our
wants before we it Cur Deus, cum sciat quibus indigemus, vult oratione nostra
sollicitari? Vult n^s ^^e pe tendo petere fidentius. -- ut magis ad amorem
incendantur -- ac at saepius majori affecti laetitia ad cum amandum atque
colendum incitemu^ ardentius. Catech. T^id. vel Romans part. 4. c. 2. pug. 386.
says, that he does this to the end, that Praying more confidently, we may be
more inflamed with love toward God: and so being possessed with more joy, may
be exercised to a fervent worship of God. So your public and general Roman
Catechism.

The case then is plain. From more Edification there arises more Consolation;
from more Consolation there issues more Devotion; from all these proceeds more
siliall Love and dutiful Worship of God. Which was long since shadowed (as

Paradoxe, Which (contrary to all anciently professed Divinity, and express
Scripture, saying, 1 Cor. 14. 15.

thrust man's Understanding out of Gods worship, to the utter abolishing of
(...), that is, his Reasonable worshipping of God; by making man (as Saint
August. Expos. 2. in Psalm. 18. Merulae, Psittaci, Corvi, Picae, and hujusmodi

which learn to prate they know not what.

THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE,
Against the said Romish Decree, as jointly injurious both
IN the fourth place We are to speak of the Iniquity of your unknown
language in Prayer, jointly against both God and Man; because that without the
understanding of the Prayer it is impossible for a man (being of discretion) to
pray unto, or to praise God as he ought: and consequently to obtain any
blessing by prayer from God, according to that Apostolical Doctrine, ^ Cor.
14. where he says of the man ignorant of the language of prayer, [(...);] How
shall he say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knows not what thou
say? To which Argument of the Apostles, taken from the Impossibility, your

Eckius and some Others answer, that the Apostle speaks of Preaching, and not
of Praying. What, not of Praying, Eckius? May it not be said of this your great
Doctor, and Antagonist to Luther, that this man could not see the River for
water? for (as your Imo sequitur [(...)] quibus verbis Apostolus significat

that not the whole vulgar, but some one was especially appointed to supply the
place of the Unlearned to say, Amen? Which reason he may seem to have

Senensis, who says that The Apostle by him [That occupies the place of the

And if there had been any such, yet the Greek phrase [(...)] would not admit
of any such interpretation. So he. * And how might not that Clerk be an
Ignaro, seeing you do confess, that Sixtus Senens. Biblioth lib. 6. Annot:
263. Verum etiam saepenumero nec ipsi Presbyteri nec Diaconi intelligunt quid
orant.
Oftentimes the Priest and Deacon understand and not what is prayed.*

Lastly, it can be no less than an extreme Infatuation to oppose (as
Satisfacit Sacerdos, cum preces etiam non intellectas absolvit: etiam meretur,
modo in Dei lauds preces non intellectas peroret. Sic in Monasterijs
professae, and Monachi non pauci orant, quae intellectu non modo non

the Rhemists in Matthew. 21. verse. 16. and in 1. Cor. 19. page 463.
do your Jesuit Salmeron, Eckius, and the Rhemists) the example of Children,
because the Children crying Hosanna, and not understanding their prayers, were
notwithstanding (say they) accepted Ergo the Priest, Monks, and Nuns, in
praising God, may be grateful to God although they understand not that which
they pray. So they. An Objection taken (as you see) from Children, or rather,
as it might seem, made by Children, it is altogether so Childish. For the
Apostle, as it were, foreseeing that this might possibly be fancied by some
fond and obstinate Opposers to the Spirit of Truth, does in the very same
Chapter 1 Cor. 14. 20. purposely prevent it, saying, Brethren, be not children
in understanding. For although, when a Child asks his Fathers blessing only
with clapping his hands together, or uttering half syllables, it joyeth the
Father, because his Child now expresses his duty, according to the Capacity
of a Child: yet if the same Child, after he is come to the perfect years of
discretion, should perform that duty in no better manner than by Childith
babbling, would the Father hold this to be Reverence, and not rather plain
Mockery? So is the Case betwixt us and God, who 2. Cor. 3. 1^.
accepts every one according to that which he has, and not according to
that which he has not: a Cor. 13. 11. When I was a child, I spoke as a
child, but being a man, I put away childishness. Away therefore with this
your more than Childish Objection.

We return to the Impossibility of praying duly in an unknown tongue,
which the Apostle illustrateth by two Similitudes, the one taken from an
Instrument of peace, Verse. 7. He that knows not the distinct sound of the
Pipe [(...)] How shall he know what is piped? that is, it is impossible for him
to apply himself to the dance. The other from an Instrument of war, If the
Trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to battle? As if
he would have said, It is impossible to know when to march forward, or when to
retraite. So it is said of unknown Prayer [(...);] How shall he that is
ignorant of the language say Amen? that is to say, (by the interpretation of
your Populus ignotae linguae quomodo respondebit, Amen? hoc est, animae
praehebit assensum, cum more Babylonice co^susionis qui dissident, nequaquam
sensu aninusque conspirent. Acosta Ies. de Indorum salute, cap. 6. page 37.
Jesuit) How shall people, ignorant of the tongue, answer Amen? (that is) yield
consent unto the Prayer, seeing that they who dissent among themselves after a
Babylonish confusion, cannot consent in mind and affection. So he. Or, as your
Quomodo dicet, [Amen?] Cum quid boni dicas non intelligit, nisi benedicas
tantum. Aquinas in hunc locum, 1. Corinthians. 14. I add Sander. de visib.
Monarch. ad A^n. 1563. [Si benedixeris spiritu, Quomodo dicat Amen?]
Significatur de precibus Ecclesiasticis, fateor, quas in spiritu, hoc est, in
dono linguae peregrinae dicat tari nollet, ut in Latina Ecclesia Hebraeam, aut
in Graeca Persicam: quia decessent plerunque viri docti and petiti illius
linguae, qui populo interpretari possent. [ Thus from the Apostle he grants,
that Prayers are not to be used, where the people have not the intepretation:
although he say, that Deus honorificentius colitur per linguam doctam, quam
per indoctam and vulgarem. As though where there is no respect of persons with
God, yet there should be respect of the Tongues.]
Aquinas; Thus in one Transgression you commit a double Sacrilege, to wit, by
Robbing God of his due Honor, and Men of their spiritual graces and Comforts.

To conclude. These Premises do prove, that among many thousands of your
people, assembled at a Roman Mass, and being ignorant of their Service, not
any such an one (a miserable Case!) can justly be held to be a true Worshipper
of God, who requires of his Worshippers the* Calves of their lips, and the
lips of Calves.

THE FIFTH GHALLENGE,
Out of the Doctrine of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14. more copiously, in confutation
of your diverse Objections.
IT were an easy matter to be superfluous in the prosecuting of this
Argument, by proving the truth of this Doctrine out In his aforementioned
Writing to a Lady, etc.
Anonymus, having had notice of most of these points, has formed such
Objections and Answers, as his prejudicated and pourblinde Conceit could reach
unto. First, and most common, in answer to the places objected out of 1. Cor.
14. affirming (out of the Rhemists Annotations) That the Apostle speaks not of
the public and set prayers of the Church; but of extraordinary and spiritual
exercises of Exhortations and sudden Prayers. So he. Wherein the man
contradicts your own Alij dicunt Apostolum loqui de divinis officijs, viz.
Haymo, Primasius, P. Lombardus, D. Thomas, and alij quidam ex Latinis. Test
Bellar. Lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16.
Schoolmen, but especially the Apostle his direct saying. Verse 23. If the
whole Congregation meet together, etc. What more public Assembly of the
whole Congregation? And (to suppose that they were extraordinary Prayers) what
is more Consectarie and Consequent, than that if the Apostle note if for an
Abuse, to practice such Extraordinary Exercises of Preaching and Praying in a
tongue unknown, even because the Hearers are not thereby Edified? Doubtless
the same Abuse, practiced in public and ordinary Service, being more
notorious and Common, must needs be so much the more condemnable: as witness
both See the sixth Challenge following.
Ancient Fathers, and your own See the former Challenges.
Brethren, who have taught the use of a known Tongue, in all public and
ordinary Prayers extraordinary. Which is a full Confutation of your former
Objection.

Yea, but It is sufficient (says he) that the vulgar people know, in general,
although they understand not the Prayers in particular. Which again
Contradicts the Apostle, who in the sixteenth Verse will have the Private or
Vulgarman to be able to give consent to the public Prayer, in saying Amen.
And therefore requires the Minister, Verse 7. as the Harper, to yield in
particular a Distinction of tunes [(...):] and Verse 8. as a Trumpeter, [(...)]
to give a certain known sound; that which your own Doctors have also
confessed.

A third Instance is taken out of Bellarmine, who says that The Non
reprehenditur oration non intellect, sed ei anteponitur oration quae
intelligitur, ut peter Verse. 17 [Tu quidem been gratias agis, sed alter non
aedisicatur] Bellar. quo supra.
Apostle reprehendeth not an unknown Prayer, but prefers a known Prayer
before the other, saying Verse 7. Thou, indeed, prayest well, but another is
not edified. Flatly contradictorie to the whole scope of the Apostle,
throughout the Chapter, as your own Salmer^ in les. See above Challenge 2. at
the let. (z)
Jesuit is forced to proclaim. The Apostle ( says he) would have the people
to be edified, because then all things ought to have been done to the
Edification and Consolation of the Assembly: and therefore he would not, have
any Public Prayer used among the Hebrews, but in the Hebrew-language; nor
among the Grecians, but in Greek, nor yet among the Latins, but in the Latin
tongue. The meaning then is, [Thou indeed] namely, who art the Minister, and
know the prayer, so far do well; but in respect of others, which cannot
understand, Not well, because, They are not edified.

If I pray with my tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is without
fruit.] So he. As though that strange Tongue, here spoken off, were not
understood by him that prayed. Which contradicts the Apostle, Verse 4. He
that speaks with the tongue does edify himself: for never did any deny^t at
he, who had the miraculous gift of Speech in a strange tongue, did understand
himself, although sometimes he wanted the gift of Interpreting He that
speaks with the tongue, let him pray, that he may interpret it.] Fifthly, by
the word [ Spirit] Id est, si orem dono linguae: nimitum, quam non intelligam,
[Spiritus] id est Affectus meus orat, sed men's est fine fructu. Ergo dicit
Apostolus, non Orationem, sed mentem esse sine fructu. Bellar quo sup And this
answer Master Brerely borrowed from Bellar. Tract. upon the Mass. p. 452.
your Cardinal would have understood the Affection, as if Affection without
understanding did profit him that prays: which is fully contrary to the
Apostles doctrine, as witnesses your Vox [Spiritus] a principio^ usque ad
finem Donum Spiritus peculiare significat, quo impelleba^tur lingus loqui. Si
Apostolus in hac voce admitteret Homonymiam aliquam, Graeci Patres nos de eo
admonuissent. Salmeron. Ies. in eund. locum.
Salmeron in plain terms; showing that the word, Spirit, thorow-out this
whole Chapter, signfieth not the Affection, but the miraculous Spiritual gift
of speaking in Strange tongues, as also the Upon the same place both Ambrose,
[Spiritu id est, lingua ignota.] * And Chrysstome also upon Saint Paul's words
[My Spirit prays, but my mind is without fruit] (...). -- (...) calls his
Not knowing the Prayer, (...). Hier. in 1. Cor. 14. Omnis sermo, qui non
intelligitur, Barbarus est. [Spiritus meus orat, sed alter non aedificatur] Id

igitur legendum, ut intelligant alij [Quomodo dicet Amen?] i. e. quomodo

incognita; (...). And of their translation of Scriptures into their national
tongues, Chrysostom. Hom. 1. in Ioh. Syri, Indi, AEgyptij, Persae, AEthiopes, and

Fathers expound it.

Anonymus contendeth by Reason, but such as others reached unto him. Fathers
say (says he) the words of Consecration should be kept secret. True, to them
that were not capable of this Sacrament, but See this proved Book 7. Chap. 3.*
never to the licensed Communicants; because that Christ, and his Apostles, yea
and the Universal Church primitive consecrated in an audible voice, and known
language, as has been confessed. Yet furthermore. The Church (says he) used
the said Hebrew word, unknown to the people. What then? know you not that in
all Churches, of whatsoever language, is used also the Hebrew word, Amen? and
if people do not learn one or two words of a strange tongue, it is not for
that they are witless, but because they are wilful and careless.

Their last Reason. Some languages (as for example that in Italy) were Roman,
and corrupted by invasion of Enemies of diverse languages, and in the end became
Italian, etc. yet the public Service was not altered, but continued Roman as
before. This Argument is a facto ad jus, all one with that Reasoning a Baculo
ad angulum. Like as if some should conclude, that because Stews are allowed at
Rome, they are therefore justly licensed. But we demand, are men made for
languages, or rather languages for men? if the latter, then is that language to
be used, which is known to serve best for the Edification and Consolation of
Gods people in his worship.

A SIXTH CHALLENGE.
Out of the Doctrine of Antiquity.
ALthough it were preposterous to exact of us a proof, from Antiquity, of
condemning the Service in a strange tongue, seeing (as has been confessed)
the Primitive practioe is wholly for us; and therefore no Abuse in those times
could occasion any such Reproof: yet shall we, for your better illumination,
offer unto you some more express Suffrages of the Augustine says of the
People, that their Safety consists not in the vigor of their understanding,
but in their simplicity of believing. So indeed does Aug. de Bap. l. 6. c. 24.
Multi irruunt in preces, etiam ab Haereticis compositas, and per ignorantiae
simplicitatem non valentes decernere, utuntur eis, and plerunque precis vitium
superat precantis affectus. -- Non quia ista corrigenda non sint, ut populus ad
id, quod plaue intelligat, dicat Amen. Idem de Catechizand. rudibus c. 9. Test
Cassandro in Liturg. page 102.
Augustine forewarne the people, who although they knew the single words of the
prayers of Heretics, yet might possibly be deluded with the obscurity of
their Heretical Senses. The Difference is extreme. For Saint Angustines people
understood the language of those prayers, in the obscure and involved Sense
whereof they were unwillingly ignorant. Augustine wishes that their
Simplicity were corrected; you hold your peoples blindness worthy to be
commended.

Secondly, Origin says, that when Christians are exercised in reading of holy
Scripture, albeit some words be not understood, yet is that reading profitable.
This Sentence also is alleged for countenancing of Origin. Hom. 20. in Ios Quae
nos profermus ^aepe non intelligimus, sed virtutes intelligunt. Ergo licet
preces non intellectis usurpare. O^ Bellar. l. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16.
Prayer in an unknown tongue; notwithstanding, that in a man's Reading of
Scripture, God is said to speak unto man: but in Praying, man is said to
speak unto God. So that it may be both lawful and profitable to the Reader,
to find some particular Scriptures, which God would have to excel the
Capacity of the most learned, to humble them, to the admiration of his
excellent wisdom, as the Fathers teach. Whereas contrarily an unknown
Prayer, wittingly used, is both unprofitable

More objections out of the Fathers you have not. We will try whether we can
recompense your Nominalities (that we may so call your impertinent Objections)
with Realties and solid Proofs. Cast but your eyes upon the Marginals,
consisting partly of the Relation of your own Johannes Billet in summa de
divinis officijs, In primitiva Ecclesia (inquit) prohibitum erat, ne quis
loqueretur linguis, nisi intelligerentur. -- At nostris temporibus, ubi nullus

Chrysostom noting a Man, Ignorant of the Prayer, to be no better than a
Barbarian to himself, not in respect of the nature of the voice, but of his
own Ignorance; and declaring Prayers, in an unknowen tongue, to be contrary to

Angustines) does deny that any can sing Psalms as he ought to God, who
knows not what he sings.

When you have digested all these Premises, concerning the Equity and
Necessity of known Prayers in the public and Divine Service, both in
consideration of Gods worship, and Man's manifold profit, so amply confirmed by
so many and uncontrolable testimonies; then guess (if you can) of what dye the
face of your Doctor Stapleton was, when he shamed not to call this our

Profaneness? and to number it among Heretical pravities. As for your own
People, who prefer an unknown worship, what can we say less, than that
dumb worshippers: and because of their ignorance, in praying they know not
what, they are to be sent to accompany Popinjayes and Iack-dawes, accordingly
as S. See above Sect. 7. in the Challenge 3.
Augustine formerly has resembled them.

*A SEVENTH CHALLENGE, For Vindication, against Francis de Sancta Clara, a
late Reconciler of our English Articles with the
A Romish professor at Doway published a Treatise this very year of our Lord
1634. Which he calls a Paraphrasticall Exposition of the Articles of the
Church of England; whose aim is not to draw the Romish professors to the
English, but the English to the Romish; and by his seeming Reconciliation to
put upon our Church (as we use to say) the Gull: albeit his whole Paraphrase
be, indeed, nothing but a Farrago of his selfe-fictions, and Opinations,
Paraphrasis or Exposition, upon this Article, will give you a shrewd guess, if
you shall have the patience to examine such stuff.

Our English Article Franciscus de S. Clara Professor Disac. Exposit. Artic.
Confess. Angl. Art. 24 Lingua populo non intellecta preces peragere, and
Sacramenta administrare, verbo Dei, and primitivae Ecclesiae consuetudini plane

says, that To pray or administer the Sacrament in an unknown tongue is
plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the Custom of the Primitive Church.
The Article of the Church of Rome Contrarily: Council. Trid. Sess. 22. Can. 9.
Si quis dixerit, tantum lingua vulgari Missam celebrari debere, Anathema sit.
He that shall say that the Mass ought to be Celebrated only in the vulgar
tongue, let him be Anathema, that is, Accursed. The English Article has two
points. 1. That Prayer in a tongue That it is also plainly Repugnant to the
Custom of Primitive Antiquity.

First of the Repugnance to the word of God.
The Romish Expositor, Paraphrasing upon these words [ Repugnant to the word of
God,] supposes in the first place that thereby is meant the Doctrine of the
Apostle, 1. Cor. 14. concerning Prayer in a Tongue not understood of him that
prays: and then for answer thereunto, repeateth only their old Crambe, to
wit, that by Prayers, there spoken off, are not meant the public prayers in
the set and solemn service of the Church of Corinth; but other their Paraph,
Crediderim Sanctum Paulum vel de privatis conventibus, vel de privatis
colloquiis, post omnia officia habitis, ibi agree.
Private Convents and Colloquies. And whereas, the Apostle requires of the
Idiote, that is, Private or Layman (as we call him) that he understand his
Prayer so, as to be able to give consent thereunto in public, saying, Amen; he
Paraph. Idiota apud Apostolum i. e. Ille cui incumbit respondere.
expounds this as understood of Him, who by office answers Amen for whom
we name the Parish-Clerke. Both which have been See the Challenges above
thorowout.
Confuted by your own Schoolmen; and the Latter more especially by Bellarmine
himself, in our former Sections, as you have seen.

A second devise of qualifying these words of our Article, [ Repugnant to the
word of God] is his own, but thus: Paraph. Decrevit igitur Articulus esse
Repugnans Scripturis, id est, non Doctrinae Scripturae, sed Scriptioni, seu
Traditioni Scripturae, quae fuit Corinthijs in Lingua communi.
The Article decrees it to be repugnant to the Scriptures, that is, (says
he) not to the Doctrine of Scripture, but to the Scription, or tradition of
Scripture, which among these Corinthians was in praying in a common tongue.
Here you have a dainty Scripture, and Scription; the word Scripture to signify
the Doctrine of Scripture, and the word Scription, to betoken Tradition of
Scripture. So he, by an elegant Figure, which we forbear to name, but wish
there were some sense in it. For was it ever heard off, that there was a
Scripture without Scription? that is to say, a Writ without writing; or when as
all Divines ever distinguished of Traditions into (...) and (...) Written,
which are the Scriptures themselves, and Unwritten, which are without the same
written word of God; Was it possible for Tradition in Scripture, which was not
Scripture or word of God? If so, then whereas all Creatures are distinguished
into Sensible and Insensible, it shall be possible to point out a Sensible
Creature void of Sense.

His third Crotchet. Idem. Dum. dicit esse Repugnans verbo Dei, intelligi
deberent Institutioni D. Pauli, non Christi, cujus scripta sub nomine verbi Dei
comprehenduntur: omnia tamen ab Apostolis demandata non sunt mandata Christi,
ut ab omnibus concessum est.
When the Article says [Repugnant to the word of God] It is to be understood
as meaning, Repugnant to the Institution and Ordinance of Saint Paul, not of
Christ, Saint Paul's writings being comprehended under the name of Gods word:
although all that are commanded by the Apostles are not therefore the commands
of Christ, as all do confess. Apostolical Constitutions, namely such as are
fitted to the Churches, according to the Conveniences of the times,
distinguished from Divine Constitutions, which are enjoined the Church, as
necessary for all times, it is true. But that (both which this Paraphrase
affirms) either St. Paul, in requiring a Knowno Prayer, delivered not therein
the Doctrine of Christ, necessary for all times, or that our English Composers
of this their Article (in affirming the Institution of Unknown Prayers to be
Repugnant to the word of God) did not thereby understand the word and
Commandment of Christ, in his Authentical Scripture, are two as strange
exorbitancies as your Glosser could make.

For the Apostle, to show that he taught a Doctrine which concerned all the
Churches of Christ, and at all times, uses Similitudes to Illustrate his
meaning, universally fitting all If a Trumpet, (says he) or a Pipe give an
uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself either to the Battle, or to the
dance? applying those Similitudes as well to praying, as to preaching in an
Unknown tongue. But every one of you will grant that the same Scripture, for
necessity of preaching in a known tongue, is the Divine Institution of
Christ, and not only an Apostolic Constitution. Therefore (except you will
separate that which Christ, by his Apostle, has joined together) you must
confess How shall he that understands not, say Amen?] being as true of all
Prayers, in all subsequent ages of the World, as it could be to the Church of
Corinth, it prooveth the truth of the Divine Ordinance of Christ therein. Thus
far of the meaning of S. Paul, now to return to our Article.

Whereas you, and all that ever read Protestant Books know, that whenever
they affirm any thing to be Repugnant to the word of God, they mean to the
Scripture, as it An unknown Prayer to be Repugnant to the Word of God] must
signify, not Repugnant to Scripture, or to the Institution of Christ, but to
Scription and Apostolical Tradition; must needs argue, in your Professor, some
eclipse of judgment, by the which also he venteth out his Inference
following.

A fourth strain he has in his Inference from our English Article, as
follows. Idem. Vi hujus verbi probabiliter inferri potest, debere Ecclesiae
officia apud nos hodie celebrari in lingua Latina, quia per se loquendo est
lingua communis, and communites intellecta: solum autem asseritur in Articulo,
Preces publicae fiant lingua a populo intellecta, quod sine dubio debet
intelligi de lingua per se communi, non per Accidens loquendo.
The Article affirms (says he) that Prayers ought to be used in a tongue
known to the people, therefore we properly infer, that Prayers in our
Church may be in Latin, because it is a language commonly known. So he,
speaking of your Romish Latin prayers, not known of your own people. As if
one should argue, saying, Because the kingdom of England holds it necessary
that the pleading of her laws be used in English, in a tongue known and
understood of her Subjects: therefore may it be thence Concluded that the Pleas
of other kingdoms may be exercised in Latin, a common language, although not
understood of the people of any Nation. Who sees not in his Inference an
extreme want of Logic?

A more full Confutation of the Glossers Qualification of the words of our
English Article, viz. [Prayer unknown is Repugnant to the words of God;] by
his interpreting it, as not meant strictly of the doctrine of Christ, but of
the Tradition It is most notoriously known to you all, that The same Article,
against Unknown Prayers, is common to all the Churches of Protestants, in a
full Accordance, to condemn the contrary Profession and practice of the Roman
Church, which justifies her Custom of praying in a Language unknown to the
people, as not Repugnant to the Law of God. And (reciprocally) you are not
ignorant that your Council of Trent, in her Anathema and Curse, cast upon all
that should That the Mass ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue,
intended thereby to accuse all Protestants for condemning the Custom of the
Church of Rome, as a transgression of the word and Commandment of God in holy
Scripture. Now this your Paraphrazer, by his Moderation and qualification
endeavoring to reconcile these Two Contradictorie Intentions, namely, of your
Romish in condemning our English Article, and of our English Article, in
condemning your Romish Canon: What it is but to affirm, that one Church has
opposed against the other for Causes they know not

Of the second part of the English Article. The Article, [Prayer in an unknown
tongue is likewise Repugnant to the Custom of the Primitive Church.] The
Glosser opposes against this. HIS FIRST INSTANCE. Paraph. Graeci apud omnes
Iurisdictioni Patriarchae Constantinopolitani subditos, licet Graeci non sint,
officia Idiomate Graeco celebrant.
SOme, whose vulgar language is not Greek, yet being under the Greek
Patriarch of Constantinople, pray in the Greek Idiome. So he, for proof of
the lawfulness of the peoples praying in a language unknown. But the Instance
is lame of the right leg; it shows indeed, and we confess, that many,
whose native language is not Greek, pray notwithstanding in the Greek Idiome;
but that they understand and not these Greek prayers (which is the only point
in question) it prooveth no more than Tenterton-steeple proves Goodwin-sands.
For we have See above Sect. 7 thorow-out.
manifested the contrary in a full Section, (namely) that all such People, who,
being not Greeks, and prayed in the Greek Idiome, did notwithstanding
understand that Greek language wherein they prayed. Was your Paraphrazer in
good tune, think you, when he would not see this his mark, that he might
speak to the purpose and matter in question?

Cyprian, and S. Augustine: Paraph. In Africa, ut testatur Cyprianus in orat.
Domin. Et Augustinus de bono perseverant. cap. 13. Missas, and reliqua
faciebant Latin, licet lingua vulgaris erat Punica, and Latina ab inferiori
plebe non intellecta.
They both witness (says he) that their people in Afric said their Mass
and other services in Latin, albeit their own language was the Punicke, and
that the meaner people were ignorant of the Latin tongue. So he, joining his
witness together; but we will take them apart, to avoid Confusion, for the
better confuting of your Paraphraser, if he will yet think himself confuted.
Cyprian is alleged Afric saying of Mass, or of their vulgar Punicke
Language, or of their Ignorance of the Latin tongue. If this be not foul
dealing, to produce a dumb witness, and to father Sayings upon him, which he
never uttered, then will you think it far more ougly, if the witness, being
heard to speak himself, shall avouch the Contrary. Hearken then unto Cyprian,
in the same Exposition of the Lords Prayer, instructing his Punicks and
Africans as follows. Cypr. Sect. 22. Expos. in Orat. Dom. Quando stamus ad
orationem, Fratres dilectissimi, vigilare and incumbere ad preces, toto cord
debemus, ne quicquam tunc animus, quam id solum cogiter quod precatur.
Dearly beloved Brethren, when we pray, we ought to be watchful, and attend
our Prayers with our hearts, lest our minds in praying think of any other
thing, than on that which is prayed. So he. Ergo, say We, The Africans,
albeit their vulgar Idiome was Punicke, yet did they understand those Latin
Prayers, which you your selves must likewise confess, except any of your
Priests could accordingly instruct your rude people, ignorant of the Latin
tongue, wherein they pray, by saying unto them, Beloved Brethren, We, (that is,
you and I) ought to attend to our prayers, and not think of any thing If any
of you should so exhort your seely people, to attend to that they understand
not, might they not interpret that his Exhortation to be no better than mere
Mockery; and as plain an exprobration, as if he should entreat a bald man
to comb his head, or a blind man to thread a needle?

We add furthermore, that this Latin Exposition of the Lords Prayer was one
of the Sermons of Saint Cyprian, and so styled in the same place, Sermo sextus,
his sixth Sermon, preached promiscuously to all his people of Afric then
assembled. Which is a demonstrable Argument that this people of Afric
understood the Latin tongue; you your selves professing that Preaching ought
always to be used in a Language which the people do understand.

Saint Augustine is his second Witness, but for what? namely, that The
Africans, albeit their National Language was the Punick, yet did they pray in
the Latin tongue, whereof they were ignorant. So he. And We answer, that in
the place de Bono perseverantiae, cap. 13.) there is no more mention of Punick
tongue, or Latin Language, than there is of Welsh, or Irish. It may be that
Saint Augustine has something hereof in some other place, and so indeed he
has: for in a Sermon of his unto the Africans, he speaks hereof as plainly,
as if in direct terms he had given this your Paraphraser the word of
disgrace. Aug. de Verbis Apostoli. Sermon. 24. Proverbium notum est Punicum, quod
quidem Latin vobis dicam, quia Punice non omnes nostis; Nummum quaerit
pestilentia.
There is (says he, preaching unto his Africans) a known Proverb in the
Punick tongue, which I will render unto you in Latin, because all of you do
not understand Punick: The Proverb is this, So he, showing that the Africans
understood Latin better than Punick, although this were their National
Language. Far otherwise your Glosser, that the Latin was unknown to the
Africans, because their native language was Panick. Whereby he bewrays a
(Proverbially so called) Punick Faith. Flatly contradicting S. Augustine,
August. lib. 1. Confess. cap. 14. Latina didici inter etiam blandimenta
Nurricum.
who furthermore confesses of himself, saying, I learnt the Latin tongue
from the fawning and flattering Speeches of my Nourses.

Our Conclusion, by way of Censure of this man's Exposition of the Articles of
the Church of England, and of the Romish Authorizers of the same Treatise. This
one Point being the first of his Paraphrase, that fell in our way, concerning
any doctrine appertaining to the Romish Mass, we have been the more Copious
in Confutation thereof, that our Reader might take a just scantling of the
judgment of this Paraphrazer in the rest; and of those who were the Censurers,
Approvers, and Authorizers of the Thomas Blacklous, Censura Thomae Blacklouse
de Libellis de Articulis Confessionis Angl. -- Catholico animo conscriptis, ut
Errantes ad Christi caulam reditum inveniant.
who shows to what end this Tractate was writ, and approoved (as he says) To
bring those that wander out of the way unto the fold of Christ, Meaning, the
Church of Rome. So then we perceive it was not (as he seems to pretend) in
the behalf of Protestants, to free them from any of the former Censures and
Anathema's, or from the curses and cruelties of the Romish Church against them;
but only to ensnare them, if it may be, in the same Babylonish thraldom of
Superstition and Idolatry, from whence by the marvailous and gracious
providence of God they have been delivered.

Therefore, from these our Premises, We Conclude Blacklous and his fellow
Privilegers of this Book, to be guilty of all the above-manifested strange
dealings, in perverting of the senses of the Articles and Authors by him
alleged. Besides that, which surmounteth the rest, is the heinous Pope Pius,
after the Council of Trent, swearing To expound no Text of Scripture, without
the unanimous consent of ancient Fathers: yet now have allowed such an
Exposition of the text of the Apostle, concerning Prayer in an unknown tongue,
which they were never able to justify by any one Father of Primitive times,
for the space of 600, that we say not a thousand years after Christ, as has
been sufficiently proved.

Church of Rome it is, whose doctrine they would reduce Protestants unto? Is it
the old and primitive Religion of Rome? Why this is that which We so
constantly profess. But mean they the Religion of the new Church of Rome, in
her new Creed of new Articles, conformable to the Council of Trent? We must
say then of your Doctrine, as Christ said of Wine, No man drinking the Old,
desires the New, for he will say, the Old is better. Luc. 5. 39.


THus said Christ to his Disciples; by which words what is meant, your Jesuit
will express (to wit) that Quia Apostoli non acciperent nisi quod ipse dabat,
verbum Dandi Translationem de manibus Christi in manus Discipalorum significat.

Because [GAVE] does signify a Delivery out of Christ his hands into the hands

The contrary Canon in your (now) Roman Mass. Concerning this, It is to be
noted ( say Notandum est quod laudabiliter Ecclesia prospexit, ut ab isto modo

from taking the Sacrament with their own hands: but that it be put into their

Confessions of your own Jesuits will show: first, that the Practice of the
Apostles and Primitive Church, for above 500 years, was according to Christ's
Institution, to deliver the Bread into the hands of the Communicants. Secondly,
that the Rome (as appears by the Epistle of Pope Cornelius.) Thirdly, that
whereas Some had devised, for Reverence-sake, certain Silver vessels, by the
which they received the Sacrament; yet two Councels, the one at Toledo, and the
other at Trullo, did forbid that fashion, and required that they should receive
it with their hands. Hitherto from your selves.

Vain, therefore, is your pretense of Reverence, in suffering the Priest only
to receive it with his hands, as being more worthy in himself than all the
rest of the people: when as our High Priest Christ Jesus disdained not to
deliver it into the hands of his Disciples. Or else to deny this liberty unto
the people, as if their Hands were less sanctified than their mouths.

But you will say that it is in Reverence, lest that the Body of Christ may (as
you teach) light upon the ground, if any fragments of the Host should chance
to fall. There can be no doubt, but that, in the dispensation of this blessed
Sacrament, Christians ought to use due Cautelousnesse, that it may be done
without miscarriage; yet must you give us leave to retort your pretense of
Reverence upon your selves, thus: Seeing that Christ instituted, and his
Apostles observed, and that the whole Church of Christ (for so many hundred
years) thus practiced the administration of this Sacrament from hand to hand,
without respect of such Reverence, they therefore were not of your opinion, to
think every Crumme or piece of the Host, that falls to the ground, to be
really the Body of Christ.

This Aberration we may call, in respect of others, but a small Transgression,
if yet any Transgression may be called Small, which is a wilful violating of
this so direct a Charge of Christ, [ Do this.]

The seventh Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Mass.
AS in the third Transgression, we, by these words of Christ [ He gave it to
them,] spoken in the plural number, have proved, from your own Confessions, a
necessary Communion of the people in the public Celebration thereof with the
Priest, against your (now) Profession of private Masses; contrary *For we
insist not upon the fourth degree of Penance in the Greek Church, called

concerning All capable thereof: So now out of these words [TAKE YE, EAT YEE]
we observe that the persons present were Takers and Eaters of the blessed
Eucharist, and not only Spectators thereof. An Abuse condemned by our Church
of England in her 25. Article saying, Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to
be gazed upon.

The Contrary Canon of the (now) Roman Mass. Guests, to Eat of the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper; but as Gazers only to look on it, as upon a proper
Sacrifice: telling the People that they, seeing the Priest eat and drink,

exhorts every man to Preparation; Let a man examine himself: and exhorting
every one, being prepared, to Eat, says, So let him eat. This (to use your

wisdom of that ancient Church of Rome, which could not suffer a Sacrifice to
devour a public Sacrament, and to exclude a Communion. Whereunto the
Scriptures gave the name of (...), that is, a Gathering together, and (...),
that is, a Communion; as also of The Supper of the Lord: Yea, and Calixtus, a
Pope more ancient that Gregory, required that persons present should
Communicate: Calixtus P. ut habetur de Consecrat. Did. 2. C. Peracts. --

Because (says he) the Apostles had so ordained, and the holy Church
observes the same.

We do not dispute against all manner of Reservation of for we acknowledge

demonstrate by the Confessions of your own Jesuits and others (out of

The primitive and principal end, prescribed by Christ, is for Sacramental
eating: and And yet notwithstanding for you to bring in a Pompous ostentation
of not- Eating, and to call it a Laudable Custom, argues what little
Congruitie there is between your Practice, and Christ's Institution; which

less Laudable will this appear to be, when we consider the gross and

Thinking that it may be omitted with profit to the Church, both because it is
but an Innovation, and also for that it serves most-what for ostentation and
pomp, rather than pious Devotion. So they.

Lastly, lest you may object (as elsewhere) that a Negative Argument (as this,
because Christ did not institute this Custom, therefore it may not be allowed)
is of no effect; we add, that the Argument negative (if in any thing) then
must it prevail in condemning that Practice, which maintains any new End,
differing from that which was ordained by Christ. Which made Origin and Cyprian
argue Negatively in this Case: the one Christus non distulit, nec servari
jussit in crastinum. Orig. Hom. 5. in Levit. Panis iste recipitur, non
includitur. Cyprian. de Coena Dom. col. 382.
saying, Christ reserved it not till tomorrow: and the other, This bread is
received, and not reserved, or put into a Box. Which Conclusion we may hold,
in condemning of your public Adored, as well as (of latter times) your Pope
Pius Quartus (which your Congregation of Sic sanctiss. Sacramentum ad infirmos
deferendum est, ut illud sumant, non autem ut adorent tantum; sicubi fit in
aliquibus locis, quod Pius Quartus prohibuit Declaratio Romans Cardinal. in
Council. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 6. [ Set forth by Ioh. Gallemart, Academiae Duac.

Cardinals report) did forbid a new-upstart Custom of Carrying the Sacrament
to sick people, that they might adore it, when as they were not able to eat
it. All these Premises do infer, that your Custom of Circumgestation of the
Sacrament, in public Procession, only for Adoration, cannot justly be called
Laudable, Laudable Noveltie, and a Laudable profanation, and Transgression,
against the Institution of Christ; as now from your own Confessions has been
plainly evicted: and as will be further manifested, when we are to speak of
your In the seventh book.
Idolatrous Infatuation it self.

Pamelius; with whom we need not to contend, because Tertullian (speaking of
his wifes Proceeding, or going out of her house, for visiting the sick and
poor) is ridiculously mistaken, for going in a public Procession, even then,
when it was scarce free for Christians to meet together in Churches, for fear
of persecution. We proceed therefore to the next Transgression. *

rejected by the Council of Trent, Determining that the Eucharist So he. Of
this more in the Challenge.

CHALLENGE.
IS not now this your Churches Rejecting of her former Practice a Confession
that she has a long time erred in Transgressing of the Institution of Christ?
How then shall your Trent-Fathers free your fore-father Pope Innocent, and your
former Roman Church from this taxation? This they labor to do, but (alas
their misery!) by collusion and cunning: for the same Synod of Sancta Synodus
docet, Parvulos, usu rationis carentes, nulla obligari necessitate ad
Sacramentalem Eucharistiae communionem -- Neque ideo tamen damnanda est
Antiquitas, si cum morem aliquando in quibusdam locis servarunt, quia certe eos
nulla salutis necessitate fecisse, sine controversia credendum est. Conc.
Trident. Sess. 2. ca. 4.
Trent resolves the point thus; The holy (say they) teaches, that Children,
being void of the use of Reason, are not necessarily bound to the Sacramental
receiving of the Eucharist. This we call a Collusion; for by the same Reason,
wherewith they argue that Children are not nessarily bound to receive the
Eucharist, because they want reason, they should have concluded, that Therefore
the Church is and was necessarily bound not to administer the Eucharist to
Infants, even because they wanted Reason. Which the Council, doubtless, knew,
but was desirous thus to cover her own shame, touching her former
superstitious practice of Giving this Sacrament unto Infants. Council of Trent
adjoyneth, that the Church of Rome, in those days, was not condemnable; but
why? Because (says your See the Testimony below of the letter ( r.)
Council) Truly and without Controversy we ought to believe, that they did
not give the Eucharist unto Infants, as thinking it necessary to Salvation.
Which Answer your own Doctors will prove to be a bold, and a notorious
untruth, because (as your Jesuit Ecclesia tunc adducta fuit Eucharistiam
Infantibus dare, argumento sumpto ex verbis Christi, [Nisi manducaverius carnem
filij hominis, et biberitis sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis.] Maldon.
Ios. Disp. de Sacram. Tract. de Euch.. Nono, p. 200 Etiam credebant Infantes
tunc baptizatos, nisi Eucharistiam percipere^t, salvos esse non posse, Idem
Com. in Ioh. 6. 63. p. 717.
shows) They then believed that Infants baptized could not be saved, except
they should participate of the Eucharist; taking their Argument from that
Scripture of John. 6. [ Except you eat the flesh of the Son, etc.] and
therefore held they it necessary to the salvation of Infants.

That this was the belief of Pope Innocent, and of the Church of Rome under
him, your Parisian Doctor Innocent. 1. Romans Pont. Epist. 93. ad Conc. Milever.
con. Pelag. respondebat, quod parvulos aeternae vitae praemiis, etiam sine
baptismatis gratia posse donari, perfatuum est: nisi n. manducaverint carnem
filii hominis, non habebunt vitam in semetipsis: qui autem hanc eis sine
regeneratione defendunt, videntur etiam mihi Baptismum cassate velle, cum
praedicant nos habere, quod in eos creditur non nisi Baptismate conferendum. [
Whence Espencaeus thus:] Mirum, ejus temporis Pontifices ex Eucharistiae

and ex eodem tum loco, tum Innocentii argumento and authoritate, adversus
eosdem hosts urgeret August. Epist. 106. cont. Pelag. -- Contra Apostolicae

etc. Espenc. de Adorat. Euch. lib. 2. cap. 12. page 58. [ Afterward he

parvulos (ait) definivit, nisi manducaverint carnem filii hominis, vitam

looseness of Aquinas his Solutions. Albeit Saint Augustine was not constant in
this opinion, but (as may be gathered out of Bedes Collectanies in 1. Cor. 10.

yet by Baptism he is made partaker of that which it signifies.]
Espencaeus also proves at large, out of the express writings of Pope
Innocent. Yea, and your greatly approved Binius, in his Volumes of the
Councels, dedicated to Pope Paul the fifth, Binius Tom. 1. Conc. ex Rescriptis
innocentii Papae ad Conc. Millevet. Epist. 25. Illud vero, etc. Hinc Binius:
Hinc constat Innocenti sententia, quae 600. circiter Annos viguit in Ecclesia
(quamque Augustinus secutus) Eucharistiam Infantibus necessariam fuisse. Conc.
Trid. recte decrevit, eam non solum non necessariam Infantibus, sed ne quidem
decere ur eis distribuatur -- Quidam viri non vulgariter docti existimarunt
Innocentium hunc locum, [Nisi manducaveritis, etc.] in Baptismi sumptione
interpretari. Sed decepti sunt, quod vim argumenti, quo Pontifex utitur, non
sunt assecuti. Ille enim ut Pelagium (qui docebat Baptismum Infantibus, Parente
fideli prognatis, peccatum originale non contrahentibus, necessarium non esse)
convinceret, hac Ratiocinatione est usus: Quibus necessaria est Eucharistiae
sumptio, usdem Baptismi sumptio magis esse necessaria; At infantibus omnibus
esse necessariam Eucharistiae sumptionem, probatur per verba Iohannis [Nisi
manducaveritis. etc.] Quae expositio praxi Ecclesiae nunc repugnat. [De

explaineth the Marginall Citation) that it will permit no evasion. And so much
the rather, because that which the Tridentine Fathers allege, for cause of
Alteration, does confirm this unto us: It is undecent (say they) to give the
Eucharist unto Infants. This may persuade us that Innocent held it necessary,
else would he not have practiced, and patronized a thing so utterly Indecent. *

Jesuits spares not to make a double cause of the Alteration of that Custom;
one, to avoid the Vndecencie and Profanation of the Sacrament (meaning, by the
casting it up again:) and Heresy of those, who thought the Reociving of this
Sacrament necessary for the Salvation of Infants. Calling this opinion an
Heresy.*

We dispute therefore. If the Church of Rome, in the days of Pope Innocent
the first, held it a Doctrine of faith, in the behalf of Infants, that they
ought to receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist; the same Church of Rome, in
her Council of Trent (whose Decrees, by the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth, are
all held to be believed upon necessity of Salvation) did decree contrarily
that the participation of the Eucharist is not Necessary, no nor yet decent for
Infants. Say now, did the Church of Rome not err in the days of Pope
Innocent? then is she now in an error. Or does she not now err herein? then
did she formerly err, and consequently Necessary to Salvation, which in it
self is Superfluous and Indecent, but also in opinion Heretical. Thus of the
contrary custom of the Church of Rome, in elder times.

The now contrary Opinion, concerning the Roman Mass, at this day. Even at
this day also your Jesuit will have us to understand the meaning of your
Church to be, that Non quod Infantes sunt incapaces hujus Sacramenti, sed quia
hoc nunc magis expedit ad decentiam, and reverentiam, quae aliquali utilitati
parvulorum praeferenda est. Suarez. Tom. 3. Disp. 62. Sect. 3.. Quocirca.

BY which words [ Like manner of Taking, and Giving, and Saying, Drink ye All
of this] we say that Christ ordained for his Guests as well the Sacramental
Rite of Drinking, as of Eating; and has tied his Church Catholic in an equal
obligation for performance of both, in the administering of this Sacrament.

This Cause will require a just Treatise, yet so, that our Discourse insist
only upon necessary points, to the end that the extreme Insolency, Noveltie,
Folly, and Obstinacy of the Roman Church, in contradicting of this part of
Christ his Canon, may be plainly displayed; that every conscience of man,
which is not strangely preoccupated with prejudice, or transported with malice,
must needs see and detest it. We have heard of the Canon of Christ his Mass.

The contrary Canon of the Romish Church, in her Mass. She, in her Council of
Constance, decreed that Christus sub utraque ^pecie Discipulis administravit --
Licet in primitiva Ecclesia sub utraque specie hoc Sacramentum reciperetur, --
tamen haec consuerudo, ut a Laicis sub specie p^nis tantum reciperetur, --
habenda est pro lege, quam non licet reprobare, Conc. Constant. Sess. 13.
Although Christ, indeed, and the Primitive Church did administer the Eucharist
in both kinds; notwithstanding ( say they) this Custom of but one kind is
held for a law irreproveable. Which Decree she afterward confirmed in her Ipsa
Synodus, a Spiritu Sancto edocta, and ipsius Ecclesiae judicium and
consuetudinem secuta, declarat and docet, nullo divino jure Laicos, and
Clericos non consecrantes, obligari ad Eucharistiae Sacramentum sub utraque
specie sumendum: Etsi Christus venerabile hoc Sacramentum sub utraque
instituit, and Apostolis tradidit Council. Trident. Sess. (...). 1. cap. 1.
Council of Trent; requiring that the former Custom and Law of receiving it
but under one kind be observed both by Laics, yea, and also by all those
Priests, who being present at Mass, do not the office of Consecrating.
Contrarily our Church of England, in her thirtieth Article thus: Both parts of
the Lords Sacrament, by Christ's Ordinance and Commandment, ought to be
ministered to all Christian men alike.


BVtwee demand; what Conscience should moove your late Church of Rome to be
guided by the authority of that former Council of Constance, which
notwithstanding makes no scruple to reject the authority of the same
Respondeo, Fuit reprobatum Conc. Co^^antiens Martino Pont. quantum ad eam
partem, qua statuit Concilium fuisse supra Papam. Bellar. lib. 1. de Conc. cap.
7.. Quintum.
Council of Constance in another Decree thereof, wherein it gain-sayeth the
Antichristian usurpation of the Pope, by Denying the authority of the Pope to
be above a Council? and that (as the Dixit Petro Christus Cum frater in te
p^ccaverit, si te non audiat, Dic Ecclesiae, Ergo Ecclesiam Papae Iudicem
constitut. Conc. Basil. apud AEnean^i Sylvium de gest ejusdem Concilij.
Council of does prove) from the authority of Christ his direction unto Peter,
to whom he said, Tell the Church. We return to the State of the Question.

The full State of the Question. All Protestants, whether you call them
Calvinists, or Lutherans, hold, that in the public and set celebration of the
Eucharist, Communion in both kinds ought to be given to all sorts of
Communicants that are capable of both. The question, thus stated, will cut off
a number of Impertinences, which your Objectors busy themselves withal, as
will appear in due places. We repeat it again, [ In public Assemblies of
all prepared, and capable of the Communion.]

The best Method, that I could choose, for the expedite and perspicuous
handling of this great Controversy, is by way of Comparison: as namely, First,
by comparing the Institution of Christ, with the contrary Ordination and
Institution of the Roman Church. Secondly, Christ his Example, with contrary
Examples. Thirdly, the Apostles Practice, with the adverse Practice. Fourthly,
the Primitive Custom of the Church Catholic, with the after-contrarie
Custom; and the Latitude thereof, together with the latitude of the other.
Fifthly, the Reasons thereof, with Reasons. Sixthly, the diverse manners of
beginning of the one, as also the Dispositions of men therein, with the
repugnant manner and Dispositions of men in continuing the other.

The discussing of all which points will present unto your view diverse kinds of
Oppositions. In the first, is the Conflict of Religion with Sacrilege. In the
second, a sovereign Presidence in Christ, with Contempt. In the third, of
Faithfulness with Faithlesnesse. In the fourth, of Antiquity with Noveltie. In
the fifth, of Universality with Paucity. In the sixth, of Wisdom with Folly: as
also of Charity with Injustice and Impiety. In the seventh, of Knowledge with
Ignorance; as likewise of Devotion with Profaneness. And all

The first Comparison is of the Institution of Christ with the Contrary:
proving the Precept of Christ, for the Use of Both kinds to all lawful
Communicants, SECT. II.
THere is one word twice used in the tenor of Christ his Institution; once
concerning the Bread, [HOC FACITE] DO THIS:] the second time touching the Cup,
1. Cor. 11. 25.
[HOC FACITE, QVOTIESCVNQVE:] DO THIS AS OFTEN, etc.] Both which whosoever
should deny to have the Sound and Sense of a Precept, might be confuted by
your own Jesuits, Doctors, Bishops, and Cardinals, among See all this above
Chap. 2. Sect. 1. in the Margent.
whom we find your Barradas interpreting it, Praecipit: your Valentian,
Praeceptum: your Iansenius, Mandat: your Alan, Praeceptio: your Bellarmine,
Iubet; each one signifying a Command. But of what? this is our next
Inquisition. And it is Bread: and Some of them, only, but conditionally of the
Cup, whereof we are now to speak.

The Acts of Christ were some belonging to Consecration, and some to
Distribution, Manducation, and Drinking, Such as concerned Consecration of both
kinds, being with common consent ackowledged to be under that Command of [ Hoc
facite,] are the Taking Bread and blessing it, etc. To the other, touching
Administration of the Cup, whereof it is said, [ He took it, and gave it to
his Disciples] whom after he had Commanded, saying, [ Drink you all of this,]
he added the other Command set down by Saint Paul, saying unto them, [ Do
this as often as ye shall do it in remembrance of Me.] That by this
Obligation he might charge them to communicate in both kinds. A Precept then
it must needs be, But we are not ignorant of your

Your first Evasion. Although ( say Bellar. lib. 1. de Eucharistilia. cap. 25..
Tertu^.
you) it be said to his Disciples [Drinke you all, and, Do this] yet it is
spoken to them as they were Priest. And only to the Apostles; says Master M.
Brereley Liturg. Tract. 4.. 7. after the letter ( y) and after ( g.)
Brerely. And again, The Apostles did represent the Priests.


We answer that your own Quorundam opinio, est Apostolos factos sacerdotes
per illa verba [Hoc facite.] Sed de his verbis non constat facta consecratione
facta consecratione immediate ea dixisse, anrequam Euchristiam ub utraque
specie dedit, vel post -- Quod si verba ista Christus post datam Eucharistiam
illam dixit, manifestum est, illum non Sacerdotibus hinc dedisse: quod mihi ex
literae decursu magis probatur. Alfon. de Castro con. Here Is. Tit Eucharist.
page 158.
Castro will not allow your Antecedent, but is persuaded rather (by the
manifest Current of the Text) that The Apostles were not Priests when the Cup
was given unto them. And although they were then Priests, yet we answer, that
your Consequence, (viz.) Ergo only Priests are enjoined to receive the Cup,
will appear to be both fond in it self, and to your own selves pernicious.
First, as fond, as if one should argue thus: It was at the first said only to
the Apostles, Go and baptize all Nations: Ergo none but the Apostles have
Command to Baptize, which office you permit as well to women Laicke, as to men.
Next pernicious, for say (We pray you) do the words, [ Drink ye all of
this] command all Priests to drink? then must this condemn the contrary See
above in this Chapter at the letter ( b.)
Practice of your now Church of Rome, which allows the Cup to no Priest
present, but only to him that does Consecrate: which is directly confuted by
the Example of Christ, who administered the Cup, unto all his Apostles, by your
doctrine, Priests.

Priest to receive the Cup? then likewise do you condemn your former Church of
Rome, which has sometime permitted the Cup unto Laike. Yea, and your Cardinal
Alan [Hoc facite.] Quod cum pertineat maxim ad potestatem sacerdotalem circa
consecrandum and sacrificandum, tamen Apostolus, 1. Cor. 11. resert quoque ad
sumptionem sive Laicorum, sive Sacerdotum. Quod and Cyrillus facit in Johan.
lib. 12. cap. 38. Et Basil in Moral. Reg. 21. cap. 3. ut [Hoc facite] pertineat
ad totam actionem Eucharisticam a Christo factam, and tam a Presbyteris quam a
plebe postea faciendam. Eodemque verbo imprimis potestas consecrandi and
offerendi, deinde etiam mandatum sumendi tam Sacerdotibus quam alijs fidelibus
detur, cum utrumque suo modo, licet prius exactius Sacrificium, quam sumptio
memoriam mortis Dominicae ^ontineat. Alan. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 37. page 646.
does not stick to tell you, out of the ancient Fathers, that the Command [
Do this] declared by Saint Luke, is applied by Saint Paul to the receiving in
both kinds, as well of People as of Priest. And by virtue of the same Command of
Christ, The Greek Church has always observed the use of both kinds unto this
day. So he, justifying our contrary Consequence; even as also your Laici
adulti tenentur ex institutione Christi communicare, jure divino: hoc thomas
probat ex Luc. 22. [Hoc facite in commemoretionem mei.] quae habent vim
praecepti, non tantum de celebrando (ait Scotus) sed etiam de administrando
Sacramentum populo. Cosmus Phil. de offic. Sacerdot. Tom. 1. de Sacrific.
Missae. l. 2. c. 2.
Cosmus Philiarchus defends, and confirms the same by Aquinas, and Scotus,
the two most eminent Doctors of your Church, holding that Laics are chargible
to receive the Eucharist by virtue of the Command of Christ, in the same words
of Institution, [Do this.]

*And lest you may think that we seek advantage only from your private
Schools, you may find the Council Braccara (about the year 67^) decreeing
the several Administration of both kinds to be Commended to the Church, by
the words of Christ his Institution. Lastly, We shall *Conc. Braccar. See the
third Section following.
prove, that the ancient Fathers with joint consent collected, as well as We,
a necessity of the Peoples receiving in both kinds, by right of equality with
the Priest, from the same example of Christ, in his first Institution, even
because See afterward in this Chapt. Sect. 9. at the
Christ admitted it to all his Disciples then present: * in the Margin.
if that the Disciples had had any privilege in receiving either of Both, as
they were Priests, as you have fondly fancied.

Your second Evasion. Next, although it were (say Nec quicquam valet quod
objicitur [Similiter and Calicem:] quia non dicit Similiter and Calicem dedit,
sed solum accepit. Bellar. ibid.. Nec quicquam.
you) said, [ And in like manner Christ took the Cup] namely, as he took
Bread: yet the word [ Similiter, Likewise] has Relation to his Taking, not to
Giving.

CHALLENGE.
THis is flatly repugnant to the Gospel of Christ, where these words of Luc.
22. 20.
Saint Luke, [Likewise he took the Cup] appear by Saint Math. 26. 27.
Matthew to have relation as well to Christ's Giving, as to his Taking of the
Cup, thus; [ Jesus took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it unto them,
saying, Drink you all of this.] Luke, the text objected is so clear, that it
needs no Comment: He took the Bread, and gave thanks, and gave it unto
them, saying, etc. and likewise the Cup. Where the precedent word, expressing
Christ his Act, is not Took, but Gave the Cup. And if any should seek a
Comment upon these words, he could find none more direct than that of your
learned Arias Montanus, and Bishop Iansenius, [In like manner:] That (say
Similiter et Caheem] id est. Qualia feci^ circa panem, tali^ circa Calicem,
Accepit, gratias egit, dividendum dedit, atque praecep^t ut biberent ab eo
om^^es: Quae omnia Lucas complexus est, dicens, [Similiter and Calicem.] Iansen

Montan. in 1. Cor. 11. 25.
they) as he did with the Bread, so did he with the Cup, he took it, he
gave thanks, he gave it unto them All to drink. All which Saint Luke
comprised in these words; [In like manner He took the Cup.] So they.

Although it be said of Drinking of the Cup, [ Do this in Remembrance of me:]
yet the words [ Do this,] (say Post panis consecrationem absolute ponitur [Hoc
facite] post Calicem vero idem repetitur, sed cum condition, Hoc (inquit)

namely, [ As often as you shall drink it.] And upon this Conceit do two
Jesuits raise up their Insultation, Mirabilis est Dei providentia in sanctis
literis, nam ut non haberent Haeretici justam excusationem, sustulit eis omnem
tergiversandi occasionem. Nam Lucas [Hoc facite] posuit post datum Sacramentum

saying; Behold here the wonderful providence of God, whereby is taken from
Heretics all color of excuse. So they, of us Protestants.

Providence, whereof you talk, be so Wonderful; and Notorious; it is some
Wonder to us, how your own other Doctors missed the sight of it; who, in
seeking most earnestly to avoid the dint of Christ's words of Precept [ Drink
you all of this] devised an uncouth subterfuge, saying, [Bibite ex hoc omnes]
Quae verba si non sint Praecipientis, sed invitantis, ut certe esse possint,
tum respondemus, etc. Petrus Arcad Corcyreut. Presb. S. T. D. de Concord
Orient. and Occident. Eccles. l. 1. c. 10.
These may bewords of Invitation, and not of Command. An Answer which might
better become one on an Alebench, inviting his fellow to pledge him. We hasten
to our Challenge, in answer to

CHALLENGE.
TO this we answer, our of the Conclusions of your own Praecepit igitur
Christus, in verbis Lucae, ut ipsa sumptione commemoremus Passionem ejus; and
non tantum ut quoties illud sumeremus Passionem ipsius in memoriam revocaremus.

Jesuit Vasquez, for the new, Concluding, that the words, [ This do ye, as
often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me,] as they command the end of the
Celebration of this Sacrament, in the remembrance of the Passion of Christ: so
do they also command the Act and manner thereof, which is, by drinking of the
Sacramental Cup. Which he holds to be so manifest a Truth, that he
thinks no man to be so blind, as not to discern it, saying, Who sees not
this? Accordingly he allegeth Solo, for the old School, concluding that the
words [ Drink ye all of this, as often, etc.] Do simply command the act of
Drinking: or else (says he) the Church has no ground, for the Priest that
consecrateth, to celebrate in both kinds. And this Obligation Cardinal
Credimus eos recte oblagari, dum militainus in hac vira, ad Sacramentum
Fucharistiae, eo modo, quo perfectius significat Passionem: id est, sub utraqu^
specie, etc. Card. Cusan. Epist. 2. ad Bohem. page 831.
Cusanus affirms to lie always upon the Church; Who in his Book of the
Liturgy of the Mass, stands so much upon the no command of Christ for the
use of boto kinds, that he justifies an ancient Roman Custom (as he calls
it) of the Priest himself, receiving on Good Friday only under one kind.]
Tract. 4. Sect. 4. page 407. And Tra. 4. Sect. 7. page 421 [ As often:] not
signifying the necessity of Drinking.
Brerely may see, and acknowledge his double Error.

And, indeed, the Evidence is so great, that although all Romish Universities
should withstand it, we might herein appeal to common Sense: for Christ having
first commanded his Disciples, saying, in the Celebration of this Sacrament, [
Drink ye all of this;] this is the Act: and adding further, saying, [ As
often, or whenever as ye shall drink it, do this in remembrance of me,]
which is the End so commanded; it does equally imply a command of the Act of
Drinking, as well as of the End. Often Commemoration of the Passion of Christ,
even until his coming again (as says the Apostle) by the Celebration of
this Sacrament. And the word [(...)] As often, or whenever ye receive, etc.
(being indefinite, and assigning no certain days or times) gives liberty to
the Church to solemnize this Memorial at her convenient times; yet so, that
Whenever the Church celebrateth this Sacrament, she do it according to the
form of Christ his Institution, by communicating in both kinds.

*Yet is not this all, but if you desire an Argument of Gods wonderful
Providence, you may see it in this, in delivering up your own Cardinals to
that Stupidity, as to be caught in their own subtilty, by the clear light of
the Text, well discerned by your Divines of Enchirid. Coloni^nse de Sacramen.
Euch. verb [Hujus.] Divus Paulus ape^tius reliquis habet: Quotiescunque
manducaveritis hunc panem, and poculum hoc bib^tis, mortem Domini
annuntiabitis. 1. Cor. 11. 26.
Colen in these words of Saint Paul, [As often as you do eat this Bread, and
drink this Cup.] Do you mark? the [ Quotiescunque,] is applied equally to
both, The eating of the one, and Drinking of the other. If then their
Consequence were good, that the Church, by virtue of that [ Quotiescunque,] had
a liberty to abstain Cup, it would follow that (against the universal
doctrine of both sides) the Church might celebrate the Communion without
distribution of either of both, whereof more in the next Section.

If the Pope, sitting in the Assembly of his Cardinals, delivering unto each of
them a Ring, to put upon their thumbes, should say, Do this as often as you
come before me, in testimony of my love: (We demand) Are they not, as often
as they come into the presence of that Pope, chargeable to put on each one his
Ring upon his thumb, by virtue of the Popes Command? [ Do this] who sees not
this, that does not wilfully blindfold and stupifie his wits? Shall we
conclude? As your own Doctors infer from these words of Christ [ Do this]
that Laics, who be of years, are bound by the Law of God to communicate: by
the same Text may we conclude, that they are likewise obliged to participate
of the Cup.

Do this as often] seem to be hereunto of no force with your two Cardinals,
who spy therein a wonderful gappe of liberty for a non-use of the Cup, in the
celebration of this Sacrament; yet your Council of Trent pronounces that See
afterward Sect. 4. at the letter (a) and Sect. 6. at (m).
The Priest by these words. [Do this as often as, etc.] is commanded to
consecrate in both kinds; Which indeed ought to be unto us an Argument of the
singular Providence of God, to see the Adversaries of his Truth, to be
Babylonishly Confounded by the Contrariety of their own tongues.


DO this] are (as you have heard) words Commandatorie, and being spoken of Both
kinds, as well for Consecration, as for Distribution, do oblige the Church of
Christ to perform both kinds: so that it must needs follow, that the neglect
of Cup of Sobriety) yet do argue so intemperatly, as though they had been
over-taken with some other Cup: insomuch that they are confuted by their own
learned fellows, by evident texts of the Evangelists, and by common sense;
Which gives us just cause to turn their Wonderment against themselves, Behold
the Providence of God! thus plainly to confound the wisdom of the
Adversaries of his truth by themselves, in their greatest subtilnesse. Hitherto
of the Comparison of the Ordinance of Christ with the Ordinance of the Romish
Church.

Our second Comparison is of the Example of Christ, with the contrary Example.
SECT. III.
WEre it that we had no Precept of Christ to [ Do this] but only the Example
of his Doing it in the first Institution, this should be a Rule for us to
observe it punctually, excepting in such Circumstances, which only
occasionally and See above Sect 2.
has been prooved; and therefore not to dare to give a Non-obstante against
the Example of Christ, as your See above in this Chapter Sect. 1. lit. ( a.)
Council of Constance has done: and which Recte docent Iurisconsulti, non
exemplis sed legibus judicandum. -- Quae ab exemplis ducuntur argumenta per
locum sunt a simili, quae non tam ad aliquid firmandum, quam ad id quod
firmatur illustrandum a Dialecticis esse traduntur. Salmeron. les. Tom. 9.
Tract. 34.
your Jesuit also teaches, as if the Example of Christ were no argument of
proof at all. Which Doctrine we are now to try by the judgment of
Antiquity. Cyprian. con. Aquarios Epist. 63. Admonitos nos scias, ut in Calice
offerendo traditio observetur, neque aliquid fiat a nobis, quam quod pro nobis
Dominus prior fecerit. [ And somewhat after] A divino Magisterio non recedamus.
Cyprian confuteth the Aquarij (Heretics that used only Water in the Chalice)
by the Example of Christ his Institution, because Nothing is to be done of us,
in celebrating of this Mystery, which was not done of Christ. So he.

In the days of Pope Julius, Anno 337. there arose many giddie spirits, which
violated the holy Institution of Christ, in this Sacrament, when as some
Consecrated Milk instead of Wine: others sopped the bread in the Cup: a third
sort squiezed Grapes thereinto. These, and the like, that holy Pope did
condemn, but how? by pretense of Custom only? no, but by the obligation of
Christ his Example, and Institution of this Sacrament, in these words
following: Julius P. apud Gratian de Consecra: Ca. Cum omne. Audivimus quosdam,
Schismatica ambitione detentos, contra divinos ordines and Apostolicas
iustitutiones, lac pro vino, in divinis officijs dedicare: alios intinctam
Eucharistiam populo pro complemento communionis porrigere: quosdam etiam
expressum vinum in Sacramento Dominici Calicis afferre: Alijs vero pannum
lincum, musto intinctum, per totum annum reservare, and in tempore Sacrificij
partem ejus aqua lavare, and sic offeire. Quod cum sit Evangel. cae and
Apostolicae doctrinae contrarium, and consuetudim Ecclesiasticae adversum, non
difficile ab ipso font veritatis probatur, a quo ordinata ipsa Sacramentorum
mysteria processerunt. Cum enim Magister veritatis verum salutis nostrae
Sacrificium suis commendaret Discipulis, nu^^ lac, sed panem tantum and Calicem
sub hoc Sacramento noscimus dedisse. Legitur enim in Evangelica veritate,
[Accepit Jesus Panem and Calicem, and benedicens dixit Discipulis suis] Cesset
igitur Lac in Sacrificando offerri, quia manifestum and evidens veritatis
exemplum illuxit, quia praeter Panem and Vinum aliud offerri non licet. Illud
vero quod, pro complemento Communionis, intinctam Eucharistiam tradunt populis,
nec hoc prolatum ex Evangelio testimonium receperunt, ubi corpus suum Apostolis
commendaret and sanguinem: scorsim enim panis, and scorsim Calicis commendatio
^emoratur.
Because these are contrary (says he) to Evangelicall and Apostolical
doctrine, and Ecclesiastical So Pope Julius.

*Long after this, the Council of Braccara (about the year of our Lord 675)
withstood the Complementall Custom of receiving both kinds in dipped soppes:
but wot you why? hearken; even because Conc Braccar. 3. cap. 1. Iliud vero,
quod pro complemento Communionis intinctam tradunt Eucharistiam populis; nec
hoc prosatum ex Evangelio recipit, ubi Apostolis corpus suum and sanguinem
commendavit: seorsim enim panis, and seorsim calicis commendatio memoratur.
Apud Binium, Tom. 2.
It is not reveiled in the Gospel of Christ's Institution. Ponder the Testimony
in the Margin, and you shall find it point-blanke contradictorie to your
opinion and practice. Which Reasoning of the Bishops of that Council had been
very loose and lavish, except they had believed that the form of Institution
of Christ, concerning Participation of both kinds, was as Commandatorie,
as well for the People, as the Priest.

Those also that offered Bread and Cheese together, in this Sacrament, are
confuted by the Institution of Christ, who appointed Bread, says Artotyritae
panem and caseum offerunt: qui excluduntur per hoc, quod Christus hoc
Sacramentum instiruit in pane. Aquinas, part 3. quaest 24. Art. 1.
your Aquinas. What can be more direct and absolute? yet dare your men object
to the contrary.

At Emmaus, Luke 24. Christ, meeting with certain Disciples, taking bread and
blessing it, and thereby manifesting himself to them, is said immediately
after the Breaking of Bread to have vanished out of their sights. Ergo, it may
be lawful ( says your Ex Luc. 24 30. Vbi Christus appatens duobus Discipulis
in Emmaus, and accumbens accepit panem, and benedixit, and dedit eis: quo
facto, aperti sunt oculi comm, and evanuit ex oculis, etc. [ Hence does

Cardinal) to use but one kind. Because ( says Master Brereley Liturg.
Tract. 4.. 3. page 402.
Master Brerely) the Text shows, that Christ vanished away, not leaving

THis Argumentis is still inculcated, almost, by every Romanist, in defense of
the Romish Custom of but in one kind, notwithstanding Nor is this likely,

Iansenius. And it is dead-rotten also in the branch and Consequence thereof,
because that this Act of Christ in Emmaus is not to be urged, as an Example to
be imitated in the Church; which is demonstrable by an acknowledgment, of your

Valentia. As for example. The Council of Trent has defined that the Priest,
in Consecrating, is commanded by Christ his Institution to consecrate in both
kinds; Because this (says your Jesuit) both the nature of the Sacrifice and
Sacrament does exact: but by what words of Command? namely (for so he says) by
these words, [Do this as often, etc.] Accordingly your Objectour Liturg. Tract.
4.. 2. page 401.
Master Brerely (as if he had meant purposely to confute, and confound
himself) The reason why the Priest receives both kinds, is, because he is to
represent the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. But Bread cannot represent
Christ dead, without some sign of Blood.

non debet corpus sine sanguine consecrari. -- Cele bratio hujus Sacrame^ti est

non in consecratione unius speciei, sed utriusque fuisse a Christo institutum,
quia alioqui ubi duae essent Consecrationes, duo essent sacrificia in Missa. --

Vasquez (if peradventure he cannot reform) will surely refute, even from
your own Romish Principle, which teaches that the Sacrifice of the Mass is
an unbloudy Sacrifice in it self, yet Commemorative and Representative of
Christ's death and Passion; which was by the Effusion and Separation of Blood
from his Body. But this (says he) cannot be represented (...) by one kind.
And thereupon he Concludes that Christ instituted

If then, because Christ ministered it not in Both kinds in Emmaus, it shall be
lawful for the Church to imitate him in that manner of Distribution of this
Sacrament, it must as equally follow, that because he is not found there to
have Consecrated in both kinds, it may be lawful for your Consecrating Priest
so to do; not only contrary to your now Roman Custom; but also (in the
judgment of the Council of Trent) conrary to the Command of Christ, as See
above. See also hereafter Sect. 6.
has been confessed. Twice miserable therefore is the darkness of your
Disputers, not to remember that common Principle, to wit, Extraordinary Acts
(such as this was) are not to be Rules for ordinary Duties.

*Wherein, that the Inconsionableness of all your Objectors may be made more
transparent, We add out of your Schools, that Christ's Acts of Excellency,
(that is, which are proper to his own Sovereignty) are neither Dispensable,
nor Imitable. And such was this his abrupt not-dispensing of Both kinds unto
his Disciples. Say, Father Vasquez, is not this most true? Vasquez. Ies. in 3.
Thom Disp 2^3. cap. 3. Suprema authoritate coram Discipulis in castello Emmaus
altera^ tantum speciem consecravit. -- quod quidem eo tempore fieri maxim

hanc obligationem Sacerdotibus relaxare.
Christ (says this Jesuit) now at Emmaus So he. With what Conscience then
could your Objectors urge this Example of Christ, for the Priests administering
the Sacrament but in One kind, which they themselves did see could not
justify either your Priests, or Popes, consecrating but in One kind?

A SECOND CHALLENGE.
Cyprian, and Pope Julius, that it was good Divinity, in their days, to argue
from the Example of Christ his Institution negatively; by rejecting such Acts,
and accounting them as contrary to the Institution of Christ, which accord not
with his Example, and which are not comprised within the Canon of Christ his [
Hoc facite.] Which kind of Reasoning, at this day, is hissed at in your Romish
Schools. What need many words? O tempora!


Saint Paul having more special occasion to handle this point, than any other
of the Apostles, may worthily be admitted to resolve us in the name of all the
Rest. He Catechizing the Corinthians, concerning the true use of the
Eucharist, records 1. Cor. 11. 23.
I have received of the Lord that which I deliver unto you, that the Lord
Jesus, etc. And, after his Recital of the Institution of Christ, he himself
adds [ Ibid. Verse. 26.
As often as you eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, you show the Lords
death until he come again. Ibid. Verse. 28.
Let therefore a man examine himself, and so eat of this Bread, and drink of
this Cup.] From this we seek a Proof both of the Apostolical Practice, in
the use of Both kinds, in this Sacrament; and of our duty in observing the
same. But we may spare our pains of proving the use of Both kinds in the
Church of Corinth, because (as your Antiqua Consuctudo temporibus Apostolorum
fuit in Ecclesia, sub utraque specie communicandi. In hac assertione nulla est
Controversia. Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. 6. page 602. So Ecchius Hom. 36. Nullum
insiciari posse, Paulum hoc praecipisse Corinthijs.
Cardinal Tolet confesses) There is no controversy thereof.

As for the Proof of our necessary Conformity, we have the same Reasons,
wherewith the Apostle persuades thereunto, [ That (says he) which I have
received of the Lord, I deliver unto you, that Jesus, etc.] Thereby applying
the Example of Christ his Institution for a Rule of their Practice: which this
conjunctive Particle of Eating [AND] Drinking; To Eat [AND] Drink, five times
so coupled in this Epistle, do plainly

But you tell us, that in this place the Conjunctive [AND] is put for a
Disjunctive, Or, thereby to teach the Church a liberty to choose whether they
shall eat or Drink: notwithstanding, you your selves have confessed that
Christ spoke absolutely, and without Condition, of the Bread, Take, Eat, Do
this. And again, 1 Cor. 11. 24. [(...), And in like manner the Cup.] It is an
AND Conjunctive, questionless. For seeing it cannot be denied, that the
Apostles Practice was both Eating and Drinking conjunctively, it is not likely
or credible that the Brerely opposes, viz. The Apostle in the same Chapter
says v. 20 He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks
judgment; also he says verse. 27. whosoever eats this Bread, and drinks
this Cup unworthily, etc. So he.

It is not to be denied but that [AND] is often used in Scripture for, [ Or:]
but Master Brerely his notions, as commonly elsewhere, so here also are too
confused, by not distinguishing the diverse use of [AND] namely, in Precepts,
and Exhortations Honor thy father, And thy mother, (Exodus 20.) here [AND] must
needs be copulative, because of the Obligation of Precept of honoring Both.
But the denunciation against the Transgressour, if it stood (as Master * Mr.
Brerely in his Lit. Tract. 4.. 7. Usual it is in Scripture to use the
Conjunctive, ET, And, for the Disjunctive. So it is said, he that shall strike
his Father and Mother, shall die. When as both the Original, the Roman Vulgar,
and our Translations have it. (OR.)*
Brerely objecteth, feigning a false Text contrary both to the Original, and
vulgar Latin Translation) thus, He that shall strike his father, And mother,
shall die: the particle [AND] must needs be taken disjunctively for, Or, (as
indeed it is expressed in the Text) because the Transgression

Against this, albeit so evident a Truth, your Doctors will have something to
object, or else it will go hard; even forsooth the contrary practice of the
Apostles, Act. 2. 42 where we read of the faithful assembled and Continuing
together in fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers; because there
is but mention only of one kind, which is Bread: whence they infer a
no-necessity of using the Cup. So your Act 2. Ita describitur com ^unicatio
Eucharistiae [Era^t enim persevorantes in doctrine Apostolorum, and
communicatione fractionis panis, and Orationibus.] Quo in loco negari non
potest quin agatur de Eucharistia. Apostoli igitur in utraque specie
consecrabant: sed populis in una specie ministrabant. Bellar. l. 4 de Euch. c.
24. p. 64.
Cardinal Bellarmine. And to answer, that the ministration of the Cup is
understood by a figure Synechdoche, is an Answer only imaginary and
groundless, says Master Liturg. Tract. 4.. 3. page 403.
Brerely.

But are they yet to learn that which every man knows, and your own
Jesuits have taught? that there is no Trope more familiar in Scripture than
this Synechdoche of taking a part They brake bread through every house; Wherein
(as your Jesuit Existamo de Eucharistia non esse Sermonem, quonium de illo
superius paulo Sermo habitus est. Lorin. les in eund. loc. And Cajetan. Card.
F^ebat distributio panis -- ita quod aceipiebant cibus erat. Comment in ^und.
loc.
Lorinus reaches) there is not meant the Eucharist, but common food? Whereby
you cannot but understand implied, in their breaking of bread, their mutual
drinking together also. And yet in the like words spoken of the Eucharist,
verse 42. [ They continued together in breaking of Bread] you exclude the
participation of the Cup. What shall we say? was your spiritual appetite
weaker than your corporal, in reading these two Texts, wherein is mentioned
only Bread, that you could discern but half refection in the Eucharist, and
an whole in their bodily repast?

*Not to trouble you with the repeating of Some Matthew. 16. The Disciples are
accused for eating bread with unwashed, hands, Mark. 3. They had no leisure to
eat bread Luc. 12. Christ to the Pharisees house eat bread. 2 Thessalonians. 3. We
have not eaten our bread freely, etc.
few Scriptures, among many, wherein the word, Bread, alone does by a
Senechdoche necessarily unply a perfect and full Refection; else men (you know)
should be clemmd, who should have Bread only, without Drink.

Besides, any man may guess what spirit it favors of, that (in paralleling
the authority of your Church with the authority of the Apostles) your Jesuits
do resolve, that although the Si daremus hunc ritum ab Apostolo fuisse
traditum, cum tamen mere positivus sit, potuillet illum mutare, quid Ecclesia
habet eu^dem spiritum, and eande^ authoritatem cum Paulo. Salmeron. Ies. Tom.
9. Tract. 34. p. 277. Eodem modo Vasquez les. in 3. Thom. Disp. 215. 216.
Nihilo minus Ecclesia and summus Pontifes poterit illud justis de causis
abrogare; licet concederemus praeceptum hoc fuisse Apostolicum.
Nevertheless (say they) the Church of Rome, and Pope thereof, having the same
authority with Saint Paul, may abrogate it upon just Cause. And yet hardly can
you allege any Cause, for abrogation of that Practice, which Saint Paul might
not have assumed in his time.


O Frustra susceptos Labores nostros! may we say; for to what end is it for us
to prove an Apostolical Practice, or Precept for Both kinds, when your
Objectors are ready with the only names of Pope and Church of Rome to stop
the mouths not only of Us Heretics (as you call us) but even of Saint Paul
himself, and of the other Apostles, yea, and of Saint Peter too? By which
Answer notwithstanding you may perceive how little Saint Paul does favor your
cause, by whose Doctrine the Advocates for your Church are driven to these
straits: but more principally if you call to remembrance, that our Argument is
taken from the Apostles Doctrine and Practice, as it was grounded by St. Paul
himself upon the Doctrine and Precept of Christ. Thus, when we appeal unto
the Apostles Tradidition, you, by opposing, Think your selves wiser than the
Apostles: which Irenaeus will tell you was the very garb of old Cum ad eam
Traditionem, quae ab Apostolis, provocamus eos, dicent se Apostolis existentes

Both kinds in the administration of this Sacrament, and the extent thereof,
both in the longitude of Continuance, and latitude of Universality, we are

these voices: Olim per multa secula sub utraque specie (...)gebatur Laicis, ut

We must confess, We do confess; yea, We do ingenuously confess a
Custom of both kinds (as well to the Laics as Priests) to have been in the
Primitive Church most frequent and general: as is proved by the ancient
Fathers both Greek and Latin, among whom are Leo and Gregory (both) Popes of
Rome; yea and universal also for a long time, continuing a thousand years in
the Church of Rome, and in So they.

Where we see both the Antiquity and Universality thereof to the full, which
it were easy for us to have shown Gradatim, descending down from the first
Age unto the twelfth; but that when we have as much confessed as need be
proved, it might be judged to be but an importunate diligence and Curiosity
to labor any further. Nevertheless, if peradventure any should desire to see
one or two Testimonies for the last Age, he may satisfy himself in the Bern.

The Romish Objections, concerning Primitive Custom. Both kinds, which we
defend; but if they shall not seek to decline the Question, and to rove about,
as it were, at unset marks, their Arguments are but as so many Bolts shot
altogether in vain. For our defense is o^^ly this, that in the public
solemnization and Celebration of this Sacrament, in an Assembly of Christians
freely met to communicate, no one example can be shown in all Antiquity,
throughout the Catholic Church of Christ, for the space of a thousand years,
inhibiting either Priest, or Laick, from Oh: Consuetudinem Eucharist^^m domum

proved to be either private, or illegitimate, or false, respectively. Hitherto
of the Primitive Custom.

Notwithstanding all this, will your Roman Church boast of her contrary
Custom of aftertimes, telling us, in her Councels, that her Custom of
administering the Eucharist but in one kind is rightly observed, as a Custom,
which has been [ Diutissime ] that is, of very long continuance. Many years
bypassed, says In Conc. Constant. de usu unius speciei. Cum hujusmodi

page 284.
Salmeron: It is certain (says he) that the Church, for these three or two
hunded years, has used to communicate to the So they.

CHALLENGE.
NOw after that we have proved, out of your own Confessions, the length of
the Custom of Both kinds to have been in the Continuance above a thousand
years, after the first Institution of this Sacrament; and for largeness
thereof, in an universal consent thereunto, without any exception by any
example ordinary, public, and legitimate; and that you have heard also even
the Fathers of your Church opposing against three hundred years, and yet to
call it [ Diutissima] A Custom of longest continuance; what Tergiversation
could be more shameless? But enough of this point. In the next place, because
the same your Council has told us, that your contrary Custom was brought in [
Rationabiliter,] with good Reason, we are forthwith to discuss the Reasons
thereof.

Our sixth Comparison is of Reasons, for the Use
A Sacrament (according to the common definition) is a Visible sign of an
invisible Grace; and so far is a Sign true and perfect, as it does fully
represent the things that are ordained to be signified thereby: Signification
being the very proper nature and end of a Sign, as well in sacred, as in
profane Rites.

Our first Reason is taken from the due Perfection of this Sacrament, which
must necessarily be in Both kinds. The things Spiritual (as all Christians
profess) are the Body Blood of Christ, which are signified in the Sacrament of
Bread and wine; These two then are not two Sacraments, but one Sacrament
formally, (as you See afterward at the letter ( m.)
know) which therefore ought to be performed in Both, or else the Act will be a
Sacrilegious dismembring of the Sacrament of Christ. This shall we easily prove
from the Principles and Confessions of your own Schools. Your Church
professes to celebrate the Eucharist, both as it is a Sacrifice, and as it is
a Sacrament. As you hold it to be a Sacrifice, you generally teach that Both
kinds are necessarily to be received of the Priest, because they both belong to
the Essence thereof. So your Sed nos nullam scimus Sacramenti mutilationem,
neque partem dimidiam Laicis esse substractam, siquidem duae species
requiruntur necessario ad Sacrificium, sed ad essentiam Sacramenti quaelibet ex
duobus sufficit. -- Proinde Sacramentum sub specle panis est verum and integrum
Sacramentum, quando sumitur per modum ^nius refectionis. Bellar. Apol. con.
Praefar. Monit. page 102. And Alfons. a Castro de nac Controv. page 157.
Sacerdos hac lege devinctus est, ut quotiescunque celebret, nec panem sine
vino, nec vinum absque pane consecrari faciat: quoniam etsi integer Christus
sub qualibet specie lateat, non tamen quaelibet species totum Christum
significat, sed panis sol^m carnem significat, species vini solum sanguinem
repraesentat, illiusque solius memoriam gerit.

at (g) where Vasquez the Iesult is cited in 3. Them. Disput. 215.
Aquinas, your Jesuits Valentia, and Vasquez, and they will say as much in
behalf of the Eucharist, as it is a Sacrament; their reason is, Because both
kinds, making but one Sacrament, ought to be So they.

If such be the necessity of consecrating in both kinds, under the hand of the
Priest, then lies the same obligation upon the Church likewise, for
distributing it in both kinds unto the people, to whom it is to be
administered, in token of Christ his Passion for them applicatorily, both in his
Body and Blood: but the Bread only can no more represent the Blood of Christ in
the mouths of people, in the eating thereof, than it can by Consecrating
Priest: and consequently the dismembring thereof, as you do, must necessarily
condemn both Priest and People. A Consequence, which your figment of See
hereafterr, Sect: 8.
Concomitancie cannot possibly avoid.

A Corroboration of the same Reason, against the Sacrilegious dismembring of
this Sacrament, by the Testimony of Pope Gelasius; and a Vindication of Doctor
Morton from the Traducement of other your Priests and Jesuits.
THe Heretical Manichees forbear the use of the Cup in this Sacrament, in an
opinion, that wine was not created by God, but by some evil spirit; whom Pope
Gelasius did therefore condemn by his public Decree: which Heretical opinion
(as once I Appeal. lib. 2. Chap. 1. page 140.
said) cannot justly be imputed unto the Church of Rome, in her manner of
abstaining from the Cup in the Eucharist. This Saying In his Answer to his
Majesty.
Master Fisher the Jesuit, of late, thought good to pervert to his own use,
thus. The Crime wherewith some Protestants charge us, that our receiving under
the sole form of Bread is to jump in the opinion of the Manichees, we may (as
Doctor Morton confesses) reject as injurious, saying with him, that it was
not the Manichees abstinence from w^ne, but the reason of their forbearance
that was judged Heretical. So he. But this man's march is but slow.

Master Brerely, In his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass, Tract. 4.. 4. page
407.
a Romish Priest, one well esteemed among you, for his exceeding labor and
pains in defending the Romish Cause, to his power, by his many Books, almost
in every particular, comes on more roundly, as follows: Doctor Morton
himself ( says he) shall plead in our behalf, who says So your Priest; yet
what of all this? So clearly does Doctor Morton ( says he) clear us from
the foul and false imputation urged against us by Doctor Whitaker, who noted
the Administration but in one kind, now used by the Romish Church, to have had
it is original from the Manichees: and so clearly does he contradict both
Master Whitaker and himself, in one place accusing us, in another excusing us,
in one and the same Respect: of which foul fault of Contradiction in so great
a Rabbin when he clears himself, instead of being Bishop of Litchfield, he
shall be unto me ever Magnus Apollo. Thus far Master Brerely. Alas! what
will become of the Doctor, being as you see, thus fiercely assaulted by two at
once, one a Jesuit, the other a Romish Priest, both conspiring together to
make the Doctor ridiculous?

CHALLENGE,
IT is now about twenty years since the said Doctor (in Confutation of a book
of Master Brerelyes, entitled an Apology) Protestants Appeal, wherein were
discovered many hundred of Master Brerelyes Ignorances, Falsities, and
Absurdities: who ever since has had Master Parson's itch, (as he himself
called his own humor) which received a Salve that might have cured him of
that itch, to be meddling with the same Doctor. Yet the only Exception, which
has since come to this Doctor's ears from your side, is this now objected
point, concerning the Manichees: whereupon you have heard them both so
urgently, and boastingly insist: and not so only, but they have also divulged
this pretended Contradiction in many Counties of this Kingdom, to his
reproach. Will you be so kind, as but to hear an Answer, and then either
wonder at, or hiss, or applaude, or him, or them, as you shall find just Cause.

Two things there were condemnable in the Manichees, one was their Act and
Practice, in dismembring the Sacrament, by Heretical Conceit, that Wine was
the Creature of the Devil. Concerning this Heretical opinion, no Protestant
(said Protestants Appeal lib. 2. chap. 4. Sect. 3.
Doctor Morton) does charge the Church of Rome: but as for the Act of not
Communicating in Both kinds, In the same Appeal, lib. 4. chap. 22. Sect. 10.
he called it Sacrilegious, and concluded the Church of Rome, in this respect,
to be as guilty of dismembring the Sacrament, as were the Manichees. And both
these he has done by the Authority of Pope Comperimus quod quidam, sumpta
tantummodo corporis sacri portione, a Calice sacri cruoris abstineante qui
proculdubio (quoniam nescio qua supersticione docentur astringi) aut Sacramenta
integra percipiant, aut ab integris arceantur, quia divisio unius ejusdemque
mysterij sine grandi sacrilegio non potest provenire. Gelas^apud Gratian, de
Consecrat. cap. Comper^mus. D. 2.
Gelasius, who decreed, in condemning the Manichees, Illi nescio qua
superstitione docentur astringi, etc. (That is) They are entangled in a kind
of Superstition. Then, for the Act of refusing the Cup, Because (says he) the
diving of the same Mystery cannot be done without grievous sacrilege, therefore
let these Manichees either receive the whole Sacrament, or else let them be
wholly excluded from receiving. So Gelasius,

Seeing then Doctor Morton, and all Protestants, clear the Church of Rome from
the imputation of the Heresy of the Manichees, in respect of their opinion,
and yet condemn them of the Manichean Sacrilege, in respect of the Act of
dismembring Morton, to collect from thence, either your Churches Justification
from a foul fault of Sacrilege, or else the Doctors foul Contradiction to
himself, and that clearly forsooth, in the same respect? who themselves are
now found to have been so subtly witless, as not to discern Heresy from
Sacrilege; an opinion from a fact; or a no-imputation of that, whereof neither
Doctor Whitaker, nor any other Protestant ever Roman Pope himself. Take unto
you a Similitude. A man being apprehended in the company of Traitors, upon
suspicion of Felony, is fully and effectually prosecuted for Felony only; if
one should say of him, that he was not convicted or condemned of Treason, but
of Felony, were this either a Contradiction in the party speaking, or a full
Justification of the party spoken of?

You are by this time (we think) ashamed of your Proctors, and of their
scornful insultation upon the Doctor, in the ridiculous terms of Rabbin,
and Magnus Apollo: who willingly forbeareth, upon this Advantage, to recompense
them with like scurrility, being desirous to be only Great in that, which is
called Magna est Veritas, and praevalet.

By which Truth also is fully discovered the vanity of the Answer both of Mr.
Fisher, and of your Cardinal, saying, that Gelasius condemned only the Opinion
of the Manichees; which is so transparant a falsehood, as any one that has but
a glympse of Reason may see throught it, by the sentence it self, as has been
proved.

Our second Reason is in respect of the perfect Spiritual
ANother Object, represented in this Sacrament, is the food of man's soul, in
his faithful receiving of the Body and Blood of Christ, which because it is a
perfect spiritual Refection, Christ would have it to be expressed both in
Eating and Drinking, wherein consists the perfection of man's bodily
sustenance: and therefore are both necessarily to be used, by law of Analogy
between the outward Sign, and the thing Signified Nam in alterutra (...) sive
panis sive vin^ significatur sufficienter refect^^ animae Bellar. lib. 4. de
Eucharist. cap. 20.. Vtranuc. page 639. Est etiam in specie quod (...)

Jesuits (from whom Master Fisher has learned his Answer) seek to persuade
their Readers, that the Souls refection spiritual is sufficiently signified
in either kind, whether in Bread, or Wine. But be it known unto you, that
either all these have forgotten their Catechism, authorized by the Fathers of
the Council of Trent, and confirmed by Pope Pius Quintus, or else Those their
Catechists forgot themselves in teaching, that Optimo jure institutum est, ut
separatim duae consecrationes fierent: primo enim ut Passio Domini, in qua
sanguis a corpore divisus est, ^magis referatur -- Deinde, maxim consentaneum
fuit, ut quoniam Sacramento, ad alendam animam, utendum nobis erat, tanquam
cibus and potus institueretur, ex quibus perfectum corporis alimentum constare,
perspicu^^ est. Ca^echis. Romans part. 2. de Euch. number. 29.
This Sacrament was instituted so, that two several Consecrations should be
used, one of Bread, and the other

Aquinas, and your Jesuit Valentia, with others, are as express in this
point, as they were in the former; who although they (as we also) hold that
whole Christ is received in either kind, (for Christ is not divided) yet do
they Hoc Sacramentum ordinatur ad spiritualem refectionem, quae conformatur
corporali. Ad corporalem autem refectionem Duo requiruntur, scilicet cibus, qui
est alimentum siccum, and potus, qui est alimentum humidum. Et etiam ad
integritatem hujus Sacramenti duo concu^^^unt; scilicet, spiritualis cibus, and
spiritualis potus, secundum illud, Ioh. 6 [Caro mea vere est cibus] -- Ergo,
hoc Sacramentum multa quidem est materialiter, sed unum formaliter and
perfective. Aqui. part. 3. quaest. 73. Art 2. Etsi negandum non est, quin ejus
refectionis spiritualis vis and commoditas clarius utr^que re s^nul, scilicet

maintain that This Sacrament, as it is conformable both to Eating and
Drinking, so does it by Both kinds, more perfectly express our spiritual
nourishment by Christ: and therefore it is more convenie it that both be
exhibited to the faithful severally, as for Meat, and for drink. So they.
For although, in the Spiritual Receiving, Eating and Drinking are both one,
even as the appetite of the Soul in hungring and thirsting is the same; as
where it is written, Matthew. 5. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
righteousness, etc. yet in this Sacramental communicating with bodily
instruments it is otherwise, as you know. Sub specie panis sanguis sumatur cum
corpore, and sub specie vini sumatur corpus cum sanguine: nec s^nguis sub
specio panis bibitur, nec corpus sub specie v^^ editu^: quia sicut nec corpus
^bitur, ita nec sanguis comeditur. Duraad. Ratitional. lib. 4. cap. 42. page

59. Dominus dicit, uno^actu fidei famein tolli, and sitim: ac proinde unico

Christ says, that by the only act of Faith both hunger and thirst is taken
away: therefore we are said both to eat and drink by the same and only act
of Faith.

Wherefore you, in withholding the Cup from the People, do violate the
Testament of Christ, who requires in this a perfect representation visible of
a complete and a full Refection spiritual; Dimensum, ordained by Christ for
their use. Concerning this second, Answer to his Majesty.
Master Fisher (one of the society of Jesuits) was taught to Answer, that the
Full causality (as he said) and working of spiritual Effects of the soul
cannot be a wanting to the Sacrament under one kind; because of Christ his
assistance. So he. We should ask, whether a greater Devotion, and a more
plentiful Grace are not to be esteemed spiritual Effects, for the good of the
Soul, Secundum Alexandrum de Hales -- Major fructus ex perceptione utriusque
speciei habetur. Salmeron. les. Tom. 9. Tract. 37. Neque been p. 303. Per
accidens tutem non est ^ubium quin usus utriusque speciei possit esse
fructuosior, eo quod potest majorem devotionem commovere in percipiente. Vnde
fiat, ut propter majorem dispositionem consequitur ille veriorem gratiam ex
Sacramento. Valent. les. Ibid. page 493.. Per accidens.
confessed to be enjoyed rather by Communicating in Both kinds.

*Will you have any more? know then that your Roman Pope Clement did
absolutely teach that Vasquez. les. in 3. Thom. quaest. 80. Disput. 215. cap.
2. Probabilior sententia mihi semper visa est eorum, qui dicunt majorem-fructum
gratiae ex utraque specie, quam ex a^^erutra percipi: and proinde illos, qui
calicem sumunt, novum augmentum Gratiae consequi. Ita Alexander Cassalius,
Arboreus, Clemens Pont. 6. Remandus ( Et i^margine sua; Hinc sententiam Suarez,
Disp. 35. 6. ut probabilem defendit.) Hanc sententiam absolute secuti^s est
Clemens 6. in Bulla ad Regem Angliae 1341. in quo ill^ concessit, ut in gratiae
augmentum in utraque specie communicaret. -- Sacramentum hoc institutum est in
modum Convivij, Ioh. 6. [Caro mea vere est cibus, and languis meus vere est
potus:] nam in Convivio nihil aliud est quam cibus and potus, quorum quilibec
suo particulari modo reficit.
A greater augmentation of Grace is obtained by Communicating in Both. Which
was the Cause (says your Jesuit) that He dispensed with the King of England
to participate in Both. For consider (we pray you) that the Assistance of
Christ does especially concur with his own Ordinance, and therefore much
rather where the form of a Sacrament, ordained and instituted by himself, is
observed, then where it is (as of you) so notoriously in this Defense, we shall
produce to this purpose, the consona^^ Doctrine of ancient Fathers.

Our third proof is taken from the manifold Reasons of ancient Fathers, for
Confirmation of the Necessity of the Communicating in Both kinds. SECT. IX.
FOr the proof of the necessary use of Both kinds, in the solemn and public
dispensation of this Sacrament, the particular Satis compertum est, universalem
Christi Ecclesiam in hunc usque diem, Occide^talem autem seu Romanam mill

and vini symbolis Discipulis suis, fidelium Communicantium personam

virtutem and gratiam hoc vini symbolo significatam esse credebant: tum ob
rations mysticas hujus Instituti, quae a veteribus vary adducuntur, viz. ad
repraesentandam memoriam Passio^is Christi in oblatione corporis, and sanguinis

Calicem Domini biberitis, mortem Dom^^ annunciatis donec venerit] Item ad
significandam integram ^ofectionem sive nutritionem, quae cibo and potu
constat, quomodo Christus inquit, [Caro mea verus est cibus, et sanguis meus
verus est potus.] Item ad designandam redemptionem and tuitionem corporis and

confessing as much, in effect, as we did intend to prove, viz. That the
ancient Fathers were induced to the Continuance of the Custom in Both kinds,
First, by the Example and Institution of Christ. Secondly, by some particular
Grace, which they held to be signified by the Cup. Thirdly, for the
Representation, that it had to the Passion. of Christ; distinctly and
respectively to his Body and Blood. Fourthly, to resemble the Redemption, which
man has in his Body by Christ's Body, and Blood in the soul. Fifthly, To
express by these Symbols the perfect spiritual Nourishments we have by his
Body and Blood. Sixthly, To understand that this Sacrament does equally belong
to People, as well as to Priests: (which they with great earnestness enforce,
with joint consent, as a necessary [ Ius] and Right belonging to both.)
Seventhly, that the Cup of the Eucharist does animate souls to receive the Cup
of bloody Martyrdom, when the time should be. *Eighthly, by the Precept of
Christ; Vasquez in 3. Thom. Qu. 801. Disp. 216. cap. 6. Justinius in 2. Apolog.

as full a Command us [Hoc manducate] or, [Hoc bibite.]
Iustine one of the most ancient Guides in Christ's Church saying plainly, that
Christ commanded Both kinds to be received

peremptory for the Common use of the Cup, that he called Christian men's Aug.

Greek Church, in obeying the Canon of Christ, and holding it necessarily to
be observed of the people also, by receiving in Both kinds; and that otherwise
we transgress against the Institution of Christ.

All these Testimonies of Primitive Fathers, under the Confession of your own
Doctors (besides our other Collections) are so many Arguments of the Consonant
Doctrine of Antiquity, for proof of an Obligation of Precept upon the Churches
of Christ whatsoever, for the preservation of the kinds. Upon this evidence
may you justly call your fellow-Priest Mr. Brerely to account for his bold
Assumption, saying, that Liturg. Tract. 4.. 9. page 425. a^ Eighthly.
No Doctor (speaking of ancient Fathers) can be produced either expressly, or
else by necessary Consequence, affirming the necessity of the Laics receiving
under Both kinds: Your selves perceiving now not only One, but many ancient
Doctors to have expressed not only One, but Many Necessities inferring the
same. And then you may furthermore question him for his next as lavish
Assertion, affirming, in his fifth Answer, The Authorities objected, for the
necessity of Both kinds, speak not of a Sacramental, but only of a
spiritual Receiving with the mouth of their hearts. When shall we find
conscionable dealing at this man's hands?

Having thus finished our Assumption, we shall more expeditely satisfy such
your Reasons, or rather Pretenses, which you

The Romish Pretenses for their Innovation and Alteration of Christ his
Institution, by the public use of but One kind. SECT. X.
We hear the Council. Trid. Sess. 21. Cap. 2. Gravibus et justis de Causis.
Council of Trent pretending (as they say) Just reasons of altering the
primitive Custom and use of both kinds, but naming none, which we may well
think was because they deserved not the mention: surely, such they were, that
your Jesuit had rather that you should believe It being your part (as Porro
causas, quae Ecclesiam moverunt, ut consuetudine^ communicandi sub altera
probaret, atque etiam pro lege observanda esse decerneret, non tam nostrum est
discutere aut inquireie, quam ipsi Decreto simpliciter obtemperare,
existimareque omnino eas fuisse justas, ut rectissime ex Conc. Trid. definitum
est. Greg. Volent. Ies. delegit. usu Sacr. Euch c. 10.. Porro, p. 499.
he says) Rather to think them just, then to discuss them. But we are not
bound to your Rules of blind Obedience. God will have us to use the sight,
which he has given us, lest If the blind lead the blind, both fall into
the Ditch. And whether the Reasons, which are given by your Doctors, be not
blind Seducements, we are now to try. Some of your Reasons are taken from
extraordinary Cases, some Instances are common to all other Churches Christian,
and some are made as being peculiar to the Church of Rome.

The first kind of Romish Pretenses, from extraordinary Cases. The first
pretense is thus alleged; Ob inopiam vini, cujus in plerisque Christianitatis
partibus magna penuria. Valent. ibid. and Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34.. Ad
quintum, page 279. And Rossens. in like manner. Bellar. also adds another
Reason to this: Movit Ecclesiam uniformitas, ut Concordia populi Christiani in
Sacramento hoc percipiendo, quod est Sacramentum pacis and unjtatis, propter
eos, apud quos vinum inveniri non potest: ut sunt, aliquae provinciae boreales,
ubi vinum non invenitur, qui existimarent se Christo curae non fuisse, aut non
ita ut alias provincias, quando Sacramentum instituit. Lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 28.
Many Northern Countries are destitute of Wine, and therefore one kind is to be
used for Concord, and Vniformity-sake. Will you be answered from your selves?
Aquinas, making the same Objection of want of Wine, and Wheare in foreign
Countries, Licet non in omnibus terris nascitur vinum aut triticum, tamen ad
omnes terras facile deferri potest, quantum sufficit ad usum hujus Sacramenti.
Aquin part. 3 qu. 74. Art. 1. Sufficit quod Balsamum potest ad omnia loca
transfetri, Idem. ibid. qu. 72. Art. 2.
Resolves that Notwithstanding, Wheat and Wine may be transported easily to
all parts. Accordingly does he resolve of the want of Balsame, used in your
Consecration, and yet it is far more scarce than Northern Country almost can
you name, that has not abundance of Wine for many persons, even unto riot, and
can they not as well have it in moderate measure, for a sacred Rite?

But what talk you of Uniformity and Concord, in this Case of Alteration,
(which are your two next Pretenses) wherein notwithstanding the Church of Rome
is dissenting from the Greek, and all other Christian Churches in the World?
Or if this were a necessary Cause, why did not your Church allow the use of
Both kinds to the Church of Bohemia, but twice raised a fierce Bis Princepes
Germaniae ad Bohemos (quod Communionem sub utraque specie communicarent)
debellandos arma sump^^cre, hortatore Cardinale Iuliano S. Angeli, Apostolicae
sedis Legato doctissimo paritet et rerum gerendarum prudentia ornatissimo viro:
quanquam bellum non satis feliciter successit. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 36
page 284.
Salmeron seems to be full sorry; marry it was, because that war had not
his wished success. Is their Concord in Hostility? Again, because you
(thirdly) pretend Uniformity also, why then do your consecrating Priests only
receive both kinds sacramentally, and all the other Priests in Communicating
participate but in one? or how is it that you allow a privilege to See a little
after at (p.)
Popes, Cardinals, Monks, and noble Personages, to receive in both kinds, and
deny this liberty to Others? Is there likewise Uniformity in Disparity?

Multi sunt abstemi^, qui vinum non ferunt. Bellar. lib. 4. de Eucharist. cap.
28.
Abstemious, and have an Antipathy against Wine, and some sickly persons also
can hardly receive without Irreverent casting it up again. If the particular
reason, which Dicendum, quod vinum modice sumptum non potest multum aegrotanti
nocere. Aquinas part. 3. quaest. 74. Art. 1.
Aquinas gives, saying, That Wine moderately taken of such can do no hurt, may
not satisfy, yet this being also a Cause accidental, and extraordinary, you
ought to be regulated by this general Rule, That extraordinary Cases ought not
to justle out ordinary Laws and Customs. For, that Command of Christ to his
Apostles, Go preach to every Creature, stood good in the general, albeit many
men happened Peter requires of every Christian of sit years, that he be
prepared to give an answer of his faith to every one that asks; which precept
was not therefore alterable, because of multitudes of many that were dumb.
Finally, to close up with you, he that by the rule of Hospitality is to cheer
up his guests, does not prescribe that, because some men's stomachs are
queasie, and not able to endure Wine, or else some meats, therefore all others
should be kept fasting from all meats and Drinks: and the Eucharist (you
know) is called by Saint Paul, The Supper of the Lord, and by ancient Fathers,
an holy See above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. in the Ch^ll.
Banquet.

The second kind of Romish Pretenses is of Such, which might have been common
to other Churches.

The other Causes abovementioned were common to the primitive Church of
Christ, wherein the use of Both kinds was (notwithstanding) preserved and
continued; except that you will say, no Northern Nations were Christians in
those stomachs of Christians were disaffected to wine, in loathing it, etc.
But two other Pretenses you have, which you think to be of more
speciall-force, to forbid the use of this Sacrament in Both kinds; One is
Because (says your Primo movet Ecclesiam consuetudo recepta, and approbata
consensu Gentium and Populorum. Bellar. quo sup.
Cardinal) such is the now-received and approved Custom of Nations and
People. So he. But first to argue, that your Church did therefore forbid the
use of both kinds, because she had approved the contrary Custom, is a mere
Nugacitie and Tautologie; and as much as to say, She would forbid it, because
she would forbid it. Secondly, saying, that the Use of but One kind had
indefinitely the Consent of Nations and People, is a flat falsity, because (as
has been confessed) The Greek Church (not to mention AEthiopians,
Egyptians, Armenians, and Others) have always held the Contrary Custom.
Lastly, to justify your Churches Innovation, in consenting to the humor of
People of latter times, what can you censure it less than a gross and absurd
Indulgence?

The other Motive, which the Mover Eccleclesiam, and quidem vehementer
Irreverentia and profanationes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix evitari possent in
tanta fidelium multitudine, si omnibus daretur sub utraque specie. Bellar. ibid.
Cardinal calls a Vehement presumption, and which all your Objectors most
earnestly Irreverence, lest the blood might be spilt, especially in such a
multitude of faithful Communicants: and also lest any particle of the Host
fall to the ground, says Master Liturg. tract. 4.. 6.
Brerely.

We have but four Answers to this mighty Objection. First, that this was not
held a Reason to Christ, or his Apostles, or to the Church of Christ, for many
ages, when notwithstanding the multitudes of Communicants were innumerable.
Secondly, that The Casual spilling of the Cup, says your Vtriusque speciei
usum illicitum esse atque sacrilegium aitfalsum est, quod usui Calicis annexum
sic peccatum vel sacrilegium, propter periculum effusionis: nam si haberet
adjunctum peccatum, neque Christus Dominus, neque Apostoli in primitiva
Ecclesia, nec Orientales modo, nec Occidentales ante Conc. Constantiense, neque
denique Sacerdotes celebrantes eo uterentur ritu. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract.
37.. Deinde p 308.
Salmeron, is no sin, else would not Christ have instituted the use of the
Cup: nor So he. We might add, by the same reason should people be forbid the
other part also, lest (as your Priest said) any particle thereof should fall to
the ground. Furthermore, for the avoiding of Spilling, you (as your Cardinal
Alan Cernuntur hodie ex antiquitate relictae quaedam fistulae argenteae and
aureae velut canales, calicibus vetustioribus adjunctae, ut per eas sine
effusione hauriri posset sanguis e calice, quarum in Ordinario Romans sit mentio.
Et adhuc in Missa solenni Pontificis adhibentur, ubi ministri Cardinales, aut
illustriores personae communicant sub utraque specie, posteriorem speciem
fistula haurie^tes: sed ista instrumenta non fuisse in usu apud plebem in
parochialibus Ecclesijs plane existimo, sed tantum in sacris Cardinalium,
Canonicorum, et Monachorum Conventibus. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch cap 47. p. 495.
relates) have provided Pipes of silver, which are used by Popes, Cardinals,
Monks, and some other Illustrious lay-Personages. Surely, there being no
respect of persons with God (as said Saint Peter) we think that he, who will
be Saint Peter's Successor should have Peter that lesson of Christ, of loving
the whole flock of Christ, as well Lambs as Sheep; not to provide Pipes or
Tunnels for himself alone, and his Grandes, for receiving this part of the
Sacrament, and to neglect all other Christians, albeit never so true members of
Christ. For this we all know, that 1. Cor. 11. Itaque fratres mei, cum
conveneritis, invicem expectate.] Dominus ex aequo Tibi and pauperi mensam
proprij corporis, and poculum sanguinis tradidit. Test Salmeron. les. Tom. 14.
Disp. 19. page 153.
Our Lord Christ prepared his table as well for the poor as the Rich, according
to the Apostles Doctrine, by your own construction, answerable to the Doctrine
of ancient Fathers. And that the Pretense of Reverence cannot be a sufficient
Reason of altering the ordinance of Christ, we may learn Reverence has often
been the Damme and Nourse of manifold Superstitions.

As for example, The Heretics called See. 9.
Discalceati, in pretense of more humility, thought that they ought to go
bare-foote. The Sea above Sect. 8. (g)
Encratitae, in pretense of more sanctity, abhorred marriage. The Aquarij solam
aquam apponendam asserebant, sobeietatis conservandae causa vinum vitantes.
Alsons. a Caflto cont. Id eres. Tit. Eucharistia, Har. 6.
Aquarij, in pretense of more sobriety, used water in this Sacrament. The
Manichees wanted not their pretense of not drinking wine in the Eucharist,
because they thought it was created by an evil Spirit. And yet were these
judged by Pope Gelasius to be Sacrilegious. *Hence was it that your Jesuit
demanded, Nic. Causin. Ies in his book called the Holy Court. page 539.
How was it possible (says he) that the Pulcheria, a woman? Yea, and what
greater defense had the Pharisees, for all their Superstitions, than that of
Reverence? whom notwithstanding Christ did pierce through with so many Vae's,
for annulling of the Precepts of God, by their Traditions, under the pretense
of religious Reverence and sanctity.

In brief. It was the opinion of Reverence that made Saint Peter to contradict
our Lords Command, when he said, Thou yet how dangerous it had been for Peter
to have persisted in opposition, the Reply of our Savior does declare: If I
wash not thy feet (faith Christ) thou have no part with me, etc. Upon which
Text Saint Discamus Christum, prout vult, venerari, honorato namque
jucundissimus est honor, non quem nos putamus; nam and eum Petrus honorare
putabat, cum sibi pedes eum lavare prohibuit: sed non erat honor, quem agebac,
sed contrarium Chrysostom. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Tom. 1.
Chrysostom reads unto you this Lecture. Let us therefore learn (says he)
to honor and reverence Christ, as he would, and not as we think meet. And
sure we are, that he would that same which he commanded, saying, [ Do this.]
Therefore our next Difference, between our defense and yours, is no other than
obedient Reverence, and irreverent, or rather irreligious Disobedience.

Si sic tanta esset degnitas Laicorum, circa sumptionem corporis Christi,
quanta Clericorum? Gerson. Tract. de utraque specie.
Greater dignity of Priests than of Laics; it is too fantastical for the
singularity; too harsh for the noveltie; and too graceless for the impiety
thereof: seeing that Christ, who gave his Body and Blood an equal price of
Redemption for all sorts, would have the Sacrament of his Body and Blood
equally administered to People, as to Priests; as you have heard the Fathers
themselves profess.

The Third kind of Romish Pretenses, which are more peculiar First, because
Movit Ecclesiam, ad hunc usum stabiliendum and lege firmandum, quod videret, ab
Haereticis, et ex errore oppugnari. Sacramentarij autem non credunt
Concomitantiam sanguinis Domini cum corpore in specie panis: unde etiam ij
Lutheranorum maxim urgent utramque speciem, qui cum Sacramentarijs rident
Concomita^^tiam. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 28.. Secundo.
Heretics (says Bellarmine, and meaning Protestants) do not believe
Concomitancie, that is to say, that the blood of Christ is received under the
form of bread: but for this Concomitancie the Church was moved to prescribe
the use of the Eucharist in one kind. So he. And this point of Concomitancse
is that which In his book dedicated to K. James.
Master Fisher, and In his Liturg. of the Mass page 396.
Master Brerely most labored for, or rather labored upon. And albeit your
Roman Maxim omnium ad convellendam eorum haeresin, qui negabant sub utraque
specie corpus Christi contineri. Catech. Romans par. 2. c. 4. nu. 50.
Catechism judges this the principal Cause of inducing your Church to
prefer one kind: yet we (whom you call Heretics) believe that the devout
Communicant, receiving Christ spiritually by faith, is thereby possessed of
whole Christ crucified, in the inward act of the Soul: and only deny, that the
Whole is received Sacramentally, in this outward act, under one only part of
this Sacrament, which is the present Question.

And in this we say no more than your Bishop Iansenius judged reasonable, who
has rightly argued, saying, Verum non facile apparet quomodo aperte exterior
illa sumptio dici possit bibitio: manducatio recte dicitur, quia sumitur
aliquid ibi per modum cibi: sed quomodo bibitio, cum nihil sumatur per modum
potus? non n. diceremus eum and manducare et bibere, qui panem tinctum vino
sumeret, quamvis sumat quod famem tollat et sitim. Proinde, secundum horum
sententiam videtur omnino dicendum -- cum dicitur manducare, and bibere, non
ratione actus exterioris, qui manducationis tantum speciem habet: sed ratione
actus interioris, nempe, ratione fidei. Iansen. Concord in Evang. page 457.
It does not easily appear how the outward receiving of Christ, under the
form of Bread, should he called Drinking, but only Eating, being received
after the manner of meats, as that is called Drinking only, which is received
after the manner of drink. Drinking therefore and Eating are distinguished by
Christ, in the outward Act. So he, even as your own Durand Rationale. lib. 4.
c. 54. Vna pars absque alia sumpta non est completum Sacramentum, cum panis
corpus significat, non potest sacramentaliter sumi sine altera specie.
before him had truly concluded, with whom Master See Book 2. Cap. 2. 4.
Brerely will bear a part.

Therefore your Concomitancie (if we respect the Sacramental Chimaera, and as
great a Solecisme as to say, that the Body and Bones of Christ are drunk, and
his Blood eaten: contrary to the Sacramental representation, in receiving
Bread and Wine, as has been proved.

Next, when we ask you, why only your Church will not reform and regulate
her Custom, according to the Institution of Christ, and the long practice of
the primitive Church? you answer plainly, and without Circumlocution, that the
Reason is, Lest that your Church might seem to have erred in her alteration if
the ancient Custom. And this your Secunda ratio, quia qui Concomitantiam
negant, ex alio pernitioso errore petunt utramque speciem: quia nimirum
existimant jure divino esse praeceptum; and propterea totam Ecclesiam longo
tempore in hac re turpiter enasse. Bellar. quo. sup.. Secundo.

Valentian use and urge as a necessary Reason, for confutation of Protestants,
who held the necessity of public Communion in Both kinds. Which Reason your
own Orator Gaspar Cardillo proclaimed as (in a manner) the sole cause of
continuing your degenerated use, Ego existimo, Patres, non solum nullam
legitimam causam esse, sed neque fingi posse, cur de consensu vestro Laici
calicem bibant: neque pati ullo modo velitis a more vestro quempiam decedere
latum unguem. -- Inprimis, quoniam Ecclesia illud praecepit, ut alteram tantum
speciem Laicis porrigamus, cut merito nobis obtemperandum est, quia nihil agit
sine magna ratione, neque in hujusmodi legibus ferendis errare potest. Denique
si latam legem nulla evidenti necessitate convellatis (Patres) suspicari multis
in mentem veniet, aut vos illam temere aulloque consilio tulisse olim
suscipisseque, aut susceptam cum ratione and servatam diutissime in Christiana
Republica, nulla vel causa vel ratione pro nihilo ducere, quo nihil sieri
potest gravirate vestra, aut hujus amplissimi ordinis majestate indignius.
G^spar Cardillo Villalpand. Orat. apud Act. Conc. Trid. page 219 221. 222.
Lest that the Church (says he) may seem to have erred. What can more savor
of an Heretical and Antichristian spirit, than this pretense does? For an
Heretic will not seem to have erred, and Antichrist will profess himself
one that cannot err: which Character of not personal erring was never assumed
of any particular Church, excepting only the latter Church of Rome.

Our Assumption. But the Church of Rome (which will seem that she cannot
possibly err, in her not administering the Cup unto Laickes) is known to have
erred 600. years together opinion of Necessity) unto Infants, as has been
plentifully See above Chap. 2. Sect. 11.
witnessed by eminent Doctors in your own Church. Hence therefore arises
another difference; between the profession of our Custom and yours, which is,
between Christ and Antichrist. All this while you do not perceive that your
opinion of Concomitancie will ruinate the foundation of your Doctrine of
Transubstantiation. But hereof In the third Book.
hereafter.


THe beginning of the Institution in Both kinds is known and acknowledged to
have been authorized by him, who is the (...) of the new Testament, even
Christ our Lord, by whom it was established and published among all his
Disciples, at his last Supper. But your Custom of only One kind, Nulla
praeceptorum vi, sed consensu quodam tacito tam populi quam Cleri sensim
irrepsit dicta consuetudo. Roffens. con Cap Babyl. Tract. de utraque Specie, f.

Episcopi propter varia effusionis sanguinis, aliaque pericula tacendo hanc

It came not in by any precept, but crept in by little and little, by the
abstinence of the people, and by the Tacit and silent consent of the Bishops.
So your Bishop Roffensis, and your Jesuit Costerus, and Friar Castro. This
confessed unknown manner of Alteration of this your Custom, as it does
utterly refute your common Objection, viz. That every Doctrine and Custom must
beejudged ancient and Catholic, the beginning whereof is not known; so does
it more especially put your Master Brerely to his blush, who durst make the
same Objection in this very One kind, to prove it to have been from the
beginning, because No first known beginning of our Catholic practice ( Liturg
Tract. 4.. 9. at the ead thereof.
says he) can be instanced. And yet behold here no certain beginning of this
Romish Custom; yet notwithstanding confessed to be an Alteration, different
from the Custom, which formerly for a thousand years was held a Catholic
Custom.

Was not the Church of Rome then a wise and a worthy Mistress of Churches, trow
you; to suffer her self to be guided by the humor of People in a matter of
this nature? what other difference can this make between our Custom and
yours, but that which is between divine Ordinance and popular negligence? or
as between a public Professor, and a Theevish Creeper? Heresy is certainly a
disease, but wore you what? the 2. Tim. 2. 15.
Apostle Cancer, or Gangrene, which is a disease Creeping by little and little,
from joint to joint, until it have eaten up the vital parts; such a Cancer
was this your Custom, if you shall stand to your own former Confessions.

Our last Comparison is between the Contrary Dispositions of Professors, one
in continuing, and distinguishing; a second in mixing; the third in rejecting
Both kinds. SECT. XII.
THe comparison, between the diverse Dispositions of Professors, none will be
more willing to show than your Jesuit Quod vero atrinet ad tempora, triplicem
in coetu Christiano statum, Nicolaus de Cusano Cardinalis expendit; ferventis
nimirum, calidae, and frigentis. Initio enim fuit Ecclesia ad fundendum pro
Christo sanguinem fervens, and tunc data est illi utraque species, ut sanguinem
Domini bibens, sanguinem suum pro illo libenter effunderet. -- In sequenti
statu Ecclesia fuit calida, licet non ita fervens, and tunc non dabatur bina
species, sed panis tantum sanguine infusus, ut ex quibusdam veterum Patrum
sententiis Concilijisque colligi potest. Tertius status est Ecclesiae frigentis
ac tepidae, and in ea tantum altera species, panis scilicet, sine infusione
sanguinis Laicis dispensatur, Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34.. Quod vero. page
277.
Salmeron, who will have you, out of Cardinal Cusanus, to observe three States
of the Church. The first is in her Fervencie; The second in her Warmnes; The
third in her Coldness. In the first state of her Fervencie, when the Christians
affected Martyrdom for the Gospel of Christ, then did the People (says he)
communicate in both kinds. In the second state, which was in her Warmnes
(though not so hot boiling as before) They then used and so were made jointly
partakers of Both, in one. But in the third state of Coldness, the people were
allowed the Sacrament only under one kind. So he.

CHALLENGE,
IF now Truth may be judged by the different Dispositions of Professors, then
may this former Confession witness for us, that there is as much difference
between the Primitive and the now Romish Custom, as there is between lively
Fervencie, and senseless Numnes and Coldness, that is to say, Godly zeal, and
Godless Indevotion and Negligence: yet a Negligence not only approved (which
is impious) but (that which is the height of Impiety) even applauded also by
your Priests, among whom the Vt nobis Iocupletissi^i testes, atque omni
exceptione majores retulerunt, in Germania qui eo loci per omnia obediunt
Romany Pontificibus, non solum (Reverendi Patres) Calicem vitae non cupiunt,
aut petere audent, etc. Gasp. Card Villalp. apud Act. Council. Trident. page
222.. Accedit.
abovesaid Gasper Cardillo in the Council of Trent, with exultation told
their Father-hoods (as being a matter of great joy) that they who are under the
Jurisdiction of the Church of Rome, in Germany, dare not so much as desire the
Cup of life.

A GENERAL CHALLENGE, Concerning this last Transgression of Christ his Mass.
IN this we are to make an open discovery of the odious Uncharitableness, the
intolerable Arrogancy, the vile Perjury, the extreme Madness, and Folly,
together with a note of plain Blasphemy of your Romish Disputers, in Defense
of this one Roman Custom of forbidding the Cup to faithful Communicants. For
what Vn^^aritablenesse can be more odious, than when they cannot but confess,
that there is more spiritual grace in the receiving of the Communion in Both
kinds, do notwithstanding boast, even in the open Council of Trent, of some of
Rome, do not only ( See the last testimony above.
their own words) not desire the Cup of life, but also dare not so much as
desire it. Which Vaunt, we think, besides the Impiety thereof, infers a
note of profane Tyranny.

Secondly, when we compare these Fathers of Trent, with the Fathers of most
primitive Antiquity, they answer, Tertio loco objiciunt Ecclesiae sapientiam,
antiquitatem, atque potestatem; atque potestatem; aiunt enim, Ecclesiam
primitivam, quae antiquior and scientia atque vitae sanctitate praestantior
erat, utraque specie usam fuisse: nostra igitur illam imitari debet, praesertim
eum eandem atque illa habet potestatem in ejusmodi legibus positivis sive
abrogandis sive dispensandis. Respondemus, non esse dubium quin Ecclesia
primitiva nostrae majore charitate, ac proinde uberiori sapientia
praecelluerit, nihilominus tamen interdum contingit minus sapientem in aliquo
malius sapere, quam alium absolute sapientiorem. Saepe etiam accidit, minus
perfectum hominem vitare aliquem errorem, quem melior non vitat. Salmcron. Ies.
Tom. 9. Tractat. 38.. Tertio loco. page 320.
Although the primitive Church (say they) did exceed our's in Zeal, Wisdom,
and Charity, nevertheless, it falls out sometimes, that the wiser may in
some things be less wise than another. Which answer, ancient Fathers? and
indeed (as the saying is) To put upon them the Fool. The like answer two of
their Jesuits made to the Practice of the Apostles, saying that your Church,
having the same spirit, has the same power to alter the Custom: whereas we
have proved, that the ground which the Apostles lay, for their Custom, was the
Institution of Christ. But that which the Roman Church allegeth, is merely a
Pretense of Plenitude of her own Authority; It is impossible therefore that in
so great a Contradiction there should be the same Spirit. And can there be a
more intolerable Arrogancy than is this, which this Roman bewrays in both
these?

Thirdly, upon the Consideration of this their Contempt of Apostolical and
primitive Antiquity, in this Cause, we find that your Romish Priests are to
be condemned of manifest perjurie also; for in the Form of Oath, for the
profession of the Romish Faith, every Priest and Ecclesiasticke is sworn Forma
Iuramenti, per Bullam Pij quarti. Apostolicas and Ecclesiasticas Traditiones
admitto, -- Ego spondeo, and juro, etc.
To admit of all Apostolical and Ecclesiastical Traditions; as also to hold
what the Caetera omnia a Concilio Tridentino declarata and confirmata
firmissime teneo. Ibid. Romanam Ecclesiam Magistram esse Ecclesiarum credo, etc.
Council of Trent has decreed. But this Custom of administration of Both
kinds, as has been acknowledged, was an Apostolical Custom, and from them
also remained in an Rome, notwithstanding, in her Council of Trent, (whereunto
likewise you are sworn) has altered and perverted: which does evidently
involve your Priests, and Jesuits in a notorious and unavoydable Perjurie.

Fourthly, As for the note of Foolishness, what more mad folly can there be
seen in any, than to take upon them a serious Defense of a Custom, for
satisfaction of all others, and yet to be so unsatisfied among themselves? so
that both the Objections Antiquity and Generality of the particular Roman
Church, for less than three hundred years, and to prefer it before the
confessed Universal primitive Custom of above the Compass of a Thousand
years continuance before the other.

Fifthly, the last is the note of Blasphemy; for this name the contempt of
Christ his last Will and Testament must needs deserve; and what greater
contempt can there be, than contrary to Christ his [ Do this] (concerning Both
kinds) to profess that Sacrilegious dismembring of the holy Sacrament, which
Gelasius the Pope himself had anciently condemned? or if this be not
Blasphemous enough, then, supposing that Christ indeed had commanded
Consecration in Both kinds, upon divine right, yet notwithstanding to hold it
very probable (as says your Jesuit Licet Gabriel, and quidam alij sentiunt
divini juris esse, ut Sacerdos in utraque specie sacrificet, nihilominus tamen
opinantur authoritate Romani Pontificis fieri posse, ut in una tantum specie
sacrificet, viz. in consecratione panis sine vino, quia putant multa esse juris
divini, quae remittere and relaxare queat Pontifex ob publicam aliquam and
gravem necessitatem: ut videmus votum, jus-j^randum, Matrimonium ratum, non
consummatum, authoritate Pontificis relaxari and dissolvi. Et ita in hac
questione prima puto probabilius and verius esse (ut dixi) juris esse divini,
ut Sacerdos in duplici specie sacrificet. Et nihilominus existimo valde
probabile, authoritate Pontificia, ob publicam and urgentem necessitatem,
praedictum jus divinum relaxari posse. Sed quia nunquam est relaxatum, ego
consilium darem ut nunquam relaxaretur. Azorius Jesuit. Tom. 1. Iustit. Moral.
lib. 10. cap. 19.. Tertium. page 857.
Azorius) that the authority of the Pope may dispense therewith. But because
Divine right was never yet dispensed with, I (says he) would give my Council
that it never may be. O Jesuit! thus to deal with Christ his Command. If he
or any other Jesuit had made as bold with the Pope *Extravag. de verbo
signific. Tit. 14. Cap. 4. G^ossa. Dominum Deum nostrum Papam.
insituled in your public Gloss, OUR LORD GOD THE POPE) as this does with
Christ himself, saying unto him; Any of your decrees (holy Doing so; yet
doubtless, would he reward him with a welcome into the office of his holy
Inquisition, for his judgment, to think it lawful so to do: namely, to leave
it to the discretion of every Jesuit, to dispense with his Papal Decrees. And
notwithstanding the Jesuits [ Suppose] we may depose, that your Romish
license, for but One kind,

*And this the Jesuits themselves do think, See above in this Chapter, Sect.
3. in the Chal. 1.
which may appear in that Conclusion, which your Jesuit Vasquez gave
concerning Christ Consecrating the Eucharist but in one kind before his
Disciples at Emmaus. Where he resolved, that This was an act of Christ's Supreme
authority, not imitable by the Church. And that the necessary Obligation of
Consecrating in Both kinds is not dispensable by the Pope. So he. Wherefore
the Act of Christ being equally an Administration in only Supreme Excellency,
and authority of Christ; the determination and Resolution must necessarily be
this. That the Administration and Consecration in only One kind are equally
Indispensable.

We are already wearied with citing of the manifold, vilde, odious, and
irreligious Positions of your Disputers and Proctors, for this your Cause; yet
one Pretense more may not be pretermitted, least we might seem to contemn the
wit and zeal of your Jesuit Salmeron, against the use of this Sacrament The
use of Both kinds (says Dispensandus non est utriusque speciei usus Hereticis,
quia non sunt danda sancta Canibus: nec Catholicis, quia debent distingui ab
Haereticis, qui communicant sub duabus. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 37. 5.
His potius. page 411.
he) is not to be allowed to Catholics, because they must be distinguished
from Heretics: nor to Heretics, because holy things are not to be given unto
Dogs. Now blessed be God! that we are esteemed as Heretics and Dogs, to be
distinguished from them, in this and other so many commanded Acts, wherein they
have distinguished themselves from all Primitive Fathers, from the Apostles of
Christ, and from Christ himself.

An Appeal unto the ancient Popes and Church of Rome, against the late Romish
Popes and Church; in Confutation of their former Transgressions of Christ his
Institution. SECT. XIV.
THe ancient Popes and Church of Rome were (as all the world will say) in
authority of Command, and in sincerity of judgment equal, and in integrity of
life Superior unto the latter Popes of Rome and Church thereof; yet the ancient
held it as a matter of Conscience for the Church, in all such Cases belonging
to the Eucharist, to be conformable to the Precept P. Calixtus. See above Chap.
2. Sect. 9.
Pope Calixtus (Anno Christi, 218.) requiring all persons present at the Mass
to Communicate. For which reason it was (we think) that Pope P. Greg. Ibid.
at (^)
Gregory (Anno 60^.) commanded every one present at the Mass, and not
purposing to Communicate, to Depart. There is an History related by AEneas
Sylvius (after, Pope Pius the Second) which shows the reason why another See
above Chap 2. Sect 7. Chall. 6. (21)
Pope of Rome, with his Consistory, yielded a liberty to the Sclavonians, to
have Divine Service in their National Language, and reports that it was
through the Let every tongue praise the Lord. P. Julius. See above Chap. 3.
Sect. 3.
Pope Julius (Anno 336.) was much busied in repressing the Sopping of bread in
the Chalice, and other like abuses of the Sacrament in his time: and the
reason, which he gave, was this; Because (quoth he) these Customs are not
agreeable to Evangelicall and Apostolical Doctrine: and our Church of Rome
does the same. Where he adds, concerning the manner of Communicating, Ibid.
We read (says he) that both the Bread and Cup were distinctly and
severally delivered. As if he had meant, with the same breath, to have confuted
your Romish Transgression in distributing to the people the Sacrament, but in
one of Both. And who can say but that Gregory and Leo, both Popes, See above
Chap. 3. Sect. 5.
observing the same use of Christ, had the same Resolution? Sure we are that
Pope P. Gelasius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 3. (r.)
Gelasius (Anno 404) called the Abuse, in dismembring of this Sacrament, by
receiving but in One kind, A Grand Sacrilege.

We read of a Council held at Toledo in Spain, under Pope Sergius, styled
Synod. Tolet. 16. -- Conc. Generale, sub Sergio Papa Baron. ad An. 693. This
Council, cap 6 says. Quontam quida^ non panes mundos atque integros, sed
crussul^m and particulam offerunt -- quod nequaquam in sacrae authoritatis
historia gestum perpenditur; ubi legitur Christum benedixisse and dedisse
panem, etc Apud B^nium, Tom 3. And this being, by Baroni^^, a General Council,
could not conclude without the Popes consent, in your judgments.
General (Anno 69^.) reproving those Priests who offered Bread in crusts and
lumps. But with what reason were they reprehended? Because (says the Council)
that fashion is not found in the Sacred story of the Evangelists. All those
ancient Popes, who held the Example of Christ, in his Institution and
Apostolical Customs, to be necessary Directions of Christ his Church in such
points, concerning the ministration of this Sacrament, being so utterly
repugnant to your now Romish

Salmeron the Jesuit gives you) it will concern both You and Us (as we will
avoid the brand of Heresy) to search exactly into the true sense of these
words of Christ; especially seeing we are herein to deal with the Inscription
of the Seal of our Lord JESUS, even the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. In
the which Disquisition, besides the Authority of Ancient Fathers, we shall
insist much upon the Ingenuity of your own Romish Authors.

And what Necessity there is to enquire into the true sense of these words,
will best appear in the after-examination of the diverse See hereafter Book,

Proper and literal sense, then we are to yield to you the whole Cause: But if
it be necessarily Figurative, then the ground of all these your Doctrines being
but sandy, the whole Structure and Fabric, which you erect thereupon, must
needs ruin and vanish. But yet know withal, that we do not so maintain a
Figurative sense of Christ his Speech, concerning his Body, as to exclude the
Truth of his Body, or yet the truly-Receiving thereof, as the Third and Fourth
Books

That a Figurative sense of Christ his speech [THIS IS MY BODY, etc.] is
evinced out of the words themselves; from the Principles of the Romish
Schools. SECT. I.


When we shall fully understand by your Church (which Conc. Trident. Sess. 13.
cap. 1. Verba illa a Christo commemorata, and a Divo Paulo repetita, propriam

holds a Proper and literal Signification) what the Pronoune [THIS] does
demonstrate, then shall we truly infer an infallible proof of our
figurative sense.

All Opinions concerning the Thing, which the word [THIS] in the diverse
opinions of Authors, points at, may be reduced to Three heads, ( * Vasquez
in 3. Thom. Disp. 201. cap. 1. Omnes opiniones ad tres tantum calsses reduci

as you likewise confess:) namely, to signify either This Bread, or This Body
of Christ, or else some Third thing different from them both. Tell you us,
first, what you hold to be the opinion of Protestants? Lutherans and all
Calvinists (says your Lutherani and omnes Calvinistae pronomen [Hoc] propane
positum esse dicunt, quia panem Christus in manu acceperat, and di^it [Hoc est
corpus meum.] Ma^don. Ies. in Matthew. 26.. H^c omnes. -- Lutherus in verba

Jesuit) think that the Pronoune [THIS] points out Bread. But your Roman
Doctors are at odds among themselves, and divided into two principal
Opinions. Some of them refer the word [THIS] to Christ's Body, Some to a
Third thing, which you call Individuum vagum. In the first place we are to
confute both these your Expositions; and after to confirm our own.

That the first Exposition of Romish Doctors, of great learning, (referring the
word [THIS] properly to Christ his Body) perverteth the sense of Christ his
Speech; by the Confessions of Romish Doctors. SECT. II.
Diverse of your Romish Divines of special note, as well Jesuits as Others,
interpret the word [ This] to note the Body of Christ, as it is present in this
Sacrament, at the pronunciation of the last syllable of this speech [ Hoc est

CHALLENGE.
ARe not these Opinators in number many; in name, for the most part, of great
esteem; their Assertion, in their own opinion, full of assurance; and
delivered to their Hearers, as the only Catholic Resolution? And yet behold
One, whose name alone has obtained an Authority equivalent to almost all
theirs, your Cardinal Argumentum eorum, qui volunt Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrate
corpus, est absurdum, quod in hujusmodi propositionibus, quae significant id
quod tunc fit cum dicitur, Pronomina demonstrativa non demonstrare quod est,
sed quod erit. Et ponunt Exempla, ut si quis dum pingit lineam, aut circulum,
dicat, Haec est linea, hic est Ciculus. Quomodo etiam exponi debet Pronomen in
illis verbis Domini, Ioh. 25. Hoc est praeceptum meum -- Haec explicatio non
videtur satisfacere, propter duas causas. Primo, quia etsi Pronomen
demo^strativum demonstret rem futuram, quando nihil est praesens, quod
demonstretur (ut in exemplis allatis) tamen si quis digito aliquid ostendat,
dum pronomen essert, valde absurdum videtur dicere, pronomine illo non
demo^strari rem praesentem. Atqui Dominus accepit panem, and illum porrigens,
ait, [Accipite, Edite, H. E. C. M.] Videtur igitur demonstrasse panem. Neque
obstat quod propositio non significat, nisi in fine totius prolationis: Nam
etsi ita est de propositione, quae est ratio quaedam, tamen Demonstrativa
Pronomina mox indicant certum aliquid, etiam antequam sequantur caeterae voces.

Bellarmine, who, speaking of the same opinion of referring the word [ This] to
the Body of Christ, does in flat terms call it ABSVRD. But not without good
and solid reason, and that according to the Principles of Romish Schools; to
wit, because before the last syllable of the last word [ Me^um] be pronounced,
the Body of Christ is not yet and the word [ This] cannot demonstrate a thing
Absent, and therefore can it not be said, This is my Body. * With your
Cardinal two other Jesuits take part, ingenuously confessing, that Vasquez in

praesens. And Jacob. Gordonus Scotus. Ies. lib. controvers. controver. 4. cap.

est corpus meum: nam pronomen, Hoc, non potest non demonstrare rem praesentem.
The Pronounce [Hoc, This] in Christ's words, does necessarily demonstrate a
thing present.

A Reason pregnant enough in it self, and ratified by your public Roman

Heretical, and So he, who with Others, if they were of fit years, might be
thought to deserve the rod, for forgetting their General Catechism, and for
defending an Exposition, which even in common sense may be pronounced, in your
Cardinals own phrase, very Absurd; * And that the Body of Christ is not the
Thing present, that can be demonstrated, your Pope Innocent proves: Because

Absurd therefore must your former. Interpretation needs be, * else show us, if
you can, but

The Similitudes which are urged, to illustrate your former Practical and
operative sense, are of these kinds; to wit, Even as if one (say Bellar. See
before at let. ( k)
They) in drawing a Line, or a Circle, should say in the making thereof, This
is a Line, or this is a Circle: or as if the Smith (say Haec locutio [Hoc est
corpus meum] habet virtutem factivam conversionis panis in Corpus Christi, ut
a^ Thomas. -- Pro simili, quod rudi intellectui satisfacere valeat, dari
potest, ut si Faber accepto ferro clavum subito motu formans, dicat, Hic est

etc.
Others) in making of a Nail, should say, This is a Nail; So by Christ his
saying [ This is my Body] it was made presently the Body of Christ, at the very
pronuntiation of the last word of this Sentence, [ This is my Body.] But most
conceitedly your Jesuit Malloune, and that not without scurrility; Master
Malloune in his late Reply, page 105. This is a K^tle for my wife, etc. * Egid.
Conineks Ies. de Sacram. qu. 75. Art. 1. n. 36 Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrat^d quod

illud in quo propositio sit sufficienter pronuntiata -- quod est commune non
solum omnibus Propositionibus practicis, quae significant quod efficient: sed
ijs etiam quae significant aliquid fieri, faciemus diversas figuras. Proprie
dicitur [Hic est Girculus] dum tamen non est haec sigura dum dico [Hic.]
As a Tailor making a Kirtle, and saying (we shall change only his last word)
This is a Kirtle for my Mistress CONCVBINA. So they.

CHALLENGE.
THese kind of Subtilties are frequent in the mouths of most Romish Priests,
as often as they are compelled to show what is demonstrated by the Pronou^e,
This. But that these your Similitudes of making Circles, Lines, and Nails, are
no better than Iugling, and Gypsie-trickes of fast or loose, and fond devises
forged in the brains of idle Sophisters, and uttered by your Circulary
Priests, your own Authors are ready to manifest: for in these Examples of the
Painters touching a Line, or Circle (as your Bellar. See before at the letter
(k)
Bellarmine shows) making and saying, This is a Circle; Is no true
Proposition, until the Circle be made. And then it is a figurative speech and
not a proper, using the present Tense, Is, for the future, Shall be. So he. In
like manner your Jesuit Profecto propesitio non est vera, nisi postquam factus
est Cuculus: Sed oration accipitur pro vera, quia id, quod futurum est,
accipitur pro jam facto, per Tropum, non juxta Proprietatem fermo nis: in quem
sensum Christus plerunque praesens pro futuro usurpavit: ut Matthew 26. Apud te
facio Pascha cum Discipulis meis, id est, confestim facio Pas^lta. Salmeron.
Jesuit. Tom. 9. Traclat. 13. Secunda. -- Si [Est] proprie accipiatur, pro
existere, durum est ut uniat subjectum cum praedicato pro futuro tempore, quia
falsa esset propositio, non solum in orationibus speculativis, and
significativis, sed etiam in practicis and factivis: ut si quis volens facere
Circulum, rogatus quid est Hoc? respondeatque, Hic est Circulus, Profesio
propositio non est statim vera, etc. Salmer. Ibid. page 83.
Salmeron affirms with a PROFECTO and full asseveration, that the speech of
him, who, in drawing a Circle, does say, This is a Circle, cannot without a
Trope or Figure, be judged true. So he.

And furthermore, who knows not that every Operative speech does signify not
the Being of a thing; but the Making Painter be so nimble, in drawing a Circle,
that his hand may go before his tongue; yet when the Operative virtue
consists not in working, by the agility of the hand, but in the orderly
pronouncing of the words of a speech with the tongue, so that the Truth thereof
depends upon the utterance of the last syllable; it is impossible but the
Priest, in uttering distinctly these words, [ Hoc est corpus meum,] must say,
This is, before he come to the last syllable of Me^um: and consequently in his
sense notify This to be Christ's Body, before (according to his own
judgment) the Body of Christ can have there any being at all.

By this is discovered the notable Vertigo and dizzinesse of Maldonate; He, to
prove that the Pronoune, This, does relate to Christ's Body, stands upon the
like Operative speculation; God (says Quum Deus ex limo terrae hominem finxit
tecte vereque dicere potuiller, sumpto in manus luno, Hic est Homo. Et cum ex
costa mulierem fabricavit, sumpta costa dicere potait, Haec est Mulier; quamvis
cum pronunciasset Pronomen [Haec] nondum fuisset mulier, ac significasset cum
ita locutus fuisset, limum non esse hominem, and costam mulierem; sed limum in
hominem, costam in mulierem converti. Sic cum Christus dicit, [Hoc est corpus
meum,] significat panem mucari in corpus suum. Quemadmodum si in Cana Galileae,
cum aquam in vinum, etc. Maldon. Jesuit. in Matthew. 26. Ita cum Christus dicit,
accepto pane [Hoc est corpus meum] quamvis illud corpus nondum ille esset, sed
futurum erat, illud eo pronomine demonstrat, nee significat panem, quem
acceperat, esse corpus suum, sed mutari in corpus suum. Idem in Matthew. 26. page
635.
he) in creating man of the slime of the earth, might have truly said thereof,
This is man: Or in framing Woman of the Rib of man, might have rightly said,
This is Woman: or Christ in working his miracle in Cana of Galilee, might have
said, (showing the water) This is Wine. So he. When, notwithstanding, he is
enforced in every one to alter the Verb, Is, thus; Slime is changed into man:
Rib is converted into Woman: Water is made Wine, as he himself confesses;
expounding This is my Body] thus, Not that it was then his Body (says he)
which as yet it was not, but was about to be: nor that he signified the Bread
to be his Body, but to be changed into his Body. So he. As if any thing could
be said properly to be that, which as yet it Is not. * No, and therefore your
Jesuit Gordon Gordonus Scotus Ies. Controvers. 4. cap 3. number. 15. [ Hoc]
demonstrat corpus futurum. And your Angles
says directly The Pronoune [THIS] demonstrateth the Body, which is about to
be. As much as to say, This [Is] shall be. Another of your own Divines will tell
you that Si [Hoc] demonstrat corpus sub ratione corporis, Propositio
speculativa esset, non Practica. Ies. Angles flor. Theol. quaest. Art. 10.
Concl. 4. Which was also the Argument of Bellarmine. See above at the letter (
k.)
If the Pronoune [THIS] demonstrate Christ's Body, then cannot the speech of
Christ be practical (that is) to effectuate that which and this will mar
your doctrine of Transubstantiation quite. * Hitherto of your first
Interpretation.

That the second Romish Exposition, referring the Pronoune [THIS] to
demonstrate a Third thing, called Individuum vagum, or Indeterminate
A Third thing, differing both from Bread and the Body of Christ, which Romish
Sophisters have lately invented, is that which they call Individuum vagum; by
which is meant, a substance confusedly taken; as when one (to use your own
example) having an Herb in his hand shall say, This herb grows in my
garden: in which speech the word, Herb, which is demonstrated by the Pronoune,
This, is not taken determinately, for that singular Herb in his hand, (for
that does not now grow in his garden) but is taken vage and confusedly, for the
common Species, nature, or kind of that herb. And this opinion is defended by
Sententia haec est, Pronomine illo designari aliquid commune Substantiae panis
and corporis Christi; Commune (inquam) non secundum Rem, (illud enim nullum
esse potest) sed secundum rationem seu denominationem, viz. sub ratione
contenti, sub his accidentibus continetur corpus meum. Ita Guitmandus ( where
he reckons up 15 other School men:) ubi Pronomen [Hoc] substantive sumitur, and
demonstrat in confuso Ens, sive substantiam contentam sub illis speciebus -- ut
cum quis dicat, Haec herba nascitur in horto meo: illud Pronomen [Haec] non
significat hanc numero herbam, sed herbam huic similem Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. in
Thom. Disput. 58.. 7. page 755. Secundum rationem Substantiae tum communem tum
Individuam vagam. Greg. de Valent. lib. 1. de Praesent. corp. Christi. cap. 9..

efficitur in hoc Sacramento ut corpus Christi sit corpus Christi, quia ita
semper fuit, nec ut panis sit corpus Christi, id enim fieri nequit, sed
efficitur, ut sub speciebus illis sit corpus Christi, sub quibus antea erat
panis: [Hoc] non demonstrat panem, vel corpus, sed contentum sub speciebus.

learned Archbishop of Caesae. sive Christopherus de Capite fontium. var. Tract.
Demonstrando corpus in genere, nescio quid -- dictum velis, cum non Individua

duarum tantum substantiarum, quae demonstrari hic queant, meminerit, viz.
Panis, and Corporis, nescio cur fingunt Tertiam aliquam, quae nec panis sit,

Ibid. page 17. Solam illam substantiam fingularem demonstrabat, quae erat in

Archbishop of Caesarea, and your Jesuit Vulgata opinio est, illud Pronomen

probabilis esse, quia etsi vocabula solent aliquando habere vagam and
indefinitam significationem, tamen aliud est loqui de significatione verbi,
aliud de acceptione, quam Dialectici vocant suppositionem. Illa quae dicuntur
Individua vaga significationem habent vagam, and indeterminatam, sed
suppositionem habent semper certam, and determinatam: nam etsi hoc Pronomen
[Hic, haec, hoc,] quantum in se est, non magis significat hunc hominem, quam
illum, tamen cum ponitur in propositione (ut hic homo disputat) non potest
accipi nisi determinate pro hoc homine. Ergo necesse est ut illud Pronomen
[Hoc] accipiatur determinate, aut pro pane, aut pro corpore Christi -- Nulla
res potest esse nisi determinate aut haec aut illa; Ergo non possunt haec
Pronomina, si substantive accipiantur, nisi pro hac vel illa re determinata

potest ullo modo sensui demonstrari, sed intellectui. Quidam putant substantive

praedicatur.
Vasquez will take part; and your Cardinal Et Cajetan Opuse. Non hoc corpus
meum, est corpus meum: quia sic corpus Christi converteretur in corpus Christi.
Cajetan with him. * 1. Because whenever the Pronoune [This] is used in
Speech, as, This man disputes, it is always in proper sense, as determinatly
taken. 2. Christ spoke of that which was in his hand, but that was no vagrant,
but a singular determinate Substance. And it is gross, to say a man holds a
confused substance in his hand. Which seemed to your Mr. Harding in his answer
to the 24. Article, saying, Learn you what they mean, and if their meaning
be naugh, handle you them as you list; you shall not offend us any whit.
Master Harding so uncouth and fond an opinion, that he utterly refuses to
defend the Authors

This, and much more have they written to the discovering and discarding of
this idle figment, wishing furthermore that the Defendants of this opinion, of
Individuum vagum, may return to their wits again, and cease to offer such
violence to this holy Scripture [ This is my Body.] So they. And worthily, for
these two words, Individuum, and Vagum, spoken of HOC, be terms as
Contradictory, as to call the same thing, singular-common, or
determinate-confused. As for example, Quidam home, A certain man, is in Logike
Individuum vagum; A certain man went from Jerusalem to Hieriche, etc. None of
the Disciples hearing this, could thereupon point him out, saying; This man: or
know thereby who, or what he was.

We, for further manifestation of your Absurdity in this point, will instance
in your own Example, for your Individuum vagum, of the Herb, which a man
holds in his hand, saying, This herb grows in my Garden, how can you say
it is true in the proper sense? for if you take it determinately, the same
Herb numero is not in the man's garden, because it is in Hoc Individuum
determinatum. And if you speak of it in a confused Notion, no Abstract Notion
can be held in a man's hand, it being the function of the brain, and not of
the hand, to apprehend mental Notions, or Generals; and so it is not
Individuum at all.

But the Text says of Christ his hand, [ He took bread, etc.] THIS, which
Christ, in so saying, pointed out with his finger, says your [Ho^ est corpus
meum.] Hoc quod Christus digito demonstrabat, cum illa verba protulit. Sand. de
visibil. Monarch. lib. 7. ad Ann. 1547.
Sanders; but a man will have much ado to point out an Individuum vagum (such
as is an invisible, or a confused Notion) with a visible finger. We would now
conclude in the Petrus Picherellus de Missa. cap 3.
Individui vagi commentum Authori Scoto (...) relinquo; but that something else
is to be added.

Another may be your Cardinal his own Assertion, which he once made as a
snare to catch himself in; for in your Cum ante Consecrationem dicimus in
Liturgia [suscipe sancte Pater hanc immaculatam hostiam] certe Pronomen [Hanc]
demonstrat ad sensus id quod tunc manibus ^enemus, id autem est panis. Bellar.
lib. 1. de Missa c. 27.. Prima proposito.
Romish Mass, the Priest having the Host in his hand, prays thus; Receive,
holy father, this immaculate Host. If you shall ask him what, in this prayer,
the Pronoune: This does demonstrate, he tells you readily and asseverantly
saying; Certainly it demonstrateth unto sense that which the Priest has in his
hand, which is Bread. So he. Now why there should not be the like certainty of
Relation of the Pronounce [ This] to Bread in the speech of Christ, as it has
in the prayer of the Priest, none of you (we think) shall ever be able to
show.

Lastly, we challenge you to show, within the space of a Thousand three
hundredth years after Christ, out of all the Ancient Hoc, This] to betoken any
Individuum vagum, or Common Substance; orels to confess that this your
doctrine is new, extravagant, and Adulterate. Nor yet can the Defenders thereof
say that this is all one, as to say, This, that is, that which is contained
under the form of Bread, because this is like as when one showing his purse,
shall say, This is money, meaning that which is in his purse; which is a known
figure Metonymia.

Yet were it granted that [ Hoc] betokened an Individuum vagum, as (to use your
own Similitude) when one says of an This herb grows in my garden; so Christ
should have said of bread in his hand; This (that is the like kind of bread) is
my Body: yet would not this make the Speech of Christ proper, or not
figurative, because Christ's Body could no more be properly predicated of the
kind of wheat- Bread; than it could be of that bread of wheat then in his
hand, as Christ himself has taught us, and as we are to prove unto you. For
speaking of his Body, he calls it (...) the grane of wheat, John 12. 24. not
This grane; yet Christ's flesh is equally called improperly The grane, as This
grane of wheat: whereof the Theodoret will read you all a Lesson, in the sixth
Section following. And now this so open and extreme civil war among your
selves, in confuting your own Expositions, will further and confirm peace
among us in that one Exposition, which we are in the next place to defend, as
follows.

The third Proposition, which is (according to the judgment of Protestants)
that there is a Tropicall and unproper sense, in the Pronoune [THIS.] We
reason first Hypothetically; If the Pronoune This Bread, then the words of
Christ are necessarily to be taken improperly and figuratively. But the
Pronoune This does demonstrate Bread. Our Conclusion will be; Therefore the
words of Christ, necessarily, are to be taken figuratively. All this will be
proved, confirmed, and avouched by Reasons, Authorities, and Confessions, which
will admit no Contradiction. We begin at our proof of the Consequence of the
Proposition.

That it is impossible for Bread to be called the Body of Christ; or Wine his
Blood, without a Figure. SECT. IV.
THe common Dictate of natural Reason, imprinted by Disparatum de disparato
non proprie praedicatur; That is, nothing can be properly and literally
affirmed jointly of another thing, which is of a different nature, viz. It is
impossible to say properly that an Egg is a Stone or (to take your own
Disparatum de disparato non p^aedicatur, valet igitur argumentum Si ^oc est
lac, non est terrum: ita etiam valebit, Si hoc est corpus non est panis; cum
repugnet, u^am n^turam de alt^ra diversa dici, ut hominem eise equum, citra
tropum, vel Metaphoram. Salm Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 16.. Primum igitur p. 109.
examples) we cannot call A man an horse, without a Trope or figure, because
their natures are repugnant. So Salmeron. And this he holds necessary. Or
thus: Ne ipse quidem Deus, qui est summa veritas, unquam efficiet, ut hae
propositiones, uxor Lot est Sal, aqua est vinum, asinus est homo, in sensu
composito sint verae. Archiep. Caesar. defens. fid. de Real. Praes. cap 58.
God, who is perfect Truth, will never make those Propositions to be So your
Archbishop. Yea, to come nearer to the point: Observandum; cum dicitur vinum
est sanguis, docetur esse sanguinem per similitudinem, reipsa autem and proprie
est vinum. Et cum dicitur sanguis est vinum, intelligitur vinum e^se p^r
similitudinem: nec enim reipsa aut proprie esse potest aut vinum sanguis, aut
sanguis vinum, cum res sunt ipsae diversae inter se, and termini ut vocant
disparati. Beld. 2. de Euch. c. 9.. Observand.
We cannot say that this wine is blood, or that this blood is wine, but by a
Similitude or Representation, because they differ in nature. So Bellarmine;
adding furthermore that it is Non potest fieri ut vera sit Propositio, in qua
subjectum supponitur pro pane, praedicatum pro corpore Christi: Panis enim and
corpus res diversissimae sunt. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 19.. Primum.
Impossible the Proposition should be true, wherein the Subject is Bread, and
the Predicate is taken for the Body of Christ. And, Bread and Christ's Body (
says your Eodem tempore panis triticeus, and corpus Christi esse non possunt,
quia disp^rata sunt. Sand. de visib Monarch. ad Annum. 1549. [ To object De
Christo (...) Deus est homo, were vain, because that is spoken by reason of
the Hypostaticall Union, whereby ^^ccidit Deo ut sit homo, per hypostaticam
unionem, non per mutationem, which Unity makes God and man in Christ
reciprocal. And we also mean. Disparata absoluta, not Relata, for thus the
same man is father and son.]
Sanders) cannot be properly affirmed one of another. * Also your Jesuit
Estius Ies. Com in 1. Cor. 1. 14 Non intendit Christus his verbis [Hoc est
corpus meum] affirmare panem quem tenebatin manu, esse corpus suum: quae
affirmatio absurda and manifest falsa effet.
Estius: To affirm Bread to be Christ's body, is a Proposition false, and As
false (says your Jesuit Jacob. Gordonus Scotus Ies. Controv. 4. cap 1. number 4.
Non magis dici potest, Panis est corpus Christi, quam aurum est plumbum, aut
hic homo est bestra -- non potest dispar tum de disparato vere and proprie
dici, nisi quis velit contendere Christum vere and proprie dici Iudam, aut Deum
Diabolum.
Gordon) as to say Christ is Judas, or God is the Devil.

And indeed it is as impossible Bread should be properly a body of flesh, as a
body of flesh to be Bread; which is grounded upon our first Maxim, which your
Jesuit Salmeron expresses thus. Quoties verbum [Est] res diversarum
naturarum, quae a Latinis dicuntur disparata, unit and copulat, ibi necessario
ad figuram and Tropum recurramus. Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract 10 page 138.
As often as the Verb [EST, IS,] joyneth things of diverse natures together, we
are necessarily to have recourse to a Trope and Figure. Will you be content
that your Gloss, as the tongue of your Church, may have the last word? Then
hearken to it: Si panis est corpus Christi, ergo aliquid quod non est natum ex
virgin est corpus Christi: and ita animatum est inanimatum. Gloss Decret. de
Consecrat. did. ^ can. Quia.
If Bread be Christ's body, then something is Christ's body, which is not borne
of the Virgin Mary; and then also the same body must be said to be living, and
not living, both at once. So your Gloss, confessing hereby an Impossibility
of this Predication, Bread is Christ's Body, in a proper and literal sense. Our
Proposition then stands firm and infallible; our Assumption will be found as
true.

That the Pronoune [THIS] does as verily notify Bread, in the words of Christ,
as if he had expressly said, This Bread is my Body; proved first by
Scripture. SECT. V.
THe Text of the Evangelist Luke 22. is light sufficient in it self; [ Jesus
took bread, blessed it, brake it, and gave it to THIS, (namely) which they
Took, and they took THIS, which he Gave; and he gave THIS, which he Brake;
and he brake THIS, which he blessed; and blessed THIS, which he himself
Took; and THIS, which he took, was Bread, [Iesus took Bread.] We appeal to
your own Consciences, who never hitherto could say, that in all these Sayings
of Christ there was made any Change or alteration of THIS which he took, till
the last word pronounced by the Priest, which is [ Meum;] nor yet can you deny,
but that he took that, which was properly, and substantially Bread. At the
writing of this Sorites, we light upon an Answer from one Master M. Malloune.
in his late Reply. page 200. His Sorites; That which the Governor of the feast
in Cana of Galile tasted, was the same which the Ministers brought him: that
which they brought him was the same that others drew out: that which others
drew out, was the same which others before them powered into the Pots; but that
which others powered into the Pots was water. Therefore that which the Governor
of the feast tasted was water. So he. [ None is so witless but will easily,
from the light of the Text, tell him, that the water was changed into wine,
before the Governor of the feast tasted thereof: whereas, in the tenure of
Christ his speech, you your selves could never point out any former change at
all, before the last syllable, Me-um.]
Malloune, encountering it with another, but a false Sorites, invented by
himself, to the discountenancing of this true one; only we entreat you, that
at the reading thereof, you will not laugh at his foolery. (See the Margin.)

Your Grammatical Objection is Childish. Cardinal Si [Hoc] accipitur
substantive, tum sensus erit [Hoc] i. e. Haec res: quod si de Pane dicatur,
absurdissima propositio erit, non enim potest dici Hoc de Re quae cernitur, and
aperte cognoscitur, nisi sit generis neutrius illa -- Nemo enim demonstrans de
Patre suo, diceret, Hoc est Pater meus. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 10.. Porro.
Bellarmine your chief Master, and also your Schoole-fellow Although the word
Bread had not been expressed, yet being present in Christ's hand, and pointed
unto, Hoc could not be taken substatively no more then one should say of his
Father, Hoc est Pater meus M. Brerelye's Liturgy, page 137.
Master Brerely, as if they would put Protestants to School, tell them that [
Hoc] taken for a Substantive neuter cannot agree with Panis, it being a Thing
then seen and known, and not being of the neuter gender: no more than for a
man to say, De Patre, Hoc est Pater meus. A strange thing, that great Clerks,
when they take upon them to teach others their Grammar, should be so far
overtaken, as to need to be put in mind of their Accedence, Quia per hanc
acceditur ad Grammaticam.
Accedence, (if ever they learned it) which tells them that The neuter
gender, substantively taken, will agree whether seen or not seen. In which
respect there might be a difference between, Hoc de Patre, and Hoc de Pane.
For although Priscian would cry out, if he heard one saying, Hoc lana, or Hoc
lapis, wherein [ Hoc] is taken Adjectively: yet if a Question being raised,
concerning the lightness and heaviness of Wool, and of Stone, one showing the
Wool in his hand should say, Hoc est leve; the other pointing at the Stone,
should say, Hoc est grave, would any think that Priscian would be offended?
for [ Hoc] in Latin, neutrally taken, more than others would be for (...) in

Greek, taken Summa Angelica. tit. Eucharist. quaest. 23. Propositio esset
magis propria, si demonstrando Cibum diceretur [Hoc est Corpus meum.]
Summa Angelica, wherein [ Hoc] neutrally taken, is made to agree with Cibus.

And although Protestants be so inexpert in the rudiments of learning, yet
will you not think that others, whom you call Catholics, could be so
deceived; who (as your Jesuit witnesses) Dicent Calvinistae, Pronomen illud
Graecum, (...), and Latinum, Hoc, Substantiva esse: quod and multi Catholici
dixerunt, ideo opus non esse ut genere conveniat, sed posse esse, Hoc quod
vobis do, est corpus meum. Test Maldon. Com. in Matthew. 26. page 633.
were Many, that taught that [ Hoc] in the words of Christ, put Substantively,
may without any Inconvenience agree with Panis, in [ This,] meaning [ This]
which I give you.

*Will not this suffice? then advise you with your learned Iansenius, to know
why he Iansen. Concord. Evang. Cap. 131. in haec verba, [Bibite ex hoc omnes.]

have rendered it thus [Hoc est sanguis meus:] where he gives his Reason for it,
and fortifyeth it when he has done by the same Translation, [ Hoc est sanguis

Bonaventure, who adventureth to say Hoc] the Subject of Christ's speech,
demonstrateth Panem, Bread? Are you not yet ashamed of your Rashness? then
must we now put you unto it.

In your own vulgar Latin Translation, it is said of Evah, the wife of Adam,
Saluteron Ies. Tom 9 Tractat. 16.. Nec tursus -- Adam de Eva ex costa ejus
desumpta, Hoc nunc os ex offibus meis.
Hoc est os, Genesis 2. what Insobriety then is this in your Disputers, so eagerly
to reach that blow unto the Protestants, wherewith they must as necessarily
buffet their own Mother Church, by which the same Translation is made
Authentike; and wound their own Consciences, being themselves bound by Oath to
defend it in all their disputations? Away then with these Puerilities,
especially now, being bused in a matter of so great importance, wherein
consists the foundation of all the maine Controversies, concerning the Roman
Mass. For, if the Pronoune [ This] have Relation to Bread, figurative sense of
Christ's speech.

* Notwithstanding, We have not yet done, but furthermore to put every one of
you to his Grammar. We have heard of a Romish Priest, who, having many
unconsecrated Hoasts before him, used this form of Consecration: Haec sunt
Corpora mea: These are my Bodies. Which Report your See afterward Book. 7.
Chap. 5. Sect. 2.
Author, indifferently, thinks might have been either true, or fabulous:
however, it justly occasioneth us to make this serious demand, to wit, when any
of your Priests, having This is my Body, and after brake it into parts,
distributing them to his Disciples:) but many round hoasts, now to be
consecrated; We ask, by what congruity he can pronounce of such a multitude
of these Hoasts (which he means to consecrate) This is my Body? have you (o
the only Grammarians!) any Grammar for this.

We return to the School of Christ, the holy Scripture, to consult (about
Christ's meaning) with his Disciple Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 11. 23.
Received of the Lord. Him we desire to expound unto us the words of Christ,
delivered by Three Evangelists, and to tell what he gave unto them, and what
he called his Body: and he tells us plainly, saying; 1. Cor. 10. 16.
The Bread, which we break, is it not the Communion if the Body of Christ?
alluding to those words of the Evangelists, He brake it, and that was Bread.
And that you may know that this was Catholic Doctrine, in the days of Antity,

That it was Bread and Wine, which Christ called his Body and Blood; in the
judgment of Ancient Fathers. SECT. VI.
FOr proof hereof, behold a Torrent of Ancient I. Irenaeus; Accipiens panem,

Fathers pressing upon you; Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origin, Hierome, and Isidore;
Thirteen to the dozen, whose sayings we may best know by their own Idiome,
and Tenure of speech. The first noting Christ to have confessed Bread to have
been his Body. The second, Christ to have called Bread his Body. The third,
that Christ's speech was spoken of Bread. The fourth, that That which he
broke, was bread. The fifth, that It was Bread which he brake. The sixth, that It
was Bread of the Lord, and not Bread the Lord, received of Judas. The seventh,
that the words [ My Body] The eighth, that Christ says of the Bread [This is
my Body.] And the same Father, as if he had studied to take away all Scales of
doubtfulnesse from the eyes of your minds, illustrateth the matter thus: So
(says he) did Christ call his Body Bread, as else where he calls his flesh
a Grane of Wheat; [Except the Grane of Wheat die, it brings forth no
fruit.] The ninth, that Christ gave to the Bread the name of his Body. The
tenth, that Christ said of the Consecrated Bread. This is my Body.] The
eleventh, that It was Wine which he called his Blood. The twelfth, that He
blessed Wine when he said drink. The Bread strengthening man's Body was
therefore called the Body of Christ. Yet need not this Father be reckoned for
the Last, if we affected to be supersluous. All these so Learned and Ancient
Fathers (sufficient Grammarians we trow) teaching the Pronoune [ This] to
demonstrate Bread, do as absolutely confute your Romish Exposition, to prove
the speech Figurative, ^s any Protestant in the world could do, if he were
permitted to plead his own Cause.


We will try what a Syllogism will do, that, after your Posall in Grammar,
we may encounter you with Logike.

The Major. No Bread can possibly be called a Body of flesh, without a figure.
(This Proposition has had the Universal consent of all Schools, by virtue of
that Maxim of Maxims, See above. 4.
Disparatum de Disparato, etc.)

The Minor. But in these words, [ This is my Body,] the Pronoune [ This] does
demonstrate Bread. (This has been the general Exposition of Fathers.)

The Conclusion. Therefore the words of Christ, [ This is my Body] are to be
taken figuratively. Except you will contradict both the General confession of
your own Schools, and Universal

That it was Bread, which Christ called his Body, is proved manifestly from
your own Romish Positions and Principles. SECT. VII.
YOur first Position is this; The word [ This] must either point out Bread, or
the Body of Christ, or that Third common which you call Individuum vagum. But
to refer to word [ This] unto the Body of Christ, is (as has been See
above. 2.
confessed) Absurd. And that the word [ This] should signify your Individuum
vagum, is an Exposition full of Absurdities, as has been also See above. 3.
acknowledged. It remains therefore that the Pronoune [ This] points out
precisely, Bread.

A second Principle you have, to wit; That these words [ This is my Body] are
words of Consecration, and Operative, so that by [ This] is meant that which is
Consecrated, and (as your Council Council. Trident. Sess. 23. c. 4. Fit
Conversio totius substantiae Panus in corpus Christi.
of Trent speaks) changed into the Body of Christ. But, by Body of Christ,
nor any Third thing, but Bread only was then consecrated and changed into the
Body of Christ. Ergo the Pronoune [THIS] has only Relation to the Bread.

*We might add, for a third Principle, the above ingenuous See above Chap. 1.
Sect. 2.
Confession of your Jesuits, granting that the Pronoune [THIS] in Christ's
words did design That thing which was then present, whereof Christ said, [
This is my Body:] when as (which has likewise been confessed) That thing was
neither Christ's Body, nor any third thing differing And therefore (say we)
could betoken nothing but Bread.

CHALLENGE.
A New Syllogism would be had, to put the matter out of question.

Major. No Sense, which is Impossible, can be given properly to the words of
Christ, [ This is my Body,] (This needs no proof.)

Minor. But to call Bread Christ's Body, properly, is a Sense Impossible. (This
has been your own constant See above 4
profession.)

Conclusion. Therefore cannot this Sense be given properly to the Body of
Christ. How can you avoid the necessity of this Consequence? All arising from
the nature of Predication, in this Proposition, wherein the Subject is Bread;
the Copula, Is; and Predicate, Body of Christ. Which because it cannot be Bread
determinate, as to say, This Bread in my hand is Christ's Body; or of Bread
undeterminate (which you call vagum) as to say, This kind of Bread is the Body
of Christ, it demonstratively shows that your Doctors can have no greater
Adversaries, in this case, than their own Consciences, which will appear more
fully in that which follows.

*A Confirmation, that in the words [Hoc est Corpus Meum: This is my Body] the
Pronoune [HOC, THIS] is expressly spoken of Bread; by the Analogy it has
with
AS all the motions of every wheel of a Watch have their activity from the
spring; so may. We say that all the Controversies, touching the Romish Mass,
in the Doctrinall parts thereof, concerning Corporal Presence,
Transubstantiation, Union, and divine Adoration, attributed to that which is in
the hands of the Priest, depend, as on their Hoc est corpus meum, This is my
Body:] and this their Interpretation rests upon the proper signification of
the Pronoune [ Hoc, This] as you have already heard. Which if it betoken
Literally Bread, as all Protestants affirm, then by Universal consent, of
even the Romish Doctors themselves, the speech of Christ must as necessarily
be a Figurative and Tropicall speech, as was that of Saint Paul, saying, The
Rock was Christ. The Romish therefore, to avoid this, have devised other
Interpretations of Christ's words, Hoc, This] to betoken Christ's Body, as if
Christ had said, This my Body is my Body. The other Opinators holding the
former to be absurd, say that by [ Hoc, This] is meant not this definite Bread
it self, but This (Individuum vagum) kind of Bread is my Body; which has
been condemned by their other parties (and truly) as an Exposition full of
Absurdities.

We now pursue this point further, by examination of the Speech of Christ,
concerning the other Element, delivered Saint Matthew. 26. 27.
Matthew and Saint Mark. 14.
Mark thus. He took the Cup, and gave it (the Cup) to them, saying, Drink you
all of this, (viz. Cup) For this (namely still, Cup) is my Blood. And is
further proved to point out the Cup by Saint Luke 22.
Luke. and Saint 1. Cor. 11.
Paul, who both deliver it thus: This Cup is the new Testament, etc. But here
in these words, [ These Cup is, etc.] the Word, Cup, by Universal Consent is
taken Tropically for the liquor in the Cup. Therefore did not Christ intend,
Consecratorie Words, a Proper and Literal Sense; when otherwise it had been as
easy to have said either (according to the first Exposition) [ This Blood in
the Cup, is my Blood:] or else answerably to your second Interpretation, [ This
kind of Wine in the Cup is my Blood:] albeit this also be as Tropicall and
Figurative, as to have said, [ This Wine is my Blood.]

Which your Church of Rome perceived right well, and therefore, for avoiding
the Trope and Figure, has she devised a new form, thus. [ Hic est calix
sanguinis mei: ] different from all the Evangelists, even in that which you
call a Form of Consecration; as if in her high presumption she had professed
to correct the form of Christ his Institution. A perfect Argument of a novell,
naughty, ruinous, and tottering Cause. If any Protestant had made so bold with
Scripture, O what outcryes and vociferations should we have heard! and that
this was done to facilitate your Answer, where you say, Vasquez. in 3. Thom.
Disp. 109. cap. 4. Ego existimo nullum esse Tropum in verbis essentialibus
formae.
The Words or form of Consecration Are without Tropes, your Jesuit Vasquez
collecteth. Wherein notwithstanding he Master Aquinas, even now when he does
Gloss and Comment upon him; for sure it is Aquin. part. 3. Quaest. 78. Artic.
3. ad 1. Dico, Hic est calix sanguinis mei, est locutio figurata: uno modo, est
secundum Metonymiam, Continens pro Contento.
dquinas concludes most directly, saying of these Words, [ This is the Cup in
my Blood:] that It is a Figurative speech called Metonymia. Hitherto of the
first Key of explication of Christ's words.

CHAP. II.
The Second Key in Christ's Words [Hoc est Corpus meum: This is my Body,]
opening the Figurative Sense thereof, is the Verb [EST, IS.]
FOr that [ Est] in these words has the same Signifies; as if Christ had said
expressly of the Bread, This signifies my Body: and accordingly of the Wine,
This signifies my Blood, may be proved by three Propositions infringible.

Our first Proposition. The Verb [EST] being joined with a thing that is a
FOr although the Verb ( Est) be indeed so absolutely simple, in it is own
nature, that it cannot be resolved into any other word (as all other Verbes may
be in like Case) yet does it (albeit accidentally) necessarily infer a
figurative Sense, and is as Signifies, or Represents, whenever it joyneth
the Sign and the Thing signified together. As for Example, A man pointing at a
sign hanging before an Inn, and saying, This is Saint George, the Verb Is
can infer no other Sense than Signifies. Why? even because the thing,
whereof it speaks, is a Sign signifying Saint George. And Bread in this
Sacrament is in all Catholic Divinity a Sign of Christ's Body. Therefore the
Verb [ Is] can have no other Sense than [ Signifies.]

The former Proposition confirmed by all like Speeches, whether
YOur own Jesuits, and common Experience it self will verify this Truth.
First, In things Artificial, as Metonymia, tropus est in Scripturis
frequentissimus, qua continens pro contento, and contra signatum pro signo
usurpari solet; ut ostensa imagine Herculis, dicimus, Hic est Hercules.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. proleg. 12. Can. 15.
To say of the Picture of Hercules, This is Hercules, is a figure. Secondly, In
things Politic, as when a Testamentum saepe sumitur pro Legato, seu Re
testata. Bartrad. Ies Institut. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 5.
Legacy, given by Will and Testament, is called the man's Will. So they. And
indeed what is more Common, than for a man to say of his Testament, This is my
Will? Of his name subscribed, This is my hand? And of the wax sealed, This is
my Seal? When as his Will (properly taken) is in his heart, his hand is
affixed to his Arm, And his seal may be in his pocket. Thirdly, In Mystical
and Divine Rites; as in Sacrifice, even among the Heathen, according to that
Example out of Homer, which is notable. The Gree^as and Trojans, when they
entered into a league, which was to be ractified Sacrifice of Lambs, upon which
both sides were to take their Oaths, this their Act is thus expressed Salm
Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 15.. Male e^^m. [Idem prius habuit noster Bez^^in Luc. 22.
20.]
-- (...) that is, They brought with them two Lambs, their faithful oaths.
Where Lambs, the rituall signs of their faithful Swearing, are called Oaths.
An Example (I say) even among the Heathen, which is as apposite to our purpose,
and opposite against your defense, as can be.

Our Second Proposition, answerable to the first.
IN all such like Sacramental Speeches, both in the old and new Testament,
wherein the Sign is coupled with the Thing signified, the Speech is ever
unproper and Figurative, and the Verb [ Est] has no other force than,
Signifies. This Truth Pascha significat transitum, qu^a Angelus transivit
domos Israelit^rum: haec ratio nominis redditur, cum dicitur, [Transibit enim
Dominus ^um viderit sanguinem in utroque post.] ^ansen. Ip^sc. Concord. in
Matthew. 26. [ It was therefore more than boldness in Bellarmine, l. ^ de Euch.
cap 11. Quaedam to say; Agnus erat propr^e Transitus, Agnus being in the
Predi^ament of Substance: and Transitus in the Predicament of Action.
Paschall Lamb, being but a Sign, was called the Passover, or passing-over.
Secondly, that (...) hoc (...) loco dicitur spiritualis, ex qua Deus eduxit per
mi^^culum aquam, quia Signum (...) e l^tgre Christi (...) Sa^meron. Ies. in 1.
Cor. 10 [Petra autem erat Christus.] Id est. Petra significab ^t Christum: ubi
signum appellat nomine rei significatae. Pe^^er. Ies. Com. in Dan 2. p. 85.
[^^etra erat Christus.] Erat autem Christus Petra, certissima scilicet
significatione. Arias Mont. in 1. Cor. 10. and Piata. Ies. ia Is 51.
The Rock, being but a Sign of Christ, was called Christ. * Albeit your
Doctor Heskins, long ago ventured to confute this Sense, saying, In his
Parliament of Christ. B. 2. Chap. 3.
Christ was the spiritual Rock, not the material: and afterward concluding
thereupon, that it is no figurative speech A Doctor-like Conclusion forsooth!
which even Petits in Common learning would easily confute by Retorsion, thus:
If Christ was by the Apostle called the Spiritual Rock, then was the
figuratively called The Rock, as well as he was figuratively called Vine, and
Door; even because he was not a Vine, or Door Materially, but Spiritually. *
Thirdly, that Circumcisio soedus d^^tu, and signum toederis. Bellar ^^b. 1. de
Ea^^ 11 Se. und^.
Circumcision, being but a Sign of the Covenant, was called the Covenant. So
likewise in the new Testament, both concerning Christus cum Nicodemo
spiritualute: intelligendus. Muddon. Ies. in cum locum. ^ob. 3.
Baptism, which in Christ his speech to Nicodemus (being but a Sign of
Regeneration) is called Regeneration. And Sep^^^ sumus Rom 6. 4. Id est,
Christum sepultum represent (...) Tolet. Ies (...) e^m (...).
Baptizing, which being Sign of the Burial of Christ) in the speech of Saint
Paul, is called Burial: and concerning the Eucharist, the Communicants thereof
are called One Bread, Cor. 10 16.

Finally, that the most proper Interpretation of the Verb [Est, Is,] in such
like speeches, imports no more, than [Significat,]your Jesuit Q^o^ vero in
(...) ^is orationibus [Petra erat Christus; Semen erat verbum De^, Ego sum
Ostium] verbum substantivum sit interpretandum pro Significat, aut sigurat; non
ei id accidit ex n^ tu^a sua, aut per se, sed quoniam Pecta illa a^iter cum
Christo conjungi non potest, quam per sig^um -- Inde sit, ut parvi refer t^sive
dicas, Petra erat signum Christi, vel significabat Christum Salmeron. Ies Tom
9. Tract. 16.. Primum igi^ur. page 118.
Salmeron will testify for us: In these speeches (says he) The seed is the
Wond, I am the Door, The Rock was Christ; the Verb [Is, and, WAS] must be
interpreted for SIGNIFIES, or figureth; not of it is own nature, but because
the word, Rock, cannot be otherwise joined with Christ, than by a figure So
he. Even as Master [Petra erat Christus] Soler ita expon^, Petra significabat
Christum, id non ita accidit quod verbum [Ess] pro significat, ex se
coll^cetur, sed quontam [Petra] illa al^ter cum Christo cohaerere, quam per
fimil^udinem, and signu ^^on potest. Sund de Visib. Mona^. ad Annum. 1550. page
141.
Sa^ders also is compelled to confess in a like Case.


THus have we argued from Induction and Enumeration of Texts of Scripture, in
all like Sacramental Speeches: which Exposition, by Analogy of Scriptures, was
ever held of all Divines the most absolute and infallible manner of expounding
the Scripture that can be. The Truth whereof arises essentially out of the
Definition of a Sacrament, which as well the whole Catholic Church, as your
Romish, has defined to be a visible Sign. But no visible Sign can be joined
to any thing signified thereby, in like Predication, without a Figure,

Our third Proposition, viz. Eight Confessed Figures are apparently found in
the words of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament. SECT. IV.
THat the Pronoune, THIS, used as well in these words of Christ [ This is my
Body] as in the other [ This is my ^lood] infer a figure, See the Sections
^^^ing before.
has been proved to the full, and so will be acknowledged by your own
publicly authorized Roman See the Sect. 6. now following.
Gloss it self: which may be sufficient to muzzle our Opposites, who please
themselves in nick-naming Protestants, calling them Toutists, of the word,
(...), which is the word, THIS; and Tropists, because of their professing the
words of Christ to be Tropicall, and figurative. But how much more

Let us begin with the word, BROKEN, thus; [ This is my Body, which is Broken
for you.] 1 Cor. 11 24. Say now, do you think indeed, and that seriously,
Christ to have signified hereby that his Body in this Sacrament was therefore
really Broken? Si proprie loqui velimus, falsae sunt istae Propositiones,
Corpus Christi mandicatur a nobis, corpus Christi teritur, corpus Christi
devoratur, corpus Christi frangitur: quia ipsi modi, qui significantur his
verbis, non convenient Corpori Christi. Maldor, de Sacrament. Tom. 1. page 144.
Sacramentalis locutio esset, si corpus Christi diceretur frangi, a ^dertibus
teri: haec enim non possunt nisi Sacramento-tenus intelligi, quia non proprie
corpus Christi frangitur, sed Sacramentum Idem. Comment. in Matthew. 26. Frangi
cum dicitur, est Metaphotica locutio, quia fractio proprie significat
divisionem, and discontinuationem partium, quam constat non fieri in partibus
corporis Christi Suarez. Ies. in Thom. Tom. 3. Disput. 47. Sect. 4.. Exempla
tertiae page 577. *
Nay (say two of your Jesuits, viz. Suarez and Maldonate) for then should the
Speech of Christ be false: but it is figuratively and Metaphorically spoken.
And they Will give you good Aquin. part. 3. Quaest. 77. Art. 7. Non potest
dici, qu^d corpus Christi vere frangatur, per quam fractionem unum fiat multa,
quia impossible esset tunc, ut totum sit in qualibet part.
Aquinas your chief Schoolman. See afterward, Book. 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 2. in
the Margin.
Because the word, [Broken] properly taken signifies a separation of the parts
of that Body, which is said to be broken. But there is no separation, or
discontinuation of the parts of Christ's Body in this Sacrament. So they. To
which purpose your Bishop Iansenius. See hereafter. Book. (...). Chap. 1. Sect.
4.
Iansenius will have us to observe a Reason wherefore the word [ Broken] is
left out of your Roman Missals (to wit) Lest that some should be so fond and
seely as to conceive that Christ's Body is truly Broken. And upon this
Contemplation your Bishop of Winchester Stephen Gardener is peremptory.
Stephen Gardener in his Explication of the Sacrament of the Altar.
If one ask (says he) if the Body of Christ be broken, I have learned to say,
No, because that glorious Body cannot now be broken and divided, for it is
whole in every part. What then (will some say) does the word [ Broken] signify
in the speech of Christ? and your Jesuit Salmeron is ready to instruct them
out of the Fathers, that Salm. ron. Ies. See afterward, B. 6. Chap. ^. Sect. 2.
It signifies the crucifying of his Body with spear and nails upon the
Cross.

The like will be confessed of the Verb, EAT, in those speeches of Christ, [
Take, Eate] which being properly taken, (say the abovenamed See above in the
Margin, at the l^tter ( a)
Jesuits) would make the speech The Reason is expressed by your Jesuit
Salmeron, Salmeron. See afterward, Book. 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 2.
Real eating (says he) requires a real touch and tearing of that which is
eaten: but Christ's Body is not torn with the teeth, because this is
Impartible. So he, Which is as plain as can be, to prove the word, Eat, (as
it is applied to Christ's Body) to be absolutely figurative.

In like manner, in the words of Christ's Institution, We read that he said,
[DRINKE you all of this:] which you refer properly to Christ's Blood, albeit
you holding Concomitancie See above, B. 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 8. Out of Iansenius
and Durand.
you do) that is, that Christ's Blood is not separated out of his Body more in
this Sacrament, than it is out of the Sacrament, but is still the same Body
which has its Blood in the veins thereof, therefore you cannot affirm truly
that Christ's Blood is properly Drunk; Witness your great Pedagogue Mr.
Brerely. Mr. Brereley. Li^^rg. Tractat. 4.. 8.
If we should attend to the propriety of speech, neither is his Blood properly
drunk in the Chalice, but only the form of Wine, seeing the Blood has the
same manner of Existing as under the form of Bread, (to wit) not divided nor
separated from the Body, but included in the veins, and then in the Body. Do
you not Christ's Blood is not properly drunk, if not properly, then
figuratively; as figuratively, as if one, swallowing the Body of Christ, should
be said to Drink his Body.

We ask Master Brerely, what then is that which is properly drunk out of the
Chalice? and he says, only the form of Wine, that is to say, a mere
Accident. Hardly can it he said that a man properly drinks the Air, which he
breaths, although it be a substance: and are you brought to believe mere
Formalities to be truly Potable?

Take, this is my Body, which is Given for you:] and of the other, [ This is
the new Testament in my Blood, which is Shed for you.] In both which words
[GIVEN, and SHED,] as they are spoken in respect of the time, We expect from
you a Confession of the figure Enallage, which is the using of the present
tense for the future; your Jesuit [Corpus quod pro^vobis datur] Id est, quod
offeretur pro vobis in cruce mactatum. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 3..
Igitur. [ Of the word, Eato, literally false, so your Jesuits. See Book. 5.
Chap. 4.. 2.]
Valentia testifying for the first, [ Given] that is (says he) which shall be
offered upon the Cross. And your Jesuit Salmeron for the other [ Blood which
is Shed.] Graecus Textus [Effunditur.] Non est negandum morem esse Scripturae,
ea dicere jam esse, quae futura sint, u^hic [effunditur] quia paulo post in
cruce essundendus. Salmeron. Ies. in 1. Cor. 11. p. 154 and Sa. Ies. in Matthew.
26. Graece, Effunditur: praesens pro futuro. So Cajetan in Matthew. 26
[Effunditur] nempe tempore passionis; jam enim inceperat effundi.
It is not denied (says he) but that it is the manner of Scripture to speak
of a thing, as now done, which is after tobe done, as in this place, [Is shed]
because shortly after, it was to be shed upon the cross. So likewise your
Jesuit Sa. And that this is among you the true and Common exposition of these
words of Christ, your Bishop Iansenius. See afterward Book. 6. Chap. 1.. 2. at
( q)
Iansenius does not forbear to testify. So then, in both these words [ Given,
and Shed] there are two figures, in respect of the Time.

We are furthermore to consider the Word, Shed; in respect See Book. 6. Chap.
1.. 4. for the three first: and Book. 4. Chap. 2. 3. for the last.
Doctors have thus determined. 1. your Bellarmine. Christ's blood, at his
Institution of this Sacrament, did not pass out of his Body. 2. your Alfonsus.
Christ's blood was never Shed after his Resurrection. 3. your Jesuit Coster.
True effusion of blood is a separating it from the Body, which in Christ was
only on the Cross. 4. you may add to these the stiff Resolution of your
Jesuit Suarez^ Christ's blood to be separated out of his Veins, who can
believe? And if this be not to be believed, then to say that it is not
Figuratively said to be Shed, is altogether as incredible.

* Will you be pleased that your Jesuit Vasquez may determine this point
throughout. He Vasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Qu. 78. Art. 3. Disp. 199. cap. 1. Ego
vero existimo utrumque verbum, Datur, and Frangitur, Effundetur, sen,
Effunditur, quae ponuntur in additamentis formarum, multo melius ad passionem
and crucem referri, quam ad fractionem and effusione^ Eucharistiae. ( Alleging
to this purpose the consent of Cajetan, Theophylact, Euthymius, Anselm, and
Chrysostom.) Adding, Rations vero pro hac nostra sententia and interpretatione
sunt (me Iudice quidem) efficacissimae -- paulo post, Non est effusio sangui^is
in Eucharistia, per modum Sacrificij, sed repraesentatio and sigura illius: in
calice enim Domininon separatur sanguis a corpore Christi, ac proinde reipsa
non effunditur.
concludes all these words, [ Broken, Given, Shed] to relute to Christ's
Passion in a future sense: bringing with him Cajetan, Theophylact, Euthymius,
Anselm, and Chrysostom for his Authors: and will have you to know that he
has most forcible Reasons for this Interpretation, besides this his own, to
wit, That the Blood of Christ cannot be said to be Shed, which is not
properly separated out of his Body in the Sacrament. Aquinas will speak as
confidently of Breaking, that See above confessed.
It is impossible it should be Now furthermore concerning the same words, [
Broken, Given, Shed,] in respect of the Time, as that they signify the Future
time of Christ's Passion, you Book 6. Chap. 1.. 2. (...)
shall have yet more of your own Docotors averring as much, so that your Romish
Suggester shall have little cause to complain of the paucity of our witnesses.
*

It follows in the words of Christ's Institution, [ This is the Cup of the new
Testament in my blood.] Now what of this? hearken to your Bishop Iansenius.
[Hic. Calix est novum Testamentum.] Non potest accipi in proprio sensu, sed in
eo, quem clari^ra verba Matthaei et M^rci indicant and exigunt. Sive enim Calix
su^atur provasc^^ potorio, sive Synechdochic^ pro sanguine in poculo contento,
non potest consistere ut in ijs verbis sit propria locutio -- Nemo enim dix
erit propria locutione vasculum illud potorium fuisse novum Testamentum, cum
incertum sit an adhuc exstet illud poculum: at novum Testamentum est aeternum
Sed nec sanguis in calice contentus potest esse novum Testamentum propria
locutione, quia lex Evangelica in Epist. ad Heb dicitur novum Testamentum, and
apu^l Matthew. and Marcum sanguis dicitur hov^ Testamenti. At unic^m est n^^um
Testamentum. Ianse^. Concord in (...) locum, page 910.
These words (says he) cannot not be taken properly, whether the [Cup] be
taken for the vessel, used for drinking, which was a temporal thing, and
therefore could not be the Testament of Christ, which is aeternall: or else
whether you take it for the matter in the Cup (which is a Figure called
Synechdoche) for it being the blood of the new Testament, could not be
properly the Testament it self. Yea, and your Jesuit Salmeron points out in
the same words, a double Figure; Subest in his duplex Metonymia, 1. quua
Con^in^ns pon^^ur pro Contento, id est, poculum, sive Calix, pro vino, eo quod
vinum in ipso continetur. 2. est, co quod contentum in poculo foedus, vel
Testamentum dicitur novum, cum sit ejus symbolum propter species. --
Testamentum hoc in loco potest sumi prolege Evangelica, quae veteri legi
opponitur, ut rem Testamento legatam testatamve significet. Quemadmodum haeres
dice^solet, Hic fundus est Testamentum Patris me, Id est portio haereditatis a
patre meo legata; in quem sensum Apostolus loquitur ad Heb. Jesus est sponsor
melioris Testamenti. Id est haereditatis Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 15. 3. p. 98.
A double Figure (says he) is here, the [Cup] being put for the thing
contained in the Cup: and [Testament] being taken for the Legacy wi^h whom the
Testamentum sumitur pro leg^to Metonymi^e, continens Testamentum sumitur pro
contento legate, s^u haereditate, quae Testamento continetur. Barrad. lib. 3.
de Euch. c. 5 page 79. Tom. 4.
Jesuit Barradas does consent.

Hereunto may be added Christ's Tropicall Saying in the 6. of John, where Christ
calling that, which he gives to be eaten, his Flesh, in the same Chapter he
calls his Flesh, which is to be eaten of the faithful, Bread. Which none of
your side durst hitherto interpret without a Figure. And yet again, the
Apostle speaking of the Mystical body of Christ, which is his Church,
assembled at the holy Communion, to participate of this Sacrament, says of
them; 1. Cor. 10. 17.
We being many are one bread But why? Even as one Bread consists of many
corns, so does one Church of Christ of many faithful persons, says your
Sicut unus panis ex multis gran^s, etc. Aquia. in cum locum.
Aquinas. But none of you will deny, that the Apostles naming the Communion of
the Faithful to be one Bread, or Loaf, is altogether Figurative.


COllect we now the Parcels abovementioned. First in the word [ This]
necessarily referred to Bread, inferring one Figure in the former Chapters: And
next, in this Section, one Figure, in the word, Broken; Another in the word,
Eat; A third in the word, Drink; A fourth in the word, Given; A fifth and sixth
in the word, Shed: A seventh in the word, Cup: An eighth in the word,
Testament: nine in all, and then your Bellarmines Objection of the word, Shed,
hereafter, in the sixth Book, and 2. Chapter.

* It is no better than Hemlocke which you put into your Disciples mouths, to
stupifie them withal, when you reach them to stand to the Literal words of
Christ, lest that otherwise Christ's speech should be accounted a Lie. First
against your own knowledge, who are not ignorant, that Truth is not opposed to
Figurative, but to False speech: else all the Parables of Christ, which are
altogether Figurative, should be called false; which were Blasphemy to
affirm. And also against the acknowledgement, already specified, confessing
that Bread cannot, in a proper and Literal sense, be truly called Christ's
Body. And the general Rule is, that Truth in a Figurative sense cannot be so
in a Literal; no more than a Literal Truth can be Figurative and Tropicall. *

That the Figurative sense of Christ's words is agreeable to the Judgment of
the more Ancient Church of Rome. SECT. V.
YOur old and public Romish Gloss says plainly; Coeleste Sacramentum, quod
vere repraesentat Christi carnem, dicitur Corpus Christi, sed improprie: unde
dicitur suo more, sed non re^ veritate, sed significante mysterio: ut fit
sensus, vocatur Corpus Christi, id est, significatur. Gloss. Decret. de
Consecrat. Did. 2. Can. Hoc. est.
This heavenly Sacrament, because it does truly represent the flesh of Christ,
is called the Body of Christ, but improperly, not in the truth of the thing,
but in the mystical Sense, to wit, it is called the So your Gloss, which you
may not deny to be the gloss or Tongue of your whole Church, because it has
been confirmed by the same Authority of Pope Gregorius XIII. Papa. In the
privilege before the body of the Canon Law.
Gregory the thirteenth, wherewith your Extravagants, and former Decrees of
Popes have been Authorized.

CHALLENGE.
IF all Protestants should meet at once in one Synod, and should conspire
together, as laboring to prove a figurative Sense in these words of Christ [
This is my Body,] I suppose that a more exact, perspicuous, copious, and
ponderous Proof could not be desired, than hitherto has been evinced from
your own Confessions; grounded as well upon sound and impregnable Reasons, as
upon direct Testimonies of holy Scriptures.

That the former Figurative Sense of the words of Christ is agreeable
YOu will needs defend your literal Exposition by the verdict of Ancient
Fathers, and we appeal to the Venerable Senate both of Greek and Latin
Fathers. The Graeci Patres vocant Eucharistiam (...), quae sunt apud nostros
figurae, Sacramenta, Signa; and haec omnia (...) accepere. Alan. lib. 1. de
Euch. c. 30. p. 383. Diony s. c. 1 de Eccle. Hier. Theod. Dial. 1. Macarius

Greek generally calling the Elements of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament,
Some, Types, Antitypes, and Symbols (that is) Figures and Signs: Some calling
Christ his Speeches Tropical, or Figurative; and his Table Typical: Some
saying that Christ would have his Disciples hereby Represent the image of his
Body. And one as expressly as any Protestant can speak (even Theodoret by
name) that Christ here gave to the Sign the name of his Body, as elsewhere he
gave to his Body the name of the Sign.

And again, (...) Ibid. Origin also in Matthew. 15. calls materiam panis,
Symbolicum corpus.
Christ, as he called the mystical fruit of the Vine, after sanctification,
the Blood of the Lord: So the fruit of the natural Vine did he call the Blood
of the Vine. So he Mark, no otherwise is the Wine in the Eucharist called
Christ's Blood after Consecration, than the juice of the Grape is called The
Blood of the Vine. Which who knows not to be improperly and figuratively
spoken? *

You cannot deny but these Phrases of Signs and Symbols are most frequent in
the writings of all the Greek Fathers, which we take to be a convincing
Argument, until you can


Against the first Romish Answer, touching the word, Type, and Antitype, used
by the Greek Fathers.
Types and Antitypes not to be taken for Signs, but for Examples, is at the
first hearing rejected by your Prima solutio; Vocem Antitypon non accipi pro
Signo, sed pro Exemplari, etc. sed haec opinio facile rejici potest, quia vox
ea nunquam sumitu^ pro exemplari. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 15.
Cardinal, and others.

The Second, alleged out of Damas^en, and much insisted upon by some favorers
of your Romish Sense: namely, that the Fathers should call Bread and Wine
Antitypes; but not after Consecration. So they. And if so, then indeed we
should have no cause to oppose. But this Answer is proved to be apparently
false by your Altera solutio est aliorum, Panem and Vinum Antitypon dic^, sed
ante Consecrationem, non postea; ita respondit olim Ioh. Damasc. lib. 4. de
fide. cap. 14. Et Epi. in 7. Syn. Art. 6. Tom. 3. sed invenimus apud Basilium

Cardinal, and others, out of the express Testimonies of these Greek
Fathers, viz. Dionysius, Areopagita, Clemens, Iustine, Macarius, Basil, and
Nazianzene. The third Answer is your Cardinals own, yet but faintly urged,

sed Antitypa, quia Antitypa non sunt quaelibet figurae, sed illa tantum, quae
nihil fere differunt a veritate. Bellar. ib. quo supra.
Peradventure they called them Antitypes, but not Types after Consecration: and
he is encountered by your Negari non potest quin nonnunquam nomen Typi
inveniatur in Patribus, ut ex Hieronymo paulo ante notavi. Idem reperitur apud
Chrysostomum Hom. 16. ad Heb. and Billius apud Nazianz. Annot in orat. 11. in

Suarez and Billius, acknowledging that the words Types and Antitypes are used
of the same Fathers in one and the same * As does likewise your Jesuit
Vasquez. in 3. Thom. Quest. 78. Artic. 1. Disput. 197. cap. 4. Noster Turtanus
putat non posse hoc Sacramentum vocari Typum corporis Christi: sed been
Antitypon, quin Typus significat figuram rei, quae tem ipsam non continet:
Antitypon autem figuram quae rem ipsam in se habet. -- Haec tamen sententia
mihi non probatur.
Vasques maintain, against your Jesuit Turrian. * This our Objection how
strong it is, may be seen by your much, but vain struggling.

* A Corroboration of the Judgment of Antiquity, in naming None can need any
better Instructor, in this point, than was one (albeit a Protestant) most
conversant in Greek Antiquity, He instanceth most especially in Cyrill of
Jerusalem Cyrillus p. 522. de Chrysmate disserens, ait fideles (...) Locus
ille consideratione digniffimus. Sic enim docet: Quando fideles baptizantur,
eos accipere (...). At de isto Christo ita loquitur: (...) Ecce, opponuntur
(...) Sp. Sancti, and (...). Christum in Baptismo suo accepisse ipsam essentiam
Sp. Sancti in se advenientis: sed nos accipere tantum (...), quod tamen ipse
appellat Sp. Sanctum. Et sane ita passim legimus in S. S. hos aut illos
accepisse Spiritum Sanctum, quum intelligamus non ipsam essentiam Sp. Sancti,
sed vim and (...) Sp. Sancti. Cur non idem dicemus de S. Eucharistia? Patres
vetustissimi dicunt nos in ea accipere (...) corporis Christi: ergo non
accipimus (...): dicitur camen quod accipimus (...); sed eo modo, quo modo
dicebamus capi Sp. Sanctum. Itaque illud etiam quod accipimus dicitur Gratia,
etc. Haec Isaacus Casaub. test filio suo pientissimo Meirico, ex M. S.
Paternis.
telling you that the material oil, wherewith Christians were anointed, was
called by Cyrill the Antitype of Christ's own anointing, which was the Spirit
of God it self. That The essential Spirit of God is opposed to the Antitype,
which was material oil. And, notwithstanding, that the same Antitype is
called by Cyrill the Spirit of God; and after, that the Christians are said to
receive the Spirit; when nevertheless they receive not the essence, but the
Energie and efficacious operation of the same Spirit. That learned man
concludes; The most ancient Fathers (says he) said that we receive the
Antitype of Christ in the Eucharist: Therefore they meant, that we do not
receive it essentially.

You, for want of other support, press the sentence of Cyrill of Alexandria.
Ob. Cyril. Alex. ad Coelosyr. Episc. Ne dubites an verum sit, cum dicit
manifest [Hoc est corpus meum:] sed potens fide tene verba Christi.
Doubt not (says he) of the truth of Christ's speech, when he says manifestly
[This is my Body] but rather believe his words, This is that Testimony of
Cyrill, Jesuit Possevin. Apparat. Tit. Cyrillus Alex. -- Paucos ante annos
edlta est ejus Epistola ad Coelosyr. Episc. [ And Bellarm. seems not to be so
confident hereof, when in objecting this, he had rather remit his Reader to
Garcetius, to see the place, than insist upon the words himself, saying; Solet
citari Epistola ejus ad Coelosyrium, vide locum apud Ioh. Garcetium. Bellar.
lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 26.]
Possevin confesses) yet doubt not we to embrace it in Cyrils sense: who
having now to deal with such Heretics, who taught that Christ had but a
seeming Fantastical Body, does refute them by Christ's speech of this
Sacrament, saying, [ This is my Body.] Which, Sacramentally spoken and
understood, must needs evince, that Christ had a true natural Body in
himself, because this Sacrament was instituted to be a Sign of a true, and
Body, not a Sign of a Figure, but of a real thing: and therefore requires in
the Receiver not fancy, but faith to believe that Christ had a Substantial
body, which is the very Argument of Tertullian See Sect. ^9. following.
afterward, against the same delusion of the said Heretics.

Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. c. 10. Hom. 24. [Quoniam unus panis, and unum corpus
multi sumus.] Quid enim appello, inquit, communicationem? [Idem ipsum corpus
sumus.] Quidnam est panis? [corpus Christi.] Quid autem fiunt qui accipiunt
corpus Christi? non multa, sed [unum corpus.] Nam quemadmodum panis ex multis
granis unitur, ut minime grana appareant, sed tamen grana sunt, verum incerta
discretione conjuncta invicem: ita and nos Christo co^jungimur, non enim alio
corpore tu, alio ille aliter, sed eodem omnes.
Chrysostom, being so eminent a Doctor of the Greek Church, may in no case be
left out: he comparing the Speech of Christ, calling Bread his Body; and the
words of the Apostle, in calling the Company of the faithful Communicants
also the Body of Christ, asks, concerning the first, What is Bread? and
answers, The Body of Christ: and accordingly touching the second, What those
faithful Communicants are made, which receive the Body of Christ? Answers,
They are made the Body of Christ. But the faithful Receivers (as you know) are
not properly Christ's Body.

The only A^nswer that your Cardinal would afford us, is, that Bellar. l. 2.
de Euch. c. 22. Respondet, Loquitur Chrysostomus de pane consecrato.
Chrysostom spoke of Bread Consecrated, and not before Consecration. Which
Answer does fortify our Argument, to show that Chrysostom held it to be
Bread as appears in his other saying concerning the same Consecrated Bread,
or^ Loaf (as it signifies the mystical Body of Christ) in that As Bread is
united of many granes of Corn, not discernable, but yet are still the granes
of Corn, joined secretly one with another. So are we joined together with
Christ his own Body. So Chrysostom. Which words can in no wise be affirmed
of your Romish mere Accidents of Bread, wherein there is no mixture of any
Granes of Corn, or of Union one with another in one Loaf, whereby to betoken
the Union of godly Christians jointly in one Christ. And therefore certainly
Saint Chrysostom believed the continuance of the substantial matter of Bread,
after the words of Consecration.

All these former Testimonies of Antiquity fight as well also by necessary
Consequence against your Individuum vagum, that is, [THIS,] you know not what:
even as Iustine, one of the ancientest of Fathers, does declare, wherein he
says Justin. Quaest. and Resp. ad Graecos. Qu. 229. page 151. (...).
There is not any Thing, but it is [This same Something:] ] So he, according to
Aristotle, denying any thing to be called [ This Thing] properly, which is not
absolutely and determinately This one Individual thing. Your quaintest device
is yet behind.*

A SECOND CHALLENGE, Against the last and most peremptory Romish Pretense,
making Christ in this Sacrament to figure, and to represent himself,
THe Solution, which seems to your Disputers most persuasive, is thus set
down by your Cardinal, and your Jesuit Suarez, viz. Solutio. Eucharistiam
etiam post Con secrationem dici posse Antitypum corporis and sanguinis Domini,
non solum quia species panis and vini sunt figurae corporis and sanguinis
Domini ibi revera existentium, sed etiam quia corpus and sanguis Domini, ut
sunt sab illis speciebus, signa sunt ejusdem corporis and sanguinis, ut fuerunt
in Cruce, repraesentant enim passione^ Christi: and ideo fortassis Basilius. Et
alij Patres non vocant Eucharisti^m figuram aut typum, sed Antitypum etc -- Ita
si Rex aliquis, gravissimo bello confecto, idem ipsum bellum ad oblectamentum
populo in scena praesens seipsum bellantem repraesentare vellet. Bell l. 2 de
Euch. cap. 15. Antitypa corporis and sanguinis Christi dicuntur, quia corpus
and s^nguis Domini, ut sunt sub illis speciebus panis and vini in Eucharistia,
signa sunt corporis passi, and sanguinis estusi in Cruce. Suarez. quo suprap.
554. Graeci Patres cum passim vocant Sacramenta Antitypa, -- nihil aliud sibi
volunt quam habere Sacramenta maximam similitudinem cum ijs rebus, quarum sunt
Sacramenta. Bellar. lib. 1. de S^^^am. in gerere cap. 9.
The Greek Fathers called Bread and Wine, Antitypes, and Signs of the Body
and Blood of Christ, because the same Body and Blood of Christ, as they are in
this Sacrament, under the forms of Bread and Wine, are Signs of the same his
Body and Blood, as they were on the Cross. Like as a King, who having gotten a
vistory in battle, should represent himself in a Stage Play, as in a fight.
So They. But without any Sentence Fathers from using that counterfeit
Testimony, which passes under the name of Saint Augustine, as if he had said;
The flesh of Christ is a Sacrament of his flesh: and inferring from hence, that
The Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is a sign of it self, as it
was upon the Cross.

And they are no small Babes, who vent out this proof; by name Billius com. in
Nazianz. orat. 11. Audiamus quid Augustinus dicit in Prosperi sententijs; Caro
inquit, ejus est, quam forma panis opertam in Sacramento accipimus; sanguis,

sententiam apertissime tuetur Roff^ns and Johan. Hessell Haec Billius.
Billius, Gardener Bishop of Winchester, Claudius Saints (one of name in the
Council of Trent) Fisher Bishop of Rochester, and Hessell. But how prove They

it is not to be found. Whither next? forsooth it is so cited by Peter Lombard,
and there it appears that Peter Lombard had it out of his supposed Brother
Gratian; we say, Gratian, whose books have been lately reproved, and

Gratian, who are the Relators, may be admitted to be the Interpreters of that
coined Sentence, they will say that the word Flesh, there specified, is taken
for the Shape or form of flesh; and the word Blood, for the outward form of
Blood; which spoyleth your Play quite: wherein you will have the Flesh of
Christ under the outward forms and shape, in this Sacrament, and not the
outward forms and shape themselves, to be the Sign of the same Body on the
Cross. So easy it is for Hunters to pursue their Game with loud cries upon a
false sent.

Cardinal, and to Suarez, who invented the Similitude of the Stage Play for
their Answer, which is indeed rather a Childish Playing, than Theological
reasoning; yet it is but a mad sport to argue against Conscience; as this your
Cardinal must needs have done, who See above at ( c)
confessing that the Greek Fathers did therefore call Sacraments, Antitypes,
because of the great Similitude they have with the things they represent; yet
now adventureth to say, that the Body of Christ, as it is in the Eucharist, is
a Sign of the same Body of upon the Cross; notwithstanding the Body of
Christ, as it is in the Sacrament, (according to your own faith) is so Christi
corpus, ut est in hoc Sacramento, nullo oculo humano, vel intellectu Angelico
videri potest. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 53. Art. 7.. 4. and 5. Sub singulis

Invisible, that it cannot be seen of Angels; so Indivisible, that it cannot
be parted or divided; and so Unbloody, that there is not the least tincture of
Blood to be discerned therein.

Wherefore to persuade your Disciples, that those grave Fathers ever taught
that the Invisible, Indivisible, and Unbloody Body of Christ, as in this
Sacrament, was or could be the Sign of his visible, torn, crucified and
bloody Body upon the Antitype, which is (as you call it) the Sea above at ( c)
Greatest Similitude, is all one, as to find out the greatest Similitude in
the greatest Dissimilitude. Which yet is the more intolerable, because it is
against the Confessed Billius. Eucharistiae Sacramentum dicitur Antitypon, et
Typus, seu Symbolum, ratione ^pecierum pa^^s et vini, quae in oculorum sensum
cadunt: et haec est communis ratio, quae a Theologis as^erri solet. Haec ille
Com. in Naz. orat. 11.
Common opinion of your own Divines, who have taught that The Sacrament of the
Eucharist is called Type and Antitype, because of the forms of Bread and Wine.
So your Billius. May you not now discern the notable perverseness of your
Disputers, and that they devised this Stage Play, ad faciendum Populum, to
please and delude their Readers? thereby to fit themselves the better for the
Pageant; whereof we shall be occasioned to say more in the Book 6. c. 5.. 7.

excludit Tropos, praesertim cum addat, excidere a Salute qui non credit: quod
etiam addit ciedendum esse, licet sensus repugnent, apertissime testatur, non
cum loqui de significatione, sed de re ipsa. [ words to be observed in the
Greek are these: (...). The last words show that Insensible is taken according
to power, that is, actively.]
Objection, and our Answer, and then make your own determination, as you shall
think good. Man is said to be made after the Image of God. Epiphanius, not
able to define what this Image consisted in, whether it be man's soul, or
mind, or virtue; notwithstanding resolves thatc All men have the Image of God
in them, but yet not according to nature, namely, that substantial nature
which is in God) because God is Incomprehensible and infinite, etc. This is the
maine point which Epiphanius will now illustrate: but how? By something ( says
your Cardinal) which seems to be that which it is not: And Epiphanius
instanceth in the Eucharist, wherein Christ taking into his hands those things
which the Evangelists do mention, he said of the one [ HOC] This is mine, viz.
Body; and of the other, This is mine, viz. Blood: hereby understanding ( says
your Objector) The Eucharist, which is truly the Body of Christ, although it
seem not to be so, outwardly, being of a round figure, or without sense) and
therefore far unlike to be the Body of Christ. So he. Who, thinking he has
overcome, does raise up his Io, and Triumph, saying, This argument is thoroughly
convincent, because Epiphanius adds, He who believes not the words of
Christ, does fall from Salvation: adding further, that they are to be believed,
although our senses gainesay it.

You have heard the Objection, which seeming to so great a Convincent, you will
give us license to make a full Answer. First, by HOC ET HOC, THIS AND THIS (by
the Interpretation of Epiphanius) are meant, The things which the Evangelist
did mention; and the Evangelist mentioned (as you know) Bread, [He took Bread,
He took the Cup,] meaning Wine in the Cup, namely, according to the Sea above
Chap. 1.. 6.
former general Consent of the Fathers, [HOC] signified Bread in one part of
the Eucharist, and Wine in the other. But Bread neither in the Substance, nor
in the Accidents can be called Christ's Body, without a Trope, as has been See
above Chap. 1.. 4.
Confessed: which is our first confutation of your Cardinal, who concludes
that Epiphanius excludes all Tropes out of Christ's Speech of [HOC.]

Secondly Epiphanius in Ancorato. Habent omnes id quod est secundum Imaginem
Dei, sed non secundum naturam: non enim secundum aequalitatem habent homines,
Deus enim mente inco^ prehensibilis est, cum spiritus sit super omnem spiritu^.
All men (says Epiphanius) have the Image of God, although Then he seeks a
Similitude from the Eucharist, an Image of a thing which seems to be that,
which in nature and equality it is not. Now in the Eucharist there are two
things to be distinguished, the one is the Natural, the other is the
Sacramental Being thereof. The Natural Being of the Elements, as of Bread and
Wine, cannot make this Similitude; because, whether they be taken as Substances
or Accidents, [ Hoc, This] has no proportion with the word which is called [
Meum] meaning Christ's Body, because the Hoc (as Epiphanins says) is a Round
figure. But as Hoc Hoc are Sacramental Images, representing Meum and Meum,
Christ's Body and Blood: the Bread broken to betoken his Body crucified, and the
Wine poured out apart, to signify Christ's Blood Shed: so will the Similitude
be most Harmonicall. Even as Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, although they
differ in nature, yet are they representative Signs and Images of the Body and
Blood of Christ. So the Image of God in man, has a resemblance of the Godhead,
although in respect of Nature and Equality it be as different as Finite and
Infinite, Comprehensible and Incomprehensible. According to which Analogicall,
Mystical, and acramentall sense, upon the hearing of these words of
Epiphanius, Whosoever will not believe Christ's words, as he said, falls from
grace, we willingly shall say Amen. The rather, Epiphanius being an Adversary
to the Marcionites, who denied Christ to have a True Body, but only
Fantastical, notwithstanding whatsoever proof from men's senses, who saw and
felt them; they could not digest the Faith of the Romish Church, which teaches
that that, which Epiphanius calls Bread after Consecration, should be
(contrary to the Demonstration of ^oure Senses, as of Seeing, Smelling, Feeling
and Tasting) mere Accidents.

Thirdly (a place as observable as any other) He says of this, [ Hoc] round
figure, and differing in nature and proportion from that [ Meum] which is the
Body of Christ, that it is (...), Insensible: But how, Passively? as not being
able to be perceived? No, for then it could not be perceived to be Round. But
Actively, as not able to perceive any thing, in which respect he opposes it
to [ Meum,] which is the Body of Christ. Which again manifestly contradicts
the abominable common doctrine of your Church, as you have heard, of Believing
the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, to be unable either to see or
hear, or exercise any faculty of sense without a Miracle; as is showed, Book.
4. Chap. 9. Sect. 2.

In the last place I require Justice from your selves against a Proctor of
yours. The Case is this: Bellarmine said (quoth I) that Epiphanius taught, We
are to believe these words of Christ, although they be repugnant to our senses:
which last words [ Although they be repugnant to our senses] said I, No man of
sense can find in Epiphanius. This says the Proctor is a false Taxation. And
I, for my Justification, shall desire Bellarmines own words, Hic locus
Epiphanij omnino convincit, quia addit etiam (nimirum Epiphanius) Hoc esse
credendum, licet sensus repugnent. And now when you shall sum up the Premises,
you will easily judge how the Testimony of Epiphanius will be held to be
Convincent.

That the same Greek Fathers have expressly unfolded their Meanings, touching a
Figurative Sense. SECT. VIII.
THe Judgment of a whole Council of Greek Fathers may well Trullo, alluding to
these words of Christ, [ This is my Body] saying, Let nothing be offered, but
the Body and Blood of Christ, that is (say In sanctis nihil plus quam corpus
and sanguis Christi offeratur, ut ipse Dominus tradidit, hoc est panis and
vinu^ aqua mixtum. Council. Constant. apud Binium, [which Canon was made against
the Aqua^ij ( those who would use no Wine) Can. 32.] called Synodus quinisexta.
They) Bread and Wine, etc. If we had not told you that this had been the
speech of Greek Fathers in a Council, you would have conceived they had bin
uttered by some Heretic, as your Charity uses to call us Protestants. Neither
may the Authority of this Council be rejected by you, as unlawful in the point
of the Sacrament, because your Binius, in opposing against some things in this
Council, yet never took any Exception against this Canon.

We may not let pass another Testimony, used by the ancient Father See above,.
6. at the Let. (x).
Theodoret, namely, That Christ called the Bread his Body, as he called his
Body Bread, Matthew. 12. saying thereof, Except the grane of wheat die, etc.
insomuch that interchangably in the one place, He gave to the Sign the name of
his Body, and in the other, He gave to his Body the name of the Sign. So he.
As Protestantly as either Calvin or Beza could speak. And you cannot deny, but
that when Christ called his Body Bread, it was an improper and Figurative
speech. And therefore, if you will believe Theodoret, you are compellable to
confess, that Christ, in calling Bread his Body, meant it not in a proper and
literal sense.

* We were about to proceed, but that your Doctor Heskins will needs cross us
in our way, by objecting the Current of Oecumenius in his Exposition of those
words of the Apostle, We are all one Body, inasmuch as we are partakers of
one Bread, saying: Dr. Heskins in his Parliam. of Christ. Book 3. C. 28.
Oecu^. in 1. Cor. 11. Quid est panis? Corpus Christi: Quid efficiunturij qui
participant? Corpus sane Christi, quia ait Apostolus, [unus panis, and unum
corpus sumus, quia de uno pane participamus] ex multis namque granis (ut
exempli gratia loquamur) unus panis factus est; and nos multi ex uno pane
participantes efficimur unum corpus Christi.
What is one Bread? the Body of Christ: and what are they made that partake of
this one Bread? The Body of Christ: for this one Bread is made of many granes,
and we being many partakers of one Bread, are made one Body. Hence your Doctor;
In my judgment this needs no explanation: for asking a question [what is
Bread?] he answers, [The Body of Christ.] Note then (Reader) he says not it
is a Sign of Christ's Body, but the Body of Christ VERILY, where he speaks
both of the Bread partaken, which he says is Verily Christ's Body; and also of
the Partakers, who be made the mystical So he.

And so we think he does; but then must not your Popish, be this Catholic
faith, because Oecumenmus calls (so) Bread the Body of Christ Sacramentally,
as he calls the Partakers of the same Bread, or Loaf, the mystical Body of
Christ. But the Partakers and Communicants are Christ's mystical Body only
Figuratively, and by Analogy; therefore the Bread is named the Natural Body of
Christ Figuratively, and as the Symboll thereof; as Christ himself calls
Bread, after Consecration; and, as Oecumenius notes, such Bread as consists
of many granes of Corn; which must needs be Substantially Bread, thereby to
represent the people, consisting of many Persons in one Communion. ^o but
Oecumenius (says your Doctor) speaking of Bread, called Christ's Body, names
it VERILY Christ's Body, which is (if it be lawful to speak rudely) a
very-Lye. For the words, Vere Corpus Christi, Verily Christ's Body, are
attributed to the Partakers of the Bread, which are the mystical Body of
Christ; and not either to the Bread, or Natural Body of Christ. Hitherto of
the Greek Fathers.

That the same Figurative Sense of Christ's words is avouched by the Testimonies
of the Latin Fathers; more largely (now) insisted on. SECT. IX.
Figurative sense, but this they do even by a Figure called As is afterward
many where is discovered.
Hyperbole, that is, only in the excess of Speech, thereby to abstract the
minds of sensual men from fixing their thoughts upon external Rites, and to
raise them up to a Sacramental and Spiritual Contemplation of the Body and
Blood of Christ. But as for the direct and perspicuous Sentences of these
Fathers, they clearly and exactly teach a Figurative sense in the words of
Christ; (to wit) Tertull. contra Marcion. lib. 4. page 233. Edit Paris.
Profellus est Christus se concupivisle edere Pascha ut suum: indignum enim ut
aliquid alienum concupisceret Deus: acceptum panem and distributum Discipulis
corpus suum fecit, Hoc est corpus meum dicendo, id est, Figura corporis mei:
figura enim non fuisset, nisi veritatis esset corpus. Caeterum vacua res, quod
est phantasma, figuram capere non potest.
Tertullian whose words are as plain as any glass can be, saying of Christ,
He distributed his Body, that is, a Sign of his Body.

*The Fantastike Marcionites held, that Christ had no essential Body, but
only a figurative, and Fantastical. These Heretics Tertullian confuteth by
Christ his Institution of the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, (as the At the
let. ( p.)
Margin will show you) thus: Nothing that is fantastical is capable of a
figure; because this were to make a sign of a Sign, But Christ in this
Sacrament gave a Sign of his Body: Therefore Christ had (namely, in himself)
a Real and Substantial Body, and not fantastical. That he gave a Figure of
his Body, he proves out of the Gospel, where he is found desirous to eat
his own Passover with his Disciples, when taking Bread, he made it his Body,
saying, This is my Body, that is a figure of my Body. So he, as Protestantly as
can be spoken.

Which our Collection, your miserable shift, how to rid your selves of it,
does rather confirm unto us; Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 7. Illud
Tertulliani [Hoc est corpus meum] Id est, non significat panem Eucharis^^ae
esse siguram corporis Domini, sed quod fuit olim figura in Testamento veteri,
nunc in veritatem corporis mutatum esse -- Conjungitur enim figura corporis
mei, cum hoc, ut sit sensus, Hoc, Id est, Panis qui olim fuit figura corporis
mei.
The (says your Cardinal) THIS, that is, This Bread which was once (namely,
in the old Testament) a sign of my Body. So he. O the profundity of this
Answer! Is a Sign, says Tertullian; that is, Was a Sign, says your
Cardinal. If one, saying of the Sunrising, It is in the East, and your
Cardinal should comment, saying, that is, It was in the East; would you
believe him? And that Tertullian meant directly that the Bread, which he now
spoke of, signified not the Bread of the Old Testament, but the Bread of the
Eucharist, as it was a Sign then representing the Body of Christ; Tertullian
observes that Christ (concerning the participating of the Eucharist) said,
That he desired to eat his own Passover; meaning, the Eucharist, as
distinct from the Jewish Passover. Next, because he confuteth the Heretics,
who denied that Christ had a true Body, by this Sacrament, because Bread herein
was a figure of a Body, And Christ's figures were not of things only imaginary;
but also real and essential.

And this is confessed by your Jesuit Maldon. Ies. de sacra Euchar.. 13.
Conjectura. page 295. Dicet aliquis cur Tertullianus figuram vocavit potius
quam veritatem. Respons. Id propositam quaellionem postulasse, volebat enim
probare contra Marcionitas, Christum habuisse verum corpus, quia illi negare
non poterant fuisse Eucharist^am figuram corporis. Si autem fuit sigura, fuit
veritas: quia fantasma siguram non caperet.
Maldonate, to have been the Argument of Tertullian, who once again Bread his
Body, in saying, [ This is my Body] as the Prophet Jeremy called his Body,
Bread, in saying, Let us put Wood upon his Bread, meaning his Body. So
Tertullian, showing them both to be spoken equally in a figurative sense. These
are so directly repugnant to your Romish doctrine, that one of your Church, in
his Admonition before the words of Tertullian, seems to impute unto
Tertullian. the Heresy (which you commonly lay to the charge of us
Protestants) Beat. Rhe^^n. Admonit. ante lib. Tertull. Error putantium corpus
Christi esse tantum sub sigura, condemnatur est.
Of thinking the Body of Christ to be only in a figure in this Sacrament of
the Eucharist.

Next, Cyprian, thus; Cyprian. Sermon. de Vact. Et significantia and significata
ijsdem vocabuliscenserentur.
Things signifying and signified, are called by the same words. Upon the which
ground he made bold to say, that Christ's Body is Created in this Sacrament: by

After consecration

*Whereupon we are compelled to complain against your Cardinal Bellarmine,
who even there, where he professedly labors to extract, out of the Fathers,
your Romish sense from the words of Christ [ This is my Body] for a proof of
the literal exposition thereof, as they sound, [ This is my Body] and not as
Protestants teach, This signifies my Body; misallegeth the words of Saint
Ambrose to his own purpose, thus; Before the Benediction of Christ's words
This is my Body] one kind of thing is named, and after Consecration ] instead
of these words [ After the Consecration, Bellar. lib 4. de Eucharist. cap 13..

Domini, in quibus Sacramentum conficitur, recitans illa [Hoc est, etc.] Et in

ante benedictionem verborum coelestium alia species nominatur, post
consecraticnem corpus Christi est.
the Body of Christ is signified.] Just Protestantwise, as can be. Do but now
tell us, how you wish we should censure this Error; whether as a wilful
Falsity? and then should you eclipse his Credit and Authority: or else only as
a Temeritie? and then ought you to Censure as indifferently of such escapes (if
any such happen) of Protestants, according to the Law of Equity -- Veniam
petimusque Damusque vicissim.

Saint Augustine ( whom one of your profession has of late Aug. lib. 3. de
Doctr. Christ. Figurata locutio. Idem cont. Adimant. Manich. cap. 12. Non
dubitavit dicere, [Hoc est corpus meum] cum signu^ daret corporis sui. Idem
Epist. 23. ad Bonifac. Tom 9. Sacramenta propter similitudinem earum rerum,
quas repraesentant, plerunque etiam ipsarum rerum nomina accipiunt. Sicut ergo
secundum quendam modum Sacramentum corporis Christi, corpus Christi; et
Sacramentum sanguinis Christi, sanguis Christi: ita Sacramentum fidei sides est
-- Sicut de ipso Baptismo ait, Consepulti sumus per baptismum in mortem
Christi: non dicit, sepulturam significamus, sed prorsus ait, Consepulti sumus.
-- Sacramentum igitur tantae rei non nisi ejusdam rei vocabulo nuncupavit. [
And intripreting that which he called Fidei Sacramentum, he sa (...):]
Respondetur, Parvulum baptizatum credere propter fidei Sacramentum.
Sacraments ( says he) for the very Similitude and likeness, wihich they have
with the things whereof they are Sacraments, do often take the names of those
things which they do signific, as when the Sacrament of Christ's Body ( says
he) is after a certain manner called the Body of Christ. But how? He adds
(as if he had meant to stop the Mouths of all Opposites) or Sign of so great
a thing by the name of the thing signified thereby. So he, even the same He,
who will be found like himself in the following passages of this and other
books, especially when we shall handle the Manner of eating of Christ's Body,
which Augustine will challenge to be Figuratively meant.

* Your Answerers are so puzzled with Saint Augustine his Testimonies, that you
may doubt whether rather to pity their perplexities, or else to hate their
perverseness; as you may see by another Testimony of the same Father, Aug.
con. Adimant. cap. 12. Scriptum est, sanguinem precoris animam ejus esse. --
Possum interpretari praeceptum illud in signo esse positum: non enim dubitavit
Christus dicere, Hoc est corpus meum, cum signum dedit corporis sui.
Christ doubted not to say, [This is my Body,] when he gave a Sign of his
Body: even as (he says) he might interpret that Scripture, Deuteronomy. 12.
The blood of the Beast is the life of the Beast: The blood is a sign thereof.
Where his sole aim is to expound the Verb [Est,] to be no more than it Is a
Sign or Signifies. But whether (as your Bell. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 24. [ in
his two last, as it were in his best Answers.] Aug. intelligere non nudum
signum, sed cum re ipsa conjunctum: nec corporis absentis, ut sanguis signum,
non animae absentis. 2. Sol. Signum corporis immolari in Cruce.
Cardinal fancieth) it was a Sign of Christ's Body present in the Eucharist,
or rather as absent after, on the Cross, Aug. regards not to mention, but
merely to teach here (which he does more exactly elsewhere) that wheresoever
Sign is called by the name of the thing signified) the speech is Figurative;
as Christ by the Apostle is called Rock; August. quaest. super Levit. cap. 57.
Non est dictum, Petra significat Christum, sed Petra erat Christus: sic solet
loqui Scriptura, res significa^tes, tanquam res quae significantur, appellans.
and Tract. 77.
It is not said, (says Saint Augustine) The Rock signifies Christ, but, the
Rock is Christ: which is usual (says he) in Scripture, which calls signs
of things by the names of the things themselves, which are signified thereby.

It will not be impertinent to adjoyne hereunto your Jesuitical Interpretation
of these words of the Apostle, [The ] and after to compare it with this of
Saint Augustine, that thereby we may the better discern Light from darkness
Ia^. Gordon. Ies. lib. Controv. 3. cap. 7. number. 21. [Petra erat Christus, 1.
Cor. 10.] Germanus and literalis sensus non est iste, Petra significat
Christum, ut putant Adversarij, qui ex hoc loco contendunt probare, verbum sub
stantiv^n, Est, aliquando usurpari pro, significat, ut inde facilius ign^ris
persuadeant verbum, Est, in verbis Christi idem valere quod significat.
The Literal and Proper Sense of these words (says he) is not that which our
Adversaries (meaning Protestants) do hold [The Rock signified Christ:]
contending hereupon to prove that the Verb [EST] is sometime used for
[SIGNIFIETH] that thereby they may the more easily persuade that the word [EST]
in Christ's Speech is the same, in Sense, with [SIGNIFIETH.] So he. What
Heretic could have more confronted Saint Augustine, The Rock was Christ] to
be in true Sense, Did Signify Christ? Secondly, that [ Est] elsewhere is used
in Scripture for [ Significat:] in both which Saint Augustine is as absolute an
Adversary; and yet no more in these than, indeed, in the whole Cause
concerning the Corporal presence of Christ in this Sacrament.

And the cause of Saint Augustines interpretation is plain: For Adimantus the
Manichee objected to the Jew; Aug. cont. Adimant. quo sap. Adimantus
Manichaeus ^it, secundum intellectum Iudaeorum, qui dicunt sanguinem esse
animam, sequi, etc.
That they understood by the other Text [The blood of the Beast is the soul
thereof] not that it was contained in the soul, or joined with the soul: but
that it is the soul it self. This is that Literal interpretation, which
Augustine declineth, and expounds the words as spoken Figuratively, Sign,
for the thing signified, as See above at the letter ( u).
he did in the speech of Christ, saying of Bread, This is my Body. And does
not Cyril. Hier. Catech. Mistag. 2 (...).
Cyril call Baptism the Antitype of Christ's Passion?

Saint Augustine desires to have one word more. Aug. in lib. Sent. Prosperi.
De Consecrat. Did. ^^ Cap. -- Hoc est quod dicimus sicut ergo coelestis panis,
qui Christi caro est, suo modo vocatur corpus Christi, cum revera sit Sacrame^.
u n corporis Christi; illius videlicet quod visibile, quod palpabile, (...)
mortale in cruze positum est, vocaturque ipsa immolatio carnis, quae Sacerdotis
manibus sit, Christi passio, mors, crucifixio: non rei veritate, sed
significante mysterio.
The says he) which is Christ's flesh, is called after a manner the Body of
Christ, when as indeed it is the Sacrament of Christ's Body, to wit, of that
Body which is visible, palpable, mortal: and the Immolation of his flesh,
which is done by the hands of the Priest, is called Christ's Passion, Death,
and Crucifixion, but not in the verity of the thing, but in a Significant
mystery. So he. Which words, if they should need a Comment, can have no
better, than is your own public privileged Romish Gloss upon them, saying,
Gl^ssa in eum locum. [Coelestis] Id est Coeleste Sacramentum, quod vere
repraesentat Christi carnem, dicitur corpus Christi, sed improprie; unde
dicitue suo modo, non rel veritate; sed signisicante mysterio, ut sit sensus,
vocatur corpus Christi, id est, Significat.
The Heavenly Sacrament, which truly represents IMPROPERLY, where it is said
to be after a certain manner the Body of Christ. There are four principal
Observables in this one sentence of Saint Augustine.

I. Your Doctors have vilified our Sacrament, because we, judging it to be
Bread, do but only account it a Sacrament of Christ's Body; Saint Augustine
does here reprove them, as directly as if he had said, Though it be but a
Sacrament of Christ's Body, yet is it to be esteemed as Heavenly Bread. II. As
often as you read of the Bread called Christ's Body, you strain it to your
own sense, as directly demonstrating Christ's Body: Saint Augustine tells
Sacrament of his Body. III. Yea but (say your Doctors) The Body of Christ
herein is a Sacrament and ^gne of himself, as he was on the Cross: Nay will
S. Augustine say, not so, for the Body of Christ is Invisible, and insensibl^
unto us; but the Sacrament is a thing representing unto us a visible, palpable,
and mortal Body of Christ. IV. Your men are still instant to interpret it of
Christ's Body Corporally present therein; and S. Augustine offers to The
thing in the hands of the Priest is so called Christ's Flesh, as his Immolation
of Christ's Body, herein, is called Christ's Passion: and that it is not
properly, and lively so meant, but [Suo modo] that is, (as your own Gloss
expounds it) IMPROPERLY. Can any thing be more repugnant to your Romish
Doctrine of this Sacrament; than this one Testimony of Saint Augustine is from
point to point?

The Bp. Facundus, who lived about the year 546. (an Author much magnified by
your Iac. Sirmundus. Ies. Epist. Dedic. ante lib. Facundi. Maximam Romanae
sedis potestatem celebrat. and Baron. Ann. Chri. 546. number. 24. Prudentissimus
Ecclesiasticus Agonistes Facundus.
Jesuit, as one who extolleth the Authority of the Sea of Rome; and by your
Cardinal, as a most wise Champion of the Church) must needs deserve of you so
much credit, as to think that he would write nothing, concerning this Sacrament
of Christ, which he judged not to be the received Catholic doctrine of that
his Age. He Facundus l. 9. defens. Trin. Cap. 5. Sacramentum Adoptionis
suscipere dignatus est Christus: and quando circumcisus est, and quando
baptizatus: and potest Sacramentum Adoptionis, Adoptio, nuncupari, sicut
Sacramentum corporis and sanguinis ejus, quod est in pane and poculo
consecrato, corpus ejus and sanguinem dicimus: non quod proprie id Corpus ejus
sit Panis, and poculum sanguis, sed quod in se mysterium Corporis and sanguinis
continet.
The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, which is in the Bread and Cup,
we call his Body and Blood, not that it is properly his Body and Blood, but
because it contains a mystery of his Body and Blood. Just the dialect of
Protestants. Your Jesuit vainly laboring to rectify this sentence, by the
sentences of other Fathers, in the end is glad to persuade the Readers to
pardon this Father Facundus: If Peradventure ( Idem. Sirmundus Ies. Annot. in
locum istum Facundi. page 404. Quod si durius hic fortasse and obscurius
quippiam locutus videatur, dignus est venia, and qui a benigno interpret vicem
officij recipiat, quod and alijs studise, quorum dicta notabantur, non semel
exhibuit.
says he) he has spoken somewhat more harshly or obscurely, as one who
himself having interpreted other men's Sayings favorably, may deserve the like
Courtesy of others. Thus that Jesuit. But what Pardon can the Jesuit
himself merit Obscure, and dark, which the Father Facundus himself, by a
Similitude, makes as clear as day, Thus; As Christ, being Baptized, received
the Sacrament of Adoption: the Sacrament of Adoption may be called Adoption;
even as the Sacrament of Christ's Body is called Christ's Body. A saying which
in your Church of Rome is now accounted a downright Heresy. *

We shall take our Farewell of the Latin Fathers, in the Testimony of Bish.
Isidore, who will give you his own Reason, why Bread his Body: Isidor.
Hispalensis. Panis, quem frangimus, corpus Christi est, qui dicit, Ego sum
panis vivus, etc. Vinum autem sanguis ejus est, and hoc est quod scriptum est,
Ego sum vitis vera. Sed Panis, quia confirmat Corpus, ideo corpus Christi
nuncupatur: Vinum autem quia sanguinem operatur in carne, ideo ad sanguinem
Christi resertut -- Haec autem sunt visibilia, sanctificata tamen per spiritum
Sanctum, in Sacramentum divini corporis transeunt. Lib. 1. de Offic. cap. 18.
Bread ( says he) because it strengthens the Body, is therefore called the
Body of Christ: and Wine, because it makes Blood, is therefore referred to
Christ's Blood: but these two being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, are changed
into a Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ. So he.

by his parallelling it with Baptism:) And Baptism being One, represents the
propriety of its Sensible Substance of Water. These are as direct, as ever
Bucer or Calvin could speak. Somewhat more, for Corroboration sake.

But yet by the way, if we shall consult with Bertram de Corpore and sanguine
Domini (after that he had cited Ambrose, Hierome, Austine, Origin, and
Fulgentius) says. Animadvertat (clarissime Princeps) sapientia vestra. quod
positis sanctarum ^rupturarum testimonijs, and sanctorum Patrum dictis,
evidentissime monstratum est, quod panis, qui corpus Christi, and Cal^s qui
sanguis Christi appellatur, figura sit, qu^a mysterium: and quod non parva
differe^^, (...) corpus, quod per mysterium existit, and corpus quod passum
est. Quia hoc proptum Servatoris corpus ^st, nec in eo aliqua figura est, sed
ipsa rei manifestatio -- At in isto quod per mysterium geritur, figura est non
solum proprij Christi corporis, verumetiam credentis in Christum populi.
Bertram, to know what he has observed both out of Scriptures, and Testimonies
of Ancient Fathers, (by name, and Fulgentius) he does tell his Prince, and
Emperor, that They demonstrate, that the Bread which is called the Body of
Christ, is a figure, because a Mystery, and that there is no small difference
between the same Body, which is the Mystery, and the Body which was
crucified; for that this is the proper Body of Christ, and no figure, but a
manifestation. But in that which is done by a Mystery, there is a figure both
of the proper Body of Christ, and also of the people that believe in him.

The same Orthodoxe Fathers of Primitive times (thirteen in number) have told
us already that Christ called See above. B. 2. Cha^. 1 Sect. 6.
Bread his Body, which has been the overthrow of your Romish Expositions of
Christ's speech, as you have heard: Cyprian, saying, that Christ created his
own Body, thereby (as your ^yp ian. See Book 3. (...). 4 Sect. 2. (in (...)
second Edi^ion)
Cardinal confessed) meaning Bread. The Fathers of the Council of Carthage,
forbidding any thing to be offered in this mystery but Bread and Wine, mixed
with Water, deliver their Canon thus; Conc. Car^^ag. Tempare Bont^^, Can 37. Or
(...) L^tta. apud Bin. Canon. 4. In Sacramento corporis and sanguinis Domini
nihil amplius offeratur, quam quod Dominus prodidit, hoc est, Panis and V^num
aqua mixtum. [ Which is a most corrupt Transtation, and ought to be thus:
Nihil amplius quam corpus and sanguis Domini, id est, Panis and Vinum.] Which
is recorded, De Consecrat. Cap. In Sacramento. [ It can be no Answer to say,
that they meant the Lay^^ffering before Consecration, because they call that
Offering, now spoken of, The Body and Blood of Christ, which all know to be
spoken Sacerdotally, before it was consecrated.
That nothing in those sacred mysteries be offered more than the Body and Blood
of Christ, as Christ himself has ordained. That is (say they) than the Bread
and Wine. Hereby plainly teaching, that as they are called Christ's Body and
Blood, in their Sacramental and Mystical use and signification; so are they
Bread and Wine, in their proper essence. The foresaid Canon is registered among
the Papal Decrees. The Heretic Novatus binding some Receivers of the
Eucharist to his part, by saying, Eusebius. lib. 6. Cap. 35. Verba Novati
Eucharistiam sumpturo: Iura mihi per corpus and sanguinem Domini, te nunquam me
deserturum, etc. Whereupon Eusebius; Miser ille homo non prius degustavit, --
Graec. (...), etc. Here the Translator omitteth, in his Translation, the word,
(...), Bread.
Swear to me, by the Body and Blood of Christ, not to depart from me:
Hereupon Eusebius; So the miserable man did not receive that Bread, before he
had said, Amen; that is, given consent to the Motion of Novatus. Where we find
Eusebius calling it Bread, which had been Consecrated by Novatus, and named
The Body of Christ. This our Collection may be held so much the rather of some
force, because Christoferson, Bishop of Chichester, (according to his guise
els-where) did fairly leave out the word [ Bread,] but is a foul fault in a
Translator of an History.

Will you have any more? you may admit into the same Cuire these other
Suffrages of Cyprian, Hierome, Eucherius, and Primasius. See afterward B. 6.
C. 3.. ^.
Melchizedech in his Oblation of Bread and Wine offered the Body and Blood of
Christ, Calling that the Body and Blood of Christ, which then, before Christ
his incarnation in the flesh, could be essentially nothing but Bread and Wine,
because it was only a Type of the Body and Blood of Christ to come. And what
will you say to the other See afterward B. 6. C. 5.. 11.
Fathers, who affirmed hereof in as full an Emphasis, that Christ is still
Crucified, bleeding, and slain in this Sacrament? notwithstanding that our
Christian Faith, generally believed, denies that this can happen to his
glorified Body, now after his Resurrection; and therefore such Phrases were to
be understood of the breaking of the Bread, and pouring out of Wine,
Sacramentally and Analogically, (that is) Figuratively representing the
Crucifying of his Body, and Shedding of his Blood. The Fathers, who used this
accent of speech, were Alexander and Gregory, both Popes of Chrysostom,
Cyprian, Hierome, Cyrill of Jerusalem, Hesychius, Paschasius, Eusebius
Emissenus, Enough, one would think, to silence all Oppositions of them, who are
instant in nothing more than in pressing the Improprieties of the speeches of
Antiquity, in a literal sense, and hereby verifying that Proverb of Solomon;
Qui nimis emu^git, elicit sanguinem. Even so they, who by the same Reason,
whereby they urge the sayings of Fathers literally, for the proof of an
unbloody Sacrifice, properly so called, must be constrained likewise ^o admit,
against the Catholic faith of all Christians, a Sacrifice properly slain and
bloody therein.

Hyperboles and the Excessive terms of Antiquity, viz. of Tearing Christ's
Body, and dying our teeth in his Blood, and the like, (in the Book 5.
thorow-out.
fifth Book:) and from their checking their own Phrase of offering the
Sacrifice of his Body, by recalling and correcting themselves immediately thus;
Or rather a Memorial thereof, (in the Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 6.
sixth Book.) All these Observations are as demonstrable, for the vindicating
of the judgment of Ancient Fathers, as any Child of the Catholic Church could

We return to our former Argument. Christ Instituting a Sacrament, and in
Taking Bread and Blessing Bread, saying, [ This is my Bodie] must necessarily
be understood to have spoken Sacramentally, that is, Figuratively, as has
been prooved from Scripture; as in all other Sacraments, so likewise in the
several confessed Figurative words of Christ, concerning this Sacrament, by
eight several Instances (in this second Book.) This one Argument of it Calvin
[Murus ahaeneus] that is, a wall of brass, and so will it be found more
evidently to be, when you shall perceive the same Book 3. thorrow-out.
Fathers judging that, which they call a Change into Christ's Flesh, to be but
a Change into the Sacrament of his Flesh; bread still remaining the same, (in
the third Book.) *

And now we are to withstand your paper-bullets, wherewith you vainly
attempt, in your Objections following, to batter our defense withal.

Phrase must be taken in the literal Sense.

CHALLENGE.
What is this? are Figurative speeches never used in Covenants, and
Testamentarie Language? or is there not therefore sufficient perspicuity in
Figures? This is your rash and lavish Assertion, for you your selves do teach
that In ipsa Scriptura dicitur Testamentum, and Instrumentum -- Quia pacta Dei
and soedera inita nobiscum continent, ut patet in pacto Circumcisionis cum
Abrahamo. -- Ante omnia praefamur S. Scripturam uti Metaphoris, non solum ob

The Old and New Testament are both full fraught with multitude of Secondly,
That the Scripture, speaking of the Trinity, and some divine things, cannot
but speak Improperly and siguratively. Thirdly, That Sacramental speeches,
as, [The Rock was Christ,] and the like words re See above, Chap. 2. Sect 3.
let [c.]
Tropicall and Figurative. Fourthly, That even in the Testamentary Speech of
Christ, at his Institution of this Sacrament, saying, [This Cup is the New
Testament in my Blood:] there is a Figure in the very word See above, Chap. 2
Sect. 4. ( p. q.)
Testament. So have you confessed, and so have you consequently confuted your
own Objection.

Hereto might be added the Testament of Jacob, prophesying of his sons, and
saying, Genesis 49.
Reuben is my strength: Judah a Lions Whelpe: Issachar a strong Ass: Dan an
Adder in the way. All figurative Allusions. Nay, no man, in making his
Testament, can call it his Will, or say that he has set his hand and Seal
unto it, without Figures. Namely, that he has given by writing a
Signification of his Will; that the Subscription was made by his Hand; and that
he added unto it the Print of his Seal. These Three, Will, Hand, Seal, every
word Figurative, even in a Testament.


Laws and Precepts ( say Verba Legum and Praeceptorum debent este propria.
Bellar lib 1 de Eucharist. cap 9.. Sequitur.
you) should be in plain and proper words: But in the Speech of Christ,
[Take; eat you, etc.] are words of Command; Ergo, They may not be held
Figurative.


CAn you be Ignorant of these Figurative Precepts, viz. of Pulling out a man's
own eye, of cutting off his hand? Mat. 5. Or ye of a Penitents Renting of his
heart? Joel 2. Or of not hardening his heart? Psalm 95. and the like. Christ
commanded his Disciples to prepare for his keeping the Passover with his
Disciples, and the Disciples prepared the Passover as Jesus commanded them,
says the Luc. 22. 8.
Evangelist. In this Command is the word [ Passover.] We demand, The word,
Passover, (which is taken for the Sacrament and Sign of the Passover) is it
taken Figuratively? You cannot deny it. And can you deny that a Commandment
may be delivered under a Figurative Phrase? You can both, that is, say and
gainsay any thing, like false Merchants, only so far as things may, or may
not make for your own advantage.

But (to catch you in your own snare) your Doctrine of Concomitancy is this,
viz. Bread, being turned into Christ's Body, is jointly turned into whole
Christ; and Wine, being changed into his Blood, is likewise turned into whole
Christ, both Flesh and Blood. If then when Christ commanded his Disciples,
saying, Matthew. 26. 27.
Drink you All of this, ] that which was Drunk was the whole substantial
Body of Christ, either must his Disciples be said to have Drunk Christ's Body
properly, or else was the Command of Christ figuratively spoken. To say the
first, contradicts the universal expression of man's speech in all Languages;
for no man is said to drink Bread, or any solid thing. And ^o grant the
Second, that the speech is Figurative, contradicts your own Objection.
Again, Christ commanded to Eat his Body; yet notwithstanding have Three Se^
above, Chapter 2.. 4. ( l.)
Jesuits already confessed that Christ's Body cannot be said to have been
properly Eaten, but Figuratively only. What fascination then has perverted
your Judgments; that you cannot but still confound your selves, by your
contrary and thwarting Languages?

Your third Romish Objection. SECT. III.
DOctrinall and Dogmaticall speeches ( say Praecipua dogmata, etc Bellar. quo

Doctrinall.

CHALLENGE.
A Man would marvel to hear such seely and petty Reasons to be propounded
by those, who are accounted great Clerks, and those who know full well that
the speech Castrating or gelding of a man's self, is Abulen. in eum lo^um.

wounded himself by that literal Exposition, in his youth, He in his Age,
expounding the words of Christ, concerning the Eating of his flesh, said of the
literal sense thereof, that, Origin. Litera haec occidit. in Levit. Hem 7.
It kills. Secondly, these words [ This is the New Testament in my Bood,]
they are words as Doctrinall as the other [ This is my Body:] and yet
figurative, by See above cap. 2.. 4.
Confession. Thirdly, the words of Christ, John 6. of Eating his flesh, are
Doctrinall; and yet, by your own Verus and he ral^s Sensus horum verborum non

Construction, are not to be properly understood, but as Christ afterward
expounds himself, Spiritually. Fourthly, where Christ thus said, The Bread,
which I shall give, is my stesh, Ioh. 6. 51. he says also of his Body, that it
is True Bread, Ver. 32. and Bread of life, Verse 48. and living Bread, whereof
whosoever eats lives eternally, Verse 5^. All, Divine and Doctrinall
Assertions, yet was his Body figuratively called Bread. Fifthly, that in those
words of Christ to Peter, Matthew. ^6. Upon And, To thee will I give the keys of
the Kingdom of Heaven; And Ioh. 21. Feed my sheep; (In which texts of
Scripture you place, although most falsely, your Doctrinall foundation of
Popedom it self;) yet know you all these to be Tropicall Speeches. Yea, and
what say you to the first Doctrinall Article, and foundation of Christian
Doctrine, delivered by God unto man, in the beginning, Genesis 3. 15.
The seed of the woman shall break the Serpents head? Is not the later part of
the Article altogether Figurative, yet signifying this Doctrinall point, even
the vanquishing of the power of Satan, who has neither head nor tail, but is
Metaphorically called a Serpent?


T He Apostles (says your Bell. Apostoli rudes and simplices erant etc. Lib.
1. de Euch. c. 9.. Argumentum secundum.
Cardinal) were rude and simple: Therefore needed to be Instructed by Christ
in plain terms, Without Figures. So he.


ANd yet Christ, you know, did often speak Figuratively unto them, talking of
Bread, Leaven, Seed, etc. And stiling them the Salt of the earth; yea even in
this Sacrament (us has been confessed) in the words Eat, Shed, Testament.
Another Jesuit witnesses, that Apostoli a Christo edocti fuerunt, and
illuminati, ut cum summa revere^ Sacramentum hoc susciperent Suarez Ies. Tom.
3. Disp. 46. 3.
The Apostles were illuminated and instructed by Christ; that they might
receive thus Sacrament with all Reverence. So he. * And so also taught your
Doctor Heskins before him: D. Heskins in his Parliament. B. 3. page 53.
Christ (says he) instructed his Apostles in the Faith of the blessed
Sacrament, before he instituted it. * Therefore are they but rudely, by you,
termed Rude; and the Passover, perceived that by Passover was figuratively
understood the Paschall Lamb, and thereupon prepared the Passover, according
to the Lord's Command) could not be ignorant, that in this like Sacramental
speech [ This is my Bodie] the Pronoune [THIS] did literally point out Bread,
and siguratively signify Christ's Body. Doubtless, if the manner of Christ's
speech in the Eucharist had not been like the other in the Passover, they
would have desired Christ to explain his meaning,

Their last Romish Objection. SECT. V.
We are never to let pass the Literal Sense ( says your Nunquam dimittamus
proprium verborum sensum, nisi cogamur ab aliqua alia Scriptura, etc. Bell. l.

Cardinal) except we be compelled thereunto by some Scripture, or by some
Article of Faith, or by some common Interpretaion of the whole Church. So he.

CHALLENGE.
SVrely nor we, without some one of these; but that you may know the grounds
of our persuasion to be more than one, or yet all These; And how bountifully
we shall deal with you, we shall show in the Proposition following.

Ten Reasons, for proof of the Necessity of interpreting
FIrst, We have been compellable to allow a Figurative Sense, by the
confessed Analogy of Scripture, in all such Sacramental Speeches of both
Testaments, concerning Circumcision, Rock, Baptism; as also that speech of
Christ, Ioh. 6. Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, as you have See
above c. 2.. 3.
heard. Secondly, We are Challengable hereunto by our See hereafter, B. ^.
Chap. ^. (...).
Article which teaches but one natural Body of Christ, and the same to
Remain now in Heaven. Thirdly, We are enforced, for fear of such See
hereafter, B. ^. Chap. 4.
Heresies, as have followed in other Case, upon the literal sense; for it was
not the Figurative, but the literal and proper sense of being borne again, by
Baptism, ( Ioh. 3.) that begat the error of Nicodemus: and the like literal
sense of God's Eyes, Hands, Feet, etc. brought forth the Anthropomorphites. And
so was it the literal sense of those words in the Canticles [ Tell me where
thou lie at noone] which deluded the Donatists; and of Origin you have
literal sense of these words, [ Some there be that castrate themselves, etc,]
did fondly wrong himself.

Fourthly, We are necessarily moved, to reject your literal sense, by a
confessed Impossibility, taught by that Universal Maxim, See above Chap. 1..
4.
Disparatum de disparato, etc. showing that Bread, being of a different nature
from flesh, can no more possibly be called the flesh or Body of Christ,
literally, than Lead can be called Wood. Fifthly, We are persuaded hereunto by
the former Fathers, both of the Greek and Latin Church, calling the Sacrament
a Figure; and expounding This is] by [ This Signifies.] Sixthly, We are urged
by the Rule set down by Saint Augustine, for the direction of the whole
Catholic Church; that, S^praeceptiva locutio f^^gitium aut facinus videtur
iubere, figurata est, ut [nisi manducaveritis carnem meam] facinus videtur
jubere: ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini est communicandum, and
suaviter, ac utiliter recolendum in memoria, quia pro n^bis caro ejus
crucifixa, and vulnerata sit. August. de Doctrina Christ. lib 3. cap. 16.
Whenever the precept (says he) seems to command that which is heinous (as
to eat the flesh of Christ) it is figurative. And of this Sacrament does not
Christ say, Take, Eat, This is my Body? Seventhly, A Motive it must needs be
to any reasonable man, to defend the figurative sense, by observing the misery
of your Disputers, in contending for a Literal Exposition thereof; because
their Objections have been confuted by your own Doctors, and by Truth it
self, even the holy Scriptures. Eighthly, your own Unreasonableness may
persuade somewhat, who have not been able, hitherto, to confirm any one of
your five former Objections to the contrary, by any one Father of the literal
Interpretation of Christ's words was the foundation of the Heresy of the
Capernaites, and has affinity with diverse other See the last Book Chap. 2..
the last.
Ancient Heresies condemned by Antiquity. Tenthly, Our last persuasion is the
consent of Antiquity, against the Literal conversion of Bread into Christ's
Body (which you call Transubstantiation) against the Literal Corporal
Presence, against Literal Corporal Eating, and Union, and against a proper
Sacrifice of Christ's Body Subjectively. All which are fully persuasive
Inducements to enforce a figurative sense, as the sundry Books following will

CHALLENGE.
YOu may not pass over the consideration of these points, by calling them
Schoole-subtilties, and Logical Differences, as Master Fisher lately has
done; thinking by this his fly Sophistry, craftily to draw the minds of
Romish Professors from the due discovery of your Romish false Literal
Exposition Mystery.

CHAP. IIII.
*A Confirmation of a Figurative Sense of Christ's words, [THIS IS MY BODY]
opened unto us by a Third Key, in the Pronoune [MEVM] as it is pronounced by
the Romish Priest, in his Consecration;
AN Objection there is, which so much perplexeth your Doctors, that both
Repugnancie among themselves in Answering, and Insufficiency of Answers, may

himself spoke them; and therefore they cannot be Consecrative words,
according to your Roman Faith, as they are uttered by the Minister. For he
must deliver them either, Narratively, by way of Repetition, as they are read,
both in the Gospel, and in your Roman Missall saying, [ And Jesus took
Bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake ] And if so, then the Minister
in rehearsing of Christ's word [THIS] should consecrate the Bread, whereof Christ
spoke in his saying, [THIS] at his Institution of this Sacrament, and not this
Bread, which is now in the Ministers hand, made visible to the People. Or else
he should pronounce the same words (according to your own term)
Significatively, that is, so speaking them in the person of Christ, as if
Christ himself should now pronounce them. And if so, then in the Priests
saying [ This is my Body,] the word [MY] should signify Bellarm. lib. 4. de

suam, non Christi: quando dicit [ Hoc est Corpus meum] agit personam Christi.
-- Secundum, In hac action long aliter Sacerdotem agere personam Christi,
quam in alijs Sacraments: nam in alijs agit ut Christi minister, tamen
loquitur in persona sua, ut cum dicit, Ego te baptizo: Ego te absolvo. -- at in
Consecratione Eucharistiae, Sacerdos non solum agit ut Christi minister, sed
induit omnino Christi personam, ac loquitur ac si ipse esset Christus: quomodo

Marginalls) that they bestirre themselves like as Soldiers would do, in
withstanding a Battery, or defending a Breach. One company of them say, that
the Priest utters Christ's words only Narratively by rehearsing them; A
second rank answers no, but both Recitingly, and Significatively. Not so,
says the Third Troop, because this is Impossible. Thus much of the irresolute
Judgments of your

That the Answers given are each of
BEllarmine and Vasquez perceiving that if the Minister should deliver these
words of Christ [ This is my Body] only as Narratively, rehearsing them, then
he could not thereby consecrate the Bread, which is in his own hands, because
it is not that Bread, which was then in Christ's hands, when he said [ This is
my Body.] And again, if they should be uttered of the Priest, as in the
person of Christ, which you call Significatively, as if Christ himself should
now speak them, by the mouth of the Priest; yet being Pronounced by the
Priest, and not by Christ, the Priest in saying, [ My Body,] should consecrate
his own Body, and not the Body of Christ. They do therefore assume and
Materially and Formally, that is, both Narratively, repeating them as the
Minister of Christ; and Significatively, pronouncing them in the person of
Christ.

If they could illustrate this to be possible by any Similitudes, we should
more easily believe them, but they cannot. Let us try this. Bellarmine. See
above in the former Section.
It is (says he in the Margin) as when the Angel of God, taking upon him the
person of God, said, [I am the God of your Fathers.] So he. We (not to
dispute now the truth of his Assertion, in saying it was Gods I am the God of
your Fathers, but to suppose it true) do reply, that the Similitude is not
appliable: Because, if as the Priest repeating Christ's words thus, [ Jesus gave
it to his Disciples, saying, [This is my Body;] So the Angel of God should
have said, God speaks unto you, saying, [I am the God of your Fathers;] Every
one at the first hearing would easily discern that the Angel spoke so, only
as a Minister, or (as the word, Angel, signifies) a Messenger of God, and not
as the person of God.

Your Jesuit Suarez will mend this, who, to show that a Suarez in 3. Thom.

hac causa dico.]
It is (says he) as if a Council of some King should say, It is given us in
charge to pronounce Sentence, saying, [I the King do say in this Cause, etc.]
So far your Jesuit, and no farther. We Reply: That the point, which is to be
proved, is, that the same words may be spoken of the same man, both in his
own person and in the person of another. But when the Council said, [ It is
given us in charge that I do say in this cause] they saying, It is given us in
charge, spoke it in their own person, and not in the person of the King; for
the Charge was not given to the King, but by the King to themselves. And when
they said, [ I the King do say in the Cause] they spoke not in their own
person, but in the person of the King. What need many words? To speak the same
words in a man's own person, and ^n the person of another (says your Jesuit
Vasquez i^ the Murgi^, and that most truly) is Impossible; and he therefore
stands only to that one Ter^^e, Significatively, which all your other
Disputers held to be necessary for the Answering

That the words of Christ, as they are pronounced by the Priest, are merely
Narrative, and not Significative, is proved by the Text it self.
IT was always held, by all Divines, to be a most necessary, exact, and
securo Rule of interpreting of Scripture, to expound a Text by the Context of
the words preceding, and the words following, Ianus wise, looking (...). The
words of the first Text are these, This is my Body:] of the Second these,
[(...) For this is the New Testament in my Blood] as Saint Matthew has it. Now
He (having taken Bread) when he had given thanks, brake it, saying, This is,
etc.] are delivered by the Minister only Narratively, namely, rehearsing what
Christ had done long since; and not any Act now in doing by the Priest, in the
person of Christ. The words likewise preceding, in the Second Text, concerning
the Cup, stand thus: [ After He (Christ) had supped, he took the Cup, and
when he had given thanks, he said, Drink you all of this, etc.] which all
are Narratives, repearing I, the Minister: And HE, what? [ Saying,] a word
Narrative, in it is own proper Signification.

Next mark the succeeding words of both your supposed Consecratory Sayings of
Christ, concerning the Bread [ This is my Body:] it follows, HE (Christ)
taking the Cup: as likewise secondly concerning the Cup, the words succeeding,
which are [SHED, for Remission of sins] are a Narration of the virtue of
Christ's Blood Shed, expressed then by Christ.

We now demand, seeing the whole Contexture, whether going before, or following
after the Text in Controversy, are all words, only rehearsing what Christ had
done; why should you conceive the Intervenient words [ This is my Bodie] to be
uttered in a different tenure of speech, as in the person of Christ? When we
should expect some warrant hereof from some one Father, you are unanimously
Similitude of a Stage Play) your Priest is here (as it were) Acting in a Play,
and exchanging his Parts, now and then taking upon him the person of a Relator,
and Rehearser only; and again, in a middle Scene, of a Significator.

Jesuit Estius renders out of the Fathers. [ In the person of Christ] is no
more (says he) but in the name of Christ, and by the authority of Christ, and
as Christ himself commanding me, and beholding me, I being the Minister of
Christ. But the Priest, in pronouncing the words of Christ, in the Romish
Significative sense, is said to do it in a far higher strain; which your
Cardinal Bellarmine will have you to consider, See above Sect. 1.
The Priest (says he) in this Action (of Consecration) deals far
otherwise, than he does in other Sacraments, where ] Do you mark? [ Far
otherwise.] And yet the Apostle, when he spoke of the Absolution, which he
gave, saying to the Corinthians, If I have pardoned any, he added, [ I have
pardoned them in the person of Christ.] So that the word [ Person,] spoken of
by the Apostle, and Ancient Fathers, is to be understood [ Far otherwise]
than that which the Significative Romish sense does exact; which is, that the
Priest so utters Christ's words, in the person of Christ, that he delivers
them Significatively, that is, as to signify the same Intention

As for example, (it is your Cardinal's own) Any one repeating these words
spoken of the wicked Jews, Saying concerning Christ [This man Blasphemeth] if
he should utter them Significatively, that is, with the same Intention of
noting Christ to be a blasphemer, he himself should Blaspheme: ^ut delivering
them only Narratively, by way of Repetition, he does not Blaspheme, because
he means not to say that Christ did Blaspheme, but that the Jews said so. So
he. And so say This is my Body] pronounces them Narratively only, and not
Significatively. For the Romish Priest, if he should speak the words of Christ
Significatively, in the person of Christ, that is, with the same Intention as
Christ, when he said [ This] of the Bread, then in his hands: the Priest
saying, [ This] should intead and mean that [ This Bread] whereof Christ
spoke, and not that which is in his own hands, which now he intends to
Consecrate; and Consequently should he make no Consecration at all. And what
hereupon Mass, in your Transubstantiation, Sacrifice, and Adoration, you may
understand in the next Section.

The full Overthrow of the whole Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Corporal
Presence, Personal Sacrifice, and Adoration, Consequently, upon the former
Confutation of your Romish Significative Pronunciation of Christ's words by the
Priest.
TRuly has your Jesuit See above in the Second Section.
Suarez expressed the Doctrine of your Church, as follows; Except these words
This is my Body] be taken Significatively, and formally, they work no
Consecration, nor can it be collected, that that which is now in the hands of
the Priest, is the true Body of Christ. So he; alleging the Cou^acel of Trent
for his warrant. But the words, as they are pronounced by the Priest, cannot
possibly be taken Significatively, but only in the way of Rehearsing and
Repeating them; No one Iota in the Text, or Context; No one Testimony of
Antiquity; No one Reason, or yet competent Example has been alleged by any
of your Doctors for proof of the Contrary.

This point needs no more discussion, only, for further Illustration-sake,
we shall commend unto you a more proportionable Example, than was any that
hitherto your Sophisters have invented; which, because your Jesuits have
affected the Sea above in the first and second Sections.
Similitudes of Historical and Comicall Representations, we shall likewise
borrow from that Stage. If therefore Aaron, in imitating an operative Speech of
turning and Transubstantiating a Rod into a Serpent, in saying (to suppose
Aaron to have said so) [ This is my Serpent] yet could not your Priest possibly
deliver the same words Significatively, as in the person of Aaron; either in
saying [ This] because, This Rod, spoken of by the Priest, is not the same Rod,
whereof Aaron said [ This:] nor yet in the word [ My] because that, whereof
Aaron said, [ My Serpent] cannot possibly be said accordingly [ My Serpent] by
the Priest, as your selves well know. Significative Exposition of these words [
This] and [ My] in the Speech of Christ.

THE THIRD BOOK, Treating of the First Romish Doctrinall Consequence,
Your Doctrinall Romish Consequences are Five, viz. the Corporal 1. Conversion
of the Bread into the Body of Christ, called Transubstantiation; in this Third
Book. Body of Christ in the Sacrament, called Corporal Presence; in the
Fourth Book. 3. Receiving of the Body of Christ into the Bodies of the
Communicants, called Real, or Material Conjunction; in the Fifth Book. 4.
Sacrificing of Christ's Body, by the hands of the Priest, called a Propitiatory
Sacrifice; in the Sixth Book. Latria, or Divine Adoration of the same
Sacrament; in the Seventh Book.

After follow the Additionals, in a Summary Discovery of the Abominations of
the Romish Mass, and the Iniquities of the Defenders thereof; in the Eighth
Book.

THese are the five Doctrinall Consequences, which you teach, and profess, and
Begetting, before it have a manner of Being, therefore before we treat of the
Corporal Presence, we must in the first place handle your Transubstantiation,
which is the manner (as we may so say) of the Procreation thereof.

CHAP. I.
The State of the Controversy, concerning the Change and Conversion professed
by Protestants, which is Sacramental;
First of the Sacramental. SECT. I.
THere lies a charge upon every Soul, that shall communicate and participate
of this Sacrament, that herein he Discern the Lords Body: Discerning
(according to the judgment of Protestants) is not only in the use, but also
in the Nature to distinguish the Object of Faith, from the Object of Sense. The
First Object of Christian Faith, is the Divine Alteration, and Change of
natural Bread, into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. This we call a Divine
Change, because none but the same See hereafter, Chap. 4.. 1. and 2.
Omnipotent power, that made the Creature and Element of Bread, can Change it
into a Sacrament.

The Second Object of Faith, is the Body of Christ it self, Sacramentally
represented, and verily exhibited to the Faithful Communicants. There are then
three Objects, in all, to be distinguished. The First is before Consecration,
the Bread merely Natural. Secondly, After Consecration, Bread Sacramental.
Thirdly, Christ's own Body, which is the Spiritual, and Supersubstantiall
Bread, truly exhibited by this Sacramental, to the nourishment of the souls
of the Faithful.

Secondly of the Romish Change, which you call Transubstantiation.
But your Change in the Council of Est conversio totius substantiae Panis in
Corpus Christi, and totius substantiae Vini in sanguinem, manentibus duntaxat
speciebus Panis, and Vini, quam quidem Conversionem Catholica Ecclesia
aptissime Transubstantiationem appellat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 2.
Trent is thus defined: Transubstantiation is a Change of the whole Substance
of Bread into the Body of Christ, and of Wine into his Blood. Which by the Bull
of Ego N. N juro hinc Conversionem fieri, quam Catholica Ecclesia appellat
Transubstantiationem -- Extra quam fidem nemo salvus esse potest. Bulla Pij 4.
super forma luram nit professionu Fidei.
Pius the Fourth, then Pope, is made an Article of Faith, without which a man
cannot be saved. Which Article of your Faith Protestants believe to be a new
and impious Figment, and Transubstantiationem Protestants esse sceleratam
Haeresin dicunt. Bell. l. 3. de Euch. cap. 11.
Heresy. The Case thus standing, it will concern every Christian to build his
Resolution upon a sound Foundation. As for the Church of England, she
professes in her 28. Article, saying of this Transubstantiation, that It
cannot be proved by holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of MANY
SVPERSTITIONS.

CHAP. II.
The Question is to be examined by these grounds; viz. I Scripture. III. Divine
Reason.

IN all which we shall make bold to borrow your own Assertions, and
Confessions, for the Confirmation of Truth.

The Romish Depravation of the Sense of Christ his words,
YOu pretend (and that with no small Confidence) as a Truth avouched by the
Council of Vt definitur in Conc. Trid. Sess. 13 Can. 4. Ex sola veritate
verborum [Hoc est Corpus meum] vera, ac propria Transubstantiatio colligitur.

proter^^ Transubstantitionem admittere. Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 23.. Secundo.
Trent. that Transubstantiation is collected from the sole, true, and proper
Signification of these words [This is my Body.] So you.


WHerein you show your selves to be men of great Faith, or rather Credulity,
but of little Conscience; teaching that to be undoubtedly True, whereof
notwithstanding you your selves render many Causes of Doubting. For first you
Scotus, quem Cameracensis sequtur, -- Dicunt non extare locu^ in Scripturis tam
expressum, ut fine declaratione Ecclesiae evidentes cogat Transubstantiationem
admittere. Atque hoc non est omnino improbabile, quia an ita sit dubitari
potest, cum homines acutissimi, and doctissimi, qualis inprimis Scotus fuit,
contrarium sentiant. Bellar. quo supra. Cajetanus, and aliqui vetustiores
audiendi non sunt, qui dicunt, panem definere esse, non tam ex Evangelio, quam
ex Ecclesiae authoritate constare. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34 page 419.
grant that (besides Cardinal Caejetane, and some other Ancient Schoolmen)
Scotus and Cameracensis, men most Learned and Acute, held that There is no one
place of Scripture so express, which (without the Declaration of the Church)
can evidently compel any man to admit of Transubstantiation. So they. Which
your Cardinal, and our greatest Adversary, faith See in the former Allegation
at (b)
Is not altogether improbable; and whereunto your Bishop Corpus Christi fieri
per consecrationem, non probatur nudis Evangelij verbis, sine pia
interpretatione Ecclesiae. Roffens. Episc. con. Capt. Bab. cap. 9. page 99.
Roffensis gives his consent.

Secondly, (which is also confessed) some other Doctors of Transubstantiation,
out of the words of Christ, were driven to so hard shifts, as to [Hoc est] pro
Transit, Bonaventura decet. Idem fere habet Oceam, and Hol cott, insinuat etiam
Waldensis -- Volunt Propositionem illam non esse, substantive, sed Transitive
interpretandam, sc. ut sit sensus. [Hoc est Corpus] id est, Transit in Corpus.
-- Sed hoc corrumpit significatione^ verbi [Est] quod, si permittitur, nulla
est vis in hujus modi verbis ad probandam realem praesentiam, nec substantiam
Panis hic non manner. Et ita potuit Haereticus exponere [Hoc est] id est,
Repraesentat Corpus. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. qu 78. Disp 58. Sect. 7. Art. 1. page
754.
Change the Verb Substantive [Est] into a Verb Passive, or Transitive, Fit,
or Transit; that is, in stead of [ Is] to say, It Is Made, or It passes into
the Body of Christ. A Sense, which your Jesuit Suarez cannot allow, because
(as he truly says) It is a Corrupting of the Text. Albeit indeed this word,
Transubstantiation, imports no more than the Fieri, seu Transire, of Making,
or Passing of one Substance into another. So that still you see
Transubstantiation

*The like violence is used by your Jesuit Iac. Gordon Scotus Ies. lib.
Controv. 4. cap 3. n. 15. Propositiones practicae proferuntur per verba
praesentis temporis, non futuri, ut certi (...) de effectuve borum. Haec verba
[Hoc est corpus meum] practica sunt, efficient quod significant: [Mandu^^^ ex
hoc, Bibite ex hoc] ubique demonstrat corpus Christi futurum, vel sanguinem
ejus futorum. Similis statuitur verbis Consecrationis, alioqui ista communio
esset mere speculativa, non practica.
Gordon, who, to make Christ's Speech to be Practical, for working a
Transubsta^tiation, does enforce the words [ This is my Body] and, [ Eat ye
this] and, [ Drink ye this] being all spoken in the Present tense, to
signify the future. Which, although it were true, all Grammarians know to be
the figure Enallage. From these Premises it is most apparent, that the Romish
Doctors cast themselves necessarily upon the horns of this Dile^ma, thus: This
is my Body] a Sense Practical, to signify that which they work, and then is
the Sense Tropicall, (as you have now heard them, against your Romish Literal
Sense, to betoken an operative power and effect of working Bread into the Body
of Christ:) or else they are not Practical; and then they cannot implie your
Transubstantiation at all.

We might, in the third place, add hereunto that the true Sense of the words
of Christ is Figurative, as by Scriptures, Fathers, and by your own confessed
Grounds has been already See the former Book throughout.
proved, as an insallible Truth. So groundless is this chief Article of your
Romish Faith, whereof more will be said in the sixth Section following. But yet,
by the way, we take leave to prevent your Objection. You have told us that See
the former Book throughout.
the words of Christ are Operative, and work that which they signify; so that
upon the pronunciation of the words [ This is my Body,] it must infallibly
follow, that Bread is changed into Christ's Body; which we shall believe,
as soon as you shall be able to prove, that upon the pronuntiation of the
other words of Christ [ This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood,] Luke Cup is
changed into the Testament of Christ's Blood, or else into his Blood it self.

The Noveltie of Transubstantiation examined, as well for the Name, as for the
Nature thereof. SECT. II.
YOu have imposed the very Title of Transubstantiation upon the Faith of
Christians; albeit the word, Transubstantiation (as you grant) Fateor, neque
Antiquos Patres usos esse hoc nomine Transubstantiationis. Christoph. de Capite
fontium, Archicpis. Caesar. lib. de reali praesen. cap. 5. 9. Artic. 4.
was not used of any Ancient Fathers; and that your Romish Change had not it is
Christendom, or name among Christians to be called Transubstantiation (as your
Cardinal Concilium Lateranense sub Innocentio Tertio coactum, ut Haereticis os
obthurarer, Conversionem hanc novo and valde significance verbo dixit
Transubstantiationem. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34. page 422. As for that
objected place out of Cyrill of Alexandria Epist ad Caelosyrium [Convertens ea
in veritatem Carnis:] It is answered by Vasquez the Jesuit; non habetur illa
Epistola inter opera Cyrilli. Vasquez. in 3. Thom. Tom. 3. number. 24.
Alan witnesses) before the Council of Laterane, which was 1^ 15. years
after Christ; nor can you produce One Father Greek or Latin, for a Thousand
years, attributing Transubstantiation, until the year 900 (which is beyond
the Compass of due Antiquity.) At what time you find, note, and urge
Theophylact, who says of the Bread, that It is Trans-elementated into the Body
of Christ. Which Phrase, in what Sense he used it, you might best have learned
from himself, who in the very same place says that Christ in a manner is
Theoph. in Ioh. 6. De Christo per sidem manducato: [(...)]
Trans-elementated into the Communicant: which how unchristian a Paradox it
were, being taken in strict and proper Sense, we permit to your own judgments
to determine.

Arian Controversy began: because the Fathers of the Council of Nice judged
the Objection of the Noveltie of that word Calumnious; for that the use of it
had been Ancient before their times, as your Cardinal Calumniam hanc Patres
Antique aptissime co^tutarunt, atque ostenderunt non inventum fuisse hoc nomen
[(...)] in Concilio Nicaeno, sed fuisse ante in usu Patrum; at illud jam
vocabulum usurpari, quo sui Majores usi fuissent. Bellarm. quo supra. c. 3.
Bellarmine himself witnesses.

You furthermore, to prevent our Objection (demanding why the Ancient Fathers
never called your fancied Romish Change, Transubstantiation, if they had been
of your Romish Faith, concerning the Substantial Change of Bread into the Body
of Christ) have shaped us this Answer, namely, that Ets: veteres Ecclasiae
Doctores non sint usi voce Tran substantrationis, tamen usi sunt vocibus ice^
significantibus, ut Conversionis, Tra^smutationis, Transi tionis,
Transformationis, Transelementationis, and si^^libus (...) Fort^^it. j^d Tract.

Although they used not the very word, Transubstantiation, yet have they words
of the same signification, to wit, Conversion, Transmutation, Transition,
Transformation, Trans-elementation, and the like. Lorichius Reader of Divinity
among you; who by his vast and rash boldness might as justly have inferred
from the like Phrases of the Apostle, viz, [ 2. Cor. 3. 18.
(...), we are transformed] that every Regenerate Christian is
Transubstantiated into Christ: or, from the word [ 2. Cor. 1. 14.
(...), He is transfigured] say that the Devil is Transubstantiated into an
Angel of light: or from the word [(...), It is changed] (used by Quiaquid

They used it not. And what the Greek Church thinks thereof, at this day, you
may learn from two Patriarchs of Constantinople; the One not admitting, the
Other rejecting it; as will be shown in the second Chapter.

Will you have the World imagine that so many, so excellent, Transubstantiatio,
and apply them to this Change, if they had once dreamed of this your Article of
Faith? Will you permit us to learn a point of wisdom from your Cardinal?
Periculosa est vocum novarum Libertas in Ecclesia, cum paulatim ex vocibus

justly place this your new word among those (...), 1. Tim. c. 20.
Paul will have Christians by all means to avoid; else so new and barbarous a
Name must needs engender a novel, and brutish opinion, such as this Article it
self will appear to be; As follows.

The Noveltie of the Article of Transubstantiation is examined, and shown not
to have been before the Council of Laterane (namely) not until 1215. years
after Christ. SECT. III.
THis Article has been decreed (as you have See above Chapter 1.. 2.
heard) by necessary Doctrine of Faith; and therefore presumed to be Ancient.

CHALLENGE.
THe first Imposition of this Article, as of Faith, your Cardinal Bellar. lib.
3. de Eucharist. cap. 23.. Vnum tamen.
Bellarmine notes to have been in the days of Pope Gregory the Seventh. viz.
1073. years after Christ. But surely at that time this could be but a private
opinion of some few, for Peter Lombard (living 67. years after this Pope, and
Master of the Romish School) when he had labored to give Resolution to all
doubts, especially in this very Question ( whether the Conversion were
substantial, or not) confesses plainly, saying; Si quaeratur, qualis sit
Conversio (viz. Pants in Encharistia) an formalis, an substantialis, an
alterius generis; definite non sufficio. Quibusdum videtur esse substantialis,
dicentibus substantiam converti in substantiam. Lombard. Sent. lib. 4 Distinct
11 lit. (a.)
Definire non sufficio: I am not able to Determine. So he. Anno. 1140.

Hitherto therefore this Article was but in Conception only, which caused your
learned and Subtle School-man Scotus to descend lower, to find out the Birth
thereof, Scotus dicit ante Concilium Lateranense non fuisse dogma fidei
Transubstantiationem. Id ille dixit, quia non legerat Conc. Romans sub Gregorib.

Affirming that the Article of Transubstantiation was no Doctrine of Faith
before the Council of Laterane, under Pope Innocent the Third, viz. Anno want
of reading. But either were your Jesuit Coster, and Cardinal Perron as
ignorant of Ancient Learning, as Scotus, or else they gave small Credit to that
Council cited by Bellarmine under Gregory the Seventh. For your Jesuit says,
in direct terms, that Ante trecentos Annos in Concilio Lateranensi, ad ifrius
rei tam admirabilis clariorem explicarionem, usurpatem fuit nomen
Transubstantiationis: ut intelligant Christiani substantiam Panis in
substantiam corporis Christi converti. Coster. Ies. Enchir. cap 8.. De
Transubstantitione.
The name of Transubstantiation was used in the Council of Laterane, for a
clearer explication, that Christians might understand the Change of Bread into
the Body of Christ. Can you say then that it was universally so understood
before? But your Cardinal Perron more peremptorily concludes, that Si nihil
plane ad Doctrinam Ecclesiasticam spectans in Concilio Lateranensi ex communi

If it So he. A plain acknowledgement, that it was no Doctrine of Faith before
that Council, even as Scotus affirmed before. But we pursue this Chase yet
further, to show,

That the Article of Transubstantiation was not defined in the Council of
Laterane, under Pope innocentius the Third. SECT. IV.

Priest, a long time Prisoner, did (under the name of Widdrington) produce many
Historians, Platina, Nauclerus, Godfridus Monumetensis, Matthew Paris, and
others, to testify as follows: That many things fell under Consultation in
that Council, but nothing was openly defined, the Pope dying at Perusium.
Insomuch that some of these Authors stick not to say, that This General
Council, which seemed to promise big and mighty matters, did end in scorn
and mockery, performing nothing at all. We might add, that the supposed Acts
of this Council were not published until more than two hundred years after.
No marvel then if some Scholastici quidam hanc Doctrinam de
Transubstantiatione non valde Antiquam esse dixerunt: inter quos Scorus, and
Gabriel Biel. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 30.. 1.
Schoolmen, among whom were Scotus and Biel, held And another, that In Synaxi

It was but lately determined in the Church. Nay, Master Brerely (if his
opinion be of any Credit among you) sticks not to say that Mr. Brerely in his
Liturgy Tract. 2.. 11. page 158.
Transubstantiation complete (that is, both for form, and matter) was not
determined until the last Council of Trent; that is to say, not until the
year of our Lord, 1560. Do you not see how much licking this ougly Bear had,
before it came to be formed? and yet it will appear to be but a Monstrum
horrendum, take it at the best; as it is now to be proved, by the full
discovering of the paipable Falsehood

CHAP. III.
The Definition of Transubstantiation in the Church of Rome; and of the
Falsehood thereof. SECT. I.
THe Council of Trent ( says your Council. Tridentinum dicit, fieri
Conversionem totius substantiae Panis, id est, tam formae quam materiae in
Substantiam Corporis Christi. Bellarmia. lib. 3. de Eucharist. Cap. 18.. Si
objicias. Council. Trident. Sess. 13. Cap. 4.
Cardinal) has defined that this Conversion is of the whole Substance of
Bread, that is, as well form, as matter, into the Substance of Christ's Body.

Our First proof of the Falsehood of the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, by the
Contradictions of the Defenders thereof; whereby they bewray their No-Beleefe
THe Opinions of the Doctors of your Church, concerning the nature of this
Conversion, are by you reduced into these two manners, (namely) that it is
either by Production out of the substance of Bread: or else by Adduction of the
Body of Christ unto the form of Bread.

CHALLENGE.
Transubstant ation. First, not by Production, because (as the same Productio
est, quando terminus ad quem non existat, and ideo vi Conversionis necessario
producitur, ut aqua in vinum. Adductiva autem, etc. Bellar. lib. 3. de
Eucharist. cap. 18.. Secundo notandum. -- Productiva non est, quia Corpas
Domini praeexistit. Idem. ibid.. Ex his.
Cardinal truly argues) Conversion by Production is, when the thing that is
produced is not yet extant: as when Christ converted water into wine, wine was
not Extant, before it was Produced out of the substance of water. But the Body
of Christ is always Extant; therefore can it not be said to be Produced out of
the substance of Bread. So he. Which Productive manner of Transubstantiation
could not be De ratione Transubstantiationis non est, ut Substantia, in quam
dicitur fieri Transubstantirio, producatur, aut conservetur per illam: imo qui
hoc modo defendunt Transubstantiationem in Sacramento, ad quoddam genus

fondly of a Reproduction, as of Carcasses converted into men, in which Change
any One may see, that as much as is Produced is not Extant, for Dust is not

Bread into the Body of Christ, his Answe^^^ impertinent, and he may be
produced for an idle Disputer.]
Suarez, by both whom it has been confuted. And if the Change be not by
Production, then it must follow that it is not by Transubstantiation; which is
demonstrable in it self, because the next manner, which they insist upon,
cannot possibly serve your turn.

This Second manner they name to be by Adduction, which your Si terminus ad
quem Corpus Christi existat, sed non in eo loco ubi Terminus a quo (id est,
Panis) tum vi Con versionis adducetur ad eum locum. Inde vocatur Conversio
adductiva: nam corpus Christi praeexistit (...) Conversionem; sed non sub
speciebus Panis. Con versio igitur non fecit ut corpus Christi simpliciter esse
incipiat, sed ut incipiat esse sub speciebus: non quod per motum localem e
Coelo Adducatur, sed solum quia per hanc conversionem fit, ut quod ante erat
solum in Coelo, jam sit sub speciabus Panis. Nec haec accidentalis conversio,
sed substantialis dicta est, quia substantia Panis desinit esse, and substantia
corporis Christi succedit Pani. Proinde Substantia in Substantiam transit.
Talis est Conversio Cibi in hominem, per nutritionem; nam anima non producitur,
sed tantum per nutritionem sit, ut incipiat esse in ea materia, ubi antea erat
forma Cibi. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 18.
Cardinal defines to be a Bringing of the Substance of that Body of Christ,
continuing still in heaven, to be notwithstanding at the same time under the
shapes of Bread on the Altar: and therefore called Substastiall, because the
Substance of Bread cease So he. And this is of late crept into the opinion of
some few, whereby you have created a new faith, flat contrary to the faith of
the Council of Trent, which defined a Change of the whole substance of Bread
into the Body of Christ. So that Council, as you have heard. Now by the Change
of Substance into Substance, as when Common Bread, eaten, is turned into the
Substance of Man's flesh, the matter of Bread, is made the matter of flesh. But
this your Adduction, is so far from bringing in the Substance of Bread, Into
the Substance that it professes to bring the Body of Christ, not so much as
unto the Bread, but to be under only the Outward Accidents, and forms of
Bread. Yet had this Figment some Favorers in your Fuerunt hujus sententiae
Alens. Bonavent. Marsil. -- Dicunt per hanc Conversionem Corpus non accipere

Schools.

No Marvel therefore if there arose some out of your own Church, who did
impugn this delusion, calling it (as your Dixi Conversionem Panis in corpas
Christi esse Adductivam, quod dictum video a nonnullis esse perperam acceptum,
qui inde non Transubstantiarionem, sed Translocationem colligunt. Sed dixi
corpus Christi non deseruisse locum suum in Coelo, neque incipere esse sub
speciebus, ut in loco, sed ut Substantia sub Accidentibus, remota tamen
inhurentia. Bellarmia. Recog. in lib. 3. de Eucharist. page 81.
Cardinal himself witnesses of them) a Translocation only, and not a
Transubstantiation; and that truly, if they should not have called it a
Trans-accession, or Trans-succession rather. For who will say, if he put on his
hand a Glove, made of a Lamb-skin, which Lamb was long since dead (and
consequently ceasing to be) that therefore his hand is Transubstantiated into
the Body of the Lamb? yet is there in this example a more substantial Change,
by much, than can be imagined to be by your Adduction of a Body under only the
Forms and Accidents of the matter of Bread; because (to speak from your
selves) there is in that a Material Touch between the Substance of the hand,
and the Lamb-skin: but in this other there is only a Conjunction of the
Substance of one Body with the Accidents of another. Which kind of mere
Succession of a Substance, your Jesuit Suarez will allow to be no more than a
Per solum Adductiram actionem revera non explicatur vera conversio
Substantialis, and Transubstantiatio, sed tantum Translocatio quaedam: quando
una Substantia succedit loco alterius, non potest proprie di^^ unam converti in
aliam. Suarez. Ies. loco citato. page 639.
Translocation.

* And that justly, as Any may easily perceive, because in every true
Transubstantiation there is a Change of a Substance into a Substance, as into
that, which is the Terming of the Change: but in this your Adduction, there is
said to be Terminus praesentiae, of the Praesence of Christ's Body, instead of
the Presence of Bread. Therefore it is flatly Translocation only. A word more;
Transubstantiation ( says your Council of Trent) is collected out of these
words of Christ, [This is my Body:] But by sole Adduction ( says your AEgidius
Coniax, Ies. de Sacram. Quaest. 75. Art. 4. Dubit. 4. number. 142. Ex quo pater,
refutar, sententiam eam, quae docet corpus Christi adesse posse per solam
Adductionem, quia hoc non potest colligi conversio Panis in corpus, ex verbis
Christi.
Jesuit Coninx) cannot be collected a Conversion of Bread into Christ's Body
out of the words of Christ.

We Conclude that seeing Conversion, whether by Production, or by Adduction,
are so plainly proved by your selves to be contrary to Truth: therefore it is
not possible for you to

Every true and proper Transubstantiation is a Change into a substance that was
not extant before.

But the Body of Christ was, and is always extant before the words of
Consecration be used.

Therefore is there no true and proper Change by Transubstantiation into the
Body of Christ.

Observe by the way that they, who gainsay the Productive, Adductive, yet do
all deny Local mutation a Termino ad Terminum. A Paradoxe which we leave to
your wisdoms to contemplate upon.

*The next Contradiction is to be seen between your Romish Popes and their
Councels, one against another: for your Pope Innocent 3. (whom your Doctors
have so earnestly objected, as an high Patron of Transubstantiation) in the
Council of Laterane, Anno 1560. defined Innocent. 3. Papa, lib. 3. de Offic.
Missae, cap. 29. Substantia convertitur in id quod fit, and non erat, ut virga
in colubrum; and tunc forma convertitur cum substantia: quandoque convertitur
in id quod erat, and non sit, ut Panis in Eucharistia, and tunc substantia
convertitur sine forma.
Transubstantiation in the Eucharist to be in matter, and not in the
substantial form. And your Pope Julius the Second, in the Council of Trent
(as you See above at the Letter (a)
heard even now) defined Transubstantiation in the Eucharist to be both in
Matter and Form. This Contradiction is somewhat to the matter in hand (We
think) to prove a spirit of Contradiction to be in your Roman Church.

CHALLENGE. II.
*In confutation of both the pretended Romish manners of Transubstantiation
jointly.
Whether you defend Transubstantiation by Production, or by Adduction, you are
equally confutable in both, even by your own Principles; who hold, that if the
Bread, which is to be Transubstantiated and changed into Christ's Body, be
annihilated, and brought to mere nothing, it cannot be said to be
Transubstantiated at all. Now whether you think the Bread, after consecration,
to be Annihilated, we desire to know from your selves. Say then (but speak out,
without lisping or stammering, we pray you, that we may hear and understand
you.) Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. Cap. 24. Nego Panem annihilari -- nam etsi Panis
nihil sit, tamen id in quod ipse conversus e^st, non est nihil, nec nullu^, nec
nusquam.
Although Bread after Consecration be nothing (says Bellarmine) yet it is not
annihilated, that is, brought to nothing. Lessius Ies. Opusc. lib. 12. cap. 16.
Circa substantiam Panis and Vini, primu^ miraculum est, quod hae substantiae vi
Co^ secrationis funditus pereant, and veluti annihilentur, quamvis non solemus
dicere eas annthilari, eo quod haec desitio ex intention divina, non sistat in
nihilo, sed dirigatur ad positionem Corporis Christi: verum hoc ad modum
loquendi spectat, nam quod ad rem attinet, nihil omnino substantiae panis
manet, non forma, non materia, non existentia, non gradus aliquis, sed totum
ita funditus perit, acsi prorsus in nihilum redactum esset, nullo positivo
succede^te; nam quod aliud succedat, non est ex vi illius desitio nis --
substantifico influxu subtracto, necesse est Rem in nihilum relabi.
And the substance of Bread and Wine (says your Jesuit Lessius) do utterly
perish, and are as it were Annihilated. So they; calling this a being Nothing,
and not Annihilated; this not annihilated, and yet utterly perishing: naming
also this manner to be Miraculous, which we hold worthy rather to be esteemed
Monstrous; the speech is altogether so contradictory in it self.

Wherefore we desire the foresaid Jesuit to play the Oedipus in unfolding
this Riddle: Our saying ( says he) that Bread and Wine are not annihilated,
belongs to the formalitie of speech; for as concerning the thing it self,
there is nothing of the Bread remaining either in form or matter. So he. But
that, say we, which is nothing, either in form or matter, is surely and
therefore Bread becoming to be nothing, before Christ's Body be present, cannot
possibly be said to be Changed into Christ's Body absent. And that the
rather, because (as one of your Ioh. Pallanterius de Castro sacrae Theologiae
Doctor, Lectiones Aureae. Nec materia, nec forma panis manent in se, vel in
Corpore, Christi post conversionem, quia vere annihilantur.
Doctors more ingenuously confesses) Bread not remaining, either in matter or
form, is truly Annihilated.

To this Argument (in our Apprehension Insoluble) we can receive from your
great Dictator no better Answer than that, Bellar. quo supra. Pani sucredit
Corpus Christi, corrumpitur, and interit quicquid definit esse: at non
annihilatur, nisi ita desinat esse, ut nihil ea succedit, ita ut ejus desitio
terminetur in nihil.
Because the substance of Bread cease to be, and the substance of Christ's
Body succeeds: Therefore the substance So he. Which his crotchet of Change,
by Succeeding, has been already exploded, as being but a Translocation, by his
own See above at (g)
Society. And yet again, if it may be, more plainly your Jesuit Vasquez;
Vasquez in 3. Thom. qu 75. Art. 8. Disp. 181. Cap. 2. Panis in conveersione
desinit esse, and cum dicitur panem desinere in corpus Christi, non probat
ipsam desitionem terminari formaliter ad positivum in quod fit conversio. --
Quocirca modus ille loquendi non formaliter sed cause liter debet intelligi,
quis enim dicat defitionem alicujus rei formaliter in aliquid termanari? -- Ita
ut ipsa Productio, seu Adductio non sit formaliter Conversio, sed causa illius.
-- Est igitur Conversio formaliter Denominatio quaedam ordinis per modum Actus,
in eo quod definit, relata ad id, quod fuit causa desition^. Aliquam (...).
Haea duo, quae diximus, sunt necessaria and sufficient, ut Panis, Vinum, hoc
ipso quod desinant, dicantur converti in corpus est sanguinem Christi.
Neither Production, nor Adduction are formally this Conversion.


T Ransubstantiation (as has been defined by your Council of Trent) is a
Conversion of the substance of Bread into the Now, in every such Substantial
Change, there are Two Terms, one is the Substance from which; the other is the
Substance whereinto the Substantial Change is made: as it was in Christ his
miraculous Change of Water into Wine. But this was by producing the Substance
of Wine out of the Substance of Water, as the matter, from which the Conversion
was made. Therefore must it be by Production of the Substance of Christ's Body,
out of the Substance of Bread. Your Cardinal has no Evasion, but by denying
the Conversion to be by Production, which notwithstanding was formerly the
Tenet of the Romish School, ever since the Doctrine of Transubstantiation was
hatched; and which is contrary to his own device of Conversion by Adduction.
wherein first he Dicta Corpus Christi ex pane fieri, non tanquam ex materia,
sed tanquam a Termino a quo, ut mundus ex nihilo: [ then confuting himselfe]
etiam sit ex aqua vinum ( that was not, ex nihilo.) In praesenti negotio,
Conversio non est Productiva, Panis enim convertitur in Corpus Christi
praeexistens: ergo Corpus Christi factum ex Pane, and ex Carne est idem. Bell.
l. 3. de Euc. c. 24. Ad Tertium
confounds himself, and secondly, his opinion has been scornfully rejected
by your own learned Doctors, as being nothing less than Transubstantiation,
as you have heard. Therefore may you make much of your Breaden Christ. As for
us, We, according to our Apostollicall Creec, believe no Body of Christ, but
that which was Produced out of the Sanctified flesh of the Bl: Virgin Mary, for
fear of Alphonsus de Castro lib. 4 Tit. Christus. Haer. 2. Manichaei dixeru^t
Christum non ex utero Virginis prodijsse; Et Apollinaris dixit Christum non
assumpsisse carnem ex Virgin. Item. Chiliastae, Democritae, Melcluoritae, ut

Heresy.

God that was able to raise Children to Abraham out of stones, can of Bread
transubstantiate the same into that Body of Christ, which was of the Virgin.
And he again received this Reply; That the Children, which should be so
raised out of stones, howsoever they might be Abraham's Children, according to
Faith, yet could they not be Children of Abraham according to the Flesh.
Therefore is there as great a Difference between that Body: from Bread, and
the other from the Blessed Virgin, as there must have been between Children
out of Stones, and Children out of Flesh.

And this our Reason accords right well to the Ancient Faith professed within
this Land, in the days of Edgar a Saxon King, as it is set out in an Homily
en. Easter day, page 35.
Homily of that time, which stands thus. Much is between the body that
Christ suffered in, and between the body of the hallowed Howsell. The Body
truly, that Christ suffered in, was borne of the flesh of the Virgin Mary, with
blood, and with bone, with skin, and with sinews, in humane limbs: and his
Ghostly body, which we call his Howsell, is gathered of many Corns, This was
our then Saxons Faith; wherein is plainly distinguished the Body of Christ,
borne of the blessed Virgin, from the Sacramental ( which is called Ghostly)
as is the Body of Flesh from the consecrated substance of Bread. A Doctrine
directly confirmed by See Book 4. cap. 4.. 1. in the Challenge.
Saint Augustine. Wherefore we may as truly say, concerning this your
Conversion, that if it be by Transubstantiation from Bread, then it is not the
Body, which was borne of the Blessed Virgin; as your own Romish Gloss could
say of the Sea above, E. 2. Chap. 1.. 4.
If Bread be Christ's Body, then Something was Christ's Body, which was not
borne of the Virgin Mary.

CHALLENGE I
*In vindication of the same Truth, against the late Calumniation of a Jesuit.
THis Sentence I have seen lately canvassed by a Jesuit, Sr. H. L.
falsely imputing unto him diverse Falsities; pretending especially that the
English Translation, used by the Knight, is differing from the Latin. Which
Exception of your Jesuit must needs have proceeded either from ignorance, if
he knew not that the Translation, used by the Knight, was taken out of the
Original Saxon-language, and not out of the Latin; or, if he knew so much,
from downright boldness, in charging him with a false Translation. I omit
his frivolous Cavillations

The maine question, for the sense, is whether in this sentence, of the Saxons
Faith, the Body, wherein Christ suffered, and his Body celebrated in this
Sacrament, betoken not two kind of Bodies, essentially differing one from the
other; or but only the two different manners of the Being of one Body. Your
Jesuit affirms them to signify the same Body, and he calls the contrary
opinion false. His Reason. For whereas it is said, (says he) that the
spiritual flesh (which is as much as to say, our Savior his flesh in the
Sacrament) according to the outward show, consisting of Granes of Corn, has
no Bones, nor Sinews, nor distinction of Parts, Life or Motion. Here the
Jesuit cries out against falsehood, but why? Because the Knight (forsooth)
has pretermitted (says he) these words [According to the outward show,
consisting of granes.] Whereby he would have us believe the new ^^mish Faith
According to the outward shew] imply (as it needs must, if he will speak to
any purpose) that the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, although in outward
show it be without Bones, Sinews, Life and Motion, yet it has all these
inwardly in it self, as it is in this Sacrament; then whilst he labors to
confute one Protestant, he contradicts all his fellow Jesuits See Book 4.
Chap. ^. Sect. 2.
who deny all possibility of Motion of Christ's Body in this Sacrament by any
natural and voluntary Act, without a miracle. But to speak to the point; This
Body, and That Body (say we) do diversifie two Bodies, the one Sacramental
(of Bread) called Spiritual (because of the spiritual and mystical
Signification) this Bread consisting of Granes: And the other the Natural Body
of Christ, consisting of Bones, Sinews, etc. In a word, This, and That, in
this Saxon narration, accords with the Doctrine of See Book 4. Chap. 4. in
the Challenge.
Bertram, taken out of Saint Augustine, That in heaven to differ as much from
This on the Altar, as did the Body borne of the Virgin Mary, from the other
which was not so borne.

But if this Homily will not advantage your Jesuit, he will wrest his
prejudicate Conceit out of another Homily of AElfrick, if it be possible,
where we read thus; As Christ before his Passion could convert the substance
of Bread, and Creature of Wine into his own Body that suffered, and into his
Blood which afterward was extant to be shed: So also was he able in the Desert
to Convert Manna, and Water out of the Rock into his So he, citing a Testimony
as fully Opposite unto your Transubstantiation; in sense, as it seems to be
absolutely for it in sound: it being just the same Doctrine, which Augustine,
Anselme, and Bid See hereafter Book 5. Chap. 3.. 1. and 2.
taught, when they said, that the faithful among the Jews Ate the same
spiritual meat, [Christs Flesh] in eating Manna, and drank the same
spiritual drink, that is, the blood of Christ, in drinking the water that
issued out of the Rock, which Christians now do. And therefore meant not a
Corporal eating of Christ, but a Sacramental. So say we, Christ could as well
then turn Manna, and Water of the Rock, into a Sacrament of his Body and
Blood, for the nourishing of the souls of God's people of those times; as he
does now Convert Bread and Wine into the Sacraments of his Body and Blood, for
the comfort of us Christians.

This Answer preventeth the Jesuits Objection: In his Book of Spectacles, p.
142.
The Time (says he) when the people received Manna in the Desert, Christ was
not in his humane nature; therefore could not Manna be changed into his Body,
nor Water into his Blood. So AElfrick his speech be understood Sacramentally,
as has been said: which because the Jesuit refuses to do, therefore is he
at difference with AElfrick, denying that Christ was able to convert Manna into
his Body; which AElfrick said, in express terms, he was able to do (namely)
through his divine power, by a Sacramental Conversion; because Omnipotency is
as properly necessary for the making of a divine Sacrament, as it was for the
creating of the World.

But was it not then kindly done (think you) of your Jesuit Spectacles to
another, when he had the most need of them himself? by the which he might have
discerned, that as Christ Sacramentally (and therefore figuratively) called
Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood; so did evermore all the faithful of
Christ. This Lesson See Book 2. C. 2. Sect. 10.
has been manifested by many pregnant Examples, in a full Section; which
being once got by heart, would expedite all the like Difficulties.

To conclude, the former Saxon doctrine is again confirmed by Saint See Book
4. Chap. 4.. 1. in the Challenge.
Augustine. Wherefore we may as truly say, Conversion, that if it be by
Transubstantiation, from Bread, then it is not the Body, which was Borne of the
Blessed Virgin, as your own Romish Gloss could say of the Predication; See
above B. 2. Chap. 1.. 4.
If Bread be Christ's Body, then something was Christ's Body, which was not
borne of the Virgin Mary. And this we are now furthermore to evince out of
your Pope Innocent the Third, against your Council of Trent. He (See the
Margent of the former Section) taught that when the Conversion is of the form
with the substance, then is the Change Into that which is now made, and was not
before, as So he, showing that the Serpent by that Change was therefore Made of
that Rod. But your Tridentine Fathers (you know) have defined the Conversion of
Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body to be as well in Form, as in Matter;
whereupon by the Judgment of your Pope Innocent it must follow, that the Body
of Christ in your Eucharist is made of Bread; and if made of Bread, then could
it not possibly be of the flesh of the Virgin: Because there cannot be a
Substantial Change of a Substance into Substance, except that the Substance of
that, whereinto the Conversion is wrought, have it is Original and Making from
the Substance of that, which was converted and changed. Nor could the Contrary
be hitherto proved by any Romish Doctor, from any Example out of any conversion
either natural, or miraculous, which has been road of from

Our third Reason is taken from the Existence of Bread, in this Sacrament,
after Consecration; but First of the State of this Question. SECT. III.
We wonder not why your Fathers of the Council of Trent were so fierce in
casting their great Thunderbolt Si quis dixerit remane^^ subst^ntiam Pan^s,
Anathema sit. Conc. Trident. Sess. 13. Can. 2.
Anathema, and Curse upon every man that should affirm; Bread and Wine to
remain in this Sacrament after Consecration: which they did, to terrify men
from the doctrine of Protestants, who do all affirm the Continuance of the
substance of Bread in the Eucharist. For right well did these Tridentines know,
that if the Substance of Bread or Wine do remain, then is all Faith, yea, and
Conceit of Transubstantiation but a feigned Chimaera, and mere Fancy; as your
Cardinal does confess, in granting, that Panis e^si non annihil^tur, tamen
manet ni^^l in se; ut Aqua post Conversionem in Vinum. Neqque obstat, quod foue

(...) and cap. 24.. Ad Alterum.
It is a necessary condition in every Transubstantiation, that the thing which
is converted cease any more to be: as it was in And so must Bread cease to be
Bread. This being the State of the Question, we undertake to give

Good Proofs of the Existence, and Continuance of Bread in the Eucharist, the
same in Substance, after Consecration. Our first Proof is from Scripture, 1.
Cor. 10. and 11.
IN the Apostle his Comment (that I may so call his two 1. Cor. 11. 26, 27. and
10. 16.
Chapters to the Corinthians) upon the Institution of Christ, we read of
Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Cup, thrice: all which, by the consent of
all sides, are spoken of Eating and Drinking after Consecration; and yet has
he called the ourward Element Bread. You will say (with Some) It was so called
only because it was made of Bread; as Aarons Rod, turned into a Serpent, was
notwithstanding called a Rod. But this Answer is not Answerable unto the
Similitude. For first, of the Bread, the Apostle says demonstratively, This
bread; and of the other, This Cup: But of Aarons Rod, turned into a Serpent,
none could say, This Rod. And secondly, it is contrary to Christian Faith,
which will abhor to say, in a proper sense, that Christ's Body was ever Bread.
Or else you will answer, with Others, It is yet called Bread, because it has
the Similitude of Bread, as the Brazen Serpent was called a Serpent.

But neither this, nor any other of your Imaginations can satisfy; for we
shall prove, that the Apostle would never have called it Bread after
Consecration, but because it was Substantially, still, Bread. Our Reason is; He
had now to deal against the Prophaners of this Sacrament, in reproving such as
used it as Common Bread, 1. Cor. 11. 22.
Not discerning therein (Sacramentally exhibited) the Lords Body. It had
therefore concerned him to have honored the Sacrament with Divine Titles,
agreeable to the Body of Christ, hypostatically united to his Godhead, and to
have denied it absolutely to have been Bread, considering that by Bread the
glory of the same Body might seem to be abased, and Eclipsed; if in Truth, and
Verity he had not believed it to have been (then) properly Bread.

This Reason, we guess, you are bound to approve off, who, in your opinion of
the Corporal Presence of Christ his Body, and Absence of Bread, would never
suffer any of your Professors to call it, after Consecration, by the name of
Bread. Whereupon it was that the Greek Archi^pisc. Cabasila. Latini nostros
reprehendunt, quod post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum] Panem and Vinum
nominant, etc. Exposit. Liturg. cap. 29.
Archbishop of Cabasila complained of the Romish Professors, for reprehending
the Greek Liturgies: why? Because (says he) after the words of Christ, [This
is my Body] So he. Which bewrays, that the very naming of the Sacrament
Bread, and Wine, is, in the judgment of the Church of Rome, prejudicial to
their Transubstantiation; and that if Saint Paul himself should deliver the
same words he did, at this day, he should by your Romish Inquisitors be taught
to use his Terms in another style. What need many words? except in the words
of Christ the word [ Body] be properly predicated, and affirmed of Bread,
farewell Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ's But that it is impossible the
Body of Christ should be properly predicated upon Bread, has been the
General Confession of your own Doctors, and the Conclusion of our second
Book.

*We return again to the Text, where the Apostle having named it Bread,
after Consecration, expounds himself what Bread he meant, saying, Bread
which we break. But never durst any of your Romanists say, that the Body of
Christ is truly Broken in this Sacrament: and never any Father of Primitive
times (we are sure) taught the Breaking of the Accidents of Bread. And
therefore it must follow, that it was still substantially Bread.

The Apostle has not yet done, but 1 Cor. 17. says, Because it is one Bread,
we being many are one Body for we all communicate of one Bread. Which
Chrysostom, is well as other Fathers, does analogize thus: See above B. 2.
^^ap. 2. Sect. 6. Challeng 1. See also Cypri^^, and S. August. B^^k. 3. Chapt.
3. Sect. 9.
That as o^^ loaf consists of So he, hereby teaching you the substantial
Materials of the same Bread, Many granes of Corn. And, as though the Apostle
had meant to muzzle the Adversaries of this truth with variety of proofs, he
(1 Cor 10. 17.) has these words, We participate (...)] that is, De pane hoc,
Of this Bread; thus called after Consecration. And again, 1 Cor. 11. 28. Let
him eat [(...) Of this Bread, which manifests the Eating of a part of an
whole loaf of Bread; and not of the Body of Christ, which, even by Paul, the
Scholar of Christ, concluded of Substantial Bread, agreeable to that which
our Master Christ himself taught of the other sacred Substantial part of
Drink, after the Consecration of this Sacrament, as is proved in the next
Section.

Our Second Proof of the Continuance of the Substance of Bread, is from the
speech of Christ, touching the Continuance
THe same is as fully verified by our Lord and Master Christ himself, in the
second Element of Wine, calling it Matthew. 26. 29.
This fruit of the Vine, that is, Wine, after Consecration: where the Pronoune

Maldonate (no one Father produced by him to the contrary,) Then answering; But
I (says he) cannot be thus persuaded. So he. Mark this (you great Boasters
of Accordance with Antiquity!) and yet this manner of Answering the Fathers is
most familiar with this Jesuit. But he proceeds, telling you that The
Fathers notwithstanding did not call it Wine, as thinking it to be Wine, but
even as Christ did, when he called his flesh Bread, John 6. Then he adds;
They that will follow the Exposition of These Fathers, are thus to interpret
them. And gives his Reason of this his Advertisement; Lest the other Exposition
(says he) may seem to agree with the erroneous opinion of the So he.

For which his Answer Calvinists are as much beholding to him, as are the
Ancient Fathers, with whom he has made bold not only to reject their
Authority, but also to pervert the plain and evident meaning of their
Testimonies; who declare that they understood Natural and Substantial Wine

Christ drank: and that hereby the Practices of the Heretics Aquarij are
confuted, who would drink nothing but Water in the Eucharist. That which
comes out of the fruit of the So Chrysostom. It was the Wine (says August. de
dogmat. Eccles. cap. 75. Vinum fuit in redemptionis nostrae mysterijs, cum
dixit [Non bibam.]
Augustine) which was used in the mysteries of our Redemption. Even that Wine,
which was blessed (says Clemens Alex. Quod Vinum esset, quod benedictum fuit,

Iansenius does confess, that these words of Christ had reference to the Cup
in the Eucharist; and not (as Some say) to the Cup of the Passover. * Yea to
the Eucharist, as your Pope Innocentius did Innocent. 3. de officio Missae,
lib. 4. cap. 2. Quod autem Vinum in Calice consecravit, patet ex eo, quod ipse
subjunxit; [Non bibam ex eo, donec, etc.]
teach you: (I say Innocentius the Pope) That Christ consecrated Wine in the
Cup, is evident (says he) by that which Christ added, saying, [I will not
henceforth drink ]

Mark you furthermore the Error of the Aquarij, and the Confutation thereof.
They used only Water in the Eucharist, in pretense of See above, Book. 1.
Chap. 3.. 10.

practice was not warranted by the Sea above, Book. 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. And

now tell us, if that your Doctrine of Transubstantiation had been an Article
of Faith, in those days, whether it had not concerned Cyprian to have stood
exactly upon it, for the more just condemnation of those Aquarij, to let them
know, that if they would needs use only Water, then (according to your
Doctrine) their Consecration should be void; and consequently their Adoration
(if it had been then in use) should have been likewise Idolatrous. But we
hear no more of these your Exceptions.


IN 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. [The Bread which we break ( says the Apostle) is it
not the Communion of the Body of Christ? for we being many are one Bread and
one Body, in as much as we all partake of one Bread.] In this Sentence the
word [Bread] has a double Relation, the First to Christ his Body Natural.
Thus the joint Participation of the Bread is called the Communion of The
Analogy, in this respect, is excellently expressed by Panis, quia confirmat
Corpus, ideo Corpus Christi nominatur: Vinum autem, quia sanguinem operatur,
ideo ad sanguinem refertur. Haec autem duo sunt visibilia, sanctificata autem
per Spiritum sanctum, in Sacramentum divini Corporis transeunt. Isidor. Hisp.
de Offic. Lib. 1. cap. 18. See above, Book 2. Chap. 1.. 9. at (x)
Isidore: Bread ( says he) because it strengthens the Body, is therefore
called Christ's Body; and Wine, because it turns into Blood, is therefore
called Christ's Blood. These are two Visibles, but being sanctified by the holy
spirit, are turned into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. So he. This is indeed a
true Analogy, not to be performed by Accidents.

Could any of them, whom you call Calvinists, have spoken more significantly
either in contradicting your Exposition of Christ called Bread his Body;) or in
declaring the true proper Sense of the Sacramental Conversion? (for he says,
Bread is Changed into a Sacrament of Christ's Body;) or else in giving the
Reason why Bread and Wine were chosen to be Sacraments and Signs of Christ's
Body, and Blood, by which we are spiritually fed? (for he shows that it is
because of their Natural Effects, Bread substantially, and therefore not
Accidentally, strengthens Man's Body: Wine turns into Blood.) Which
overthrows your third Figment of only Substantia Panis non pertinet ullo
modo ad rationem Sacramenti, sed solum Accidentia. Bellar. Lib. 3. de Euch.
cap. 23. Respondeo substantiam.
Accidents; as if the Substance of Bread and Wine Sacrament. Say then, does the
Accident of Roundnesse, and Figure of Bread strengthen man's Body? or does the
Accident, Color of Wine, turn into Blood? As well might you affirm the only
Accident of Water in Baptism to be sufficient to purge and cleanse the Body, by
the color, and coldness, without the substantial matter thereof.

The Second part of the Analogy is discerned in the Mystical Body of Christ,
which is the Congregation of the Faithful Communicants; [ 1. Cor. 10. 17.
We are all one Body, in as much as we are partakers of one Bread.] It
stands thus; As many Granes of Corn make one Loaf of Bread, and many Grapes
make one measure of Wine in the C^p: So, many Christians, partaking faithfully
of this Sacrament, become One mystical Body of Christ by the Union of Faith,
and Love. This Exposition, as it is yielded unto by yo^ C^^inall Vnus Panis,

only Accidents, as painted Colors in stead of natural; because where there
is not a Sacramental Analogy, there is no Sacrament. You may not say, that
the Analogy consists in the matter before Consecration; because every
Sacramental Analogy is between the Sacrament, and the Thing Signified: but
it is no Sacrament, before it be Consecrated.

CHALLENGE.
SAy now, what Better Author is there than Christ? What better Disciple and
Scholar, than the Apostle of Christ? or Christ, and his Apostle, than the
Sentences of Ancient Fathers? calling the one part Wine, the other Bread, after
Consecration, as you have heard.

Our Third Proof, that the Substance of Bread remains after Consecration in
the Sacrament, is taken from the Judgment of Sense, necessarily. First, by the
Authority of Scripture.
ALthough man's Sense may be deceived, through the inconvenient Disposition of
the Medium, through which he sees, as it happens in judging a strait Staff to
be Crooked, which stands in the Water; and in thinking a White Object to be
Green in it self, which is seen through a Green glass; or Secondly by the
unequal Distance of place, as by concelving the Sun to be but two feet in
breadth; or Thirdly by some defect in the Organ, or Instrument of seeing (which
is the Eye) whereby it comes to pass that we take One to be Two, or mistake
a Shadow for a Substance. Yet notwithstanding when our Eyes, that see, are of
good Constitution, and Temper; the Medium, whereby we see, is perfectly
disposed; the Distance of the Object, which we see, is indifferent; then (say
we) the judgment of Sense, being free, is True, and the

This Reason, taken from Sense, you peradventure will judge to be but Natural
and Carnal, as those Terms are opposed to a true and Christian manner of
Reasoning. We defend the Contrary, being warranted by the Argument which Christ
himself used to his Disciples, Luke 24. 39. [ Handle me, and see.] Your
Cardinal, although he grant that this Reason of Christ was available, to
prove that his own Body was no Spirit, or Fancy, but a true Body, even by the
only Argument sense of Touching; Consequentia Christi, affirmative sumpta, Hoc
palpatur, hoc videtur, Ergo est Corpus, optu^a fuit, quia sensus non fallitur
circa proprium Objectum: ^taque necessario quod videtur, and tangitur Corporale
est. At negative, hoc non palpatur; nec videtur, Ergo non est corpus, Dominus
non fecit, and mala est. Non falluntur Sensus nostri, cum nos album quid,
rotundum, solidum sentire arbitramur, quae sunt propria objecta. Sed cum Panis
Substantiam sub illis Accidentibus ^atere denunciant, falluntur. Dominus solum
probare voluit se non esse inane spectrum, seu Phantasma, sed verum Corpus; id
quod ex Testimonio sensus Tangendi optime probavit. Illud autem Corpus esse
humanum, idem quod antea suerat, non probavit Dominus hoc solo Argumento, ex
Tangendi sensu desumpto (quod sine dubio non erat sufficiens) sed multis alijs
modis, loquendo, manducando, testimonio Angelorum, miraculo Piscium,
allegatione Scripturarum. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 14.. Respondeo.
Yet (says he) was it not sufficient in it self, without other Arguments, to
confirm it and to prove it to have bin a human body, and the very same which
it was. So he.

Which Answer of your Cardinal we wish were but only false, and not also
greatly irreligious: for Christ demonstrated hereby not only that he had a
Body (as your Cardinal speaks) but also that it was his own same Humane
Body, now risen, which before had been Crucified, and wounded to Death, and
buried, according to that of Luke [That it is even I] Luke 24, 39. Now because
1. Cor. 15.
It is not a Resurrection of a Body, except Therefore would Christ have Thomas
to Ioh. 20. 27.
thrust his hands into his sides, and feel the print of his wounds, to
manifest the Same Body; as Two of your Jesuits do also observe, the One with
an [ Optime Origenes, Ostendit se Christus in vero Corpore suo resuscitatum.
Tolet. les. in Ioh. c. 20. page 534.
Optime,] the Other with a [ Probatum est, Christum idem Corpus numero
demonstra^sse. Silarez Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 54.. 1.
Probatum est.] Accordingly the Apostle Saint Paul laid this Argument, taken
from Sense, as the Foundation of a Fundamental Article of Faith, even the
Resurrection of the Same Body of Christ from the dead; for how often does he
repeat, and inculcate this? 1. Cor. 15. 5.
He was seen, etc. And again thrice more, He was seen, etc. And Saint John
argues, to the same purpose, from 1. Ioh. 1. 1.
That which we have heard, which we have seen, and our hands have handled,
declare we unto you. The validity of this Reason was proved by the Effect, as
Christ averreth; 1. Ioh. 20. 29.
Thomas because thou have seen (that is, perceived both by Eye, and hand) thou
have believed.

The Validity of the Judgment of Sense, in THOMAS, and the other Disciples,
confirmed (in the second place) by your own Doctors. SECT. VIII.
PErerius a Jesuit confidently pleads for the Sense of Touch; Illud sine
dubitatione dicere non verebor, non polle ab ullo D^mone formari corpus corpus
adeo simile humano, ut siquis cum cura animi and attentione id tangeret, non
facile dignosceret ipsum non esse corpus humanum. Itaque non poterit Demon
similitudine corporis humani oculos fallere. Tactus autem sensum fallere omnino
non potest, quod quatuor Argumentis confirmabo -- Hoc verissimum esse patet ex
eo, quod Christus dixit discipulis suis [Palpate and videte:] and Thomae [After
digitum, etc.] Perer. Ies. in Genesis 6. number. 78. page 2.
I fear not ( says he) to say, that the Evidence of Sense is so strong an
Argument, to prove without all doubt an humane Body, that the Devil himself
cannot herein delude the touch of man, that is of understanding and
consideration. As for the unbeleeving Disciples, [Christ his Handle me, etc.]
says your Jesuit Si Discipuli Christi non potuissent Christi vera osta and
carnes discernere, mollitiem, and duritiem eorum, non dixisset ijs [Palpate,
and videte:] ac si diceret, Palpate and Percipite veras carnes and ossa.
Vasquez Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 51. Art. 2. disp. 184. cap. 2. page 487. Thomas dicit
singula Argumenta non fuisse per se sufficientia, been tamen conjuncta probari
cum testimonijs Prophetarum -- Ego tamen cum Cajetano Argumentum illud Tactus
efficacissimum fuisse ad comprobandum vetitatem Corporis humani in Christo.
Idem. ibid.
Vasquez, was as much as if he had said to them, Perceive you my true flesh? as
being a most efficacious Argument to prove the truth of an humane Body. So
he, yea, and Illud Thomae [non credam, etc] pertinaciae and obdurationis
vitium erat, and peccatum Infidelitatis. Optime Orig. lib. 2. con. Celsum, ubi

dixit solum [Nisi videro, non credam] sed adjunxit, [Nisi infero manum in
vestigia Clavorum.] Tolet. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 20.
Tolet another Jesuit did well discern the case of Thomas to have been an
extreme Infidelity, when he said, [Except I put my finger into Which prooveth
the Efficaciousnesse of the Judgment of Sense, in reducing so extreme an
Unbeliever to believe.

Wherein your Authors are authorized by S. Augustine, Aug. de tempore. Si
forte, inquit, Diceremus Thomae oculos fuisse deceptos, at non possemus dicere
ma^us frustratas: de Tactu non potest dubitari. Et Greg. Pont. Plus nobis

saying that Although Thomas his Eyes had been deceived, yet his touch was not
frustrate. And accordingly by Gregory Pope of Rome, who sticks not to say,
that The Infidelity of Thomas made more for confirmation of Christian Belief,
than did the faith of the other Apostles: Because his Doubtfulnesse being
convinced by And if this were not sufficient to confute your Cardinal, he may
be shackled with his own Answer, who, to disable the Infallibility of the
Sense of feeling, said; See above at (b)
That other Arguments were requisite for the certifying the judgment of Sense:
and among these Other he reckons Christ his speaking, eating, and working
Miracles. All which, what are they else (we pray you) but equally Objects of
Sense? What Vertigo then may this be called in him, to seek to invalidate the
verity of Sense, by an Argument which justifies the Certainty of Sense?

A third Confirmation of the Truth of Senses, as sufficient in Divine Causes,
for discerning Objects of Sense: and particularly in perceiving Bread and Wine
to continue the same in this Sacrament; by the Judgment
HOw many Heretics of old were there (such as the Valentinians, Montanists,
Marcionites) who denied that Christ had a True, and Essential Body? and how
absolutely were they confuted of Ancient Fathers, by the Evidence of men's
Senses that heard, saw, and felt the Body of Christ? Which shows plainly,
that a Demonstration by Sense stands good and strong, even in Christian
Philosophy. And to come to the viz. By the same Evidence may a Christian man
prove Bread to be truly Bread, after Consecration, whereby Christ proved his
Body to be a Body of flesh, after his Resurrection? But this he did from the
Infallibility of Sense. Therefore this may be equally concluded by the same
Argument of Sense.

And that there is the same Reason of both these, the Ancient Father Theodoret
shows in the Argument, wherewith he confuted Heretic by Sense, thus;
Eranistes apud Theod. Quia sicut Panis desinit esse Panis post Consecrationem,
sed mutatur in substantiam Corporis Christi. Ita Corpus Christi post
resurrectionem desinit esse proprie Corpus, sed in Naturam divinam mutatur
Orthodox. Imo vero, ut te capiam in laqueis his: Signa mystica non recedunt a
natura sua, manent enim in priori sua forma, figura, and substantia. Theod,
Dial 2. c. 24.
As after Consecration (says he) Bread remains the same in substance: So
Christ his Body after the Resurrection remained in substance the same. Thus
much of the Analogy. (As for the word [ Substance] more is to be spoken
thereof See hereafter, Sect. 12.
hereafter.) Yea, and Saint Augustine will not suffer the Communicant to
blindfold himself, whose Testimony (digested by Beda ex Augustino, Sermon. ad
Insd^^tes in cap. 10. ad Cor. fol. 139. apud Bedam. Quod vidistis Panis est,
quod oculi vestri renunciant, quod autem fides vostra, etc. Sic^^ ex multis
granis tritici unus Panis: Ita ex multitudine fidelium, una assurgit Ecclesia.

unto you. And he speaks of Bread, as this Sacrament was a Symbol, and Sign
of the mystical Body of Christ, which is his Church, consisting of a multitude

*Give Chrysostom leave to put in his suffrage, especially in that Sentence,
Chrysostom. de Resurrect. (Objected by D. Heskins in his Parliam. Book. 2. Chap.
11.) Non est meum, meos ludificare Phantasmate, vanam imaginem visus si timet,

which is objected against us by your own Doctor, wherein that holy Father
brings in Christ, as speaking to his Disciples, concerning the verity of the
Sense of Feeling, and delivers two points, especially remarkable. One is,
that Although the Sight, by reason of some defect, might be easily deceived:
yet the Trial by Touch, in discerning a Body of flesh, is beyond all
peradventure. The Second is, that if Christ should have propounded any Object,
as being a Body, wherein their Touch should be deceived, he might then be said
to have mocked and deluded his Disciples. Whereunto accords the like
Testimony of Gregory, above cited, in the former Section. And is not the Touch,
in discerning the bodily Creature of Bread, and Flesh, of equal efficacy?
yea, and again Augustine in another place, objected by your own selves;
August. in Ioh. Tract 26. Objected by Dr. Heskins, Parl. Book. 2. Chap. 219.
Our Lord Jesus (says he) commended his Body and Blood in those things, which
of many are brought into one certain thing: for the one is made into one of
many Granes, and so Consists; the other Comes into one, of many Grapes.

Consonantly S. Cyprian, and as plainly, Cyprian. lib. 1. Epist. 6. ad Mag. Nam

Pamel. Epi. 76)
When Christ called his Body Bread, (says he) which Bread was made one, by
Both these holy Fathers (even as Chrysostom already, Both. 3. chap. 3. Sect.
4. has done) teach, as it were with one breath, that the Outward
Sacramentalls, wherein Christ commends his Body and Blood, being Substances
compounded, the one of diverse Corns in one loaf, the other of diverse
mystical Body of Christ, which is the Church of his faithful, by the union of
multitudes of people in one. But in your mere Accidents of Bread and Wine, you
can have no union either of Granes, or of Grapes; neither can you say, that he
spoke not of the things Consecrated, because the things were first Consecrated,
before they were commended to his Disciples to be eaten and drank.

Athanasius will be content to deliver his vote after the other Manichees, who
fancied only a Fantastical Body of Christ, observes that ( Athan. Tom. 2.
Orat 2. in Assumpt. Christ. -- (...)
Christ both did eat meat, and permitted his Body to be touched of his
Disciples, that thereby they might have not only their eyes, but also their
hands Witnesses of the Truth of his Body, and remove all exception of the
apparition of a Ghost, yea, and that By the continued sight hereof with their
bodily eyes, Christ insinuated Faith into their souls. Gladly would we know
whether even any doctrine could more patronize that Heretical doctrine of a
Rhantasticall Body, than this yours, of your manner of the Presence of Christ's
Body in the E^charist does where in these appears not so much as a Spectrum
of that Body, but only (as you) Accidents of Bread. *

Tertullian has a large Plea against the Academicks, who denied the judgment
of Sense; wherein he maintains the Truth of the Senses, and in proof
thereof he manifests the Perfection of Christ his Senses in Seeing, Feeling,
Tasting, Smelling; and at length he falls upon the point now in Question,
saying, that Tertull de Anima, cap 7 ad finem. Quid agi^. Academice

If we yield not to the suffrages of Senses, some may doubt whether Christ
perceived afterward another Sent of ointment, which he received (meaning
another that the natural Sunt thereof) before his Burial. And immedia^ly he
adds, One might doubt also whether Christ tasted afterward another taste of
Wine, than was that, which he consecrated for the memorial of his Blood. That
then, which Christ Tasted, was first Consecrated. Next, he invadeth the
Heretic Marcion, for denying the Truth of Christ's Body on earth, and
confuteth him by the fidelity of the Senses of the Apostles. Faithful (says
he) was their sight of Christ in the Mount, Faithful was their Taste of Wine
at the Marriage, Faithful was the Touch of Thomas, etc. (then concluding:)
Which Testifications (says he) had not been True, if their Senses had been
Liars. So he in Academicks, but also of the Heretical Marcionites, who
(contrary to the demonstration of the Apostles Senses) denied the truth of the
humane Body of Christ.

CHALLENGE.
Tertullian, in behalf of the verity of the Senses, does minister to all
Christians four Conclusions, First, not to conceit of Accidents without
Subjects: but to discern of Subjects, and Substances, by their Accidents.
Secondly, that our Outward Senses rightly constituted (more especially the
Sense of Feeling) are Demonstrations of Truth, in Sensible Objects. Thirdly,
that this verification of Subjects, by their Accidents, is common with Christ,
his Apostles, all Christians, and with every reasonably man. And lastly, that
Wine is to be discerned to be truly and naturally Wine, after Consecration,
by the judgment of the Senses, because he instanceth in this very point:
teaching that Christ had the same taste of Substantial Wine afterward, which
he had before in that which he consecrated; even as he had also the same Sent
of Substantial Ointment after, which he had before his Burial. And all this
even now, when he convinced Marcion of Heresy, an Enemy to the Catholic
Faith, in denying the Truth of Christ's notwithstanding the Evidence of Man's
Senses.

Here had been a full and flat Evasion for that Heretic to say, what tell you
us of the validity of the Evidence of two Senses, concerning the Truth of
Christ's Body, seeing you yourselves gainsay the judgment of four Senses at
once, in denying the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament? This, we say, they
must needs have replied, if that the Catholics then had been of your now
Roman Belief, to think that all the Senses are deceived, in judging the
matter of this Sacrament to Bread or wine; and so might they have blown away
all this Catholic Confutation of Heretics and Infidels with one and the same
breath, together with the like Instances against the same Heresy, already
specified, as you have heard.

Come now hither all ye that say we must renounce all Verdict of Senses in
this Case; and tell us whether any Protestant could have been more opposite to
your Doctrine than was Tertullian, in his Defense of this Truth? whereby he
also defends the Catholic Doctrine of the Resurrection of and was never
hereof questioned by any Catholic, in, or since his days.

Let none of you object that of the Disciples, in their way to Emmaus with
Christ, of whom it is said, that [ Luc. 24. 16.
They could not know him:] for the same Text gives this Cause, that their eyes
were holden, lest they should see him: and after, Ibid. verse. 31.
Their eyes were opened, and they saw him. So the Evangelist, which is so far
from infringing any thing that has been said, for the Infallibility of
Sense, rightly constituted and disposed, that this thereby is notably
confirmed. We call upon Hierome to Hieron. ad Pammach: contra Errores Johan.
Ierusal. Episc. Scias errorem fuisse non corporis Domini, sed oculorum fuisse
clausorum: nam aperti sunt oculi eorum, and videbant.
The Error of not discerning Christ, when he was in the midst between them,
was not in Christ's Body, but in their eyes, because they were closed that they
could not see. Apply we this unto the Eucharist. Dare any Papist say, that the
Cause, why any of you cannot see Christ in this Sacrament, is not in his Body
(which you believe to be in it self invisible) but in your Eyes, as being
shut up; when notwithstanding you will be known, that these are open enough
for discerning Colors, and forms of Bread and Wine.

*It can be but a matter of merriment, to acquaint you with that which Master
Malloune a Jesuit reports in good sadness, as thus: Mr. Malloun in his Reply,
page 305.
A devout Maid of the Vulgar sort, by name Ioane Martlesse, (a thing most
admirable, says he) was able to find out one only consecrated Host, among a
thousand unconsecrated, not only by Divine revelation, but also by her
natural Senses. So your Jesuit (as he says) out of Waldensis. Host among a
thousand, or whether the Priest infused some smellable virtue into it, to give
it a Sent, yet must we tell you, that when afterward (in the seventh Book)
it shall be discovered unto you, that there are incident to the Action of your
Priest, in Conscrating, above five hundred possible Defects, which may nullify
his whole Act, so that the thing remain still Bread (notwithstanding
whatsoever his manner of Consecrating, by him performed;) You will then know how
happy it were for Nose of Ioane Martlesse, to try whether there be any Hosb
truly consecrated, as being (according to your Doctrine) substantially Christ's
Body, lest that otherwise you fall into Idolatry, by worshipping Bread instead
of Christ himself. (See the seventh Book.)*.

Our Fourth Proof, that the Substance of Bread remains, after Consecration,
is taken from the Confessed Sensible Effects.

your selves have discerned to be That the Cup does inebriate, or make drunk.
Secondly, The Host taken in great Quantity does nourish. Thirdly, That, it
being poisoned, it paysoneth. Fourthly, That having been long reserved, it
engendereth worms, which are bred out of it; and are also fed of the same.
Fifthly, That their matter of Generation and nourishment is Substantial; and
that the Contrary Opinion is false, and Incredible. Sixthly; That this matter,
whereof worms are bred and fed, is the same Bread, which was taken before
Consecration. So your own prime Schoolmen, Historians, and Jesuits
respectively.

If then the Bread, now ingendring worms, be the Same that was taken to be
Consecrated; how say you that, being Consecrated, it is not still the same, our
Senses giving Testimony thereunto?

THE FIRST CHALLENGE.
HEre you have nothing to answer, but that the Bread, whereof new worms are
bred, whether it be the Same that was, or not, yet being Bread, it is wrought
either by a Quomodo fiat haec materia -- Thomistae liquot dicunt per
Conversionem aliquam in (...) sum, Panem, A^^ iterum Crea^^; and hoc verius

Probabilior sententia est, a solo Deo per creatione^ produci *
Miraculous or by a New Creation. What? you, who every where teach that none
are to conceit of any Miracle in this Sacrament, without necessary Cause, can
you possibly be persuaded that there is, or can be any necessary Cause, why God
should work a Miracle, either of Conversion into, or of New Creation of Bread,
for Breeding, or Feeding of worms? or of Wine, for making such men Drunk, as
should taste too largely of the Cup? yea, or else to poison your Enemy, were

Pope? Nay, can it be less than Blasphemy, to say that God works Miracles,
for the accomplishment of vain, Blessed Body of our Lord Christ, who by his
Touch cured so many diseases, in the time of his mortality, should now, being
glorified, miraculously poison his Guests whosoever they be.

Believe (if you can) that if God wrought (as you say) a Miracle to convert
Accidents into Bread, to engender, or nourish vile worms, that he would not
much rather work a miracle, (if any such miracle were herein to be expected)
to hinder the poisoning of his faithful Communicants. In all this we appeal
again Miraculous Conversion of the Consecrated Host (when it begins to
putrify) by being changed again into Bread; or of Mice eating the Body of
Christ; or that being putrified it should bread worms; (seeing it were a
miracle they should not be so bred) or any such kind of Romish Fancies, and
delusions; or otherwise to confess your Objectours to be miserable Proctours
of a vile, and desperate Cause. Yet lest any of you may think, that One coming
into a Cellar full of new Wine, and made Drunk with the smell thereof,
therefore mere Accidents do Inebriate: your Jesuit will deny this, and tell
you that it is the In Cella Vi^^ria, novis vinis ^^plera, solus Accodore

A SECOND CHALLENGE,
YOur Common and most plausible Objection, to dementate vulgar people, is to
persuade them that you cannot attribute Credit to your Senses in this case,
without much derogation from Faith. Therefore, for Caution-sake, be it known
unto you, that we have not pleaded for the Truth of Senses, as holding nothing
credible, but that which may be proved by the Testimony of Senses.

This we utterly abhor, as the Gulf of Infidelity, proper Athean Sect: for
we accord to that saying of an holy Father, Fides non habet meritum, ubi Ratio
aut Sensus habet experimentum; and also to that other of (...). Justin.
Exposit. Fidei.
Iustine. In which respect we condemn the Incredulity of Thomas, in that he
would not believe, except he should See: yet notwithstanding we, with our
Savior, approve in Thomas, that by Seeing he did believe. For this is a true
Tenet in Divinity, Faith may be ( Supra) above right Reason, or Sense; but
never ( Contra) against either. It was never read that God required of any man
a belief of any Sensible thing, which was Contrary to the exact judgment of
Senses. And therefore your opposition, in this Case, as it is Sensles, so it is
indeed Faithless, as we have already learned from Scripture and Fathers; by
whom the Judgment of Sense has been acknowledged to be, in Sensible
Objects, a notable Ground of Faith. All this while we have said nothing of
your professed manner of Existence of Accidents, which you may read in the
Challenge following.

*A THIRD CHALLENGE, Touching the Accidents of Bread and Wine, in this
Sacrament.
COncerning the Accidents of Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, after
Consecration, some are such as were before Consecration inherent in them, as to
be Visible, Savory, Solid, etc. And some are Accessory Impressions and
Alterations, which accrue afterward, as if it shall happen Hot, Cold, Sweet,
or Sower, or the like. We demand, what thing you do judge that to be, which so
happens to be hot or sweet after Consecration? None can deny but this must be
either Quality or Quantity, or some material Substance. We, consulting with
two of your own Jesuits, hear the one maintaining that these two Accidents
have Bellarm. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 24.. Respondeo tractantur -- Si
mutatio in Pane Eucharistiae sit sola alteratio, ut calefactio, co^densatio,
tum non requiritur materia aut substantia pro subjecto: nam Accide^tia omnia
pro subjecto habent Quantitatem, quae in Sacramento maneat, unde Hostia
consecrata dicitur alba, sapida, rotunda, parva. Haec enim omnia denominant
Quantitatem, alioqui non possit fieri denominatio, non enim Accidentia de
seipsis dicunsu^ in Concreto, sed solum de Subjecto, excepta Quan^^tate, quae
dicitur Quantitas and Quanta.
Quantity for their Subject; and the other Lessius Ies. Opusc. de
Perfectionibus divinis. lib. 12. cap. 16. number. 112. Alterum Miraculum est circa
species, quod ita Passiones and Impressiones suscipiant aliarum quantitatum,
perinde ac si Materiae Panis and Vini rema^^rent, calescunt enim Species, atque
frigeseunt, similesque mutationes subeunt. Quidam putant Quantitatem sol^^ esse
immediate Subject^^h omnium Accidentinum, quod difficile est creditu, quid enim
Quantitatis indoli cum illis Qualitatibus? non enim Quantitas haber ullam
propensionem ad calorem, frigus, saporem, (...) and similia; neque enim illa
dicuntur calescere, frigescere, aut been maleve olere.
Confuting this; Because Hotnesse, Sweetness, and such like Qualities have no
affection to Quantity: meaning, that we cannot call any Quantity Cold, Hot, or
Sweet; Whereunto

As for the said Qualities, which the latter Iusuite answers to be Ibiden.
Mihi semper verius est visum, non solum Quantitatem, sed and alias Qualitates
hic per se existere, nullique Subjecto niti, ac proinde calorem and frigus, and
similes Impressiones extrinsecus immissas non recipi in Speciebus, tanquam in
Subjecto proprio, sed and penetrative, and mutuo nexu commisce^i.
mingled with the other Accidents, which were inherent in the Host, before
Consecration, the former Jesuit gain says it, because Accidents are not
predicated of themselves in the Concrete; to wit, we say not of Coldness it
is cold; or of Sweetness, it is sweet. but these are spoken of their Subjects,
which we call either Sweet or Gold. And this we likewise approve. Seeing
then, that no Accident can be predicated, but of some Subject, and this
Subject of Coldness, Hotnesse, Sweetness, Sowernesse, and of other the like
Accidents happening to the same Sacrament, after Consecration, cannot be so
called either in respect of Quantity or Quality, it remains that the Subject
of them must be a material substance, which, as you your selves (we know)
will swear cannot be the Body of Christ; for you dare not say of it, that it
in your touch or taste is either Cold, Sweet, or Sower, You must therefore give
us leave to believe it to be Substance of Bread. And this our Argument takes
away your Fancy of Accidents without a Subject; else must you affirm that he,
or she, whosoever shall make the Host, after it be Consecrated, either Hot,
Sweet, or Sour, does in so doing make so many Miracles of Accidents, which are
void of their Subjects; which unnecessary multiplication of Miracles both your
old, and new Schools have ever controlled. *

Our First Proof, that Bread remains Bread in Substance, after Consecration,
in this Sacrament, is by the Judgment
TEstimonies of Ancient Fathers infer a necessary Consequence, for proof of
the Existence of Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, as might be proved partly
by the repetition of many Arguments premised, and partly by intimation
Irenaeus, speaking of the Eucharist after Consecration, as being not now common
Bread, said that Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 34. Sicut Panis, qui est a tetra, jam
non Communis Panis est, sed Eucharistia, ex duabus rebus constans, terren a and
coelesti: Sic Corpora nostra participantia Eucharistiam jam non sunt
Corruptibilia, sed spem Resurrectionis habentia.
It consists of an earthly part, and an heavenly: how? even as the Bodies of
the Communicants (says he) are no more corruptible, having an hope of the
Resurrection to come. Scan these words, by the Law of Similitude; and it must
infallibly follow, that as our Bodies, albeit substantially Earthly, are
notwithstanding called Incorruptible, in respect Earthly substance of this
Sacrament, being Bread, is nevertheless endued with a sacred and Divine
property of a Sacramental Representation of Christ's Body. Which Sacrament
Origin calling Sanctified meat, says that the Origin. in Matthew. 15. Ille
Cibus, qui sanstificatur per Verbum Dei and Orationem, juxta id quod habet
materiable in secessum emittitur: And after he calls this [M^teriale]
Materia Panis, super quem dictus est sermo. ibid.
Material part thereof goes into the Draught, or seege: which no sanctified
heart can conceive of Christ's Body, whereof the Fathers often pronounce, that
It goes not into the Draught.

But what is meant by, Material in this place, think you M. Liturg. Tract.
2.. 11. Subd. 3.
Brerely? namely Magnitude, and other Sensible Accidents, which in regard of
their Significations, are materials. So he. Very learnedly answered forsooth!
If Magnitudo, that is Greatness, be a Material thing; be you so good as
tell us what is the matter thereof? for whatsoever is Material, has that
appellation from it is Subject matter. Is is the Body of Christ? then must you
grant (which we, with the holy Fathers, abhor to think) that the Body of
Christ passes into the Draught: or is it Bread? Then farewell
Transubstantiation. Nay, will you say, but they are mere Accidents. And we
Answer, that it was never heard, no not in your own Schools, that mere
Accidents were called (which are Origen's words in this place) either Meats, or
Materials. Yea, and Origin (that he might be known to understaud Material
Bread) furthermore calls it now, after Consecration, Matter of Bread: not of
Accidents of Bread, or yet Accidents signifying Bread: for what Papist will say
that the Forms of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament, after Consecration, are
Symbols, or Signs, signifying Bread and Wine; and not Symbols of the Body and
Blood of Christ?

S. Ambrose his Comparison is of like Consequence; Ambros. lib. 4. de
Sacrament. cap. 4. Quanto magis est operatorius Sermo Christi, ut sint quae
erant, and in aliud convertantur? -- Tu eras vetus Creatura, postquam
consecratus, nova Creatura esse coepisti.
As one Baptized had been an old Creature, and was made a new one, even so
(speaking of the Bread and Wine after Consecration) they being changed into
another thing, remain that which they were before. But he (you know) that was
baptized, remains after Baptism in Substance the same man, although, in
respect of Spiritual Graces, he suffers a Change. Of which Testimony more
See below, chapter 4. Sect. 2. at the let. (...)
hereafter.

Cyprian is a Father much alleged and urged by you, in defense of
Transubstantiation; but is now at hand to control Cyprias. lib. de Unction.
Dedit Dominus noster in Mensa, in qua ultimum Convivium cum Apostolis
participavit, propris manibus Panem and Vinum: in Cruce vero manibus mili^um
corpus tradidi^ v^^^tandum, ut (...) Apostolis secretius impressa sincera
veritas and vera sincerit^s, exponeret Gentibus, quomodo Panis and Vinum Caro
ejus essent and Sangui^; and quibus rationibus Causae effectis conrenirent, and
diversa nomina, vel species ad unam reducerentur essentiam, ut significantia
and significata eisdem vocabulis conferentur.
Our Lord gave in this Banquet ( says he) Bread and Wine with his own hands,
when he partaked thereof with his Apostles: but on the Cross he delivered up
his Body to the Soldiers to be pierced with wounds, to the end, that sincere
verity, and true sincerity having an inward impression in the Apostles, he by
them might manifest to the Gentiles, how that Bread and wine is his Body and
Blood, and by what means there may be agreement between Causes, and Effects;
and how different names and forms might be reduced to one Essence; that things
signifying, and things signified might be called by the same names. So he. A
gave to his Disciples, he answers it was Bread, and Wine; and not absolutely
that, which he gave up to be Crucified on the Cross by Soldiers, ( namely)
his Body, and Blood. If again you demand of Cyprian, why Christ called the
Bread, which he had in his hand, his Body, he readily answers saying: The
things signifying ( or Signs) are called by the same names, whereby the things
signified are termed.

* The Marcian Heretic held Bread and Wine to be unclean Creatures:
Tertullian confuteth them, But how? even by the Bread and Wine used of Christ
in the Eucharist; Because Christ (says he) did not reject his Creature,
wherewith he represented his own Body. In which Testimony the word, [
Represents,] being spoken of the Eucharist, it must needs note it as a thing
Consecrated, else could it not be said to Represent the Body of Christ. And by
calling this a Creature representing Christ's Body, he distinguishes it from
Christ's Body. And lastly, the Heretic teaching the Substance; and not the
Accidents of the same Creature, Bread, to be unclean, and Tertullian
disproving him by the Sacramental Bread, must as necessarily have meant a
continuing of the Substance of Bread, as all the Laws of Arguing do proclaim;
which teach all Answerers and Confuters to speak ad Idem. *

Protestant of admirable learning, unfolded unto you The Bread, by being
divided, is diminished: that, It is delivered by fragments: that these are so
little, that they are to be called rather Bitts, than Parts. Thus they spoke
expressly of Bread Consecrated; but to say that you eat Bitts and Fragments
of whiteness, of Roundnesse, and other Accidents, who is so absurd among your
selves? and to affirm the same of Christ's Body, who is so impious?

* Only it will be our duty to Answer the Objection of Heskins, for proof of
the Corporal presence of Christ his Body; who produces the Cautions, which
Pope Clement, in his second Epistle, gave to the Priests and Deacons,
concerning the Fragments, and pieces of that which he calls Fragments of the
Lords Body; Charging them, Dr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ.
That no Mice-dung may be seen among the Fragments of the Lords Portion: Nor
that they be Suffered to remain rotten through their negligence. We Answer;
First, by the words, Fragments of Christ's Portion, are to be understood either
mere Accidents, and then are your Disputers unconscionable, to argue Fragments
of mere Accidents, for a Substantial Existence of the Body of Christ: Or else
thereby you must believe they meant properly Christ's Body, and then should you
be altogether blasphemous, to teach a Body of Christ rent into Fragments, and
Portions; and the same pieces of the same Body to be in themselves subject unto
the pollution of Micedung, Putrification, and Rottenness. Here, indeed, were
there some use of the admirable Below in the fourth Book. (...)

Nice. In the Interim we may well think, that that Primitive Church, which
abhorred to think the Body of Christ should be Devoured, or pass into the
Draught, would never have consented (as* She did) to the Burying of the
Sacrament, which remained after the Communion; if they had conceived it to be
Really the Body of Christ.

Another Inference we may take from Antiquity, in her calling this Sacrament [
Pignus] a Pledge (so Hierom. in 1. Cor. 11. Dominus passionis suae ultimam
nobis Commemorationem, and memoriam reliquit: que^admodum siquis peregre
proficiscens aliquod pignus ei, quem diligit, derelinquat, ut possit eius

of the Bodily Absence of Christ, by virtue of the Relation between the Person
and his Pledge; And so does also Primasius, See-Booke 5. Chap. 9.. (...).
Primasius. The third and last Classis of Fathers may be viewed in the Section
following.

A Confirmation of the same Judgment of the Fathers, acknowledging in express
terms, Bread to remain, after Consecration, in Substance the same. The First
Father is THEODORET. SECT. XII.
THeodoret makes a Dialogue, or Conference between two Parties, being in
Controversy about the humane and bodily nature of Christ; the one is named
Eranistes, upon whom is imposed the person of an Heretic, for Defense of the
Sect of the Eutychians, who (falsely) held, That the Body of Christ, after his
Ascension, being glorified, was swallowed up of his Deity, and continued no
more the same humane and Bodily Essence, as before his Resurrection it had
been. The other Party and Disputer is named Orthodoxus, signifying the
Defender of the Truth of the Catholic Doctrine; which Person Theodoret
himself Heretic is brought in, for Defense of his Heresy, arguing thus; Even
as Signs in the Eucharist, after the words of Invocation (or Consecration) are
not the same, but are changed into the Body of Christ: even so, after his
Ascension, was his Body changed into a Divine [(...),] meaning, Substance of a
Divine Essence. Which both your Romanistes and Protestants confess to have
been the Doctrine of these Heretics.

This was that Heretic his Objection. The Orthodoxe, or Catholic (which was
Theodoret himself) comes to answer, catch the heretic, as he says, in his
own Snare, by retorting his Argument of Similitude against him, thus: Theod.
Dial. 2. c. 24. Non post sanctificationem mystica signa (...). (...) post. Sic
illud Corpus Christi priorem habet Formam, Figuram, Circumscriptionem, and (de
summatim dicam) (...): etiamsi post resurrectionem immortale, and immune ab
omni corruptione.
Nay, But as the mystical Signs in the Eucharist, after Sanctification,
depart not from their former nature, but continue in their former Figure, Form
and [(...)] that is, Substance. So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection,
remains in its former Figure, Form, Circumscription, and [(...)], or
Substance which it had before. You may perceive that the Assertion, set down
in the name of a Grand Heretic, is absolutely your Romish Profession for
Transubstantiation at this day, (to wit) Bread is changed after Consecration
into the Substance of Christ's Body; and that also the Assertion of Theodoret,
in the person of the Protestants, defending that Bread after Consecration
remains in Substance the same. Wherefore if ever, it now concerns your
Disputers to Free your Romish Article from Heresy: which diverse have
undertaken to do by their Answers, but alas! so absurdly, that any reasonable
man must needs laugh at their Answer; and so falsely, as which any man of
conscience must as necessarily detest.

The Principal Answer is that, which your Non loquitur de substantia, quae
distinguitur contra Accidentia, and quam in Categori^a posuit Aristoteles; sed
de Essentia, and natura Accidentium. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 27.. Sed me.
Cardinal gives, that Theodoret, in saying that Bread remains the same and
(...); By [(...)] meant not Substance, properly understood, but the Essence of
Accidents. So he. *Or as your Gordon. Ies. lib. Controv. 4. cap. 4. number. 12. De
signorum (id est, Accidentium) substantia loquitur.
Jesuit says, Thesubstance of the Signs, which are Accidents. An answer (by
your leave) No oriously, Ridiculously, and Heretically False.

First, Notoriously false, because the Argument of Theodoret, being taken from
a Similitude, and every Similitude consisting of two Propositions, the first
called Protasis, and the other Apodosis, it is necessary by the Rule of Logike;
(as you know) that the words and terms, betokening the same Similitude,
Apodosis of Theodoret, which is this: So the Body of Christ, after the
Resurrection, remains the same in Figure, Form, and (...); by the word
[(...)] was meant properly Substance, because this was (...), the maine point
in Question between Theodoret and the Heretic, viz. whether the Substance of
Christ's Body continued the same, which it had been in time before his
Resurrection; (the Heretic denying it, and Theodoret proving it to be
absolutely still the same in Substance:) and not whether the same only in
Quantities, and Accidents; for those the Apostle 1. Cor. 15. 34.
Corruption putting on Incorruption, Mortality Imortality, and shame Glory.
Therefore in the Protasis, and first Proposition of that comparison of
Theodoret, (which was this, As the Bread remains the same in Figure, Form,
and (...)) the word [(...)] can have no other signification than Substance,
properly taken.

Secondly, Ridiculously false, because in reckoning Figure and Form, which are
known to be Accidents, and adding [(...)] this necessarily is opposed to the
former Two, as Substance to Accidents. Nor was there (we suppose) ever any so
unlearned, who did add the word [(...)] to Forms, and Figures, but he thereby
meant to distinguish it as a Substance from its Accidents.

Thirdly, Heretically false; for what was the Heresy of the Eutychians? tell
us; They (say Alphonsua a Castro, de Haeres. Eurych. Negabant Christum habuisse
naturam humanam; tantum in eo ponentes naturam divinam.
you) held that Christ (namely after his Resurrection) had not an humane
nature, but only Divine. Which word, Humane Nature, does principally imply the
Substantial nature of Man; and therefore in his comparison, Heresy concerning
Bread, after Consecration, in Figure, Form, and [(...)] the same word [(...)]
had the same signification of Substance, as your Master Brerely afterward is
compelled to confess: who, to the end he may disgrace Theodoret, rudely and
wildly takes upon him to justify the Heretics speech to be Catholic, for
proof of Transubstantiation.

Wherefore Theodoret, in his Answer, Retorting (as he himself says) the
Heretics Comparison, against him, did, by (...), likewise understand
Substance, else had he not disputed ad Idem; Heretic. Much like as if one
should use this Comparison following. As the Moone-shine in the water (in the
opinion of the Vulgar) is truly of the same bigness with the Moon in the
Firmament; so a feigned friend is equally as loving as is a Faithful. And
another retorting the same, should confute him, saying; Nay, but as the
Moonshine in the water, is not of the same bigness with the Moon in the
Firmament; even so a feigned friend is not equally loving as is a Faithful.
Here the word [ Love] being taken for Loyal Affection Retorter, to signify
Lust, the Disputers might be held to be little better than those Two in Alter
hireum mulget: alter cribram supponit.
A. Gellius, where such an Objectour is compared to a man milking an Hee-goat,
(or if you will, a Bull) and the Answerer to another holding under a Sive.
*Observe also that Arius the Heretic, being required to tell What is Substance
(Greek (...)) answered, That is Substance, [(...)] whereby a thing does
subsist. And Athan. Tom. 1. Disput. cont. A^ium, ubi Arius: (...). Cui
Athan^s^^s, (...).
Athanasius himself approved hereof, saying, Thou have answered rightly: This
could they not have said, Greek Church, as well among Orthodoxe, as among
Heretics: for that which gives a Subsisting to other things (as you your
selves will not deny) is to be properly a Substance. *

Here had we fixed a Period, but that we again espied one Master Brerely (a
Romish Priest) coming against us with a full careere, who after that he had
been Vid Protestants Appeal, Book. 2. chapter 2.. 10.
confuted, for urging the former Objection, notwithstanding, concealing the
Answer, he blusheth not to regest the same; albeit, as one conscious to
himself of the futility thereof, he leaves it presently, falling foul upon
Theodoret, as though that Father had been in some distemper, when he so, writ:
In his Liturg^^ of the Mass. Tract. 2.. 2 subd. 3. p. 254.
saying, first, that Theodoret used that his Retortion in his Not so, for he
was now not i^^a personal Dispute, but deliberately writing against the
Heresia of the Eutychiant.
heat of Dispute. Then he takes part with the Heretic, saying, It is not
likely that an Heretic should have urged against a Catholic sentence for
Transubstantiation, as for a point of Faith well known, if the same Doctrine
So he, who might as well have reasoned, in the behalf of the Sadduces,
condemned by Christ, saying: It is not likely that they would so expressly
have denied that there a^e any Spirits, in their Dispute against Christ, if
that Doctrine had been then either unknown or condemned as False, by the
Church of God, among the Jews. And yet it is certain that the Heresy of the
Sadduces was judged execrable in that Church.

Now if the Eutychian Heretic find such Patronage at the hands of your
Priest, alas! what will become of the Father Hearken, Theodoret being an
Orthodoxe Bishop ( says he) could not have propounded the Heretics Argument,
as grounded upon the Churches received Doctrine of Transubstantiation, had the
same been then unknown, and reputed False. So he, who if he had not lost his
Logike, would certainly have argued contrarily, saying; Theodoret, being an
Orthodoxe and Catholic Bishop, would never have set down an Objection for
Transubstantiation, in the name of a rank Heretic, and after himself
impugned and confuted the same, except he had known it to be flatly repugnant
to the Catholic Church in his time. Wherefore if you

For a further Evidence, take unto you an Answer of your Jesuit Valentia, to
this and the like Testimonies of Antiquity: It is not to be held any marvel
(says Valent. Ies. l. 2. de Transub. c. 7. Dabimus aliud breve, and simplex,
and sine ullo incommodo responsum. Enimvero antequam quaestio ista de

in the Church, he plainly confuteth your now Roman Church, which judges it to

was an Orthodox Father, and very Ancient.

Now then. Gelasius said that Gelasius lib. de duab. nature. cont. Eutych.

quodper eadem divinae efficimur participes naturae, and tamen non definit esse

and Baton quo supra. At dicit Gelasius. In Divinaru transcunt Spiritu sancto

may be seen, indeed, that this Gelasius was a Latin Author, (but what is
this to the Greek Theodoret?) when the Latin Language was not so perfect, and
that he did use the word equivocall^, but yet so; that the matter it self does
challenge a proper use thereo, when he speaks of the Substance of Bread, for
confutation of the same heresy.]
Cardinals here (as before) by Substance interpret Accidents: one of them
laboring to prove that Gelasius somewhere else called Accidents, Substances.
Were this granted, yet the Argument, which Gelasius has in hand, will compel
the understanding Reader to acknowledge in this his Sentence a proper
signification of Substance. For where as the Heretic Eutyches taught that
Christ his Body was changed into the Substance of his Divinity, after the
Resurrection, and that the substance of his Body remained no more the same;
Gelasius confuteth him by a Similitude, and Comparison, viz. That as the
Substance of Bread remains after Consecration: So Christ his Bodily Substance
remained after the Resurrection. Wherein if the word, Substance, be not in
both places taken properly, Gelasius should have made but a mad Reason, as any
reasonable man will confess. For albeit Similitudes do not amble always on
four feet, yet if they halt upon the right foot, (which is the matter in
Question) they are to be accounted perfect Dissimilitudes.

Master Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 3. page 259.
Brerely would have you to know, that this Gelasius (whosoever he were) writes
against the same Eutychian Heresy, that Theodoret did; and thereupon uses
accordingly, to his like advantage, the words Substance, and Nature, in the
same sense, as did Theodoret. So he. And he says true; and therefore must
Gelasius with us, until you shall be able to free your selves from our former
Interpretation of Theodoret. But Master Brerely opposes against us another
sentence of Gelasius, from whence he concludes that Gelasius held
Transubstantiation: so that Gelasius must rather contradict himself, than that
he shall not consent to the Romish Tenet. Whereas, indeed, he says no more
than, in a mystical sense, any Protestant must, and will allow, viz. that The
Sacrament is a Divine thing, and that whosoever eat spiritually the Body of
Christ, are by it made partakers of the blessing of his Divine So Gelasius.
Whereof copiously throughout the fifth Book.

To which Saying of Gelasius, touching the Eucharist, is answerable a like
Saying of Gregory Nyssen, concerning Baptism, calling it a Greg Nyssen. A quam

he did term Priest, Divine; People, Divine; it proves that he meant no
Substantial Change. Fie upon blind boldness! This man's falsity, in alleging
Chemnitius, I let pass.

It is further worthy your Reflection, to observe your Disputers how earnest
they have been to prove that this Author was not Pope Gelasius; contrary to
the acknowledgement of your own Historians. May we not therefore suspect that

It is further worthy your Reflection, to observe your Disputers how earnest
they have been to prove that this Author was not Pope Gelasius; contrary to
the acknowledgement of your own Historians. May we not therefore suspect that
the Testimony objected was distasteful unto them, when they so greatly feared,
lest this Witness should be thought to have been a Pope and Supreme Pastor of
your Church?

Two other Testimonies from Antiquity, for the express acknowledgement of the
Existence of Bread after Consecration, in the Sacrament; Chrysostom, and
Bertram: to whom is added Ephraimius. SECT. XIIII.
C Hrysostome his words are these, that Chrysostom. Ante Consecrationem Panem
vocamus, Divina vero gratia Sacerdotis ministerio sanctificatur, and digna
appellatione Dominici Corporis habetur, etsi natura Panis in ipso permansit.
Epist. ad Caesar. [See of this Doct. Usher, ad Ann. 400. in his Answer to the
Jesuits Challenge. page 64]
Bread after Consecration is freed from the name of Bread, being accounted
worthy of the name of the Body of Christ, albeit the nature of it remains
therein still. Your Exception is, that this Epistle is not extant among the
works of Chrysostom. This your Answer might satisfy us, were it not that it
was extant sometime in the Libraries of So our Peter Martyr.
Florence, and So your Stephen Gardener, Bishop of Winchester, lib. 2. de Euch.

Canterbury. To whom may be adjoined the Author of that Imperfect work,
Chrysostom, and by you upon any occasion objected against us; wherein it is
expressly said, that Author operis imperfecti, in Matthew. Hom. 11. Si ergo haec

est Corpus Christi, sed Mysterium Corporis ejus continetur; quanto magis vasa

The True Body of Christ is not contained within these sanctified Vessels, but
the mystery of his Body. It seems that your later Parisian Divines were
offended with others, who would have these words utterly dashed out of their
last Editions, which were published in the former; as you have been admonished
by one Dr. James in his Specimen Corruptelarum, etc. Haec veba habentur in

CHAP. IV.
Answers to the Objections of Romish Doctors, taken from the Testimonies of
Ancient Fathers, for Transubstantiation.
Or, an Antidote to expel all their poysonsome Pretenses in that behalf.
SECT. I.
THis our Antidote is compounded of five Ingredients, used for the Discovery of
the Inconsionableness of your Disputers, in their Objecting the Testimonies
of Fathers under false Pretenses. First, upon their terming the mystical Act A
Work of Omnipotency. Secondly, their denying of the Eucharist to be Naked
and Bare Bread. Thirdly, in forbidding the Communicants to rely upon the
Judgment of their Senses. Change of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament, and
calling it Transmutation, Transition, and the like. Fifthly and lastly, in
forcing of the speeches of Fathers, which may seem to make for
Transubstantiation, as absolutely spoken of the Sacrament of the Eucharist,
which the same Fathers do apply as well to the Sacrament of Baptism, and also
to other sacred Rites, wherein you believe there is not any Substantial Change
at all.

The First Inconsionableness of your Romish Disputers, in objecting the
Fathers speeches of an Omnipotent Work
A Work of Omnipotency is attributed by diverse Fathers to the Change, which
is made in this Sacrament, which we likewise confess. Ambros. Sermo Christ^,
qui potuit ex nihilo facere quod non erat, non potest ea quae sunt in id
mutare, quod non erant etc. De myster. i^tian^. c. 9. -- At omnipotentia non

Ambrose compares the Change by Benediction, made in this Sacrament, unto many
miraculous Works yea, even to the work of Creation. Ex Cyprian. de Coena
D^mini. Secundum. -- Panis iste non effigy, sed natura mutatus omnipotentia

Substance, but the Condition: Et factus Caro, is no more than a Sacramental
and mystical Being of the Body of Christ, as all other places of Cyprian

Cyprian speaks of a Change in nature, by Divine Omnipotency, Aug. de
Trinitate. lib. 3. Non sanctificat ut sit magnum Sacramentum, nisi operante
spiritu Dei, quae per illos, cum haec omnia Corporales motus sint, Deus
operatur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24.. Sed Paulo.
Augustine reckoning it among God's miracles, says that This Sacrament is
wrought by the Spirit of God. Accordingly we hear Chrysostom. hom. 83 Non sunt
humanae v^tutis haec opera, quae tunc in ida Coe^a confecit, ipse nunc quoque,
operatur, ipse perficit, ministrorum nos crdinem tenemus: qui vera ^aec
sanctificat atque transmutat ipse est. This is objected by Mr. Brerely, Tract.
2.. 2. Subd. a. page 111. Liturg.
Chrysostom proclaiming, that These are not works of humane power: He that
changes, and transmuteth now, is the same that he was in his last Supper.
Each one of these Testimonies are principally alleged by your Disputers, as the
strongest fortresses for defense of your Article of Transubstantiation, and
being taken altogether, they are esteemed as a Bulwark impregnable; See above
in his objecting of Ambrose.
Because (says your Cardinal) Omnipotency is not required to make a thing to
be a Sign Significant. So he. We answer first from your own Confessions, and
then from the Fathers themselves.

There are two works observable in every Sacrament; one is to be a Sign of an
Invisible grace, promised by God: the other to be a Seal and Pledge thereof, as
all Protestants hold; and (as your most opposed Calvia. Semper memoria
repetendum est, Sacramenta nihil quam ^ustrumentales esse confetendae nobis
gratiae Causas. Antid in Conc. Trid. Sess. 7 Can. 5.
Calvin teaches) an Isntrumental cause of conferring grace to the partakers
of the Sacraments. In both which Respects there is required an Omnipotency of
a Divine Element cannot be changed into a Sacrament, either to signify, or yet
to seal, much less to convey any grace of God unto man. And (that we may
take you along with us) It is the Doctrine of your Church, with common consent
(says your Roman Solus Deus (communi Consensu) instituere Sacramenta ex
authoritate potest, quae gratiam efficient, aut etiam infallibiliter
significant. Bellar. l. 1. de Sacram. in Genesis cap. 23.
Cardinal) that God only can by his Authority institute a Sacrament, because
he only can give them power of conferring grace, and of Infallible
signification thereof. So he Well then, as well infallible Signification of
Grace, as the efficacious conveyance of Grace, is the work of the same
Omnipocencie. To this purpose more plainly your English Cardinal Alan,
speaking (as he says) from the judgment of Divines, Card. Alan de Sacram. in
Genesis c. 17. and 18. Sacramenti Institutionem neque ad Pontificem; neque ad
ullam Creaturam pertinere: nec hoc solum sed etiam, etc -- propter solam
significationem Gratiae, quam Sacramentis omnibus Communem diximus, d^bebant
etiam vetera Sacramenta determinari per applicationem mortis Christi: quia
licet quidem in Creaturis, ad signationem effectuum spiritualium, aptitudo
quaedam sit, tamen ista aptitudo non nisi a divina institutione determina^ur ad
peculiarem effectum. Habet enim Aqua ex natura sua ut munditiem significet, at
ut determinate purgationem animae a peccato originali significet, and hominis
sanctificationem repraesentet; divinae tantum institutionis est, per quam
elevatur Creatura haec supra naturae consuetudinem, non solum quoad vim
operandi, sed etiam significandi. Non potest Sacramentum nisi a solo Deo
Ordinari, quia habent Sacramenta Supernaturalem Effectum, ut in veteri lege,
quae debant munditiem legalem. These (he says) that he speaks, Ex
Theologorum Sententia.
tells you that Although there be an aptness in every Creature to bear a
signification of some spiritual effect, yet cannot the aptness be
determinatly applied unto any peculiar effect, no not so much as to signify
the outward Cleanness of man's Body (Sacramentally) without a Divine
Institution; much less to represent man's sanctification: but being so
determinated and ordained of God, the Creature (says he) is elevated above
the Custom of nature, not only in respect of the work of sanctification, So
he; and that as well as we could wish: for this Omnipotent Change of a
Creature into a Sacrament, and this Iustrumentall Cause of conferring
Sanctifying Grace, to the Faithful Communicant, is the General Doctrine of
all Protestants. But what Change shall we think? Of the Substance of Bread
into the Substance of Christ's Body, as you teach? No; but as Book 2. Chap. 3..
6.
before Isidore said, The Change of visible things, by the spirit of God, into
a Sacrament of Christ's Body. So he. This being a Change from a Property
natural into a Property Supernatural, which Change is Divine, albeit but
Accidental: whereunto accords that objected place of See above at the letter
(c)
Augustine, that This is sanctified by the Spirit of God to be a

Seeing then that both Divine power and authority is required in every
Sacrament, to make it either infallibly significant, or else efficaciously
profitable to man; and that it is by the same Divine power that the Element is
Changed, by being Elevated from a common, unto a spiritual and divine property
of a Sacramental Signification, as one of your Cardinals has said: What an
unconscionablenesse is it then in your Disputers; from the terms of
Omnipotency and Divine working, which is necessarily in all Sacraments, to
conclude a Change of the Element Bread, by Transubstantiation, as you have
heard.

But much more transparent will their Inconsionableness be, if we consult
with the Objected Fathers themselves. For first Ambrose, who observes an
Omnipotency in the Change of this Sacrament, explaineth himself what kind of
Efficacy he meant, viz. such, that Ambros. lib. 4 de Sac. am c. 4. Si tanta
vis est in sermon Domini, ut incipian^ ess quae non erant quanto magis
Operatorius est, ut sint quae erant, ^t in al^d convertantur? -- Tu ipse eras
ver^^s homo, postquam consecratus eras, no vus homo esse coepisti.
The things changed into a divine Sacrament are still the same, which they were
before (namely) according to their natural property. Which one Clause does so
strangle all conceit of Transubstantiation, that it may seem you have some
reason to wipe this Testimony of S. Ambrose out of your new These words [ ut
sint quae erant] are wanting in the Roman and Paris Editions, Anno 1603 as
Bishop Usher (...) nesseth in his Answer to the Tesuit.
Editions: notwithstanding, by Gods providence; so much of Ambrose his tongue
is preserved, even in the same place, as will convince your Objectors of
wilful Falsehood; telling you by a Similitude, that the Change of Bread in this
Sacrament is like to the Change, whereby a Christian Regenerate See above at (1)
of an old Creature is made a new Creature: which is (as every Christian
knows) not a change in the substantial nature of man, but in the Accidental
properties. So this Bread of a common bodily Food is made Sacramental. And the
same Father who Baptism he is made a new Creature, says also of this
Sacrament, that Per (...) ^or Explicati^e; Corpus significatur.
By Benediction Bread is made another nature, (namely) of an Elementall become
Sacramental, as you have heard; and as his own words import, After
Consecration the Body of Christ is Signified: and that, which was Wine, Is
called Blood.

In the Testimony of Cyprian you applaud your selves, for to your Lindan L^ndan
A^ea (...) Cypri^ni v^^o -- ^ie (...) adv^gilate, Evang^^^, and D^vum Cyp^anum

Cardinal To admit no solution. Our Answer, first unto the Author, is to deny
it to be the Testimony of Cyprian: may we no^? This Sermon of the Supper of
the Lord is by us (says your Master Mr. (...) Lit^rg. Praef.. 14. page 51.
Brerely) attributed to Cyprian. Whom of your Side he mean by Vs] you may be
pleased to ask him; sure we are your Cardinal does tell us that Author
illius de Coena Domi^^t non est Cyprianus. ^ed aliquis post cum. Bellar. ^^ 2.

The Author of this Book is not Cyprian, but some But, not to disclaim your
Author; all that he says is that Cyprian. de Coena D^n. Pa^s ^ste natu^a
mu^^tus om^^potentia ve^b^ factus est C^ro, etc.
Bread is changed by Gods Omnipotency not in Figure, but in Nature. This is
ill; And all this has been, but even now, quitted by your ow^e Confessions,
granting a power of Omnipotency in every Sacramental Change, where the
natural Element is altered from it is common habitude into the nature of a
Spiritual Instrument and use, both signifying and exhibiting Divine Grace; and
so the word Nature does import. The Schools, distingui^hing the Nature of
Accidents from the Nature of Subjects, show that there is an Accidental Nature
as Substantial. Theology teaching that Ephesians. 2. 3. August. Ipsam naturam
a^^ter dicem: cum prop^^e loquimu^ naturam hom^^s incalp^bi^s factus est.
By nature we are the children of wrath; wherein Nature signifies only a
vicious Quality. This saying, viz. Indifferent things in fact Change their
nature, when they are commanded, Master Litu^g. Tract. 4. 6.
Brerely allows of, as for example: a Surplesse being commanded by lawful
Authority, the use thereof becomes necessary, so that the nature thereof is
Changed, yet not in the Substance of the thing, but in the legal necessity of
the use.

* And what will you think of that of Saint Hilarie? saying of all persons
Regenerate, that Hilar de Trin. lib 8 Per naturam sidei unum sumus, renati ad
innocentiam and immortalitatem regenerati in umus AEternitatis naturam.
By the nature of faith In both which the Proprieties and qualities of things
are called the Natures thereof. In which respect we embrace the saying of Saint
Ambrose, when he affirms the Ambros. de jis qui initiantur myster. cap. ult.
Major benedictionis omnis virtus quam naturae, quia benedictione etiam natura
ipsa mutatur.
Nature of Bread to be changed in this Sacrament. Certainly, even as it is in
all other Mysteries, wherein (as Saint Augustine speaks) Aug. Tom. 9. in Se^m
de Cataclysmo.
Accedit verbum ad elementum, and fit Sacramentum. As much as to say, the
Element (as Bread) is Changed into a Sacrament; (as See above Book 2. cap. 2..
16.
Isidore spoke) which is called the Body of Christ, because of the Sacramental
property Sign by the name of the thing signified; as the same * Father, with
diverse Others has amply declared. *

But to come nearer, Answer us but this one Question. Whereas all learning
allows this saying, that in Baptism the nature of the Element, and the
nature of the Sacrament are different, whereupon it is said; The word coming to
the Element makes it a Sacrament: when we shall say of the water in Baptism
that the Nature of it, as of a Sacrament, is more excellent than, is the nature
of it, as it is a mere Element; whether does not the word, Nature, attributed
to the Sacrament, justly accord unto the Phrase of Cyprian, in the case of the
Eucharist? and so much the rather, because that Cyprian, in the words
immediately following the Testimony objected, does fully confute
Transubstantiation by a Similitude; comparing the Humanity, and Deity of Christ
with the Natural and Spiritual parts of this Sacrament, to wit; Et sicut in
persona Christi humanitas videbatur, and latebat Divinitas; ita Sacramento
visibili ineffabiliter divina se effundit essentia. Author. Coenae. Ibid..
Quarto.
As in Christ himself true humanity appeared in his flesh, and his Deity was
hid: (This was the Even so into this visible Sacrament the Divine Essence
infuseth it self. So he, which, by the law of a Similitude, must stand thus:
Even so Bread in this Sacrament is seen, and the Spiritual operation of Gods
power therein to the Faithful is Invisible. Like as we may say of the
preaching of the Word of God to the Faithful; The words are audible, and
sensible, but because of the inward working of Gods Spirit, for the Conversion
of Man's soul, it is called Romans 1. 16.
The power of God unto salvation: as likewise Baptism is made the Lavacr^
whereof Gregory Nyssen affirms that Greg. Nyssen. erat. de Baptism. Divinum
Lavacru^ magnum quid operatur per Benedictionem, and mirabiles producit
Effectus.
It works marvellously by benediction, and produces mavelous Effects. As
for Augustine, and Chrysostom (not to be superfluous) every Protestant does
both believe and profess (namely) a Divine Operation of God, both by changing
the Element into a Sacrament, and working by that Sacrament Spiritual Effects,
to the good of Man's soul.

* A Vindication of diverse Testimonies of Saint Cyprian, by Romish Torturers
forced, for proof of Transubstantiation. But you have not done with Cyprian,
he is found saying, concerning this Sacrament, that Cyprian de Coena Dom.
Christus usque hodie verissimum, Sanctissimum suum Corpus creat, sanctificat
and benedicit, and pie sumentibus dividit. Objected by Dr. Heskins Parl. Book
2. Chap. 8.
Christ daily Creates his most true, and most holy Body, sanctifies and
blesses it. This, in the Opinion of your Objector, must needs prove a proper
Existence of Christ in the Eucharist, because Christ creates not an imaginary
Body, but that which is called a most true Body. Which words, notwithstanding,
in true sense, Cyprian are, that Christ does Create his most true Body: the
only Question is of the word [ Create,] whereunto it is to be referred
properly? This must be either to Bread, or to Christ's Body: and your Cardinal
abhorring to say that Christ's Body is properly created in this Sacrament,
Bell. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. In verbis Cypriani illa, Creas, sanctisicas,
benedicis, referuntur ad materiam, unde consicitur Corpus Christi: agimus enim
gratias, quod per Christum primo panem creet, deinde per eundem sanctificat and
benedicat, convertendo in Corpus suum -- Quod autem Cyprianus loquitur de vero
Corpore suo non de signo, patet ex eo, quod veracissimum illud appellat. [ We
grant that Christ spoke of his true body, for this Sacrament we say is a
figure, not of a fantastical, but of a substantial Body.]
Answers that the words Create, Sanctify, and Bless, are to be referred to
Bread, which is first Created, (says he) before it is converted into Christ's
Body. If then Cyprian by the words, Christ's Body, meant Bread, which is the
Sign of his Body, is it not a wilful blindness in your Disputers, to
conclude from a Sign the real presence of a Body? especially from this Father
S. Cyprian, who teaches every Christian how to interpret the sense of Christ's
words, in calling Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood, viz. Cyprian de Unction.
Dedit Dominus in mensa, in qua ultimum cum Apostolis participavit Convivium,
proprijs manibus Panem and Vinum, in Cruce vero manibus militum corpus tradidit
vulnerandum, ut in Apostolis exponeret quomodo Vinum and Panis corpus esset and
sanguis Christi; and quibus rationibus causae cum effectibus convenirent, and
diversa nomina vel species ad unam reducerentur essentiam, and significata and
significantia eisdem ^ocabulis censerentur.
Things (as Signs) and things signified, are called by the same terms, or
names. What is, if this be not our Protestant Doctrine?

And were it that Cyprian could possibly have meant a Creating of Christ's
Body, in this Sacrament, properly; yet could not such our Opposers have
bewrayed more stupiditie, or else obstinacy, than by urging this Sentence,
whereby two Articles of your Council of Trent are absolutely strangled. The
first is Transubstantiation, which (as you confess) is of Something
Pre-existent: Whereas Creation, (as all know) is from a Nothing. The second
Tridentine Article is, that the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is
whole in the whole Host, and in every part thereof. But Cyprian says of that
Body, which he calls Created, that It is divided.

We have light upon another sentence of Cyprian, objected out of the same
place, and as vehemently pressed, as any other out of Cyprian, Cyprian de
Coenae Dom. (in the place objected, Ineffabiliter Sacramento visibili divina se
infundit essentia, ut esset Religioni circa Sacramenta devotio, ut ad veritatem
cujus corpus and sanguis Sacramenta sunt syncerior pa^eret accessus. Objected
by Dr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ.
The Divine essence (says Cyprian) infuseth it self into this Sacrament, that
we should have a religious devotion toward it, that a more sincere address
may be had to be the Truth, whereof the Body and Blood are Sacraments. Cyprian
his own direction will permit.

We grant, first, that the Divine Essence, which is the divine power of
Christ, is exercised in every Sacrament, by making it effectual to the
salvation of the Communicants. Secondly, that by the word, Verity, or Truth, is
meant the Reality of his Body and Blood. And Thirdly, that every one that
approaches to this Sacrament, ought to come with a Devotion, and sincere
affection. The only difference is, how Christ's Body and Blood are said to be
Sacraments of the Reality of his Body and Blood, here mentioned? and your only
Answer is, that Christ is a figure and sign of himself, as he is in this
Sacrament; which figment is easily confuted by a Catholic and universal
doctrine of all Christian Churches, which is, that every Sacrament is a visible
Sign of an invisible Grace. But in this Sacrament the Body and Blood of
Christ, properly taken, are nothing less than Visible, by your own
Confessions, who teach them to be so Invisible herein, that they cannot be
discerned either by Angel, or the Bodily eyes of Christ himself. You perceive
by this, that your Boast of this Place of Cyprian, is but a vain blast.

Wherefore we expound the words thus; Christ's Body and Blood (that is) the
outward Symbols, carrying the names of his Body and Blood, are Sacraments, and
Seals of that Verity of the same Body, which was crucified, and of the same
Blood, which was shed upon the Cross for man's Redemption;

But you will ask, who will warrant this our Exposition of the words of
Cyprian? and we Answer, that we shall need no other Interpreter than Cyprian
himself, already alleged, saying, See before at number. 6. in the Morgin.
that Things signifying are called by the names of Things signified. So he
there; and therefore so here are Bread and Wine called the Body and Blood of
Christ, being in themselves only Sacraments and Signs: whereof you Christ
herein created his Body; by Body meaning Bread, as your Cardinal has
confessed. Which may give you a true Pattern of the genuine Idiome of the
Fathers, as often as they call the Bread Christ's Body, or Wine his Blood: and
that all such Speeches are not more yours in sound, than they are ours in true
and Orthodox Sense.

The second Inconsionableness of Romish Disputers, for abuse of the
Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, is seen in objecting their denial
TO this purpose Irenaeus, saying that Irenaeus lib. 4. contra. Haer cap. 34.
Non est Panis Communis. Bellar. Obijcit lib. 2. de Euch. per totum.
It is not Common Bread: Ergo (say you) not to be properly judged by Sense.
Unconscionably; knowing that Sol. Chrysostom. in Psalm. 22. hom. 16. De aqua
Baptismi. Non est aqua Communis.
Chrysostom (and also other Fathers, whom you moreover object) says likewise
of the Sacrament Baptism, See in this Section li^. ( c. h.)
We are to behold it not as common water. The second is Iustine Martyr,
saying, Bellamin. Oblustin. Mart. lib 2. (...) (...), etc. Sol. Ratio, quia
(...), id est, Eucharisticatus, sive sanctificatus Cibus.
We receive these, not as Common Bread, or Common Drink. Therefore (say you)
we may not judge them by Sense. Unconscionably; knowing that Iustine Martyr in
the same place shows his Reason, why it is not to be called Common, even
because (says he) it is [(...)] that is, Sanctified meat. And so Water in
Baptism is Sanctified, as you know. The third is Cyrill of Jerusalem, saying,
Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 13. Ob. Cyril. Hieros. Catech. 18. (...) Sol.
I^em. Catech. 3. (...).
Consider these, not as Common Bread and Wine: Ergo (say you) not to be judged
by Sense. V^conscionably; knowing that the same Cyrill, in the same place,
says the same of the water of Baptism: It is not simple Water. Yea, but he
further says (say Oh. Cyrill. mystag. 3. (...).
you) Think not of it, as of bare Bread, (adding) but the Body of Christ. Ergo
(say you) not to be judged otherwise by Sense. Unconscionably; knowing that
the same Father in the same place, for explanation sake, says likewise of ^ot
Sequiturs (...). Idem Catech. Mystag 3
Sacred Oil, viz. Even so that holy Oil is not bare and simple Oil (Adding)
but the gift of Grace.

And that your Authors Inconsionableness may be the more notorious, in
their Wresting of the Catholic meaning of the Fathers, in this kind, we must
tell you that there is no speech more familiar unto ancient Fathers than to
esteem, as they ought, all Sacramental Signs Sacred; and therefore no more
Common, or bare Elements. Inso much that Gregory Nyssen, Altar, or Table of the
Lord, he says that Greg. Nysson. Altar hoc sanctum, cui adsistimus, l^pis
est natura Communis, nihil differen^ ab alijs crustis lapide^s, ex quibus
pavimenta nostra exornantur: Sed quoniam Dei cultui consecratur, and d^dicatur,
and benedictionem accep^t, me^sa facta, and Altar immaculatum est. Orat. de
Sancto Baptismo. Et ne contemnas divinum Lavacrum, neque id Commune putes, etc.
Although by nature it be but as other stone, wherewith the Pavements are
garnished, and adorned; yet being Consecrated to Gods Service, by Benediction,
it is an holy Table and Altar. Adding also of Baptism, and saying; The Divine
Water is not to be contemned, nor to be held as Common. Yea, and what less
does your Church say of your hallowed Balsome, Beads, and Bells, and the like,
all which you distinguish from Common and bare Oils, and Metals, because of
their different use, and service, without Opinion of any Change at all?

The third Vnconscionablenes of your Disputers in urging, for proof of
Transubstantiation, the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, forbidding men to
[Discerne of this Sacrament by their Senses.] And first of their abusing the
Testimony of Cyril, by two egregious Falsifications.
We may not easily pass over your Objection taken out of Cyrill, being in
the opinion of your Cardinal so impregnable; Let us first here your Objector:
Cyrilli Testimonium vel solum sufficere deberet, est enim hujus Sancti, and
antiquissimi, and ex opere ejus indubit^to, and clarissi^u^ and apertissimum,
ut nullo modo perverti possit; and est in Catechesi, in qua solent omnia
proprie and simplic^^er explicari, and denique nemo unquam reprehendit Cyrillum
erroris alicujas circa Eucharistiam. B^^ll^r. lib 2. de Euch. cap. 13.
This Testimony of Cyrill alone ought to suffice, being the Sentence of an holy
man, and most ancient, out of a work which (unquestionably) was his, yea and
most clear, and plain, as that it cannot be perverted. Besides it is in his
Catechism, wherein the use of all things is delivered simply, properly, and
plainly: Nor was this Father Cyrill ever reproved of Error in his doctrine of
the Eucharist. Thus far your Cardinal, you see, with as accurate an Oratory
of Amplification, as could be invented. What Protestant would not now, if
ever, expect a deadly blow from this Father to our Catholic Cause? but attend
to the Issue.

First, Cyril. Pro certissimo habeas, Panem hunc, qui videtur a nobis, Panem
non esse, etiamsi gustus Panem esse senserit, sed esse Corpus Christi --
Rursus. Christus, cui credamus, Panem in Corpus Transmutavit -- Nam sub specie
Panis datur tibi corpus: sub specie Vini datur tibi sanguis. Catech. Mystag. 4.
Cyril will not allow a man to credit his Taste, but although Taste says it is
Bread, yet undoubtedly to believe it to And he is brought in by your Cyrillus
aperte ponit Transmutationem Panis in corpus Christi, and solas species Panis
remanere post Transmutationem: quia dicit Corpus Domini sub specie Panis sum^,
distinguens Corpus a Pane. Bellar lib. 2 de Euch cap. 13. adding; Hoc est
Apertissimum Argumentum.
Cardinal to aver furthermore that The Body of Christ is given under the
form of Bread. And so the Sentence seems to be most manifest, says he. But
for what we pray you? That first (forsooth) the Change is the same with
Transubstantiation: and secondly that there is no more Substance of Bread, but
Accidents under the form of Bread. So he, and Master Liturg. Tractat. 2.. 2.
Subd 4. page 116.
Brerely from him, as follows; Cyril says, under the form of Bread his Body
is given, etc. and then dancing in the same triumph, adds; Can any Catholic
of this Age So he. And we answer, could any Iugglers deal more falsely? For
upon due examination it will appear to be a manifest Delusion, by a false
Translation of Cyrils words. The Body of Christ is given (as your Cardinal
does render it) [ sub specie Panis] in, or under the form of Bread; whereas it
is in the Greek, Cyril. (...) Cate^^ Mystag. 4. Russus Mystag. 5. Non
existimetis vos gustare Panem and Vinum, (...)
Under the Type of Bread: even as he says afterward; Think not that you
taste bread, but the Antitype of Christ's Body. In both, [(...), or (...),]
not, [(...)] Type, and Antitype; not Form, or Figure of Bread.

Now there is a maine and manifest difference between Form, and Type. For
Accidental Forms are things Real, and the determinate Objects of Sense; but
Types, or Antitypes are only Relatives, and (as such) no Objects of Sense, but
of Reason, and understanding only. As for example, when a Judge is set in his
Scarlet upon the Bench, the Eye sees nothing but the color, and the fashion
of the Gown, and outward figurature of his Face, and so may every Child see
him; for these are Outward and Visible Accidents. But to see that man, as he
has upon him the person of a Judge, ordained to try Causes Bread and Wine are
Round, and White, and Sweet in Taste, our Bodily Senses perceive them; but as
they are Types, and Antitypes, that is, Signs of the Body and Blood of Christ,
so are they spiritually discerned with our understanding only.

As therefore it follows not, that the Scarlet Gown of the Judge, because it
is an Ensign of his Office, should be only Color and Fashion, without the
matter and Substance of the Cloth; no more can any conclude from Cyril, that
because the Sacrament is a Type, therefore this Type was only Form, and
outward Accidents, without all Substance of Bread. And thus your Cardinal his
first [ Apertissimum Argumentum] for proof of Accidents, without the Substance
of Bread in this Sacrament, is proved to be Apertissimum Figmentum, void of all

His next Observation is the Change by Transubstantiation, and the error of
Sense, in judging it to be Bread. We call upon Cyril to decide this
Controversy, who is best able to interpret himself. He therefore that said
of the Eucharist, after Consecration, It is not Bare Bread, but the Body of
Christ, affirmed as much of Consecrated Oil, saying, It is not Bare Oil. But
we are answered, that Bellar. Hoc confirmat sententi^m nostram. Nam Cyrillus
non eodem modo loquitur de Chrismate, and de Eucharistia. De hac enim ait, Non
esse Panem Communem, sed Corpus Christi: de Chrismate vero dicitur quidem, non
esse Commune Vnguentum, sed non addit Spiritum sanctum, vel Corpus Christi: sed
esse Chrisma Christi sanctificatum oleum. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 13.
Cyril, in denying the Eucharist to be Common Bread, called it after
Consecration Christ's Body: but in denying Oil to be Bare Oil, he called it
yet still but Chrisme, Sanctified Oil, after Consecration. So your Cardinal.
And so are we posed for ever. But behold another Jesuitical Fraud! For Cyril
as he called the Consecrated Bread Christ's Body, after Consecration, so does
he call the Consecrated Oil [Charisma] that is, the Gift of the Grace of
Christ; and not [ Chrisma] that is, Chrisme, or Ointment, as your Cardinal
renders it.

We say again he calls that Charisma, which notwithstanding he says was,
after Consecration, still Oil, wherewith their Foreheads were anointed. This
must we Judge to have Bellarmine, except you would rather we should think,
that when he was now to prove that our Senses are deceived, in judging of
Bread to be Bread, he meant to prove it by seeming to be deceived himself,
in thus mistaking the word Chrisma, for (...) Cyril. Catech. Mystag. 3.
and so utterly perverting the Judgment of Cyril; by whom we are contrarily
taught, that the Sight is no more deceived in judging Bread to be Bread, than
in discerning Oil to be Oil. For neither was the other Bare Oil, being a
Type of a spiritual Gift; nor yet was it therefore changed into the Spiritual
Grace it self, because it Type and Symbol thereof. Which One Parallel of Oil
with Bread does discover the Unconscionable pertinacie and Perverseness of your
Disputers, in urging the Testimony of Cyril.

*All this, which I have avouched out of Cyril, I have since found exactly
confirmed by our Judicious Not. M. S. in Bellar. formerly alleged.
Isaac Casaubon, the Myrrour of learning; concluding with this Epiphonema: If I
(says he) have any judgment, Cyril judged Bread to remain in this Sacrament
of the Eucharist, as verily as in Oil consecrated, there remains Oil. As
for the term of Transmutation of Bread into Christ's Body, you may have a
further plentiful satisfaction in the Seventh Section following. And we
concur in Judgment with the same Cyril, exacting that we regard not our
Senses herein; namely, to look upon it with our natural eyes, as beholding
bare Bread: but with Spiritual, to behold it to be Sacramental Bread, and in
it, as in a Sign, to discern the Lords Body, as Cyril has already expounded
himself saying, that it is changed into an Antitype of Christ's Body.*

The like Romish Objection out of Chrysostom, and as Unconscionable. SECT. V.
SAint Chrysostom his Testimony may in no wise be omitted, which seems to
your Disputers to be so Convincent, that your Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 22.
Cardinal placed it in the front of his host of the Fathers, Mr. Brerelay,
Liturg. Tract. 2.. 4. Subd. 2. page 167.
Brerely reserved it to the last of the Testimonies, which he alleged, as that
which might serve for an Vpshot. I will conclude ( says he) admonishing the
Christian Reader with Saint Chrysostom his Saying ( you long to hear it, we
think:) Although Christ his speech ( says Chrysostom in Matthew. Hom. 8. Etiamsi
sensui, and cogitationi nostrae absurdum esse videatur quod dicit, superatque
sensum nostrum and rationem sermo ipsius, quaeso, quod in omnibus rebus, sed
praecipue in mysterijs faciamus? non illa quae ante nos jacent aspicientes, sed
verba tenentes? nam verbis ejus defrau dari non possumus, sed sensus saepius
fallitur. Quoniam igitur ille dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum] nulla dubitatione
teneamus, sed credamus, nihil enim sensibile traditur a Christo nobis, sed in
rebus sensibilibus. Omnia vero, quae tradidit, sunt insensibilia; sicut in
Baptismo per Aquam donum illud conceditur -- Regeneratio intelligitur, quia
est: nam si incorporeus esses, incorporea tibi tradidisset dona; quoniam vero
Anima conjuncta est Corpori, in sensibilibus intelligibilia tibi tradidit.
Chr^sostome) may seem absurd unto Sense and Reason, I exhort you
notwithstanding that, especially in Mysteries, we look not unto that which is
before us, but observe Christ's words: for we cannot be disappointed of that
which he says, but Senses may be deceived. So Chrysostom.

Now what of all this? Chrysostom (says your Bellar. Non potuisset sane
Chrysostomus loqui clarius, si Calvinistam aliquem habuisset, quem hortari ad
fidem voluisset. Ibid. quo supra.
Cardinal) could not speak more plainly, if he had had some Calvinist So
he, meaning the Faith of Transubstantiation, Which (as has been confessed)
was no doctrine of Faith until more than a Thousand years after Christ. But
to return to Chrysostom, whose Sentence we may compare to a Nut, consisting
of a Shell, and a Kernel: The Shell we may call his Figurative Phrases; the
Kernel we may term his Orthodoxe meaning. Of both in the Section following.

Of the Rhetorical, and Hyperbolicall Phrases of Chrysostom.
TO begin with the Shell. First, we are to know that Hyperbole is a
Rhetorical Trope, or Figure, which may be defined to be an Excessive speech,
signifying a Truth in an Untruth. As to say, Something is more dark than
darkness it self; which, being strictly taken, were an Impossibility, and
Untrue: but it does imply this Truth, (namely) that the thing is wonderfully,
and extremely dark.

Secondly, that Chrysostom was most frequent in this Figure Hyperbole, your
own Non sunt Concionatorum verba in rigore accipienda, quum primum ad autes
perveniant, multa enim per Hyperbolen Declamatores enunciant: hoc interdum
Chrysostomo contingit. Senensis Bibliotheca. Annot. 152.
Senensis does instruct you; where Fathers in their Sermons do use to declame
Hyperbolically, he does instance most specially, and by name, in Chrysostom. *
And albeit that We object plain places of Chrysostom, and such wherein every
word may be taken in a proper Sense; (as for Example, where he reproves those
that are only Gazers, and not Communicants at the Celebration of the
Eucharist, It is better (says he) not to be present, than not to participate)
yet can we receive no better Answer, or other satisfaction from your Quod
dicit Chrysostomus, melius esse non interesse Sacrificio, quam interesse, and
non communica^^: D^co Chrysostomum, ut quaedam alia, per excessum esse locu^um.
Bellar. lib. 2. de Missa. Cap. 10.. Ad illud.
Chrysostom here, as else where, spoke in an excess.*

Thirdly, that the Excessive Phrases of Chrysostom, upon this Sacrament, do
verify as much, viz. to tell his people, that Dentes Carnl suae insigere.
Chrysostom. Homil. 45. in Johan. Lingua cruentatur hoc admirabili Senguine. Hom. 83.
in Matthew. Turbam circumsusam rubificri. Lib 3. de Sacerdotio.
Their Teeth are fixed in the flesh of Christ: that, Their tongues are bloodied
with his Blood: and that The Assembly of the people are made red therewith.

Fourthly, that he is as Hyperbolicall in denying (in the Celebration of this
Sacrament) the judgment of Senses, saying, Number vides Panem? number Vinum? ne
putetis Corpus accipere ab homine, sed ex ipso Seraphin forcipe ignem, Idem.
Tom. 3 de Eucharist. in Encaenijs.
Do we see Bread or Wine? which is spoken in as great an Think not that you
receive the Body from a man, but Fire from a Scraphin, or Angel, with a pair
of Tongs. You will think (notwithstanding those kind of Phrases) that
Chrysostom thought he saw as well Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, as he could
discern either Man from a Seraphin, or Spirit; or his own Fingers from a
pair of Tongs.

Fifthly, that the Sentence objected against us, is adorned with the same figure
Hyperbole, when he says that No sensible thing is delivered unto us in this
Sacrament, and that our senses herein may be deceived. Words sore pressed by
you, yet twice unconscionably; both because every Sacrament by your own Church
is defined to be Sacramentum est invisibilis grat^ae signum visibile. Magister
Sentent. lib 4. did. 1. Sacramentum est ^es sensibus objecta. Catech. Trid.
Test Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram cap 11.
A Sensible Sign; and also for that you your selves confess that Sensus non
fallitur ^^ca proprium objectum Sententia vera. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euch. cap.
24.
Our senses cannot be deceived in their proper sensible Objects.

Sixthly, that Chrysostom himself well knew he did Hyperbolize herein, who
after that he had said, No sensible thing is delivered unto us in this
Sacrament; notwithstanding, he adds In things Sensible, things Intelligible
are given unto us. Thus far of the Rhetorike of Chrysostom.

Now are we to show his Theology, and Catholic meaning, as it were the
Kernel of his Speech. He in the same Sentence will have us understand Man to
consist of Body and Soul, and accordingly in this Sacrament Sensible things
are ministered to the Body, as Symbols of spiritual things, which are for the
Soul to feed upon. So that a Christian, in receiving this Sacrament, is not
wholly to exercise his mind upon the bodily Object, as Transubstantiation, and
Absence of Bread, Chrysostom, in true Sense, makes wholly against it, by
explaining himself, and paralleling this Sacrament with Baptism: As in
Baptism (says Sicut in Baptismo, etc. Chrysostom. See above,. 5. at (r.)
he) Regeneration, the thing intelligible, is given by water, the thing
sensible, the Substance of water remaining. Which proportion between the
Eucharist and Baptism, is held commonly by ancient See hereafter at large in
the 8. Book.
Fathers, to the utter overthrow of Transubstantiation. And that Chrysostom
believed Existence of Bread after Consecration, See above Chap 3.. 13.
has been already expressly shown, and is here now further proved. For he
says of Bread after Consecration, that Nos per hunc Panem unione conju^gimur
Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. Hom. 24.
We are joined together one with another, by this Bread. * And yet
furthermore, the same Chrysostom has already delivered his mind, touching the
infallibility of the sense of Touching; declaring in a plain and literal
Sense, as from the mouth of Christ, * That man's sense of Touch could not be
deceived. *

And now that you see the Nut cracked, you may observe how your Disputers have
swallowed the Shell of Hyperbolicall Phrases, and left the kernel of
Theological Sense for us to content our selves withal. Furthermore (for this
is not to be omitted) the other Testimony of Chrysostom is spun and woven with
the same Art, which says of Consecrating this Sacrament, that Chrysostom. Hom 50
in Matthew. juxta Edit. Graec. Ne existmes Sacerdotem esse. qui hoc facit, sed
[(...)] Then follows of Baptism, Ibid. Ille non te Baptizat. (...).
Man is not to think it is the hand of the Priest, but of Christ himself,
that reaches it unto him; seeing immediately after (as it were with the same
breath) it is added: It is not the Minister, but God that Baptizeth thee, and
holds thy head. * Words, you see, as Hyperbolicall as could be uttered, and
notwithstanding urged by your Doctor Heskins, calling it a Dr. Heskins in his
partiam of Christ, Book. 2. Chapt. 55. objecteth.
Plain place, for proof of a proper Presence of Christ's Body in the
Sacrament. But will this relish with you also? All this is to prove unto you,
that you are not to exact an (...), no more than when the Apostle said of the
faithful, in respect of Christ; See above c. 3.. 7.
Thus far concerning Judgment of Senses, which has been formerly proved
(at large) both by Ibid. in the Chapters following.
Scriptures, and * Fathers. We draw nearer our mark, which is the word
Transubstantiation it self.

Fourthly, the Inconsionableness of your Disputers, in urging other
Figurative Sayings, and Phrases of the Fathers, of Bread Changed, Transmuted,
etc. into the Body of Christ, for proof of a Transubstantiation thereof in a
Proper Sense.
SVch words as these, Bread is the Body of Christ; It is made the Body of
Christ; It is Changed, Translated, Trans-muted, Trans-elementated into the Body
of Christ, are Phrases of the highest Emphasis that you can find in the
Volumes of Antity; which if they were literally meant, according to your Romish
Sense, there ought to be no further Dispute. But if it may evidently appear,
by the Idiome of speech of the same Fathers, Tropicall, and sometimes
Hyperbolicall, then shall we have just Cause to tax your Disputers of as
great Inconsionableness (if not of more) in this, as in any other.

For whenever they find in any Father (as in Eusebias Emiss. Adest
Substantia Panis, sed post verba Christi est Corpus Christi. Hom. 5. Objected
by Mr. Brerely. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 2. * And Damasc. lib. 4. de Orthod.
side, cap. 14. Panem corpus suum facere. Objected by Dr. Heskins in his
Parliament. Book 2. Chap. 20. *
Eusebius) these words; The Bread is the Body of Christ; they object it for
Transubstantiation; but Unconscionably. First, seeing that the Fathers do but
herein imitate our Lord and Master Christ, who said of the Bread [This is my
Body:] which has been See above B. 2. throughout.
proved by Scriptures, and Fathers to be a Figurative and Cyril of Sacred Oil,
saying, this is Charisma, the Gift of Grace; as he called also the Holy Kiss
a (...) Cyrill. sup.
Reconciliation, and Others the like, as you have heard. Thirdly, seeing that
you your selves have renounced all proper Sense of all such speeches, because
Things of different natures cannot possibly be affirmed one of another: for no
more can it be properly said, Bread is man's Body, than we can say, An Egg is
a Stone, as you have See above, Book 2. cap. 1.. 4.
confessed. Again, Some Fathers say, Bread is made Flesh, as Saint Ambros. De
Pane; Fit Corpus caro Christi. Ob by Bellarmine, lib. 2. de Euchar cap. 14. and
by others.
Ambrose objected; but Unconscionably; knowing, First, that you your selves are
brought now at length to deny the Body of Christ to be Produced out of Bread.
Secondly, knowing the like Idiome of Fathers in their other Speeches;
Chrysostom saying that Chrysostom Nos secum Christus munam, ut ita dicam, massam
reducit, neque id fide tantum, sed reipsa nos Corpus suum effecit. In Matt 26.
hom. 83. Objec^^ by Mr. Brerely. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 2.
Christ has made us his own Body, not only in Faith, but in Deed also. And
Augustine saying that Aug. Ipsi Christiani cum Capite suo, quod ascendit in
coe^um, unus est Christus. Enarrat. in Psalm. 127. Et in Psalm. 26. Titulus
Psalmi: Omnes ^ illo, and Christi, and Christus sumus
Christians themselves with their Head, which ascended into heaven, are one
Christ: yea, and Pope Leo, De homine Regenerato per Baptismum. Vt susceptu, a
Christo, and suscipiens Christum, non idem sit post Lavacrum, quod ante
Baptismum fuit, sed ut corpus Regenerati fiat caro Crucifixi. Sermon. de
passione. 14.
Leo, saying of the party Baptized, that He is not the (says he) the Body of
the party Regenerate is made the Flesh of Christ crucified. Yea, and our
Venerable Bede says, Beda in 1. Cor 10. Number and nos ipsius Corpus facti sumus,
and quod accipimus, nos sumus.
We are made that Body which we receive. In all which the word [ Made,] you
know, is far from that high strain of Transubstantiation. We draw yet
nearer to the Scope.

We may not deny, but that the Fathers sometimes extend their voices higher,
unto the Preposition Trans; as See above, c. 4.. 7.
Transit, Transmutatur, signifying a Change, and Trans-mutation into the Body
of Christ. Every such Instance is, in the opinion of Transubstantiation it
self; and all the wits of men cannot (says one) Assoyle such Objections.
Wherein they show themselves altogether Unconscionable, as has been partly
declared in Answering your Objected Sayings of See above c. 4.. 2.
Ambrose, In aliud Convertuntur; of Ibid. at the Letter ( r)
Cyprian his Panis natura mutatus; of Cyrils Trans-mutavit; and as now in this
Section is to be manifested, in answering your other Objections to the full.

The Father Gregor. Nyssen. Quicquid assu^^enu conveniens est, and expertrum
sit, ut Apostolus vult, qui han^ mensam nobis p^apa^vit, in id commutatur,
infirmorbus olus, Infantibus Lac, etc. Lib. de vita Mosis page 509.
Gregory Nyssen, comparing the Body of Christ with Manna, which satisfied every
man's Taste that received it, The Body of Christ in this Sacrament is changed
into whatsoever seems to the Receivers appetite convenient and desired. This
is objected by your Cardinal, to prove Transubstantiation: but, First,
Unconscionably; because it is in it self (being literally understood,) even in
your own judgments, incredible. For what Christian will say that the Body of
Christ is Transubstantiated into any other thing? much less into whatsoever
thing the appetite of the Receiver shall desire? No. But as Manna did satisfy
the bodily Appetite: so, Christ's Body to the Faithful is food, satisfying the
Soul in Spiritual and heavenly desire thereof. We say, the Soul, and not
the bodily appetite, as your selves well know, and the Council of ^certne
Council of Ni^^ L. 4. c. 11.. 3.
Nice does teach us to profess. Secondly, Unconscionably objected, because the
same Father expresses his Hyperbolicall manner of Speech likewise, saying that
Greg. Niss. Corpus illud Christi in Corpus nostrum ingrediens totu n^in se
transfert. Ob. by Bellar. l. 2. c. 10.. Idem Greg.
Christ's Body does change our bodies into it self, which in the Literal
Sense, according to your arguing, would prove a Transubstantiation of Men's
Bodies into Christ. * Were it (for these are his two Instances) into Milk, or
Colewoorts.

But what now? Bellar lib. 2. de Euch. ca. 6. Idem Gregorius in Oratione
Catechetica cap. 37. multa habet express de veritate hujus hic locus ab
Euthymio. Dicit corpus Christi immortale cum nostro corpore mortali conjungi,
and immortale per illud reddi: and quod in corpus nostrum ingrediens terum in
se transfert and commutat -- Deinde se explicat -- Dicit hoc fieri divina
virtute, and explicat seipsum, dicit enim, nunc Panem mutart in Carnem Christi,
quemadmodum, dum adhuc in terris esset, mutabatur Panis, quo ipse vescebatur,
in Carnem ipsius. Quae ^am sunt perspicua, ut non fuerit ausus ullus
Adversariorum, quod sciam, vel ad haec ^oca respondere, vel aliquid ex hoc
authore nobis objicere.
The same Gregory Nyssen (says your Cardinal) in his Catechetica hat^ such
plain places for the changing of Bread into the substance of Christ's Flesh,
as which none of our Adversaries, for ought that I know, did ever answer, or
yet object out of this Author, any thing against us. So he. And good reason,
for indeed, none need Gr. Nyssen, and not of some other suborned Author, under
his name. Whereof we may be persuaded both because that the objected places
are only read in the Bellarm. de Script Eccles. ^d Annum 380. Tit. Greg.
Nyssen. -- Observatio secunda, praeter libros numeratos, ex^nt ex Editione
Pa^siensi, Anno 1573. Catechetica oration, etc.

Author, who has published the same Catecheticall Oration, confesses of Author

This might have been our first Answer; but lest that, if we should insist
upon this, we might seem to decline your pretended answerlesse Objection,
observe you, with us, in the same Author, that as he says, The Bread is
converted into the Body of Christ, so he says of the same Body of Christ,
being received, that See above at ( p.)
It does convert the body of the Receiver into Christ himself, as you have
heard. Convert, is to be taken for a mystical and Sacramental Change, and
not for a proper and substantial; except you would conclude from the same
Father, by you objected, that the body of the Communicant is Transubstantiated
into Christ himself. Nor this only, but by virtue of the same word [
Transit,] must you be constrained to allow of a far more strange
Transubstantiation, even of the Bread, which was eaten of Christ, Nyssen. in
Orat. Catech. q^o supra. Corpus Dei verti ad divinam Dignitatem, (...). -- and
in illo Corpore ( sc. Christi.) transmutants Panis transit in divinam naturam.
Into his own Deity. Are you not ashamed to urge such a proper Sense of the
same Nyssen in one Sentence, which in another Sentence of his, (if properly
taken) you your selves cannot but abhor as Heretical.

And with the same forehead does your Cardinal say, that Protestants find
nothing to object out of this Father, Gregory Nyssen; seeing that it is not
Nothing to observe, where Nyssen says, that Bellar. lib. 2. de Eucharist. cap.
16. Gregor. Nyssen. de vita Mosis. Panis, qui de Coelo descendit, qui verus
cibus est, qui aenigmatice hac Historia (de Manna) significatur, non incorporea
res est, quo enim pacto res incorporea corpori cibus fiet? res autem quae in
corpore est, corpus omnino non est.
The Bread, which descended from Heaven, is the true meat signified in the
History (of Manna) it is no incorporeall thing, and being without a Body,
cannot be nourishment to a Body. Hereupon we make bold to demand of your
Answerer, what is that in this Sacrament, which gives See above, Chap. 3.
Sect. 10.
nourishment to all, whether Men, or Mice, that receive it? And the Oracle of
your Schools tells us, that not Bread and Wine, but the Aqam part. 3 Qu. 77
Art. 6. Species Sacrame^tales -- manifestum est quod nutriunt.
Accidents and Contrarily, Gregory Nyssen says, as you have heard; [(...)] How
can an incorporeall thing give nourishment to a thing corporal? (as thinking
it impossible.) Our Argument then from thence may be this. Seeing Accidents of
Bread cannot nourish, then certainly the substance of Bread, in this
Sacrament, which gives a bodily nourishment, does remain therein. And if the
Substance of Bread remain, then (by your own unanimous Confessions) Bread is
not changed, and converted into the Substance of Christ's Body; and
consequently must you bidd your Lateran Transubstantiation adiue.

Chrysostom is found admiring these Mysteries, and is objected by Mr. Mr.
Brerely, Tract. ^. 4. Subd. 2. page 164.
Brerely, for proof of the wonderful Effects of this Sacrament. Why? what
says he? Chrysostom. Admiranda Mysteria -- ut non solum per dilectionem, sed
reipsa in illam carnem convertamur. Hom. 45. in Job.
We our selves (says he) are converted and changed into the Flesh of Christ.
Which was the former saying of Greg. Nyssen. Will your Disputers never learn
the Hyperbolicall Language of ancient Fathers, especially when they speak of
Sacramental, and mystical things? (more especially Chrysostom, who, when he
falls upon this Subject, does almost altogether Rhetoricat:) our Bodies to be
Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ? Hearken unto Chrysostom a word
more, and he will tell you, that wicked and impenitent Communicants being And
again, Hom. 51. in Matthew. 14. Quam Satisfactionem offeremus, si cum nutriti
hoc cibo, ipsi in lupos convertamur?
Nourished with this food, are turned into Woolves. Now are we past the limits
of due Antiquity, you descend lower.

Theophylact will say hard to us, who, speaking of this Sacrament, says indeed
that Theophylact. in Marc. 14. Vocat hanc Conversionem Trans-elementationem,
quae quidem vox nihil minus significat quam Transubstantiatio: nam
Trans-elementatio significat mutationem totius rei -- ad ipsam materiam, quae
ab Aristotele Elementum dicitur. Si mutatio solius formae, recte dicitur (...).
Transformatio, and mutatio, externae figurae transfiguratio, cur mutatio
substantiae non poterit recte dici Transubstantiatio? Bellarmin. lib. 3. de
Eucharist. cap. 23.. Secundo.
The Bread is Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ: which your Cardinal
will have to be, in the same Fathers sense, Equivalent with your
Transubstantiation. Unconscionably; for does not the same Father say, likewise
that Theoph. in. Ioh. 6 Qui me man lucat, quodammodo (...).
A Christian is in a manner Trans-elementated into Christ? Like as Isidore
Pelusiota spoke of Isi^or. Pelusiat. lib 3. Epistol 107. De recipiente semen,
ut terra bon^: Qui verbum recipit [(...).
Trans elementing, in a sort, of the word of God into the good Iearer. Again,
Theophylact is objected, as saying, Theophyl. in. Math. 26. Panis ineff^bili
modo transformatur -- Panis quidem apparet, sed caro est. Objected by Mr.
Ererely, Laturg. Tract. 2. 2. S^bd. As for [ est caro] this Phrase (...) been
already answered. See above at ( s.)
The Bread is after an ineffable manner Transformed. It is true; He says so:
and so does Hierome say that Hier. in Marc. 14. Accepit Jesus Panem, and
b^nedixit, fregi^, Transfigurans Corpus suum in Panem: quod est Ecclesia
praesens, quae frangitur in passionibus.
Christ, in breaking Bread, did Transfigure, and Pope Leo sticks not to say
that Leo. Non alia igitur participatio Corpous, quam ut m^id, qu^d summus
transeamus. De Passione Sermon. 24
We Christians, in communicating [Transimus] turn, or are Changed into Christ
his Body. So these ancient Fathers.

Are you not yet out of breath with objecting Testimonies of Fathers
Unconscionably, and imper^inently? No, for Master Brerely, for a Close,
desires to be heard, and to try us with an Objection out of the Greek Church
these latter times, as follows. Mr. Brereley in his Apology (of the first
Edition) concerning the Faith of the ancient Greek Church.
It appears by a Treatise published by the Protestant Divines at Wittenberge,
Anno Domini 1584. entitled So he of the Patriarch Hierem^as; which Patriarch,
if he were alive, would very hardly contain himself from answering this your
Brother with some indignation, calling him both rash and precipitant; seeing
that the same Patriarch expressly said that Hier. Patriarch. Non enim hic
nominus tantum communicatio est, sed rei identitas: etenim vere Corpus and
Sanguis Christi mysteria sunt: non quod haec in corpus humanum transmutentur,
sed nos in illa, melioribus praevalentibus. Which is his Answer in this Point
to the Doctors of Wit^enberge.
The Body and Blood of Christ are indeed Mysteries, which are not changed into
humane flesh, but we into them. So that Patriarch.

Franciscus de Sancta Clara. Exposit. Artic. Confess. Angi in Art. 28
Orientalis and Oc^identalis Ecclesia in hoc Articulo Transubstantiationis
convenient. Hieremus Patriarcha in sua Censura, contra Lutherum, idem fatetur.
Priest durst boast of your alliance, in this doctrine of Transubstantiation,
not only with this forenamed Patriarch of Constantinople, but also with the
whole Eastern and Greek Church. But behold Cyril, now Patriarch of
Constantinople, ready at hand to strangle this false brag, saying (as he
himself speaks) Conf^ssio fidei ^ Reverendissima Cyrillo Patriarchia
Constanti^op. nomine omnium Ecclesiarum Orientalium Edit. Anno 1632. In
Eucharistiae Administratione Piaesentiam veram and realem Christi consitemur
and pr^fitemur: at illam, quam Fides nobis offert, non autem quam excogitata
docet Transubstantiatio.
In the name of the East and Greek Churches: We profess a true and real
Presence of Christ in this Sacrament: but that which is offered by faith, not
that (says he) which the devised Transubstantiation So he; namely so, as we
Protestants do likewise profess (as will be declared in the next Book at
large.) And that the Grecians, who were present at the Council of Florence,
did not yield Assent to that Article of Transubstantiation, although your
Jesuit Gordon. Ies. Controv. 4. cap. 4. number. 25. Quod de Graecis in Concilio
Florentino congregatis co^miniscuntur Adversarij, cos nimirum negasse
Transubstantiationem, apertum est Commentum, -- Nam Disputatio tantum erat,
quibus verbis fieret Transubstantiatio, seu Consecratio.
Gordon would qualify and mince the business, yet Binius the Publisher of
that Council Binius Tom. 4. Not. in Conc. Florent Sess. 25. [In vobis etc.]
Cum Pontifex egisset, ut Graeci dicerent, quid statuerent de Processione

respondissent, se admittere Purgatorium etc. De Transubstantiatione vero Panis
Suorum sententiae inhaesissent
confesses that they did therein Persist in the opinion of their own Doctors.

Master Brerely would think it an injury done unto himself, if we should
pretermit his objected Authority of Pope Gregory: for Doctor Humphrey (says
he) does charge Gregory the Great with Transubstantiation. So Master Brerely,
who objected this in his Apology, many years ago, and had a full Answer in
Appeal. lib. 1. Chap. 2.. 7. [The testimony it self, cited out of Greg. by M^
Brereley, is answered in the first Book, concerning EATING.
Appeal, made purposely in confutation of his whole Apology. The Sum of
that Answer is this: Doctor Humphrey did not speak that, as grounded upon any
sentence of Gregory, but only upon the report of a Romish Legend (supposing it
to be true) which in the judgment of Romish Doctors themselves (whose
Testimonies are there cited) Is unworthy to report the memory of the fact,
being in it self fond, filthy, and frivolous, the Author whereof may seem to
have a face of Iron, and a heart of Lead; and the Objector, namely Master
Brerely (for grounding his Objection on a Legendary History) A Falsisier of his
own promise. This Answer was home, one would think, Cole-worts twice sod.

CHALLENGE.
What greater Inconsionableness could your Disputers bewray, than by so
torturing the Hyperbolicall, Figurative, Sacramental Sayings of Ancient
Fathers for proof of the Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ?
insomuch that they must be consequently constrained, by the force of some
Phrases, contrary both to the meaning of the same Fathers, and to the Doctrine
of your own Romish Church, to admit of three other Transubstantiations; viz.
First, of Christ his Body into whatsoever the Appetite of the Communicant shall
desire. Secondly, of Christ his Body into the Body of every Christian. And
Thirdly, of the Body of every Christian Body of Christ. As the Testimonies
objected plainly pronounce. *Besides which you may add a Fourth, of Bread into
the Deity of Christ. And again, a Fifth out of Chrysostom, of the Wicked
receivers, turned into Wolves, as you have heard. As also (for a Sixth, from
others, of the Change of Set the 9. following, Dio^ysius.
Godly Receivers into God. A Seventh out of Saint Augustine, of Changing
(says he, of Christ) See Book. 5. cap. 8. 1.
Me into Thee, and Thee into Me. In all which Objections they do but verify
the Proverb: Qui nimis emungit, elicit sanguinem.

Fifthly, the like Inconsionableness of your Romish Disputers is unmasked, by
laying open the Emphaticall Speeches of the Fathers, concerning Baptism,
answerable to their Sayings objected, for proof of Transubstantiation
COncerning Baptism we have See above in this Chap.. 3. etc.
heard already, out of the Writings of Antiquity, as efficacious Terms, as you
could object for the Eucharist. First of the Party Baptized, Changed into a new
Creature. Secondly, that No sensible thing is delivered in Baptism. Thirdly,
that The Baptized is not the same, but changed into Christ his flesh. Fourthly,

Fathers, I. Touching the Exposition of Christ's words, [This is my Body.] The
Fathers ( says he) used the same form of speech, which Christ had done before
them: which does no whit help the Papists, because it is one thing to use the
same phrase of speech, and another thing to define II. Using Examples, which
destroy Transubstantiation, (as namely) the Change of Water in Baptism, of
Laics into the Priest. III. They acknowledged the sensible Sign with the
thing signified thereby. But they never teach any thing whereby either
Transubstantiation, or the being of Accidents without their substance is
established. IV. They attributed the Participation of this Mystery unto Faith,
yet so, as not excluding the receiving by the Mouth, in respect of the Symbols.
Somethinke, when the Fathers say Christ is present, And he has left us his
Body, and the like, that thereby they mean the Doctrine of the Papists, but
they are deceived. V. All the Fathers with one Consent teach, that there is the
same Change and Transmutation of Water in Baptism, which there is of Bread in
the Eucharist. VI. That the Hyperboles and Excessive speeches of the Fathers
are not to be pressed, Dionysius Areopagita, saying that Man, by this
Sacrament, is made a God. Thus far that Orthodoxe and learned Author,
justifying (in effect) as much as hitherto by Us has been avouched from
Antiquity.

Sixthly, the Inconsionableness of the Romish Opposites does betray it self,
by their alleging of Testimonies of the Fathers, contrary to their own Romish
Principles.
YOur Romish Positions and Principles are these; one is this: Josephus Angles
Flor. Theolog. qu. 5. Art. 1. Disp. 3 Conclu. 1. Panis fit corpus Christi, est
falsa positio; quia non suscipit Corpus Christi formam panis. Conclu. 2. Panis
mutatur in Corpus Christi, falsa est propositio, quia in hac conversione nullum
subjectum manet, and nulla intervenit mutatio, (nempe Corporis Christi.) Sic
ille. Aquinas, part. 3. qu. 75. Art. 8. in hoc Sacramento, facta conversiont,
aliquid idem manet, s^ilicet, (Accidentia panis) secundum quandam similitudinem
harum locutionum aliquae possunt concedi scil. quod de pane fit corpus Christi,
ut nomine panis non intelligatur substantia panis, sed in universali Hoc, quod
sub speciebus panis continetur. -- Et paulo post, ad 1. Non tamen proprie
dicitur quod panis fiat corpus Christi, nisi secundum aliquam similitudinem, ut
dicitur. Vasquez in 3. Thom. qu. 75. Art. 8. Disp. 181. cap. 14. Verum cum jam
a nobis notatum est, verbum [FIERI] in praedictis propositionibus non sumi
proprie pro aliqua corporis, Christi productione, sed pro eo, quod est, corpus
Christi adduci, seu fieri praesens in Sacramento, ex hac part nihil
difficultatis est in praedictis annuntiationibus. -- Panis fit Corpus Christi
melius docent Tho. Rich. Gabr. Sotus, Ledesma, hanc propositionem esse falsam,
si secundum proprietatem vocum accipiatur. Et ratio manifesta est, quia cum
aliquid dicitur fieri aliud, debet esse aliquod commune, saltem materia sub
utroque termino Transmutationis, hic autem nihil manet commune nisi Accidentia,
quae non fiant corpus Christi, sed continent. AEgidius Coninck de Sacramentis.
Qu. 75. Art. 8. De pane sit Corpus Christi: Ex pane fit corpus Christi, in
rigore sunt falsae, si apud Patres inve^^antur, pie explicandae sunt, Patres
Catachresi usos esse.
This Proposition, Bread is made the Body of Christi, is False, say your
Doctors; And, It cannot agree with the Body of Christ in true Propriety; and
they give reasons hereof (in the Margin.) The other is, That to affirm, that
Bread is changed into Christ his Body, is a false Proposition: the reason is,
because in your Transubstanciation there is no Change made in Christ's Body. A
third may be this, touching the Praeposition, [De] That the Body of Christ
cannot be properly said to be made [De Pane] of Bread; for so it should not be
of the flesh of the Virgin. Thus can they say, and thus can Bread is said to be
made Christ's Body; and which speak of Changing Bread into Christ's Body; and
also such, which express the Body of Christ to be made of Bread. Which one
Consideration as it does discover the Inconsionableness of our Adversaries,
so may it instruct us, that all such Sentences of the Fathers are to be
Interpreted as spoken, (...), or in a Figurative Sense.


Only give us leave to speer you a Question, before we end this third Book.
Seeing that Transubstantiation cannot properly be, by your own Doctrine,
except the Substance of Bread ceasing to be, there remain only the Accidents
thereof (this Position of the continuance of Only Accidents, without a
Subject, being your Positive Foundation of Transubstantiation) Why is it that
none of all your Romish Disputers was hitherto Cyril, which See above Chap. 4.
4.
has bin (as yoe have heard) egregiously abused and falsified? Learn you to
Answer this Question, or else shame to object Antiquity any more; but rather
confess your Article of Transubstantiation to be but a Bastardly Impe.

We might enlarge our selves in this point of your Inconsionableness, in
your objecting Testimonies of Fathers, for proof as well of Transubstantiation,
as of the other Articles Corporal Presence; Corporal Union, Corporal
Sacrifice of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, and the Divine Adoration thereof;
so plainly that any man may be persuaded, our Opposites mean no good Faith, in
arguing from the Judgment of Ancient Fathers.

Hitherto of the First Romish Consequences. THE FOVRTH BOOK, Treating of the
second Romish Consequence, arising from the false Exposition of these words of
Christ, [THIS
THE Sacramental Presence has a double Relation, one is in respect of the
thing sensibly received, which is the Sacrament it self; the other in respect
of the Receiver and Communicant. Both which

CHAP. I.
Of the state of this point of Controversy.
That notwithstanding the difference of opinion of Christ's Presence be only
De modo, that is, of the manner of Being; yet may the Romish Doctrine be
Heretical: and to hold the contrary is a pernicious Paradoxe. SECT. I.
IT would be a wonder to us, to hear Any of our own profession to be so
extremely Indifferent, concerning the different opinions of the Manner of the
Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament; as to think the Romish Sect
therefore either Tolerable, or Reconciliable, upon Pretense that the Question
is only De modo, (that is) of the manner of Being, and that Consequently all
Controversy about this is but vain langling. Such an one ought to enter into
his second thoughts, to consider the necessity that lies upon every Christian
to abandon diverse Heresies, albeit their difference from the Orthodox
profession were only De modo. As for example. First, The Gnostick taught man's
soul to have it is beginning by manner of Production, from the substance of God.
The Catholics said nay; but by manner of Creation, of nothing. The Pelagians
maintained a free will in spiritual Acts, from the grace of Catholics nay;
but by special grace of Christ, freeing the will through the efficacious
operation of his holy Spirit. The Catharists held themselves pure, in a purity
of an absolute perfection. The Catholics nay; but by an Inchoative,
comparative, and imperfect perfection of purity. Furthermore against our
Christian Faith, of believing God to be absolutely a Spirit; the
Anthropomorphites conceived of God, as of one (after the manner of men)
consisting of Arms and Legs, etc.

Not to be tedious. We come to the Sacraments. The Cataphrygae did not Baptize
in the name of the Blessed Trinity, after Artotyritae celebrated the Eucharist
in Bread and Cheese. To omit many others, take one poniard, which we are sure
will pierce into the intrailes of the Cause (to wit) the heresy of the
Capernaits, in the days of our Savior Christ: who hearing his Sermon,
teaching men to Eat his flesh; and conceiving thereby a carnal manner of
Eating, irreconciliably, contrary to the spiritual manner, which was believed
by the true Disciples of Christ, departed from Christ, and Apostated from the
Faith. *For we are to understand, that Quomodo] How? The one Insidelitatis: as
though it were unpossible to be True in the Sense of the speaker. The other [
Quomodo] How? Prudentiae: by inquiring into the Possible Sense of the speaker.
Of the first kind was that of the Capernaits, by not believing, through their
praejudicate understanding of his speech, Contra Christi Sensum. That other is
of us Protestants, believing the same words, juxta Christi Sensum.* And that
the Romish manner of Eating Christ his Body is Capernaiticall; her manner of
Sacrifice sacrilegious; her manner of Divine Adoration thereof Idolatrous; and
all these manners Irreconciliable to the manner of our Church, is copiously

The manner of Presence of Christ his Body 1. According to the Judgment of
Protestants. 2. In the profession of the Church of Rome.

That Protestants, albeit they deny the Corporal Presence of Christ in this
Sacrament; yet hold they a true Presence thereof in diverse Respects; according
to the Judgment of Antiquity. SECT. II.
THere may be observed Four kinds of Truths of Christ his Presence in this
Sacrament: one is Veritas Signi, that is, Representation of Christ his Body;
the next is Veritas Revelationis, Truth of Revelation; the third is Veritas
Obsignationis, that is, a Truth of Seal, for better assurance; the last is,
Veritas Exhibitionis, the Truth of Exhibiting, and deliverance of the Real
Body of Christ to the faithful Communicants. The Truth of the Sign, in
respect of the thing signified, is to be acknowledged so far, as in the
Signs of Bread and Wine is represented the true and Real Body and Blood of
Christ: which Truth and Realty is celebrated by us, and taught by ancient
Fathers, in contradiction to Manichees, Marcionites, and other Heretics; who
held that Christ had in himself no true Body, but merely Fantastical, as
you Marcionitae, Manichaei, and alij Haeretici putabant corpus Christi verum
non esse, sed phantasticum esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 24.. Resp.
Argumentum.
your selves well know. In confutation of which Heretics the Father Ignatius
(as your Ignatius (citante Theodoret. Dial 3.) Eucharistia est Caro Christi,
Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. Hoc scripsit Ignatius contra Haereticos, qui
negabant Christum habuisse Carnem veram, sed tantum visibilem and apparentem.
-- Observandum est, Haereticos illos non tam Sacramentum Eucharistiae, quam
Mysterium Incarnationis oppugnasse. [ True, and the Argument of Ignatius was
the same which Tertullian used also against the same kind of Heretics: Lib.
4. in Marcion. [Hoc est corpus meum] Id est, figura corporis mei: Figura autem
non fuisset, nisi veritas esset corpus. See this in the place of Tertullian at
large.
Cardinal witnesses) called the Eucharist it self, the flesh of Christ.
Which Saying of Ignatius, in the sense of Theodoret, (by whom he is cited,
against the Heresy of his time) does call it Flesh and Blood of Christ,
because (as the same Theodoret expounded himself) it is a true sign of the
true and Real Body of Christ. So your Cardinal, even as Tertullian long
before him had explained the words of Christ himself, This is my Body] that is
(says he) This Bread is a Sign, or Figure of my Body. Now because it is not
a Sign, which is not of some Truth ( See above, Book 2. Chap. 2. (...) 9.
for as much as there is not a figure of a figure) therefore Bread being a
Sign of Christ's Body, it must follow, that Christ had a true Body. This indeed
is Theological arguing, by a true Sign of the Body of Christ to confute the
Heretics, that denied the Truth of Christ's Body. Which controlleth the
wisdom of your Concilium dicit vero contineri Corpus in Sacramento contra
Sacramentarios, qui volunt Christum adesse in Signo, and Figura: Signa enim
Veritati opponuntur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2.
Council of Trent, in condemning Protestants, as denying Christ to be Truly
present in the Sacrament, because they say, he is there present in a Sign.
Truth of being in a Sign, or Figure; which were to abolish all true
Sacraments, which are true Figures, and Signs of the things which they
represent.

A second Truth and Realty in this Sacrament is called Veritas Revelationis, as
it is a Sign, in respect of the Typical Signs of the same Body and Blood of
Christ, in the Rites of the old Testament; yet not absolutely in respect of the
matter it self, but of the manner, because the faithful under the Law had the
same faith in Christ: and therefore their Sacraments had Relation to the same
Body, and Blood of Christ, but in a difference of manner. For as two Cherubins
looked on the same Mercy-Seate, but with different faces oppositely: so did
both Testaments point out the Augustine. contra Fauslum, lib. 19. page 349. Tom.
6. Deltrat, qui dicit mutaus Sacramentis res ipsas diversas esse, quas ritus
Propheticus pronunciavit implendas, and quas ritus Evangelicus annunciavit
impletas. -- aliter res annunciatur facienda, aliter facta.
Saint Augustine teaches, Prophetical, prenunciating and foretelling the
thing to come: but the rites of the new Testament are Historical, annunciating
and revealing the thing done: the former showed, concerning Christ his Passion,
rem faciendam, what should be; the latter rem factam, the thing done, and
fulfilled. As therefore the Truth of History is held to be more real than the
Truth of Prophecy, because it is a declaration of a real performance of that,
which was promised: So the Evangelicall Sacrament Leviticall. Therefore are the
Rites of the old Law called Heb. 10.
Shadows, in respect of the Sacraments of the Gospel; according to the which
difference Saint John the Baptist was called by Christ a Prophet, in that he
Ioh. 1. 15.
foretold Christ as now to come: but he was called more than a Prophet, as
demonstrating and Ibid. 19.
pointing him out to be now come. Which Contemplation occasioned diverse
Fathers to speak so Hyperbolically of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, in
comparison of the Sacraments of the old Testament, as if the Truth were in
these, and not in them, as Origin. Hom. 7. in Numer. page 195. Illa in
aenigmate designari, quae nunc in nova Lege in specie and veritate complentur.
[ Calling ours Truth, yet not simply, but comparatively ^ for a little after
he confesses that they received Eandem Escam; id est, Christum.] Objected by
Mr. Brerely, Lirurg. Tract. 4.. 2. Subd. 4.
Origin did.

Besides the former two, there is Veritas Obsignationis, a Truth sealed, which
makes this Sacrament more than a Sign, even a Seal of Gods promises in
Christ; for so the Apostle called Circumcision, (albeit a Sacrament of the old
Law) the Romans 4. 11.
Seal of Faith. But yet the print of that Seal was but dim, in comparison
of the Evangelicall Sacraments; which because they confirm unto the faithful
the Truth, which they present, are called by other ancient Fathers (as well as
by August. Tom. 4. de Catechizand. rudib. cap. 26. Signacula esse visibilia
rerum divinarum.
Saint Augustine) visible Seals of Divine things. So that now we Sign, or
Signification, but under a Seal of Confirmation also: which infers a
greater degree of real Truth, thereby represented unto us. This might have bin
the reason why Saint Augustine taught Christ to be August. Tract. 50. in Ich.
Habemus Christum in praesenti ad Baptismatis Sacramentum: habemus in praesenti
ad Altaris cibum and potum. Tom. 9.
Present both in Baptism, and at receiving the Lord's Supper.

A fourth Reason to be observed herein, as more special, is Veritas
Exhibitionis, a Truth Exhibiting and delivering to the faithful Communicants
the thing signified, and sealed, which Christ expressed, when he delivered it
to his Disciples, saying; [ Take, eat, this is my Body given for you: and,
this is my Blood shed for you.] Thus Christ, by himself; and so does he to
other faithful Communicants whersoever, to the ends of the World, by his
Ministers, as by his hands, through virtue of that Royal Command, [DOE THIS.]
Vain therefore is the Objection made by your Athanas. apud Theodoret. Dial. 2.
page 330. Corpus est, cui dicit, Sede a dexteris meis -- per quod corpus
Pontifex fuit, and dictus est, per id quod tradidit mysterium, dicens; Hoc est
corpus meum. This was objected by Bellarmine. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 11.
Cardinal, in urging us with the testimony of Athanasius, to prove that Christ
his Body is exhibited to the Receivers. As though there were not a Truth in a
mystical,

That the Romish Disputers do Odiously, Slanderously, and Unconscionably
vilify the Sacrament of the Eucharist, as it is celebrated
BEllarmine, with others Christus nihil est illis, nisi frustum panis, and vini

object against Protestants, saying that Their Sacrament is nothing else but a
crust of Bread, and pittance of Wine. And again, A morsel of Bread ill baked,
by which the Protestants represent unto their memories the death of Christ, and
the benefits thereof. A goodly matter! so does a Crucifix: and to make the
Sacrament only a Sign, is an ancient Heresy. So they.

But have you not heard the Doctrine of the Protestants, teaching the
Eucharisticall Bread to be (more than Bare Bread) a Sacramental Sign; more,
an Evangelicall Sign; more, a Sacred Seal; yet more, an Exhibiting Instrument
of the Body of Christ therein to the devout Receiver? And have not these
outrageous Spirits read your own Cardinal? witnessing that the Protestants
teach that Docet Calvinus Symbola, and corpus Christi, licet loco inter se
plurimum disten^, tamen conjuncta esse, non solum ratione signi; quia unum est
signum alterius; sed quia per signum Deus vere nobis exhibet ipsum corpus
verum, and sanguinem, quo animae nostrae vere alantur. Bellar. l. 1. de Euc. c.
1. ^it Calvinus affirmat saepius, Christi corpus esse praesens in Sacramento
quatenus ibi animis nostris vere unitur, and communicatur substantialiter: sic
enim loquitur, secundum substantiam, non modo secundum effectum. Et Fortunatus
Calvinista dicit, in Sacramento corpus Christi versari realissimeque percipi.
Valent. Ies. Tom. 4. disp. 6. quaest. 3. punct. 1.. 7. p. 9. Idem Sadael and
Beza sentiunt. Idem ibid Haec est eorum sententia; licet Christi corpus
corporaliter and essentialiter sit in coelo, nihilominus duplici modo in hoc
Sacramento vere percipi, spiritualiter, and sacramentaliter; spiritualiter
quidem ore mentis, non dentis, id est, per fidem and co^junctionem, virtute
Spiritus Sancti in animo communicantis: sacramentaliter etiam, ore quidem
corporis sumendo, non ipsum quidem corpus ejus, sed signum corporis ejus,
panem, and vinum, quae dicit esse sigilla certa, quibus promissio redemptionis
in corpore and sanguine Christi fidelibus obsignatur. Valent. quo supra.
Although the Body of Christ be still in Heaven, yet is it received in this
Sacrament; first Sacramentally by Bodily mouths, in receiving the Bread, the
sign of Christ his Body; and by which God does truly, albeit Sacramentally,
deliver unto the faithful the real Body of Christ: and secondly spiritually
to the mouth of the soul by Faith, and so they truly and really participate of
the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ. So Bellarmine, concerning
Protestants, which is so plainly professed by Calvin, in his Book intituted,
Defensio Carvini de Sacramento. Augustana Confessio [In sacra Coena vere dari

Calvin himself, as would make any Romish Adversary blush at your former
Calumnies, who has not abandoned Dr. Heskins in his Parliam. of Christ. Book.
3. cap. 48.
who therefore upbraided Protestants with their Common Bread, only because
they denied it to be Transubstantiated into Christ's Body; even in the same his
Book, wherein notwithstanding, he confesses the Shewbread, delivered to
David by Abimelech, to have been no Common Bread. Which, because it was before
Christ incarnate in the flesh, you your selves will swear was not
Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ; and yet notwithstanding, Common
Bread.


THus may you see that we have not hitherto so pleaded for the Existence of
the Substance of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration, as thereby to
exclude all Presence of Christ his Body; nor so maintained the propriety of a
Sign, or Figure, as not to believe the thing signified to be exhibited unto
us, as you have heard. With what black spot of bare Bread, which they
notwithstanding teach and believe to be a Sacred Sign of the true Body of
Christ, in opposition to Heretics; an Evangelicall Sign of the Body of the
Messiah crucified, against all Jewish conceit; yea, a Seal of Ratification;
yea, and also a Sacramental Instrument of conveying of the same precious Body
of Christ to the souls of the faithful, by an happy and ineffable
Conjunction? whereof more hereafter in the In the fifth Book, throughout.
Book following, where the consonant doctrine of the Church of England will
likewise appear.

And as your Disputers are convinced of a malicious Detraction, by the
confessed positions of Protestants, so are they much more by your own Instance
of a Crucifix^ for which of you would not hold it a great derogation from
Christ, that any one seeing a Crucifix of wood (now waxen old) should in
disdain thereof call it a wooden, or rotten Block, and not account Crucifix
as glorious as either Art could fashion, or Devotion affect, or Superstition
adore, yet is it but a sign invented by man. And therefore how infinitely more
honorable in all Christian estimation must a Sacramental Sign be, which
only the God of Heaven and Earth could institute, and Christ has ordained to
his Church, far exceeding the property of a bare sign, as you have heard? A
Father delivering by politic assurances under hand and seal a portion of
Land, although an hundred miles distant, and conveying it to his Son by Deed,
if the bare sign, were he not worthy not only to loose this fatherly Benefit,
but also to be deprived of all other the temporal Blessings of a Father, which
he might otherwise hope to enjoy? yet such like have been your Calumnies, and
opprobrious Reproaches against our celebration of the Sacrament of Christ. The
Lord lay not them to your Charge.

Now you, who so oppose against the Truth of the Mystical Presence, will not
conceal from us that Presence of the Body which your Church does so extremely
dote on.

CHAP. II.
The Romish professed manner of Presence of Christ's Body in this Sacrament.
SECT. I.
Corporal Presence of Christ in this Sacrament, but only a literal Exposition
of Christ's words [ This is my Body:] which by Scriptures, Fathers, your own
Principles, and by unanswerable Reasons has been Book 2.
proved to be most grossly false, we shall not need to insist further upon
that; only we shall but put you in mind of Saint Paul's words, in teaching the
use and end of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, to wit, The showing of
meaning corporally, at the last day. Which word [VNTILL,] being spoken of a
last day, does exclude your coming again of Christ in his Corporal Presence
every day; for the Apostles word is absolutely spoken of his Bodily Coming, and
not of the manner thereof; albeit other Scripture teach, that his Coming must be
in all glorious Visibility. We go on.

In the Eucharist (says your Si quis negaverit in sanctissima Eucharistia

Blood of Christ: and they account him Accursed, whosoever shall not believe

effectuating that Presence.

Eloquence to set forth his merchandise to sale; telling us by the way of

the Eucharist, even by the Testimony of men's eyes, that have seen it. A thing
(says he) most miraculous, which every one that has eyes may yet see. So he,

Brerely thus prefacing; Miracles sent by God confirm the same, wherein at the
breaking of the Host, sundry times great copy of blood issued out, as is
testified by many Writers. We are now attentive to the Relation of your Orator
and Others, and afterward (as you shall perceive) to give that credit unto
them, which the cause it self shall require. We will take their Relations
according to the order

I. Anno CCCC. Simon Metaphrastes ( says Simon Metaphrastes narrat, etc.
Bozius ibid.
Bozius) tells in the days of Honorius the Emperor (for the confirmation of
the faith of an Eremite) that the Sacrament being propounded, presently [Infans
visus est] a living Infant was seen by three old men on the Altar: and whilst
the Priest divided the Bread, an Angel was seen, and seemed to divide, and
cut in pieces the flesh of the Child, and so [Senex carnis cruentae aperte
particeps factus est, and resipiscit,] The old Heremite being made partaker
evidently of the Bloody flesh repented.

II. Anno 600. A woman ( as Johannes, and Paulus Diaconus in vita Gregorij
narrat, etc. Bozius ibid. and Coccius Thesaur. li. 6. de Euch. art. 8. Anno
590. And Masser Brerely Tract. 4.. 3. Subd. 1. out of Paulus Diaconus, de vita
Greg. lib. 2. cap. 41.
Bozius reports, and with him Coccius) had laughed to hear the Bread called
the Body of Christ, which she her self had made with her own hands, and was
observed to laugh by Pope Gregory: who thereupon fell to prayer with the
people, and by and by looking aside upon the Host, behold the forms of Bread
were vanished, and he saw [Veram carnem] true flesh: Then the people wondered,
the woman repented, and the Host, at the prayer of the Priest [in pristinam
formam reversa est] Returned into it is own shape again.

III. Anno 800. Ante Annos prope octingentos, ut narrat Pascasius, quidam
Presbyter, etc. Bozius ibid. and Coccius.
A certain Priest called Phlegis, being desirous to see Christ in the
Eucharist, not that he doubted thereof, but that he might receive some heavenly
comfort [Divinitus] from God, after prayers for this purpose, he saw ( after
Consecration) [Puerum Iesum,] The Child Jesus, in the Host, [and amplexatus
est eum, and post multam deosculationem, etc.] he embraced him, and after much
kissing of him, he desired to receive the Sacrament, and the Vision vanished,
and he received it. So he. These two last, are also alleged by your Cardinal
Bellar. lib. 3. de Eu^^r. cap. 8. Deus non est testis menda^^, etc.
Bellarmine.

IV. Not many years after a fourth in Italy, E^ Guitmun lo, and Lanf^^nco,
Bozius and Coccius Ibid.
A Priest saying Mass, and sinding [Veram carnem super Altar, verumque
sanguinem in Calice,] True flesh upon the Altar, and true Blood in the Cup,
fearing to receive it, forthwith reported it to the Bishop, demanding what he
should do; The Bishop consulted with the other Bishops his Brethren, by whose
common consent the Priest taking the Cup and the flesh, shut them up in the
midst of the Altar,

V. Anno 1050. Tempore quo, urgente nefando Berengario, haec in controversiam
sunt adducta, ut Deus adstipulatus intellig^tur veritati, and refragatus
errori, etc. Baronius Anno 1059. number. 20. ex Petro Damino.
Cardinal Baronius will needs have you know, that Berengarius was confirmed by
a like miracle from God, as the Bishop of Amalphi ( says he) witnesses to
Pope Stephen upon his oath; That when he was doubting of the Truth of the Body
of Christ, in the Sacrament, at the breaking of the Host [Rubra and perfecta
caro inter ejus manis apparuit, ita ut digitos ejus cruentaret,] Red and
perfect flesh appeared betwixt his

VI. Anno 1192. Behold an History ( says your Quae admiranda hoc seculo in
S^lavorum Historia, authore Helmoldo Abbate, hujus seculi narrantur fide
dignissima, accipe. His ferme diebus, etc. Baron. An. 119^. number. 20. and 21.
Haec de Transubstanti^^one: consutavit item idem miraculum Haeresin nuper
obortam negantium aquam vino mixtam mutari in sanguinem. Baronius ibid. number. 24.
Cardinal Baronius) most worthy of belief ( you must believe it.) At Thuring
after that the Priest had given the Sacrament to a young Girl then sick, and
had washed his fingers in a pot of water, she observing it very diligently,
willed them that were by to uncover the water, for I saw (said she) a piece of
the Eucharist fall out of the hands of the Priest into it: which being brought
unto her to drink, all the water was turned into Blood, and the piece of the
Host, albeit no bigger than a man's finger, was turned [In sanguineam carnem]
Thus far the Story. This ( says the same Cardinal) So he.

VII. Anno 1230. Bozius quo supra ex Filiano.
A Priest in Florence looking into the Chalice saw drops of Blood divided into
parts, and joining together again, in Abbess lends the Priest a Violl to
put the Blood in, which the third day after appeared to be flesh. This flesh is
still reserved in a Cristall glass in the Church of Saint Ambrose in Florence;
and although the outward forms thereof be somewhat dark, yet are they to be
seen of all Travelers. So he.

VIII. Anno 1239. Bozius quo supra.
In the Kingdom of Valentia [Vere memorabile] a thing truly memorable; In the
time of the wars between the Christians and Mahumetans there was seen of
the Priest in the Altar pieces of the Host enclosed in linen, and sprinkled
with drops of Blood, which Host afterward by advice was laid, with all
reverence, on the back of a Mule to be carried to that place, wheresoever the
Mule should make a stand. The Mule (although enticed often by Provander to
stand els-where) never made

IX. Bozius ibid. ex Villano, etc.
Anno 1258. When the Priest celebrated the Mass in the Kings Chapel at Paris,
and was now in elevating the Host, to show it unto the people, many of them
presently saw [formosissimum puerum a most beautiful Child: And out of the
Eucharist [sanguis copiosus emanavit] much Blood issued; so that this cannot
be imputed to the Art of the Devil.

X. Anno 1261. Bozius ibid. and Onuphrius in Vita Vrbani Quarti. Vivus Sanguis
ex Hostia manavit, and totam mappam, quam Corporale vocant, tinxi^.
[Illustrissimum illud] The most famous, upon occasion whereof the Feast of
Corpus Christi day was first instituted, which Panvinus mentions in the life
of Pope Urban the Fourth, when there issued out of the Eucharist [sanguis
copiosus] Abundance of Blood. So that it cannot be attributed to the cunning of
the Devil.

XI. Anno 1273. Bozius ibid.
A Miracle was seen at Picenum, where a woman reserved the Eucharist, which
she should have eaten, and kept it with purpose to abuse it for recovering the
love of her Huband by Magic; The Host she laid on Coals, and it presently

XII. Anno 1510. Bozius ibid.
At Knobloch, a Village under the Marquisate of Brandenburgh, one Paulus
Formosus on a night stole the Pix wherein the Eucharist was reserved, he sold
it to a Jew, The Most of all these are related by Master Master (...) in his
Book of the Laturgie of the Mass^, page 188. and 399.
Brerely Priest; whereupon he makes this Conclusion: Miracles showed by God (
says he) do forceably confirm the same, for at breaking of the Host at
sundry times great copy and abundance of Blood issued out, as has been
formerly testified. So they.

It were pity, when as so many Countries have been graced with such Miracles,
England should be thought unworthy of like honor; nay here also we hear
there was ( Anno 950.) at Canterbury Master Fox Acts and Monuments, page 11^.
Ex O^berac, in vita (...).
a Miracle wrought for confirming diverse Clergy men (then wavering) in the
Doctrine of Transubstantiation, by a Bloody dropping of the Host at Mass.
Such as these are the Miracles, whereof your Jesuit boasts, saying, Mr.
Mallon Ies his Reply, Epist. to the Read. r.
I have enlarged my self in the Article of the Real Presence, because it is a
matter of great importance: in which Argument I have alleged many miraculous
Demonstrations, recorded So he. But of what credit your Historians are, who
report these; what Conscience your Disputers have to object these; give us
first leave to diseusse, and we shall easily permit it to the Judgment of any
Conscional^^ man, to make his own Conclusion. *

That these were not Apparitions of true Flesh, and true Blood of Christ, by
the judgment of Romish Schoolmen.
YOur Bellarmine, Baronius, Bozius, Master Brerely, and Coccius have, for
proof of the Corporal Presence of Christ, insisted upon Apparitions of ( as
they have said) true flesh, red flesh, perfect flesh of the Infant Jesus; and
the child Jesus seen, embraced and kissed in the Eucharist: of Wine turned
into blood, of Drops But we rather believe your Schoolmen, of whom (besides
many Revera videri Christum in specie pueri, aut carnis opi^antur, sed cum
du^^tione, Alensis, G^briel, Palacius. S^^rez. Ies. Tom 3. Disp. ^5.. 2 p. 710.
that doubted) diverse, together with Thomas Aquinas, with the Thomists, and
other Authors, alleged by your Jesuit Suarez, denied all this, saying, Dicendum
est in hujusmodi apparitione non videri Christum in se: ita Thomas, and omnes
Thomistae. Suarez. ibid Quando app^et this species, quidam dacunt, quod est
propria species Christi corporis, nec obstare dicunt, quod aliquas tautium pa^s
carnis, aut quod species pueri appareat, qu^a potest Christus ^ qua vult specie
apparere in propri^a siv^a^ena: sed hoc est inconveniens, quia species Christi
non potest in propria specie videri, nisi ^ uno loco, in quo definitive

Sacramento. Legitur quod loque multorum Episconorum Concilio in paxide

sed color tantum, et figura Suarez. Jesuit. quo supra. And the Jesuit

and 101. In istis apparitionibus non videtur caro et sanguis in se, sed tantum
figura et color illam referens.
That in such Apparitions there is no True flesh, nor true Blood of Christ at
all. Their Reasons: First, Because Christ ( say they) cannot Secondly, Because
it were heinous wickedness to enclose Christ in a Box, appearing in his own
form. Thirdly, Because Christ's Blood to issue, and sprinkle out of his veins,
who can easily believe? ( yea, and your Jesuit Coster, with some Others, spare
not to profess, as well as we, that See the fixed Book, Chap. 1.. 4.
Shedding of Christ's Blood out of his Body, was only on the Cross.) Fourthly,
Because it were Vndecencie to reserve such Relics, experience teaching that
they do putrify. Thus your own Schoolmen produced, and approved by Suarez
the Jesuit, whose Conclusion and Resolution is, that The flesh thus appearing
is not only not the flesh of Christ, but even no true flesh at all, but only a
color and sign thereof. * Fifthly, Jesuit Vasquez, denying those to be the
Apparitions of true Flesh; and as though none but simple people were deceived
with such Apparitions, he holds it sufficient that Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Thom.
Quaest. 76. Art. 8 Disput. 193. Cap. 2. Respondeo, Neque apparere carnem
Christi, neque alterius, quae revera caro sit, sed carnis solum effigie^. --
Quod autem simplices decipiantur, and credant ibi esse carnem Christi
divisibili and cruento modo, parum refert: haec enim deceptio instructione vera
Doctorum and Pastorum corrigendus est.
Their Deception herein may be corrected by the true instruction of the
Learned. How will your Bozius, Coccius, Bellarmine, and your many other Doctors
together with their Believers, digest this; to be thus ranked by this your
Jesuit among the Simple and Ignorant people in this their deliration,
concerning such fictitious Apparitions? *

Do you not then see the different faith of your own Historians, and of your
own Divines? namely that those Historians, as unclean Beasts, swallow down
at the first whatsoever comes into their mouths: but those your Divines, like
more Clean creatures, do ruminate and distinguish truth from falsehood, by
sound reason and judgment, and prove the Authors of such Apparitions flat
liars; the Reporters uncredible Writers; and the Believers of them stark
Fools.

That the Romish Answer, to free their former pretended Miraculous Apparitions
from suspicion of Figments, or Illusions, is Insufficient. SECT. IV.
ALbeit in these Apparitions there be not true flesh ( say Quamvis non fiat, ut
vera caro Christi, vel revera vera caro (ut respondent Thomistae) sed tantum
color and figura ejus, tamen quod sit externa species, sive imago divinitus
facta, sufficiens est ad confirmationem veritatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disput.
55. Sect. 2.
some of your Doctors) yet such Apparitions, being miraculously wrought, are
sufficient Demonstrations that Christ's Flesh But why should not we yield more
credit to those Schoolmen, who say Alens. Gabriel. Palacius dicunt quod
miracula siunt veris, and non apparentibus signis and figuris -- Asserunt talem
apparitionem non esse factam virtute Dei, sed Daemonis. Suarez Ibid. [Where he
adds, Hoc ab ijs gratis dictum est.]
True miracles use to be made in true signs, and not in such as seem only
so to be; because seeming signs are wrought by the Art of the Devil? And we
take it from the Assurance, which your Jesuit gives us, that Potest Demon
repraesentare figuras quarum libet rerum, ut argenti, auti, epul rum,
quemadmodum per^ssimi Sculprores and Pictores v^tias fo^mas, and figur^ rerum
ita finguam, ut interdum verae esse videantur. Sed vere and proprie miraculum
id dicitur opus, quod omnis ^aturae creatae vum atque potentiam excedit. Et una
differentia, qua vera miracula possunt a falsis discerni, haec est, quod falsa
sunt pha^tastica, and simulata, ideoque non diturna: vel sunt plane inutilia.
Perer. Ies. in Ex^. 7 Disp. 4. Number. 34. and D. 5. N. 36 38. Tertia ratio sum

Devils and Painters can make such semblances and Similitudes: and that true
Miracles are to be discerned from false, in that false Miracles carry only a
likeness of things, and are unprofitable. Furthermore, yourp Aquinas proves
against the Heretics, from Sense, that Christ had a true Body, Because it
could not agree with the dignity of his person, who is Truth, that there should
be any fiction in any work of his. Thus stand you still confuted by your own
domestical witnesses.

Infant, and of the Child Jesus; albeit Christ, at his Ascension out of this
World, Baron. A^n. 34.
was 34. years of age: and yet now behold Christ an Infant 34. years old! as
if your (...) had beheld Christ, with the Magi, in Bethelehem, at the time of
his birth; and not in Bethaven, with his Disciples, at the instant of Ascension.

Of the Suggesters of such Apparitions; and of their Accomplices: SECT. V.
THe first Apparition of flesh abovementioned was not before the days of the
Emperor Arcadius, which was about Christ; nor is it read of any like
Apparition in all the days of Antiquity, within the compass of so long a
time; excepting that of one Marcus, recorded by Irenaeus adversus, Haereses
lib. 1. c. 9. Marcus purpureum and rubicundum apparere facit, ut puraretur ea
gratia sanguinem stillare in Calicem per invocationem per magu^ illum.
Irenaeus, who feigned to Make the mixed Wine in the Cup, through his
Invocation, to seem red, that it might be thought, that grace had infused
Blood into the Cup: which the same Father notes to have been done by Magic;
at what time there were daily Proselytes and new Converts to the Christian
Religion, and on the other side diverse ranks of Heretics, as namely,
Valentinians, Manichees, Marcionites, Bodily Substance at all. Were it not then
a strange thing that so many Apparitions should be had in aftertimes, in
Churches established in Christian Religion, concerning the truth of Christ's
Body, and no such one heard of in these days of Antiquity, when there seemed
to be a far more necessary use of them, both for confirming Proselytes in
the faith, and reducing Heretics from their Error? that Apparition only of
Marcus excepted which the Church of Christ did impute to the Diabolical Art of
Magic.

As for the Reporters, much need not to be said of them; Simon Metaphrastes is
the first, who was of that small Credit with your Cardinal, that, in Answer to
an Objection from the same Author, he said; Bellar. lib. 2. de Pont. c. 5..
Neque. And Baronius: Si qua fides adhibenda est Metaphrasti, qui nulla^ hic
meretur fidem. Ann. 44. number. 38.
I am not much moved with what Metaphrastes says. And if the Foreman of the
inquest be of no better esteem, what shall one then think of the whole Pack:
As for the testimony under the name of Amphilochius (objected by your Coccius
Thesaur. Catho. de Eucharistia. And Dr. Heskins in his Parlia, of Christ.
Coccius) writing the life of Basil, and mentioning the like Apparitions of
Flesh, we make no more account of it, than do your two Sed haud dubio falsa,
vel supposititia. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tit. Amphilochius; and Cardin. Baron.
ad Ann. 378. number. 10.
Cardinals, by whom it is rejected as Supposititious and Bastardly. But the
Suggesters of these Apparitions, what were they? (a matter observable)
ordinarily Priests, together with either old men, women, and sometimes young
Girls, who (wheresoever Superstition reigns) are known to be most prone
thereunto. That we say nothing of the lewd Iuglings of your Priests, who in
other kinds have bin often discovered amongst us, and in other Countries.

We conclude. A true Miracle, for confirmation of Religion Divinum opus, the
Infidel Magicians being enforced to confess as much, saying, Exodus 8. 19.
Digitus Dei hic est. And as sure are we that a fained miracle (although it be
in behalf of Religion) is impious and blasphemous against God, who being the
God of Truth, neither will, nor can be glorified by a lie: Job. 13. 7.
Has God need of a Lie? (says holy Job.) We right willingly acknowledge,
that diverse Miracles have bin wrought, for verifying the Eucharist to be a
Divine Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ: but to be it self the true
and substantial flesh of Christ, not one. When a Socrat. hist. lib. 7. cap. 17.

Saint Augustine tells of a Physician, who was vexed extremely with the Gout,
and at his Baptism was freed from all pain, and so continued all his life
long. Baron. An. 384. Number. 19.
Baronius reports another of a Child fallen into a little Well, prepared for
men of age to be Baptized in, and after that it was held for drowned, in the
opinion of all bystanders, at the prayer of Damascus it arose from the
bottom, as whole and sound as it was before. These Miracles happened water of
Baptism, but of the nature of the Sacrament it self, albeit void of the
Corporal presence of Christ. Not to tell you (which your Tanta suit Evangelij
authoritas, ut etiam codices ipsi miracula ediderint: ut Gregorius Tureneusis

Gospel, for the extinguishing of F^ers. And the former Histories do in most of
the premised Examples report as well the Adoration given to the former
Apparitions of a No-Christ, and of his No-Flesh; as they do unto Christ
himself: which, beside the Absurdity of their Opinion, does involve them in a
gross Idolatry, whereof We are to treat in the seventh Book.


FRancis Collius, Professor of Divinity at Millan, is the Author; whose Book
is Authorized (as the Francisus Collius T^eologiae. Dactor, De Sanguine Christi
m^raculo (...) Anno 1618. (Cum privilegio per Rus^am. Co^^gij Ambrofiant,
Praesiaem Collegarum nomine) Libri qu^que omnium Doctorum con^e su^cepri; and
etiam A^^s. Consult^r Offic^ pro ^ever^dissimo Inquisitore, etc.
Margin shows) With a public privilege, and Commendation of ALL the Doctors
of the College of Saint Ambrose. His whole Discourse is of this only Subject,
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. Out of which we have singled Three especial Points,
incident to our present purpose, concerning The Blood of Christ Separated out
of his Body, specified in Romish Histories. The first Separation thereof is
said to be made in the miraculous Apparitions in the Eucharist: The Images and
Relics: The Third of the Blood which issued out of Christ's side at his
Passion; whereof Some parts are also storied to be kept as Relics in diverse
Countries in Christendom.

I. Of that Blood, which is reported to have Miraculously Issued out of
Christ's Body visibly in the Eucharist. Corporal presence in the Sacrament, in
the name of True Blood, and Visible, flowing out of the same Body; and
thereupon the Common and solemn worship given thereunto, wheresoever the
aforesaid Apparitions are recorded to have been. Now enters in your Author
Collius, speaking unto you in an higher strain (in the Margin) than this is;
which we shall render unto you in English. His first General Declamation is
this. Idem Collius Lib. 4. cap. 3. Disp. 9 Cujus ^ures auaire non refugiunt,
sanguinem Christi post gloriosam a motrus Resurrectionem e naturalibus venarum
conceptaculis non semel distractu^ fuisse? imo quis non perhorrescit hoc
intelligere -- cum compertum sit diuturnitate temporis evanescere, seu ut
verius dicam, contabescere id, quod ^b Alense verus sanguis Christi putatur --
Cap. 4. Quanquam possit hoc Deus potenti virtutis imperio, tamen tutissime
videtur asserendum, nunquam spectasse mortales oculos, verum Salvatoris nostri
sanguinem, postquam Triumphator caelos penetravit -- Cap. 5. Sol^^igitur
sententia Thomae tenenda, juxta concordem insignium Theologorum sententiam,
cruorem, ex sacra Synaxi emergentem, non esse ex Christi venis haustum -- Cap.
6. S^ non est verus Christi sanguis ille miraculosus, cujus tandem conditionis
et naturae est? Belluarumne, an hominum potius? number a Deo recenter creatus, an
solummodo Commentitius and fictitius sanguis? -- Si per longa inter valla
durat, verus est sanguis -- Cap 7. Sanguis qui brevissimo tempore, vel in
transcu^u cernitur, non v^us, sed adu^bratus sanguis duntaxat puta^ d^s est.
Whose Ears can abide to hear, the Blood of Christ, now after his glorious
Resurrection, to have been separated out of the natural receptacles of his
veins? Yea, who can without horror think thereof, especially seeing Experience
tells us, that the same Blood, which appeared, did vanish away, putrify, and
corrupt? Wherefore, It will be our safest Resolution, according to the Consent
of TRV^ BLOOD of Christ, since his Triumphant piercing of the Heavens. Hitherto
your public Professor, according herein with Thomas Aquinas (whom he calls
the Angelical Doctor) and with other famous Divines. But presently (whereas
his cited Doctors furthermore Conclude, None of those Apparitions to have been
of any True flesh at all, but only Shadows, and Representations thereof) he
craveth leave to depart from them, affirming it to be, although not the True
flesh of Christ, yet True flesh: and leaves them Miraculous Apparitions; What
True flesh then it might be, Whether the flesh of Be^sts, or of a Man; Whether
newly Created, or Commentitiously obtruded? He answers, yet so, that whereas
your Stories, and all their Reporters and Worshippers of such Apparitions do
equally esteem of All, as being a like Truly flesh; he teaches them to
distinguish of the Apparitions, which are said to have vanished shortly after
their first show, and the other that were of a longer continuance^ and to
acknowledge the Existence of the True flesh, only in

In the last place, opposing against the General Opinion of Thomas, and other
of your choicest Divines (abovementioned) who held these to be merely
Apparitions, without any Substance of flesh, He, albeit granting that a
Fictitious Apparition may be truly Miraculous, yet to make the same Opinion
Ridiculous, breaks out, and inveigheth in this manner; Quo^sunt? ( C. 6.
contra eos qui dicunt tantum fictitum esse sanguinem illum, qui per long a
interva^^a corspicitur. Ide^ Author Collius. Quis sibi persuadere poterit

Who Can persuade himself, that such abundance of l^quor of red color, which
is said to have issued out of So your Doctor, of his supposed Miraculous
Apparitions; Notwithstanding he has no more Foundation either out of
Scripture, or from any Tradition out of the Primitive Church of Christ, for
Mere Accidents without Substance, in that which he says he believes; than he
has in the other which he believes not, but declameth against, as you have
heard.

II. The same Authors Discourse upon the Romish Stories, concerning the
mentioned Relics of Christ's Blood, issued
Whereas Aquinas, with Others, out of many Histories, have approved of many
Apparitions of Blood in great abundance at Mantua, Venice, Rome, and els-where
flowing out of Images: This your Doctor concludes with himself, that Idem

Athanast^ magni, sed alterius Doctoris ejusdem nominis -- quae tamen, si ejus
fuisse dicatur -- tamen unius Sancti Patris authoritas ad r^m tanquam de fide
stabiliendam non sufficient. -- Et approbatio Synodi Nycenae secundae non est
existimanda cadere in totum, ac singulas Istius historiae parts, sed solum
quadrare in historiam perfossae Imaginis, etc. Quod ad Brigittae Revelationem
spectat; etsi sit e^ maximi ponderis, tamen non tan^ tamque efficacis censenda
est, ut ab ea discedere impium ac i^^^ligiosum fuit.
Albeit Some portion of the Blood of Christ might be said to remain on earth,
yet can it not be thought, that EVERY ONE THINKS HIS OWN BEST;) yet could
not so great Quantities of Blood, as filled whole vessels, be said to issue out
of Christ's Body, without some iujury to that perfection of his glorious Body.
And therefore He that shall believe that, let him hear that notable saying of
Solomon, He that is of a sudden Belief, has a light and inconstant heart.]
By occasion of this Question, thus prosecuted, they whether it be a matter of
Faith to believe the Blood, so appearing, to be the Blood of Christ? One side
affirming it to be, grounding themselves, Bulls of the Popes of Rome; upon a
pretended Testimony of Athanasius; and upon the Divine Revelations of Saint
Bridget: On the contrary side, your Doctor qualifieth the Approbations of
Popes; excepteth against the pretended Testimony of Athanasius ( and justly) as
counterfeit; and denies that the Revelation of Saint Bridget can be sufficient
to prove it to be Impious and irreligious, not to believe the contrary.

III. As for the third point, of the Blood of Christ shed at his Passion, we
leave them Id. Disp. 9. cap. 2. An portio aliquas de sanguine effuso in
passione relicta fuerit in orb tertarum? Affirmo, Nihil ejus sanguinis tunc
effusi extra Dominici corporis venas remanfisse. Silvester contrary colligit

skirmishing together; One side affirming, and the other denying, any part of
that Blood to Faith of Others, to believe such and such Apparitions of Christ's
Blood, which they themselves, by their own Reasons, Contradictions, and
Conclusions have made uncredible.

CHAP. III.
That the Romish manser of the Corporal Presence of Christ, in the Sacrament,
is manifoldly Impossible.
NO sooner do you hear Protestants talk of the Impossibility 20 30
of your manner of Presence, which your Church prescribes, but you presently
cry out upon them, as upon Blasphemous Detractors from the Omnipotency of God;
as if they meant Absit ^ut fidelis quispiam aurem accommodet impijs
Sacramentarijs, qui excaecata mente omnipotentiam Christi in hoc Sacramento vel
comprehendere detrectant: quod tanquam pestem lethalem vitae, and intellectum
nostrum in obsequium Christi cap tivare debemus. Theologi Colon. in Provinc.
Cont. Tract. de Sacram. Euch. fol. 92.
To tie God to the rules of Nature, as your Authors are pleased to suggest.

I. That, by the Judgment of ancient Fathers, some things (by reason of
Contradiction in them) may be called Impossible, without the impeachment of the
Omnipotency of God; yea, with the great advancement thereof. SECT. II.
THis Proposition accords to the judgment of ancient Fathers, showing that
Aug. de Civit. lib. 5. cap. 10. Dicitur Deus omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non
faciendo quod non vult: quod si accideret, nequ^quam esset omnipotens: unde
propterea quaedam non potest, quia est omnipotens: non potest mori, non
peccare, non falli. Ambros. lib. 6. Epist. 37. ad Chroma^. Non posse mori, non
infirmitatis est sed virtutis. Chrysostom. in ^ohan. Nihil impotentius quam hoc
posse. Ad^e hereu^to, Theodoret. Dial. 3. cap. 4. Impossibilia sunt Omnipotenti
Deo, (...) Sic posse, esse (...) Nazianz. Orat. 36. -- (...),
God cannot do something, even because he is Omnipotent, as not dye, not
sin, not lie, because such Acts proceed not from power, but from impotencie,
and infirmity.

* Theophylact will explain this Point, in answering this Question, Can God
make that which is once done to have been not done? Theophylact. in Marc. 10.
Nu^quid autem dicunt Deum factum infectum facere non posse? Dicimus Deum esse
veracem: factum autem infectum facere, mendacium est. Quo pacto, quaeso, verax
mendacium fecerit? prius enim perderet naturam suam: Et ideo qui sic loquuntur,
perinde loquuntur, ac si quae^ant, Number potest Deus non esse Deus? vides igitur
quam ridicula sit quaestio.
God is true of his words ( says he) but to make that not to be done, which
has been done, is a Lie. How then can he that is true, Lie? He should sooner
lose his Divine nature. They therefore that speak so, talk as if they should
ask So he. The ancient Father Iustine Iusti^. Martyr. Quaest Grec. Constable. qu.
10. (...)
distinguishes of Impossibilities; One, simple and absolute, which he calls
(...) and the other, which he says is (...): giving for his example, in the
first Impossibility, a Diameter-line in a Figure to be equal unto the sides
thereof. Of the further judgment of the Fathers hereafter. * So the Fathers.

It is not long since you have been taught by an exceeding worthy Scholar,
that in such Cases as imply Contradiction Gods omnipotency to have been
anciently Casaub. Exer^t. 3. ad Baron. An 91 Number. 91. Scitu^ est piorum Patrum:

The Sanctuary of Heretics. And they give an instance in the Arians, who
denying Christ to have been God eternal, believed him to have been created
God in time; as if it were possible there should be a made God, whose property
is to be eternal. Their only pretense was Gods Omnipotency, to make false
things true: wherein they proved Liars. Take unto you a second Proposition.

II. That the Do^trine of the same Impossibiity (by reason of Contradiction)
does magnify the Power of God, by the Universal consent of Romish Doctors;
and their diverse Examples of Impossibility, concerning a Body. SECT. III.
YOur own Jesuits do lay this for a ground: Dicendum, Deum omnia posse
facere, quae ullo modo fiant. Omnes Theologi dicunt, Deum esse omnipotentem,
quia potest ad omne, quod non implicat contradictionem, quae ponit esse and non
esse simul: and proinde si illud fieret, fieret aliquid, cujus esse esset non
esse, etc. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 2.. Alio igitur. Idem. Adversarij
convenient in hoc, id non posse fieri, quod implicat contradictionem. Ibid Ipsa
contradictio co^ sistit in esse, and non esse. Si Deus haberet esse conjunctum
cum non esse, non esset Deu^: Si non esset Deus, non esset Omnipotens. Quare
posse facere quod implicat contradictionem, est Deum posse non esse
omnipotentem Mal^on. Ies. Tom. 1. de. Euch. qu. 1. p. 153. and Perer Ies. in
Genae. 7. initio.
All Divines affirm ( say they) that God is Omnipotent, because he can To
conclude. Every thing either is, or is not: take away this Principle ( say you)
and farewell all learning and knowledge. So you, and that, without
contradiction, most truly.

As your Doctors have taught the truth in Thesi, and Doctrine, so will they
manifest the same in Hypothesi, by Examples of Impossibilities, because of
Contradiction: namely, I. Impossible est Deum posse contineri ancaliquo loco.
Gregorius de Valers Ies. ^ I. Fieri non potest divina virtute, ut spiritus

facta infecta reddere, quis non videt idem esse, ac dicere Deum posse facere,
ut quae vera, non sint vera? Salmeron. Ies. in 2. Tim. 2. Disp. 3.
Impossible for God to be contained in one place. Secondly, for a Spirit to be
divided into parts. Thirdly, for Bread to be the Body of Christ, at the same
instant when it is Bread. Fourthly, for the same thing to be present together
at diverse times. Fifty, for one thing to be twice produced in diverse places at
once. Sixthly, for a Body, having Quantity, not to be able to possess a place.
Seaventhly, It is impossible for Christ his Body, as it is in the Sacrament, to
come from one place into another. Eighthly, Impossible it is to undo that which
is once done; because this were to make that, which is true, to be false.

* Ninthly, IX. Scotus, and qui eum sequuntur, negant idem corpus posse esse in
pluribus locis simul, propter sequens absurdum, quod tunc idem corpus posset
esse vivum in uno loco, and mortuum in alio. Inter quos and Ledesma; Id
impossible esse per absolutam Dei potentiam Henricus, and A^^siodorensis,
propter contradictionem, affirmant. Ibid. cap. 5. X. Minus corpus adaequari
majori, Impossible esse Ibid. cap. 5. XI. Impossible est idem corpus (quamvis
possit esse in pluribus locis quoad extensio^e^ loci) esse tamen eo modo
ubique, quia non potest hoc modo universum ei adaequari. Vasquez in 3. Thom.
qu. 76. (...) 6. Disp. 189.
Impossible for the same Body to be at one time alive in one place, and dead in
another. Tenthly, Impossible for a less Body to be equal to a greater.
Lastly, Impossible for a Body to be in all places. So your Jesuits, with
others. And all these are therefore judged Impossible, Because of
Contradiction. Many Scores of the like confessed Impossibilities might be
extracted out of your own Books, who notwithstanding doubt not to impute
Blasphemy to Protestants, for their affirming but of one Contradiction, and
consequently the Impossibility of the being of a Body in diverse places at
once; albeit it will be found in the after-Discourse to be an Truth.

III. That the Doctrine of Calvin (who is most traduced in this point)
accords to the former Judgment of ancient Fathers. SECT IV.
IT is no new Calumny, which you have against Calvin, as if he had impugned the
Omnipotency of God, in this Question of Calvin himself did refute in his
lifetime, professing, that he is far from subjecting the power of God to man's
reason, or to the order of nature; and believing, that even in this Sacrament
it exceeds all natural principles, that Christ does feed men's souls with
his Blood. But his only Exception is against them, who will impose upon God a
power of Contradiction, which is no better than infirmity it self. Calumni^tur
(Westphalus) a Nobis in dubium vocari Dei omnipotentiam -- at rerum omnium
conversionem fieri posse a Christ^, nos quoque fatemur; verum inde si quae
coel^m, conversum esse in terram coltigat, ridiculus erit veritatis aestimator.
Calv. in Admont. (...) Westphal. -- Rursus. Nos ita addictos rationi humanae
esse jactant, ut nihilo plus tribuamus Dei potentiae quam naturae ordo patitur,
and ^ctat communis sensus. A tam improbis C^lumni^s provoco ad Doctrinam ipsam,
quam tradid^, quae satis dilucide oftendit hoc mysterium minime rationis modo
metiri, nec naturae legibus subijci; obsecro an ex Physicis didicimus Christum
perinde animas nostras ex coelo pascere carne sua quod naturaliter non fieri
omnes dicunt? Dicent; doctrina nostra fidei alis superato mundo, transcendit
coelos. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus, ut corpus idem plura, and diversa loca
occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur? Infane, q^id a Deo postulas, ut carnem
faciat non ^arnem? perinde, ac si instes, ut lucem faciat tenebras -- Convertet
quidem qu^ndo volet lucem in tenebras, and tenebras in lucem; sed quod exigis
ut lux teneb^ae sint, and non differant; quid aliud quam ordinem Sapientiae
pervertis? and eadem est carnis conditio, ut in uno certo loco sit, and sua
dimensione constet. Calv. Instit. lib. 4. c. 17.. 24. item Beza adversus
Hesshufiu^.
We (says he) are not so addicted to natural reason, as to So Calvin, and
Beza accordingly with him.

And so say we, that it is possible for Christ, (as God) if he were so
pleased, to make of Bread an humane Body, as easily as of stones to raise up
Children to Abraham; for there is involved no Contradiction in this. But to
make Bread to be flesh, while it Bread, is a Contradiction in it self, and as
much as to say Bread is no Bread; and therefore, to the honor of the
Omnipotency of Christ, we judge this Saying, properly taken, to be Impossible.

* This Consequence has been (as you have heard) the Universal Asseveration
of your Doctors, to whom, for Conclusion sake, We will add the determination
of another Jesuit; AEgid Co^incks Ies de Sacram qu 76 Art. 3. number 50 Satis est
ad hoc ostendendum, non neg^ndum esse, qu^n Deo sit possibile qui^vis, modo
ostendamus non p^sse co^tra e^^pert^m adferri Contradictionem.
It will be sufficient (says he) for the teaching of Gods Omnipotency that we
deny not but that every thing is possible to him, wherein an evident
Contradiction cannot be shown. So he. In the Interim you may not let slip the
Contradiction of your Doctors in this very place, who confessing it to be no
impeachment of Gods Omnipotency, to hold Every thing Impossible, wherein any
Contradiction is employed; have notwithstanding Calvin and Beza, for denying of
a Possibility of a Corporal Presence, only because of a Contradiction
therein. And so, in making others seem Blasphemous, have shown themselves
slanderous; as we are now to prove in our confutation of the principal
Article of your Romish Church [ The Corporal Presence of Christ in the
Eucharist,] by reason of six more Contradictions involved therein.*

CHAP. IV.
That the Romish Doctrine of the Corporal Presence of Christ in the Sacrament
does, against that which Christ called [CORPVS MEVM, MY BODY] imply six
Contradictions.
The first Romish Contradiction, in making it Borne
THE Catholic Faith has always taught, 20 30
concerning the Body of Christ, That it was borne of the Virgin Mary. Secondly,
that this, so borne, was, and is but One. Thirdly, that this One is Finite.
Fourthly, that this Finite is Organicall, and consisting of distinct parts.
Fifthly, that this Organicall Perfect, and endued with all Absoluteness, that
ever any humane body can be capable of. Sixthly, that this Perfect is now also
Glorious, and no more subject to Vilification, or indignity here on earth. But
your now Romish Doctrine, touching Corporal Presence in this Sacrament, does
imply Contradictions, touching each of these, as now we are to manifest,
beginning at the first.

Our Apostolical Article, concerning the Body of Christ, is expressly this; He
was borne of the Virgin Mary: which is the ancientest Article of Faith,
concerning Christ, that is read of in the Book of God: The seed of the Woman
etc. Genes. 3. to show that it was by propagation. But your Roman Article, of
bringing the Body of Christ into this Sacrament, is, that The substance of
Bread is changed into the substance of Christ's Body, which infers a Body
made of the substance of Bread, as we have already See above Book. 3. Chap. 3..
2. (...)
proved, and as all substantial Conversions do show, whether they be
natural, or miraculous. Air is naturally changed into the substance of Water,
this water is made of Air: when the substance of Water was miraculously
changed into Wine, the substance of the Wine was produced out of the substance
of water: when the Body of Lots Wife was turned into a pillar of salt, the
substance of that salt was made of the substance of her Bodily flesh.


Do you then believe your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, that it is the
substantial Change (by the operative words of Consecration) of Bread into a
Body, which you call the Body of Christ? then is this Body not borne, but made;
nor by Propagation from the Blessed Virgin, but by Production, and
Transubstantiation from Bread: which differences, Borne of the Virgin Mary, and
not borne of the Virgin Mary, are plainly Contradictory, which was the cause
that Augustine (as Bartam. de corpore Domini, page 61. Pon^mus unum testimonium
Augustini, quod dictorum sidem nostrorum ponat, in sermon ad populum: potest
(inquit) animo cujuspiam cogitatio talis oboriri, Dominus noster Jesus Christus

aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur: quod videtur, speci^m habet corporilem, quod

nunc sedet ad dextram Patris, and quid de isto, quod supra Altar ponitur,
sentire debemus: Illud integrum est, neque ulla sectione dividitur, Hoc autem
figura, quia Sacramentum.
Bertram shows) distinguished between the Body borne of the Virgin, Altar,
as between Aliud, and Aliud; one, and another thing. And this Argument has
been fortified Lib. 3. Chap. 3.. 2.
before, and is furthermore confirmed by Saint Augustine Lib. 4. Chap. 7.. 6.
afterward. * Yet for this present the same Author, out of Saint Ambrose, to
the same purpose Bertram. ibid ex Ambrosio. Vera utique caro Christi quae
crucifixa est, vere ergo carnis illius Sacramentum est. Ipse cla^at Dominus
Jesus; Hoc est corpus meum. Hinc Bertram. Quam diligenter, quam prudenter facta
dictincti^, de carne Christi quae crucifixa est? vera itaque caro Christi. At
de illa, quae sumitur in Sacramento, vere illus carnis sacramentum est.
Distinguens Sacramentum carnis a veritate carnis: quam sumpserat de Virgin,
diceret cum crucifixum. Quod vero nunc agitur in Ecclesia mysterium, vere
illius carnis, in quae crucidixus est diceret esse Sacramentum.
observes a distinction used by that Father, between The Flesh of Christ
crucified (and therefore Borne of the Virgin) and the Sacrament of Christ's ]

CHAP. V.
The second Romish Contradiction, to the overthrowing of that which Christ
called [MY BODY:] by making one Body of Christ, not One, but Many. SECT. I.
YOur Profession stands thus: Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3.
The Body of Christ, albeit now in Heaven, yet is (say you) substantially in
many places here on earth, even whersoever the Host is Consecrated. So you.
Next your Master Mr. Brerely in his Book of the Liturgy of the Mass, page
150. Because Calvin Institut. 4. cap. 17.. 10. says: Etsi incredibile videtur,
ut in tanta locorum distantia penetrare ad nos possit Christi caro, ut sit
nobis in cibum, etc.
Brerely labors earnestly to draw Calvin to profess a Possibility of
Christ's Bodily Presence in diverse places at once, contrary to M. Calvin's
plain and express profession in the same Chapter; where he directly confuteth
this Romish Doctrine of Madness, saying thus: The same Calvin in the same Chap
17.. 24. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus ut caro eadem diversa loca occupet, ut
nullo loco contineatur, ut modo, and specie careat? Insane, quid a Deo
postulas, ut carnem simul faciat esse, and non carnem? perinde ac si instes, ut
lucem simul lucem faciat, ac tenebras. Ibid.. 26. Corpus Christi, ex quo
resurrexit, non Aristoteles, sed Spiritus Sanctus finitum esse tradit, and
coelo contineri usque ad ultimum diem. Et.. 30. Cujus ergo amentiae est, coelum
terrae potius miscere, quam non extrahere Christi corpus e coelesti Sanctuario?
To seek, that Christ his Body should be in many places at once, is no less
madness than to require, that God should make his Body to be flesh, and not to
be flesh at one time; whereas not (says he) has taught us, that this his Body
is to be contained in Heaven until the last day. Afterward Calvin,
inveigheth against the folly of your Church, which will not acknowledge any
presence of Christ in this Sacrament, except it be local on earth, As if
(says he) she would pull Christ out of his Sanctuary of Heaven. And at last,
after that he had said, As for the objected sentence he explicateth himself,.
32. Christus illis presens non est, nisi ad nos descendat, qu^si vero si nos ad
se evehat, non aeque ejus potiamur praesentia. E^. 36. Vt Christum illie rite
apprehendant, piae animae in coelum erigantur necelle est. [ As untruly also
does he allege Bucer, Beza, and Farel. page 237. who had the same sense with
Carvin. Mr. Fox said, that Christ if he list might be on earth, but he said
not so of and in the same time.]
Christ his Body is united to the Soul of the Communicant, he so explaineth
himself, that he meant a spiritual Union: so that it does fully appear,
that Master Brerely in this point (as usually in many Calvin's testimony,
against Calvin's sense, and his own conscience.

It is irksome to see the fury, wherewith your Disputers are carried against
Protestants, amongst whom we see again your Master See in the former
Alleg^ition.
Brerely imposing upon Beza the same opinion of the Presence of Christ's Body
in Heaven, and on Earth at one time. Although, notwithstanding, Fi^ri posse, ut
Christi corpus possit esse in plu^ibus locis simul, praet^r hunc Apostatum nemo
inficiatus est, quod cum credere n^luit, tollit ab omnipotenti virtute. Salmer.
Ies. tom. 9. tract. 23. p. 173.
your Jesuit Salmeron as bitterly taxes Beza, for contrarily holding it
Impossible for one Body to be in two places at once; whom therefore he calls
an Apostata: and whom Beza cum Adversarijs congressus, ubi Calvini mysteria non
posset defendere, in eam prorupit Blasphemiam, ut Deum neget omnipotentem:
diserte enim scribit, Deum non posse officere, ut Corpus aliquod, manente
substantia, sit absque loco, vel in pluribus locis simul; Illud enim Angeli
axioma [apud Deum nihil est impossibile] non sine ex^ p^ione accipiendum esse,
quod factum fieri nequit infectum -- O argutos Philosophos! qui Dei Majestatem
ad suas Physicas regulas non erub^scunt revocare. Frateol. Elench. Haeres. lib.
2. Tit. Bezanitae.
another terms, for the same cause, Blasphemous, as if this were indeed to
deny the Omnipotency of God. Whereas, according to our former Proposition, it
is rather to defend it, because God is the God of Truth (which is but one) and
truth is without that Contradiction, which is necessarily employed in your
Doctrine of the Local presence of any one Body in many places at once, as in
the next place is to be evinced.

That the same Second Romish Contradiction, holding the Presence
IN the first place hearken to your Aquinas, (the chiefest Doctor, that ever
possessed the Romish School) Catholici isti cum Thoma in quartum distinct. 14.
art. 2. hanc rationem, cut non possit corpus Christi localiter esse, etc. --
Quod si vero non postic corpus Christi localiter esse in diversis locis, qu^a
divideretur a seipso, profecto nec possit Sacramentaliter esse eadem ratione:
qui licet dicat hoc non esse per loci occupationem, tamen dicit, per realem and
veram praesentiam in plariribus Hostijs, sive Altaribus: quae realis praesentia
in tot Altaribus, and non loc^ intermedijs, non minus tollere videretur
indivisionem rei. Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. page 491. Quidam Catholici,
atque in eis Sanctus Thomas, existimant non posse unum corpus esse simul in
diversis locis localiter; quia (^mquiunt) unum est ill^d, quod indivisum (...)
quocunque alio. Bellar. quo supra.
it is not possible by any Miracle, that the Body of Christ be locally in many
places at once, because it includes a Contradictio, by making it So he,
together with others, whom you call Catholics, who conclude it Impossible for
the Body of Christ to be locally in diverse places at once: * Besides that his
other Sentence wherein he holds this Aquin. in Supplem. in 3. part. qu. 83.
Art. 3. ad 4. Dicendum quod corpus Christi localiter in diversis locis non
potest fieri der miraculum -- quia esse in pluribus locis simul, repugnat
individuo, ratione ejus, quod est En^ individuum in se -- and includit
Contradictionem, sicut quod Homo careat ratione. Et qu. 8^. Art. 2. ad 1.
Corpus non potest actu esse in pluribus locis simul, hoc enim est solius Dei.
Possibility, as proper only to God. Which though he speak concerning the
local manner of Being; yet his Reason (as See the former testimony.
your Cardinal confesses) does as well concern your Sacramental manner of
being on earth, to deny the Body of Christ to be really in many Hoasts, and on
many Altars at once. And Aquinas his reason being this, [ Vnum] One (says he)
is that, but, to be in diverse places at once, does divide one from it self,
and consequently makes it not to be One: which being a Contradiction, does
infer an Impossbility. So he.

* Accordingly your Jesuit Conincks; AEgid Conincks Ies. de Sacram. qu. 75.
Art. 4. Dub. 3. Thomas in 4. Did. 44. qu. 2. Art. ^^ ait, Per miraculum fieri
non posse, ut corpus sit simul in duobus locis, sc. modo quantirativo. [Quia
esse in pluribus locis repugnat Individuo, ratione ejus quod est esse indivisum
per sc.] Sane haec ratio si absolute, n^ sonat, intelligatur, corpus Christi
non potest esse simul in coelo, and in hoc Sacramento.
If, as Thomas says, (says he) a Body cannot be in two places at once
Quantitaetively, no not by any Miracle of God, because the thing should so be
divided from it self: then (the words being taken as they sound) cannot
Christ's Body be at once locally in heaven, and on earth in this Sacrament. So
he. Thus is the maine Article Corporal Presence of Christ in many places at
once, wholly overthrown by the judgment of Thomas Aquinas, the Oracle of your
Romish Shooles. But when as Protestants argue accordingly, as you have done,
your Ies. Vasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 189 Cap 7. Ratio, quae ab Haereticis
affertur, est, Corpus idem, si in diversis locis collocetur, esse divisum a se.
Vasquez spares not to call it the Reason of Heretics. Which bewrays the
distorted and squinteyed sight of our Romish Adversaries, who knowing the same
Argument to be used by your own Aquinas, as well as by Protestants, do
notwithstanding honor the one with the Title of Angelical, and upbraid the
other with the black mark of Heretical.

Earnestly have we sought for some Answer to this insoluble Duplex est
divisio, una intrinseca, in se, altera extrinseca, and accidentalis in respectu
loci. Itaque cum corpus est in diversis locis, non tollitur indivisio in se,
sed extrinseca, in respectu loci, ut cum Deus sit unus, est in diversis locis,
and anima rationalis est in diversis partibus corporis una. Bellar. ibid.
Being in a place is not the essential property of a thing, and therefore can
be no more said to divide the Body from it self, than it can be said to divide
God, who is every where, or the soul of man, which is one in every part, or
member of the Body. So he. We throughout this whole Tractate, wherein we
dispute of the Existence of a Body in a Place, do not tie our selves every
where to the precise Acception of place, as it is defined to be Superficies,
etc. but as it signifies one space or distinct Vbi, from another, which we
call

CHALLENGE.
AN answer you have heard from your Cardinal, unworthy any man of Judgment,
because of a Triple falsity therein. First in the Antecedent, and Assertion,
saying that Being in a Place or space is not inseparable from a Body. Secondly,
in the Ground of that, because Place is not of the Essence of a Body.
Heterogenies. Contrary to this Assertion, we have already proved the necessity
of the Local Being of a Body, wheresoever it is; and now we confirm it, by
the Assertion of One, than whom the latter Age of the World has not
acknowledged any more accurate, and accomplished with Philosophical learning;
even Si dicas, corpus est hic, and ibi idem, ipsum quidem distrahas in diversa:
principio ptimo per se, and immediato prohibetur corpus esse in pluribus ubi:
est autem continuitas affectus consequens immediate unitatem; Contradictiones
enim sunt. Julius Scalliger Exercit. 5. quaest. 6. [ For how can there he.
Continuity in that 5. the Termi^i whereof are separated by diverse places?]
Julius Scaliger by name, (a Professed Romanist) who has concluded, as a
Principle infallible, that Continuity being an immediate affection and property
of Unity, One Body cannot be said to be in two places, So he. Certainly,
because Place being the Terminus (to wit that, which does confine the Body that
is in it) it is no more possible for the Body to be in many places at once,
than it is for an Unity to be a multitude, or many. Which truth, if that you
should need any further proof, may seem to be confirmed in this, that your
Disputers are driven to so miserable Straits, as that they are not able to
instance in any one thing in the world to exemplify a Possibility of the being
of a Body in diverse places at once, but only Man's soul, which is a spirit;
and God himself, the Spirit of Spirits, of both which See below Ch ^.. 2. and
(...). 2.
hereafter. Only you are to observe, that the Cardinals Argument, in proving
Space to be separable from a Body, because it is not of the Essence of a Body,
is, in it self, a Non sequitur, as may appear in the Adjunct of Time: which
although it be not of the Essence of any thing, yet is it impossible for any
thing to be

*And for the better discovery of the weakness of this their common
Objection, We add, that although [ Vbi,] Place, or Space be not of the
essence of a Body, to constitute it one, yet may it be sufficient to
demonstrate it to be but one Body, because of Contradiction; as well as all
proper (...), or properties, as Risibility in a man; or else as Quantity to a
Body, and Circumscription to Quantity; which although they be after their
Substances in nature, yet are they jointly and inseparably with them in Times.
But that Body of Christ to be Local, according to the dimensions of Place; and
not Local, according to the dimensions of Place, at one time, implies a
Contradiction. But you teach the same Body of Christ to be at once (as ^n
heaven) Local, according to the dimensions of Place; and (as on the Altar) not
Local, according to the dimensions of Place. Therefore is your Romish Doctrine
Contradictorie to it self. Yet shall we be content that you may call this a
Sophistical Argument, except the Ancient Fathers shall establish the same
Extra se, without it self; but for a Body, being here, to be at the same time
separated from Here, by a Space where it is not, as on this Altar, and on the
other Altar, and yet not to be in the Space between, is to be without it
self; and Consequently divides it self from it self; which no man will
affirm, that is not beside himself.

The same Second Romish Contradiction manifested in Scripture,
M Atth. 28. 6. The Angel speaking to the woman that sought Christ in the
grave, said; He is not here, for he is risen, and gone into Galilee: which is
as much, as to have said, he could not be in Both places at once; an Argument
Angelical. But you Answer that it was spoken Morally. How? (we beseech you)
as if one should say (says your Loquitur ad mentem sanctarum illarum mulierum
-- Sed optima est solutio, moraliter intel ligi, ut si quis dicat, talis homo
non sedet ad mensam, coenatus est enim. Bellar. li. 3. de Eu h. c. 4.
Cardinal) Such a man sits not at table, for he has supped. What fond
trifling is this, and wilful perverting the Truth of God? for this your
Argument, A man sits not at table, for he has supped, is scarce a probable
Consequence, that a man is risen from the table, as soon as he has supped.
Contrarily, the Angel's Logike is not by a Peradventure, but necessary; not
imaginary, but historical; not conjecturall, but dogmaticall, and
Demonstrative. *And so Saint Chrysostom. [Venite and inspicite ubi positus erat]
(...) upon the words of the Evangelist.
* Chrysostom does call it. For better explanation whereof, we may turn the
Causall word Illative [THEREFORE, ] because it is all one (as you know) to say
he is not here in the Grave [For ^hee is risen out of the Grave; And to say,
He is risen out of the Grave, [Therefore] he is not here in the Grave.

Understand then, first, that the matter subject of this Argument being no
moral arbritrary Act of man's will; but the omnipotent Resurrection of Christ
from the dead, (which is a fundamental Article of Christian Faith, yea, and as
it were the foundation of all other Articles, without which, as the Apostle
says, 1 Cor. 15. 14.
Our Faith were vain) the Angel must necessarily Come, and see the place,
where the Lord was laid. Which he adds (says your Videli. ad Comprobandum
dictum. [Non est hic.] Salmer. Ies. Tom. 11. Tract. 9. page 72.
Jesuit) for confirmation of that, which he had said, [Hee is not here.] and
Seeking by their sight (says also another Maldonat. Ies. in eum locum. Nunc
experientia confirmat, and ipso visu nititur fidem facere.
Jesuit) to make them believe. *And as much as if he had said, (says Quasi
dicat, si verbo non credatis, vacuo sepulchro credatis. Anselm.
Anselme) If you believe not my word, give credit to the empty Sepulcher, in
satisfying your own sight. Therefore was it demonstrative. And again, the
Angel putting them to make use both of his Saving, and their own Seeing; Go
ye (says he) and tell his Disciples: And they went (says the Text) to bring
his Disciples word. Therefore was his Argument Doctrinall, such whereby he
thought so fully to persuade them, that they might inform others in an
Infallible Truth.

*One of your Doctors of Lovain published a Book entitled, A Confutation of
Cavillations, wherein he Marcus Constant. Theol. Lovan. lib. qui inscribitur;
Confutatio Cavillationum, quibus Sacramentum Eu^h impeti solet. Ad ob. 6.
[Surrexit, non est hic.] Respondet Catholicus, quae est haec Consecutio? non
est hic, ergo non est in Sacramento? -- adeone illi inepti, ut id colligant,
non est hic, ergo non potest hic esse? Arundimea sunt haec, and flaccida tela,
quae librata non pertingant quo intenduntur.
propounds the Argument of Protestants, as if it stood simply thus: The
Angel said of Christ, now risen out of the grave, He is risen, he is not
here: Therefore he cannot And thereupon calls them Absurd: when as they
argue from the Angels own Logical term, [ For] in the Text, Matthew. 28. 6.
He is not here, [For] he is risen. Implying the Consequence, which you have
heard, that he could not be both Risen out of the Grave, and In the Grave, at
the same time of the Angels speech. But the Causall word, [ For] your Doctor
omitted quite, that he might more easily impose upon them an Absurdity of his
own devising. Thus have you been confuted by an Argument both Angelical and
Evangelicall.*

That the Romish Objection out of that Scripture, Act. 9. is frivolous.
CHrist ( Act. 9.) appeared to Saint Paul, then Saul, when he was in his way
to Damascus, etc. whence your Cardinal Simul in summo (...), and in ^e^re
vieu^ terrae. Bellar^ll. 3. de E^ch. c. 3.. Secundum, etc.
labors to prove a double presence of Christ, at one instant, (to wit) in
Heaven with the Saints, and in the Air unto Saul. First, because the light in
the Air Struck Saul blind. Secondly, because others in the company of Saul
heard not the same voice of Christ, which he heard. Thirdly, because Saul
asked saying; Lord, who art thou? and heard, and understood the voice.
Fourthly, Because Saul was thereby made a Christ risen from the dead. And
therefore (says he) was this Apparition in the Air. Every objection may
receive it is opposition. To the first, thus: Did none of you ever know a man's
eyes so dazzled with the brightness of the Sunbeams on earth, that he could
not see for a while; and yet did not the Sun remove any whit from his Sphere?
So might the glorious shine of the person of Christ in Heaven work upon Saul
on earth.

John 12. 29. which some heard articulately, and said, An Angel speaks, and
the common people said, It thundreth? because (as your Tolet. Ies. in cum locum.
Jesuit confesses) they heard it but confusedly.

To the third, thus: Men hear, and hear not, so far as God is pleased to
reveal, or not to reveal himself, or his word, and voice, yea or any sight
unto them; for Saint Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Majesty of Christ,
when others wanted that sight.

To the fourth, thus: The eyes of Saul beholding Christ in Heaven might be as
good witnesses of Christ his Resurrection, as were the eyes of Saint Stephen,
Acts 7. who saw him; and so blind by the brightness of that sight of Christ,
and after healed in the Name of Christ.

If any desire to know the judgment of ancient Fathers, in this Case, your
Cardinal leaves him to seek it where he shall please. Sure we are that Aug.
in Psalm. 54. and Tract. 1 in Job. Caput in coelis, cujus membra calcabantur in
terra.
Augustine, Ambros^^ 1. Cor. 15. Appatuit e^ primo in coelo.

aliocurus.
Gregory the first, and Isil. Pelus^ lib. 1. Epist. 409 (...) E^ Pheophylact.
in Act. 9 (...) etc.
Isidore Pelusiota do expressly affirm that the appearance of Christ to Saint
Paul was [ De Coelo] from Heaven. *And lest that any fondly, by the word,
Heaven, conceiving any inferior heaven, may catch at the Moon; you may
observe that the Fathers understood that Heaven, wherein Christ is said to sit
at the right hand of God; and that, whereby the Doctrine of Christ is entitled
Celestial, and Heavenly. *And if all this were true that has been objected,
that Christ appeared in the Air, yet is your Consequence but lame, that
therefore he was bodily also in Heaven, if we may believe your Jesuit
Lorinus: Potuit tantisper de coelo descendisse. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 9. * And
Pelufiota already, at the letter
Because Christ (says he) might for so short a time have descended from
Heaven. By all which you may perceive, that your Cardinal, for all Air, has
been (as the Proverb is) but Beating the Air.

*And lest that any of you might Object that of Acts 23. ver. 11. The next
night the Lord (Christ) said (unto Paul) Bethou constant, etc. as spoken by
Christ, being Corporally there present, when as notwithstanding he was also
resident in Heaven, one of your own Jesuits Lorinus Ies. Com. in Act. 23. 11.
Non audeo de omnibus aepparitionibus affirmare, factas immediate esse a Christo
ipso, cum Posset Angelus apparere pro Christo.
Not daring (as he says of himself) to affirm all such like Apparitions to
have been immediately by Christ himself, will have you to know that they
might have been performed by some Angel, in the person of Christ.*

And as lanke and frivolous is his Confirmation of their Assertion by (as he
says) Apparitions of Christ unto diverse here on earth, when as yet he was
certainly in Heaven: for it is not certain, that he appeared personally to any
here on earth, if the position of your Angelical Doctor Aquinas may stand for
good, who held it See above, c. 2.. 3.
Impossible for Christ to appear here on earth, in his proper shape, in two
places at once: which shows that these Apparitions of Christ were rather
only Visions, without any personal appearing. We are not ignorant how much
you Bellarmine, whom you have heard contending so urgently for proof of the
visible Presence of Christ in diverse places at once; and what like Esteem you
have of your great Professor Suarez, who now comes Concluding as follows.
Concludo, Christi corpus tantum esse in coelo and in Eucharistia; seclusoque

where but only in Heaven: and to affirm the contrary were a great rashness
without ground; and contrary to all Divines. So he. We leave these your two
most eminent Doctors of the Chair, and both of the same Society of the
Jesuits, the one for Rome, the other for Spain, in this

Stories, which are alleged by Bellarmine of bodily Apparitions


answered: otherwise they well know that the Fathers meant an absolute
Impossibility; and that this is most evident by the Heresy which they did
impugn, and also by their manner of confuting the same.

The Eutychian Heretics (you Alfons. de Cast. cont. haeres Eutych.
know) confounded the Properties of Christ's humane nature with his Godhead,
pretending (as you do) the Omnipotency of Christ, for the patronizing of their
Heresy, As thinking thereby (thus says Theod. Dial. 2. Dicunt Christi carnem
spiritualem, and alterius substantiae quam sit nostra caro: imaginantur se per
haec Deum magnifacere, cum tamen falsi veritatem accusant.
Theodoret, out of Amphilochius) to magnify the Lord Christ: whereas this was
indeed (as the same Father says) to accuse Truth of falsehood. You may hear
the same voice sound out of the Roman Chair. Leo Papa. Ep. 13. quae est ad
Pulcher. Aug. Subrepsisse intelligo spiritum falsitatis, ut dum affirmat se
religiosius de filij Dei majestate sentire, si ei naturae nostrae veritatem
inesse non dicat, etc.
Leo speaking of Eutyches, the Author of that Heresy, says that He affirmed,
that thereby he did more religiously conceive of the Majesty of Christ, by
denying his humane nature; whom therefore that holy Pope censureth to have
been seduced by the Spirit of falsity. Therefore it cannot be but that the
Fathers, in confuting an Heresy founded upon a pretense of Omnipotency, did
hold that doctrine absolutely impossible, which they withstood, as will now
more lively appear by the Testimonies of themselves. Theodoret against this
Heretic argues thus: Theod. Dial. 3. lib. 3. ex Eusebius Emis. (Contra eos qui
dicunt Corpus Christi in Divinitate mutatum esse post resurrectionem) Hos
dicere necesse est vel divinae naturae manus and pedes, and alias corporis
parts tributas esse, vel fateri corpus manfisse in suae naturae finibus. Atqui
divina natura simplex est and incomposita, corpus autem compositum, and in
multas parts divisum: non est ergo mutatum in naturam divinitatis, and quidem
immortale ^actum, and divina natura plenum: sed tamen corpus, quod propriam
habet C^cumscriptionem.
The Body of Christ, being a compounded thing, cannot be changed into This had
bin no good reasoning, except his CANNOT had imported an absolute
Impossibility. *And this Eranistes Heret. (...), Ex lob. Theod. opponit
Ex^mplum impossibilium: (...) Theodoret: Dial. 3. Cap 4. -- Et paulo post;
(...). -- (...).
Theodoret himself does furthermore make good, who in the same Dialogue, where
(to the Heretics Objection out of Job, saying, I know thou can do all
things, nothing is impossible with thee) he answers, by instancing in
examples of Impossibility, because of Contradiction, saying; It is impossible
for eternity to be in time, or a thing created to be uncreated: or finite to be
infinite. So he.*

Vizil. lib. 4 cont. Eutych. Circumscribitur loco per naturam carnis suae, and
loco non capitur per n^turam divinitatis suae, Haec fides est confessio
Catholica, quam Apostoli tradiderunt, Martyrs roboraverunt, and fideles nunc
usque custodiunt. Et paulo superius. Quia nunc in Coelo est, non est utique in
terra.
Vigilius (anciently Bishop of Trent) might have read a Lesson to the late
Bishops at Trent, who against the same Heretic, distinguishing the two natures
of Christ, his Humane nature, by being Circumscribed in one place; the Divine,
by being unlocable, doubted not to infer, saying of his Bodily nature; It
being now in heaven is not at all on earth. And, lest that any might think
this was but his own private opinion, he averreth saying; This is the
Catholic profession taught by the Apostles, confirmed by Martyrs, and hitherto
held of the Faithful. So Fulgentius saying of his Bodily substance, that
therefore Fulgent. de persona Christi ad Trasimund lib. 2. cap 5. Vnus idemque
homo localis ex hom^ne; qui est Deus immensus ex Patie. Vnus idemque secundum
human^m substantiam absens caelo, cum esset in terra; and derelinquens terram,
cum ascendisset in coelum.
Being on Earth, it was absent from Heaven; and going to Heaven, it left the
Earth. Damascea had to deal with the forenamed Heretic, and professing to
deliver the substantial difference of both Natures, he differenceth them by
these contrary Characters, Damascen. de fide Orthodoxi, lib 3. cap. 3. E^rum
naturarum, (...) ast^umus salvari: nam c^eatum mansit creatum; increat^^,
increatum: morrale ^maneb^t mortale; immortale, immortale: (...) * Paulo
su^erius (...).
Created, not Created; Capable of mortality, and not Capable of mortality;
Circumscribed, and not Circumscribed; and Invisible in it self, and Visible:
which notwithstanding is, in the Eucharist, by your doctrine, no^ Capable of
Circumscription, whole in the whole Host, and in every part thereof, and to
the very Angels of God Invisible.

*And yet again, that you may further know that Damiscen is as professedly
ours, in this point, as any Protestant can be; he, in confutation of the same
Heretic, adds saying; How can one and the same Nature be capable at once of
two essential contrary Differences? for how is it possible for the same
Nature, according to the same, to be created, and uncreated mortal, and
immorall; circumscribed, and uncircumscribed? Where, by the way, you may
observe, that Circumscription of a Body is accounted by Damascen to be [(...)
that is] Essential to a Body. In like manner Ephraemius (in Phot^us) sticks
to the same Argument of difference of natures, by reason of Contradiction,
saying concerning the two distinct natures of Christ? That none that has wit
can say, that the same Nature is both palpable and impalpable; visible and
Invisible. *

Let us ascend hither to the more primitive Ages, to inquire of Fathers, who
had conflict; also with Heretics, who gainesaid the Truth of either Nature.
Athanasius urged Christ his Athanas. (...). 2. Adversus eos q. trullum nos
miraculum (...), eo quod car^em negant: (...) -- (...)
Vnd^^rminate in place, and uncircumscribed; even then, when it was
Hyphstatically united with the Body, being on earth^. Therefore it was his Body
that ascended into Heaven from Earth. His Argument is taken from
Circumscription; even as I Nazian Epist. 1. id Cled^^ Hominem and (...) (...).
Nazianzen also does Characterize them.

Cyril of Alaxandria is a Father, whose Patronage your Disputers would be
thought often to rely upon; he is now about Heretics, who held that God's
nature is a Substance, which can received vision and partition. If God (says
Cyril. Alex, Tom. 2. lib. de T. inir Si vere S^ chohem and Partitionem, Divini
nature, (ut (...) dicunt) reciperet, and intelligeretur, ut corpus: si autem
hoc, and in loco om^^no and li quanta facta esset, non effugeret Circumscrip^^
fol. 89.
Cyril) should be divisible, as a Body, then should it be contained in place,
and then should it have Quantity, and having Quantity it could not but be
Circumscribed. Will you now say (which hitherto has been your only Answer to
other Fathers) that Cyril meant not that it was absolutely Impossible, that
Quantity should be without Circumscription, but only according to the Course
of nature? then might the Heretics, whom Cyril confuted, have made the same
Answer, and consequently Cyril's Consequence, and Confutation (together with
the Arguments of the Fathers abovementioned) had been of no force. What shall
we say? must still the ancient Fathers be made no better than Asses, in
arguing, that your Romish Masters (forsooth) may be deemed the only Doctors,
Heretics, which they devise for themselves? but you must pardon us, if we
believe that Cyril (seeing he durst say, that God himself, if he were a Body,
must be in a place, as a thing having Quantity, and Circumscribed) would have
abhorred your now Romish Faith of believing See hereafter, Chap. 3. Sect. 3.
Christ's Body consisting of Quantity, albeit not Circumscribed in place.

*The Arguments, which we receive from these Fathers, in Confutation of your
Romish Faith, of believing the same Humane Body of Christ, Circumscribed in
Heaven, and Uncircumcised are Two. The first is their denying the Possibility
of Christ's Body to be Uncircumcised, and that upon two grounds: One, because
Circumscription is Essential, and as Proper to Christ's Body, as
Vncircumscription is Proper to his Divine Nature; without which Difference
there should follow a Confusion of his two Different natures, which was the
very same Heresy which they impugned. Their second ground is from the
infallible Rule of Contradiction, being the extremest Degree of Impossibility
that can be imagined; namely, For mortal, and immortal; palpable, and
impalpable. And yet your Fathers of the Council of Trent, in their wisdoms,
have Canonized it for an Article of your Faith, by teaching a palpable, and
Circumscriptive Body of Christ in Heaven, and impalpable, and Vncircumscriptive
on Earth. It might be held a kind of Impiety not to consult with Saint
Augustine, in a Question of this moment.

The Judgment of Saint Augustine, styled by learned Doctors, First, giving
this Caution, viz. Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan: where after this Coveat,
[Cavendum ne ita Divinitatem affirmamus, ut corporis veritatem auferamus:] he
has these words. Spatia locotum toll corpotibus, and nusqua^ erunt; and quia
nusquam erunt, nec erunt. Idem. Tract. 31. in toh. Homo secundum corpus in loco
est, and de loco migrat, and cum ad alium locum venerit, in eo loco, unde
venit, non est: Deus autem implet omnia; ubique totus, nec secundum spatia
tenetur locis; erat tamen Christus secundum visibilem carnem i^ terra, secundum
invisibilem majestatem in coelo, and in terra.
To take heed lest we s^ establish Christ's Deity, that we destroy not the
truth of his Body; He afterward concludes against the Impossibility of a
Body uncircumscribed, saying, Take away Space of Place from Bodies, and then
shall they be nowhere; and if they be nowhere, then must they be no-what,
having no Being at all. Secondly, where he concludes, that Christ, according
to his Visible flesh, was on earth, when according to his Invisible Majesty,
He was both in Heaven and Earth; he laid this Ground thereof, to wit, that A
Body removing from one place to another, is not in that place from whence it
came. But our He ascended from Earth to Heaven:] And therefore by Saint
Augustine his Argument, He was not then on Earth. In the third place,
Discussing the Difference of the two Natures of Christ more fully, in respect
of Presence in Place, for the reconciling of a Seeming Contradiction of Christ's
words, saying in one place, [ I am with you unto the Ends of the World,] and
another place saying, [ You shall not have me always with you,] he assoyleth
the Difficulty, by Differencing Christ's Natures. Aug. Tract. 50. in ^oh.
[Pauperes semper habebitis vobiscu^, me autem non semper habebitis] Potest sic
intelligi* -- Accipiant and hoc boni, sed non sint soliciti, loquebatur emi^ de
praesentia corpo^^s sui. Nam secundu^ majestatem suam, secundum providenuam,
secundum inessabilem, and invisibilem gratiam impletur ab eo quod d^ctum est;
[Ecce ego vobiscum sum usque ad consummationem seculi:] secundum autem ^d quod
de Virgin natus est, quodque in Resurrectione mani^estatus est, non semper
habebitis vobiscum. Quare? Quoni^m conversatus secund^ corporis p^aesentiam
quadraginta diebus cum discipuli^ suis, and eis videntibus ascendit in coesum,
and non est hic. Ibi est enim, sedet ad dextrim Patris: and hic est, non enim
reces^^^* praesentia majestatis. Secundum praesentiam carnis. Ec. lesia modo
side ten^^, oculis non videt.
In that Christ said (says he) [ You shall not have me always with you, ]
he spoke it of the Presence of his Body; But in saying, [I am with you until
the Consummation of the World,] he spoke it of his (Divine) Majesty,
Providence, and Invisible grace. But according to that (nature) which was borne
of the Virgin, and after was manifested in the Resurrection, [You shall not
have me always with you.] So he.

Your sole Answer, in the Judgment of your choycest Divines, delivered by your
Cardinal, is this; Bellarm. l. 1. de Euchdr. cap. 14.. Denique -- Augustinus
intelligit corporis Christi praesentiam visibilem, more humano inter homines
conversantis: atque ita se explicat Quare? quia conversatus est secundum
corporis praesentiam quadraginta dies, ipsis viden^ibus, modo side renet,
o^ulis non videt.
that S. Augustine [in denying that Christ is always with us, according to the
presence of his Bodie] understood a visible presence which he collecteth from
that which follows in the speech of Saint Augustine, That Christ was seen of
the Apostles in his Bodily presence after his Resurrection, and as his
Assension: But now (says S. Augustine) We see him by Faith, and not with our
eyes. So your Cardinal. Which is as raw and extravagant a Collection, and
repugnant to the meaning of Saint Augustine, as can be. Because the whole scope
of Saint Augustine is to show the Excellency of Christ's Divine Nature, in
respect of the Humane, in regard of Presence it self, and not of visibilitie,
or any manner of Presence; Because the Divine nature, by it is Omnipresency, is
always with us, but the other, which was seen after his Visible Conversation
upon Earth, was seen to ascend into Heaven. He inforceth directly from hence,
therefore It is not here on Earth, (Thus;) It ascended into Heaven, and is not
here, for he there sits at the right hand of God. But as for the Presence
of his Majesty (which signifies his Deity) It is here (says Saint Augustine)
and not departed from us: which is a manifest Distinguishing of the Deity, and
Humanity of Christ, merely, in respect of, Hic est, and Non hic est, that is,
Presence of the one, and Not-Presence of the other. As also between, Recessit,
and Non-Recessit, in like Difference; whereas if according to the Popish Faith,
the Distinction held only in respect of the Visibilitie, or Invisibilitie of
Presence, (you always teaching that Christ's Body is substantially Present on
Earth, Invisibly in the Eucharist) then (in respect of the manner of Presence by
Because Saint Aug. calls the presence of his majesty and grace, Invisible.
^re the Testimony above cited.
Invisibilitie) there should be no Prerogative of Difference between Divine,
and Bodily Being on Earth; against the Conclusive Determination of Saint
Augustine in this place* Which is also confirmed, by that which is further
objected in opposition against us, out of the last words of Saint Augustine:
The Church (says he) Sees not him with her eyes* but holds him by Faith;
namely by believing the Presence of his Body; But where? to wit, Sitting at the
right hand of God (says he;) but not in the Pix, or on the Altar.

The next Testimony of this Father may be that his Malling and braining of the
Heretical Manichees, who held a Bodily Sun and Moon at once; He making a
flat Contrary Conclusion: ( Aug. contra Faust Manich. l. 20. cap. 11. Secundum
praesentiam spirituasem nullo modo (...) pari posset; secundum vero praesentiam
corporalem, simul and in sole, and in luna, and in qu^^ esse non posset.
Christ's Bodily Presence could not (says he) be in the Sun and Moon at
once. Yes, will the Romish Answer; Miraculously it may. God a mercy Papist
would the Heretic have said; for I likewise, when I said it was in the Sun
and Moon at once, was not such a Lunatic, as to think it could be naturally
so, and without a Miracle. The same holy Father, that he might show himself
constant to his own Tene^, explaining the words of Christ [ You have heard
that I said, I go and come (says he) according to that, wherein he was man,
in one place: and he remained with them as God, and in all places* still
opposing the Nature of Man and God, according to the Different Presences of,
One-where, and All-wheres. More Testimonies for proof of this one point there
needs not. *

CHALLENGE.
THese so many and manifest proofs of the ancient Fathers, Impossibility of
Existence of a Body without Determination in one place; may be unto us a full
Demonstration that they were Adversaries to your Romish Doctrine of Corporal
Presence, and that all your Objections, out of them, are but so many forged,
and forced Illusions. * Only be it known unto you, that in this whole
Discourse the word, Circumscription in place, is used, in a large Acception,
for every limitation of a Body in a space, or Vbi, adequate unto the thing
Circumscribed. *

We conclude. If Christ himself gave a Caveat, not to believe such Spirits as
should say of his Bodily presence in this world, after his Resurrection; Mat.
24 23.
Behold here is Christ, and behold there is Christ: then, doubtless, much
less credit is to be given to your Church, which teaches and professes an
Here is Christ, and a There is Christ, in the same instant; as we shall
furthermore confirm by like verdict of Antiquity, See Cap. 6.. 3.
Angels, and all Created Spirits are finite Creatures, and not Gods, even
because they are contained in one place: and also that the Chap 6.. 2.
Holy Ghost is God, and no finite Creature, because it is in diverse places at
once. But we must handle our matters in order.

That the Romish Doctors (in their Objections) have no solid proof of the
Existence of one Body in diverse places
IT is a kind of Morosity and Perverseness in our Opposites, to object those
Testimonies, which have their Answers, as it were tongues in their mouths,
ready to confute their Objections. For Chrysostom. li 3. de Sacerdo^^; O
miraculum! O Dei benignitatem! qui cum patre su^^t^ sedet, and eodem tempore
omniu^ manibus pertractatur. Obijcit. Bellar. lib 2. le Euch. cap. 22 [ Not
considering what went before (...) words, in the sau^e place, where ^hrysost^^
will not have his heart believe, that the Priest and people ^^^taking do no^
[in tertis consi^st sed ponus in coelum transferr^ then follows, O miracul^^,
etc. -- ad^st enim Sacerdos non ignem gestans, sed Spiritum Sanctum.
Chrysostom says not more plainly, o Miracle, that Christ, at one and the
same time, sitting with his Father than he does say of the Priest and People
Communicating, o Miracle, that They do not consist or stay on earth, but are
transported into Heaven. And again, a little after the words objected, The
Priest (says he) is here present, not carrying the fire, but the Holy Ghost.
These and the like Sayings of Chrysostom do verify the Censure of your See
Book 3. Chap. 4.. 6.
Senensis upon him, that he was most frequent in figurative Amplifications,
and Hyperbole's. Another Objection is commonly made out of Chrysostom. ad ^^ulum
Antioch. hom. 2. Helisaeus M^^lotem accepit (Heliae) erat postha^c duplex
Elias, sursum Eliais, deorsum Elias. Then applying this to the Sacrament;
Helias nempe melotem Discipulis ^uis reliquit: filius autem Dei ascendens nobis
carnem (...): sed Elias quidem ex^tus, Christus autem and ipsam nobis reliquits
and ipsam ascendens habuit.
Chrysostom, of a Double Elias, one above, and another Elias below, the
sheepe-skin, or Mantle of Elias, received by Helisaeus) namely, that Christ
ascending into Heaven, in his own flesh, left the same, but as Elias did his
Mantle, being called the other Elias, to wit, figuratively: so the Sacrament, a
token of Christ's flesh, is called his flesh. Which must needs be a true
Answer, unless you will have Chrysostom to have properly conceited, as a
Double Elias, so Consequently a Double Christ.

* And if you be not yet sufficiently acquainted with the style of Chrysostom,
take unto you another Saying of his, wherein he introduces Christ, as
speaking to every good Christian, and saying Chrysostom. ad pop. Antioch. Hom. 55
Manduca me, and te sursum haben, and deorsum tibi connector.
Eat thou me, I have thee here above, and am annexed to thee there below. So
he. Do you understand those words, as you did his Eating Christ's Body here on
earth, is corporally present with Christ in Heaven. But do you grant it to be
figuratively meant? then must you confess, that the Conjunction, spoken of by
Chrysostom, is not Corporal, but a Spiritual, and a Mystical Communication.
So then Chrysostom, speaking of a Sacrament, used a Sacramental style, to
call the Sacrament of Christ's Body, the Body or flesh of Christ; even as
Christ (according to the Interpretation of Ancient Bread his Body, as being a
Sign and Sacrament of his Body, after the usall term of Scripture in other
Sacraments also. (All which have been largely shown throughout the Second
Book). No marvel therefore, if, granting that Christ taking his Flesh
Personally with him into Heaven, which he left Sacramentally here on Earth;
you deny, notwithstanding, that Elias, by leaving his Mantle, left not
himself, because his Mantle was not a Sacrament of himself. *

As for the next Testimony, it is no more than which every it is the same
whole, and undivided Christ, which is spiritually received of all Christians,
wheresoever, and whenever throughout the world: the same we say Objectively,
although not Subjectively; as the Sixth Book, Chap. 6. and Sect. 3. will
demonstrate. *And furthermore understand, that the Fathers, speaking of the
Eucharist, and calling it The Body of Christ: and of the Fragments, Bitts, and
Pieces thereof; yet, in your own construction, do mean Sacramentally, that
is, Figuratively.

Your Jesuit M^. Fisher Ies. ^ his Answer to K James in hu^ tract. of
Transubstant.. 4. in ^ish Whites Reply. Greg. Nyster. Orat. de Paschate. Sicut
Divinitas replet mundum, and tamen una estata m^umerabilibus locis of fertur,
et tamen unum corpus est. [And the same is objected by Mr. Brerely Tract. of
the Mass* 1.. 4. Subd. 1. page 149.
Master Fisher would think it a sleighting of him, if his Testimony might not
be heard. What marvel (says he) that Imagination fail us to apprehend the
multiplied presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, which is Spiritual,
Angelical, Supernatural, comparable with the Divine? whereof Gregory Nyssen
sticks not to say; As Deity fills the World, and yet is One, so the Body of
Christ is but One, and is offered in all places. So he. Our Answer, in brief,
is that Master Fisher sticks not to abuse both the Credulity of his Reader,
to make him believe that which is not; and his own Conscience, to seem to
believe that which he believes not; (namely, that there is an Omnipresencie
of Christ's Body) as also his Adversaries patience, to occasion him to seek
that which is not to be found in the place alleged, or yet in any of the
Orations of Gregory If any such Sentence had been extant in any Book of
Gregory Nyssene, or else of any Primitive Father, o how every one of your
Romish Disputers would have embraced it, and still harped upon it; especially
it making so evidently for that, which your Jesuit urges, The multiplied
Presence of Christ's Body. But it is no news with us, to be dealt with
deceiptfully, and unconscionably, by your Romish Dispuputers. *


AVgustine in expounding the 33. Psalm, and falling upon a Translation, where
the words 1. Sam, 21. are these (by interpretation) He carried himself in his
own hands; Aug. Tom. 8. in Psalm 33. Conc. 1. [Esserebatur in manibus. ejus.]
Hoc quomodo possit fieri in homine, quis intelligat? manibus alienis portatur
quis, suis autem nemo portatur. Quomodo intelligatur de Davide secundum literam
non invenimus: in Christo autem invenimus, quando commendans ipsum corpus suum,
ait, [Hoc est corpus meum:] ferebat enim corpus in manibus suis, etc.
says that these words could not be understood of David, or Quomodo fieri
potest?] (says he) How could that be, etc. And therefore expounds them as
meant of Christ, at what time he said of the Eucharist, [ This is my Body.]
This is the Testimony which not only your Obijcit Bellar. Vox [Quodammodo]
Signi, non propria spetie, sed aliena, nec modo usitato, sed extraordinary:
satis est, quod non figurate significatur Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24.
Cardinal, but all other your Disputers, upon this subject, do so
ostentatively embrace, and as it were, hug in their Arms as a witness,
which may alone stop the mouth of any Protestant; which therefore, above all
other, they dictate to their Novices, and furnish them therewith, as with
Armor of proof against all Opposites, especially seeing the

Contrarily, we complain of the Romish Disputers, against this their
fastidious and perverse importunity, in urging a testimony, which they
themselves could as easily have answered as objected; both in taking exception
at the ground of that speech, to show that it is not Scripture at all, and also
by moderating the rigidity of that Sentence, even out of Augustine himself.

THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Showing, that the Ground of that speech was not Scripture.
PRotestants (you know) allow of no Authentical Scripture of the old
Testament, which is not according to the Original, namely, the Hebrew Text;
and the Church of Rome Vulgar Latin Translation, as of the only Authentical.
But in neither of them are these words, viz. [ He was carried in his own
hands:] but only that David, now playing the Madman, slipped, or fell into the
hands of others, as your T^status Abulensis. [Et collabe batur inter manus
eorum:] Nempe, ad modum hominis furiosi ostendebat se, ut insanum, Cor. in ^um
locum.
Abulensis truly observes. So easily might the Transcribers of the
Septuagints err, in mistaking (...) for (...): and so impossible it is for you
to ground the objected Sentence upon divine Scripture, even in your own
judgment.

THE SECOND CHALLENGE,
THis word [ Quomodo, How] implying it to be impossible for David, or any other
man, to carry himself in his own hands, excepting Christ, as you defend, must
argue either an carried in his own hands, in a literal sense, then could not
Christ, as man, be carried in his own hands: and if it do not intimate an
absolute Impossibility, then might David, or any other man, by the power of
God, have carried himself in his own hands. So that whether thus, or so, you
will make Augustine contradict himself, if his words be taken in the
preciseness and strictness of that which is a Literal Sense.

THE THIRD CHALLENGE,
SAint Augustine after he had said Quomodo, How? (a word seeming to signify
an Impossibility) lest that it, being taken absolutely, might imply a direct
carrying of himself in his hands at his Supper, he qualifieth that his speech
somewhat after saying; [ Quodammodo, etc.] that is, After a certain manner
Christ carried himself in his own hands. Which is a Modification, and indeed
a Correction of his former sentence. Our next labor must be to find out the
meaning of his [ Quodammodo] and what this manner of Christ's carrying himself
was, in the judgment of Saint Augustine. Whatsoever it is that a man has
really in his hands, were it a loaf of Bread, it were ridiculous to say, that
he carries a loaf of Bread, After a sort in his if the same were Properly
carried therein; as will appear most plainly in the fifth Challenge.

THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE, Showing Saint Augustine to be an utter enemy to the
Romish Cause in all their other conceited Manners, concerning Christ in this
Sacrament.
Augustine often pleading for a Figurative Sense. Secondly, against your manner
of bringing in the Body of Christ, by Transubstantiation, he has acknowledged
in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the Continuance of Bread. Thirdly,
against your Corporal Existence of Christ in many places at once, in this
Sacrament, or elsewhere without dimension of Place, or Space, he has already
contradicted you in both, holding them Impossible: and also by arguing that
therefore his flesh is not on because it is in Heaven. Fourthly, Your manner of
properly Eating Christ's Body Corporally, he will See the fifth Book Chap. 5.
Sect. 5. and Chap. 6. Sect. 3.
renounce hereafter, as an execrable Imagination. Wherefore Augustine holding
(...) Impossible for Christ's Body to have any Corporal Existence in this
Sacrament, it is Incredible he could have resolvedly concluded of Christ's
Corporal carrying of his Body, properly, in his own hands.

THE FIFTH CHALLENGE,
Do you then seek after the manner which Augustine believed? what need you?
having learned it of Augustine himself, by his [ Secundum quendam modum,
(where he says) This Sacrament after a sort is the Body of Christ:] What,
literally? Nay; but (for so he says) August. Sicut secundum quendam modu^
Sacramentum Corporis, Corpus Christi est; ita Sacramentum Fidei, Fides est. See
above 8. at (a.)
As Baptism (the Sacrament of Faith) is called Faith. And if you have not the
leisure to look for Augustine judgment in his writings, you might have found
it in your own Book of Decrees, set out by Decret. part. 3. de Consecr.
distinct. 2. C. Hoc est. Sicut ergo coelestis panis, qui Christi caro est, suo
modo vocatur corpus Christi, illius viz. quod, etc. -- vocaturque immolatio
carnis, quae Sacerdotis manibus fit, Christi Passio: non rei veritate, sed
significante mysterio [ Observe that in the words. coelestis panis, qui caro
Christi est, the word Caro is by the Gloss in Gratian interpreted Species
panis, at the letter (f) Caro, id est, Species panis, to avoid the absurdity of
interpreting Christ's Flesh to be the Body of Christ]
Gratian, where Augustine is alleged to say, that This holy Bread is after it is
manner called the Body of Christ, as the offering thereof by the hands of the
Priest is called Christ's Passion. Dare you say, that the Priest's Oblation is
properly, and literally in strict sense, the Passion of Christ? or that
Augustine meant any such Manner? Surely he did not, and therefore may we most
aptly expound Saint Augustines Quodammodo] by this Saint Augustine his [ Suo
modo] which is clearly and evidently explained by your own Romish Glossa
ibid. [Coeleste, etc.] Coeleste Sacramentum, quod vere repraesentat Christi
carnem, Christi caro vocatu^: unde dicitur suo modo, non rei veritate, sed
significante mysterio, ^it sit sensus, vocatur Christi co^pus, id est,
Significat.
Gloss, where it says: The heavenly Sacrament, which represents the Flesh
of Christ, is called Christ's Flesh, so said, [Suo modo] after it is manner, not
in the Truth of the thing, but in a significant mystery, as meaning, It is
called Christ's Body, that is, it signifies his Body. So the Gloss.

* To conclude. We are in good hope, that you will give credit to that, which
Many of your own Doctors shall confess, and that with the approbation of your
Jesuit Suarez, Suar. Ies in 3. Thom. Disp. 47. 4 Quae coveniunt co^pori
Christi secundum le, non possunt dici de speciebus, nisi valde metaphorice and
improprie, eo modo, quo nomen rei significatae tribuitur signo. Ratio est
clara, Quia corpus Christi est res omnino distincta speciebus. -- Iuxta hanc
Conclusionem interpretantur multi, quod alibi dixit August. Sacramentum
corporis Christi [Quodammodo] dici corpus Christi.
who relates thus much, saying, that whereas Saint Augustine has these words,
viz. The Sacrament is called [Quodammodo] that i^, after a manner the Body of
Christ; Many ( says he) do expound them as spoken very Metaphorically and
Improperly: the reason whereof is clear, because the Body of Christ is a thing
distinct from the forms. So he. Confessing that those Many yield unto us that
True and Figurative Sense of Saint Augustines [Quodammodo,] which we have all
this while contended for. *

In a word, rightly might Calvin. Admonit. u^t. ad Westphol. Augustinum totum
esse nostrum, omnes lib^^ clamant.
Calvin say, speaking of these All the Books of Augustine (upon this subject)
proclaim that he is wholly ours. Much more, concerning Christ his not being
Corporally here on Earth, will, by the judgment of Augustine and other
Fathers, be found in the fifth, sixth, and seventh Books; besides that which
they affirm in this Book, in the Chapters following.

THE SIXTH CHALLENGE, In general, Concluding the maine Point.
BY this time, we think, you may discern between plain dealing, and false
juggling: for your Disputers have usually alleged, for defense of your
Transubstantiation, and Corporal in the Sacrament, the Sentences of Fathers
used in their Sermons, and Exhortations, wherein commonly they exercised their
Rhetoric in Figurative, and Hyperbolicall speeches, as has been confessed
by your own Doctors; and proved by many their like Sayings concerning other
Sacramental Rites; but especially of the Sacrament of Baptism: whereas our
proofs arise directly from the Testimonies of the Fathers, which they have
commonly had in their sad and earnest Disputation, in confutation of many, and
maine Heresies, where indeed they were necessarily to Logicko, for discerning
Truth from Error; and also of Grammar; we mean the Exactness, and
propriety of Speech, void of Amphibologies, Hyperboles, and Ambiguities,
whereby the minds of their Hearers, or Readers might be perplexed, and the
Truth darkened. This one Consideration we judge to be of necessary importance.
And thus much concerning the judgment of ancient Fathers, touching this second
Contradiction.


See above (...) 5.. ^.
heard of the Antecedent, which was granted by Aquinas, viz. It implies a
Contradiction, to say a Body is Corporally in two places at once, because this
makes that one Body not to be one. Which being confessed, your have also heard
your Cardinal making this Consequence, viz. by the same reason it muct follow,
that it is absolutely Impossible. But besides, there are Actions and Qualities,
whereof some are Relatives, and have respect to some place, and others are
Absolutes. Of the Relatives you have determined that Vnum corpus in diversis
locis positum unum habet esse substantiale, sed multa habet esse localia: ex
quo fit, ut omnia multiplicari debeant, quae consequuntur esse locale: illa
autem non multiplicantur, quae aliunde proveniunt, Relationes vero ad loca
necessario multiplicantur, propter dimensiones locorum. Itaque erit idem corpus
sursum, and deorsum, propinqusi, and remotum, poterit moveri in locum, and
quiescere in alio loco, nec tamen implicatur ulla contradictio. Illa enim
dicuntur Contradicentra, quae convenient uni respectu eodem, eodem tempore,
modo, loco. Ac ne id mirum videatur, Anima humana, quae tota est in toto
corpore, and quolibet membro Corporis, certe, ut est in capite, est remota a
terra, ut in pedibus propinqua, ut in brachio quiescere dicitur, and ut in
altero mo^ movere. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. Ac primum.
One Body (say you) as it is in diverse places at once, might be below, and
above, on the right hand, and on the left, behind, and before it self, may
move, and not move, at the same instant, without Contradiction: because it is
so said in diverse Respects, namely, of diverse places, as the soul of man in
diverse parts of the Body. So you.

These are but Capriccious Chimera's and mungrell fancies of addle brains, who
disputing of Bodily Locality can find no Example, within the Circumferences of
the University of Creatures, but only Man's soul, which is a Spirit: which
point is to be discussed in the fifth Chapter. In the Interim

* Which peradventure one of your Doctors saw, when he denied in this
Sacrament any Motion at all; Because else (says Ioh. Paluter. a Castro. S. T.
D. Lect. our. in. 4. Sect Tom. 4. Lect. 58 Christi corpus in hoc Sacramento non
movetur neque per se, ne que per Accidens. Et paulo post: Si ad Hostiae motum
moveretur, time ad Hostiae motum esse^ sursum simul and deorsum. At hoc ex
dictis non sapit verum.
he) at the Motion of the Host, Christ's Body should be both below and above
at once, which savoureth not of Truth. So he. And although your Gabriel. Biel.
Lect. 47. Cu^n innumera sint altaria, in quibus celebratur sacrum illud
mysterium, si moveretur per modios orbs coelis, and sphaeras elementares ad
s^gula hujusmodi Altaria corpus Christi, esset in continuo motu, and moveretur
ad contrari is positionum differentias, simul se ad ori^ntem and ad occidentem,
meridianum and septentrionem, pro varietate situs Altarium; quod est Absurdum
and Ridiculosum.
Gabriel Biel defends the Corporal Presence of Christ in Heaven, and on your
Altars at once yet that If should move from North and South; East and West, and
all at the same time, according to the variety of Altars, This (says he) is
Absurd and Ridiculous. * You See above Chap. 5.. ^
will say, (and it is your common Sanctuary) that Place is not essential to a
Body, and therefore separable from a Body; so that a man may be in two places
at once. And you may as well say, that because Time is not of the essence of a
man, some man may have a Being without any time, or else in two times at once.
(But enough of this has been answered in the sixth Section.)

Finally, this your Subtilty would have been judged a palpable Theodoret
taught this Philosophy, to hold true in Divinity (to wit) that whosoever has
properly one thing on the right hand of it, and another thing on the left, it
is Circumscribed in place. Whereby he demonstrateth the Truth of Christ's
Body, because it is Circumscribed: and that it is circumscribed, because it is
written of him, that Theod Dial. 2. cap. 3. (...)
. The Sheep shall stand on his right hand, and the ^oates on the left. Nor do
you your-selves teach, nor yet can you imagine his Body to want either his
right hand, or his left, as he is present in this Sacrament. One word more.
The Sea above ^^.. 5.
Fathers, who were many, that distinguished Circumscribed, and the other is not
circumscribed, would never yield to either of both, that it is both
Circumscribed and not Circumscribed; as you do to Christ's Body, teaching it to
be at the same time Circumscribed in Heaven, when it is Uncircumcised, as it
is on many Altars upon earth. Diverse other your Contradictorie Relations you
may find in the Sections following in this Fourth Book.


Were it possible that Actions and Qualities, which have respect to Place,
might avoid the Contradiction; yet Actions and Qualities as have no Relation to
place, it will be beyond your imaginations to conceive so, as will appear by
your own Resolutions. For your Cardinal, and your Jesuit Suarez, with diverse
others, have thus Corpus Christi, in diversis locis positum, habet unum
substantiale, and quae sunt absoluta in eo non multiplicantur respectu
diversorum locorum: unde quae recipluntu^ a corpore, sive Actiones sint, sive
Qualitates, sive quae unque alia, non multiplica^tur. Ratio, qua corpus unum
est, non multa; ut si corpus Christi in uno loco calefiat, in alio erit
calidum: si in uno loco vulneretur, in altero erit vulnerarum. Bellar. lib. 3.
de Euch. cap. 4. Actus contrarij, ut amoris, and odij, assensus, dissensus, non
possunt competere uno subjecto in diversis locis, quia vitales actiones
proficiscuntur ex potentiae naturali, ut a principio agente, and eadem potentia
non habet vim naturalem ad efficiendum actus contrarios -- Ratio; inter actus
cortrarios -- tantam esse repugnantiam, ut etiam per potentiam Dei absolutam
non possint esse in eodem subjecto, and loco, quia sese omnino destruunt ex
part objecti. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp ^8. Sect. ^.. Atque.
determined, that Such Actions and Qualities as are real in a Body, without
any relation to place, may not be said to be multiplied in respect of diverse
places, wherein the same Body is supposed to be: As (for example) the same Body
to be hot in some Country, and cold in another, at the same time; wounded, and
not wounded; passible, and not passible. And the like may be said of Love, and
Hatred, Actions, proceeding naturally from the Subject. So that the Body, which
in one place is affected with love, cannot possibly but be so affected in what
place soever. So your Disputers.

*Who might have added one of the Oracles of your Church, Pope Innocent the
third, where he writes of your Roman Mass, saying that Innoc. 3. de offic.
Missae. lib. 3. cap. 22. Sed cum incredibile judicatur, ut secundum eandem
naturam simul esset mortalis and immortalis.
It is judged a thing incredible, that Christ should be both mortal and
Immortal, according to the same nature. On whom your Jesuit Vasquez. in 3.
Thom. Quaest. 76 Art. 6. Disput. 189. cap. 4. Qualitates, quae pendent a loco,
ut telatae, quales sunt motus, actio in subjectum, and passio ab Agente, etc.
At omnia absoluta a loco ita enunciantur, de corpore absoluto a loco, ut eorum
enunciatio non limitetur. Verbi gratia, Si Petro convenit esse album,
enunciabitur de illo, sive filium habet, sive non, eo quod albedo non convenit
ei respectu filij -- Sequitur, perinde esse dicere, si semel Petrus supponatur
esse albus in uno loco, absolute albus erit in omni l^co. Idem dici porest de
aegritudine, sanitate, etc.
Vasquez will wait, holding the General Tenent, that whatsoever Quality it
is, that has no dependence of place, it cannot be limited in respect of place:
Among these he reckons Blackness, and Whiteness. *

But have they any reason for these Points? Yes they have, may be hot, and not
hot at the same time, gives us this reason: Because (says he) it is one
Body, and not many. So he. A reason Infallible. Your Jesuit Suarez also
denying that the same party can love, and hate, consent, and dissent at the
same time, in respect of diverse places, yields this reason; Because (says
he) these repugnant affections, belonging to one subject, cannot by the
Omnipotency of God be together in the same, because they destroy one another.
So Aquinas, and other Quicquid pertinet ad Christum secundum quod in se est, id
potest ei tribui in propria specie, and in hoc Sacramento existenti, ut vivere,
mori, dolere, animatum esse. Aquia. part. 3. qu. 81. art. 4. Cum Thoma

Schoolmen denying that the same Body can be said to grieve, and not to
grieve, both at once, in respect of diverse Because Grief being in the same
man, as he is a man, cannot be said to be together with not Grieving in him;
lest we should make a man not to be himself. *Well has your Jesuit See the
precedent numb. 24.
Vasquez resolved of Blackness, health, sickness, and the like, that they are
not limited by any respect of place. As for example, If being in one place,
Peter be Black, he shall be said to be black in whatsoever place he does
consist*. Cardinal Alan Putatur a quibusdam vetustioribus Theologis Christum
propter varias ejus existentias simul mortalem, and immortalem, passibilem, and
impassibilem se repraesentare. Alij huic se sententiae, opposuere tempore
Berengarij, quia viderunt maxim, intelligentiae repugnare, ut idem corpus sit
simul mortale and immortale. Alan. Card. de Euchar. Sacram. lib. 1. page 451.
denying that the same Body, in respect of diverse places, can be said to be
Mortal and Immortal, Passible, and Impassible, expresses this was used of
old: Because these sayings are most repugnant to the understanding of man.

*Lastly and most largely your Aegid. Conincks Ies. de Sacram. qu. 75. Art. 4
Dub. 3. number. 110. Possibile esse corpus habere diversa accidentia, ut movere in

WE have in these your Premises received as true Assertions, as sufficient
Reasons, and as absolute Confessions See in this Book Chap. 9. 2. etc.
you teach that Christ, as he is in this Sacrament, has no natural faculty,
either of Motion, of Sense, of Appetite, or of Understanding things past, all
which notwithstanding he has in all perfection in Heaven. But to understand,
and not to understand, to have, and not to have an Appetite, you will confess
to be as absolute Qualities, and Acts Contradictorie, as free from respect to
Place, as are those which you have allowed, to wit, Grieve, and not Grieve,
love; and not and not alive: because man has an Appetite and Desire, an Act of
understanding in himself, not as he is in one Place more than in another. *A
Parisian Doctor will give you his Determination, saying, that Liber qui
inscribitur, Olim incognitur Carmelita Doctor paris. in 4. Sent. Cum esuries

vel sensitivus, and velle comedere, sive sic, sive sic: Dico, quod si appetitus

If the Appetite be satisfied in one Place, it does not desire meat at the
same time in another Place. So he. How much more must this hold in the
Understanding part of things passed? which because they are Things passed,
cannot be said to have Relation to any present place, no more than To freeze,
and to be hot. * Seeing therefore you have been enforced, by infallible
Principles love, and hate, and to have contrary passions together, because they
are Contradictories, and would infer, that one man should be, and not be
himself: Therefore are you become necessarily Contradictory to your selves.
Can there be a stronger Argument than this, to persuade Christians, that your
Doctors are men delivered up to strong delusions, to believe lies? of which
kind this, of teaching a Body to be in diverse places at once, is not the least;
notwithstanding any Objection by you made to

CHALLENGE.
But the Doctor was answered, that the Example is many Presence of the same
Body in diverse places at once. We say, the same Body; but this your Example of
Word, or Voice, which you Both call the same, is not individually the same in
every man's hearing, as is here affirmed; but only the same in kind, by a
multiplication of the sounds, and words uttered, as Philosophy teaches. Like
as we see in throwing a stone into the water, it makes at the first a Circle,
and circle multiplieth upon circle, till the last come to a large
Circumference: Even so the Verbum, quasi ^aerem verberans. Cicero.
Word, by Voice breaking the Air, does make in the Air Circle upon circle,
till a ^ound come to the ears of the hearers; every of the parts of the Circle
being articulated, through the multiplication of the first form, from the
several emanations of the Rays, the diverse ears do no more receive the same
individual Voice, than they do the same individual Air, whereby the Voice is
conveyed. So that this Example is no same Body in diverse places at once, by the
sound of a word in many men's ears; which is not individually the same, and
serves for nothing rather than to make the Disputer ridiculous.

Thus was that Doctor answered, when he confessed of the voice of the Preacher
in the Pulpit, which is received by multitudes of Hearers, and of his other
Example of a color of a red Cow, by multiplication of it is forms seen of
thousand men's eyes at once, that it is not Numerically the same. *And this A

confessed, See the Margin) the Voice be nothing else but Air moved; then
seeing the Air, which enters into one man's ear, is not the same with that
which is received into another man's ear; the voice which is an Articulate
impression of the Air, can be said to be no more the same, than are the ears
of the Hearers. Which is furthermore demonstrable in this, that the voice is
more and less perceived of men, according to their distances in place from the
Speaker, some hearing it more, and some less, some in whole,

Love darkness better than light. It might seem to be a superstitious
diligence to confute such sottishness with the serious judgment of any grave
Father; otherwise Greg: Naz. Orat. 51. Vnius corporis locus, duorum, aut
plurium non est capax: sed (...).
Gregory Nazianzen is at hand, ready to tell you, that there is as great a
difference between Bodies, and Voices, or Sights; as there is betwixt Bodies,
and Spirits: so that whereas two Bodies cannot be in one place, yet voices, and
sights [(...)] are by an Incorporeall manner apprehended, so that the same Ear
is capables of many Voices, and the same sight of many Visibles.

A Confutation of their second, and third Reasons, taken from the Similitude of
man's Soul, or Presence of God, devised to
TWo other Argumentum sumitur ab exemplis Dei, and animae rationalis. Deus est
unus in infinitis locis indivisibilis, and anima humana est tota in qualibet
part corporis. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3.
Instances you have, whereby to maintain your supposed Bodily Presence in two
places at once; one is in man's Soul, the other in God himself. First, we
will enquire into the nature of the soul. Our exception against a Bodies Being
in diverse places at once, is by reason of the distance between place and
place, for it is far less than Body should in one and the same moment be at
Toledo in Spain, and at Paris in France; and yet not to be in the intermediate
Space between both, which divides Toledo from Paris. But the Condition of the
humane Soul is utterly different, for it is in the Bodily members, not as a
Body in diverse places, but as a form in its own matter, being virtually and
operatively in each part, nor having Quantity and extension, (the unseperable
properties of a Body) but by a formal perfection, As containing the Body, and
not contained thereof, Anima est in corpore, ut continens, non ut contenta.
Aquin. 1. qu. 52. Art. 1.
says your Aquinas. For the Soul is so in Souls Being in diverse places.
Saint Augustine will tell you (in the VIII Chapter following, Section 6.) that
there is, in this respect, a Greater difference between a Soul and a Body.
And another Father will illustrate the like difference between Bodies, and
Angelical Spirits, in the next Section.

Nay, and your Cardinal having See above Chapter 3. Sect. 3.
confessed already, that It is not possible by any divine power, that a spirit
should be divisible after the manner of a Body; does hereby as fully confute
himself, as if he had said, there is no comparison to be made between Body
and Spirit, in respect of Local Being: how much less between it, and God the
Father of all Spirits, who cannot be so in many places at once, that he is not
likewise both in every intermediate space, between place and place, and also
in all places without them: this being the property of his infiniteness to
contain all places, and not to be contained of any. And therefore cannot this
manner of Presence, without irreligious impiety, be applied to any creature;
which notwithstanding, Quod si quis requirat esse in loco ^am circumscriptiv^
quam definitive, id requirere, ut non sit a^^bi; dicere possumus dari tertium
modum existendi in loco, nimirum, per solam praesentiam, quomodo Deus est in
loco Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4.. Altero.
your Cardinal blusheth not to do in that manner, as was hitherto (we think)
never imagined by any Divine before him, namely, a manner of being of a Body in
a Circumscriptively, as natural Bodies are, nor Definitively, that is, so that
being in one place, it is not at the same time in another, as Angels and
Spirits are; but a third, how? By only presence, after the manner as God is in
place. So he. O golden Divine! for who knows not that Existence in place
only by presence is a property of Divine Infiniteness? which being
attributed to any thing, that is not God, does equal the creature with the
Creator, God himself. *Not to mention the Difference of Opinions among
Philosophers themselves, touching the particular Seats of the Soul One sort of
them assigning the Heart; as did Hypocrates, Chrysippus, and Aristotle: Another
party placing it in the Brain; to wit, Plato, Gallen, and Averroes, all
admitting a Determinate Seat to the Soul, do thereby gainsay the Being
thereof in many parts of the Body, as properly occupying so many places. *

A Confutation of the former two Romish Instances in Man's Soul, and God
himself, by Ancient Fathers, in their Doctrine concerning Angels, and
ANcient Fathers (we trow) were profoundly learned both in Philosophical, and
in Theological Mysteries, who notwithstanding (as your Job 1. 6. [Cum
venissent et astitissent Angeli, etc.] Origin. Athanas. Greg. Nazianz. tanquam
dogma fidei tradunt, Angelos moveri localiter, neque omnibus locis praesentes,
sed esse cuique locum suum, and spatium praefinitum, cum illud necessario
requiratur, ut ab uno loco in locum alium veniant. Simili ratione confirmat
hanc verita^em Tert. Apol. cap. 22. Chryso. Hom. in Heb. 1. Ambros. lib 1. de
Sp. S. c. 10. Damasc. l. 2. de fide cap. 3. Nazian. Orat. 2. de Theol. Athanas.
Epist. ad Scrap. Test Pi^eds Ies. in eundem locum Job.
Jesuit witnesses) held it as a Doctrine of Faith, that Angels, which are
Spirits, have every one their own definite places and space, and that they
cannot be in diverse places, but by moving from one place to another, which
cannot Body that (as you say) is without motion in diverse places at once.
Surely, if ever such strange and paraphysicall, nay, more than Hyperphysicall
Crotchets had entered into the minds of ancient Fathers, we should have heard
you allege, at least some one of them, if not for proof, yet in pretext and
color of patronizing these your repugnant Paradoxes, concerning a Body taking
the right hand, or left of it self, and the like, Velut aegri somnia vanae
singuntur Species.

For your better satisfaction, we shall allege some Testimonies, which may
sufficiently declare their Judgment of an Impossibility of a Spirits being in
diverse places at one time, whether we consider the Spirits of Angels, or of
men; yea or the Humane Spirit or soul of Christ. Of Angels, Damascen;
Damascen. Orthod. fid. l. 1. c. 17 and l. 3. cap. 7. Angelus dicitur esse in
loco, (...): Deus autem ubique existens, copora vero (...).
They are so circumscribed in the place where they work, that they cannot
possibly be in more places at once. Athanasius, Athanas. Tom. 1 Epist. ad Serap.
p. 201. (...).
As the holy Ghost fills all places, so Angels are contained in a certain
place. Accordingly Ambrose; Ambros. de Sp. S. lib. 1. cap. 10. Seraphim quod
jubetu^ exequitur, Spiritus quod vult dividit: Seraphim de loco ad locum
transit, non enim complet omnia, sed ipsum repletur a Spiritu.
Herein do Angels differ from the holy Pope Gregory would be heard speak;
Greg. Moral. lib. 2. cap. 3. Angeli, ut and nos, loco circumscribuntur:
comparatione quide^ corporum nostrorum Spiritus sunt, con paratione Dei
incircumscripti Corpus sunt.
Angels are circumscribed, being, in respect of our Bodies, Spirits: but, in
comparison of the uncircumscribed God, they are to be esteemed as Bodies. So
they. Our next speculation must be touching the souls of Saints departed. The
Author set out by your selves, in the name of Athanasius, unto this Objection,
How do the souls of Saints so often appear at one moment of time in the
Sepulchers, as they seem to have done? Answers, that They are not the same
Saints, but rather visions, and adumbrations of them, by transfigurations He
gives his Reason, why he thinks the other impossible, Athanas quaest. ^l
Antioch. 26. Quomodo (cedo mihi) una existens Petri aut Pauli anima, (...)
apparere in suo monumento, and in mill templis per totum mundum, nec Angelus
potest? (...). Edit Paris. Anno 1627.
Because it is proper ( says he) to God alone to be at one moment of time in
two places at once. So he. And if the Fathers shall say, in effect, as much of
the humane soul of Christ, you (we should think) would require no more.
Tertullian among his many divine Answers, to prove Christ to be God, he urges
the Arian Heretics with this one, as not the least: Tert. de Trinit. circiter
medium. against the Ebionites. Si homo (...) modo Christus, quomodo adest
ubique invocatus? cum haec non hominis natura sit, sed Dei, ut adesse (...) in
omni loco: si homo tantummodo Christus, cur and Mediator invocatur? etc.
Because Christ is present in all places, where he is invocated, which is a
power not incident unto man, but proper to the nature of God. So he. How like
you this? And Augustine may not be thought to dissent, Aug. Epist. 57 ad (...)
[Mecum eris in Paradiso] Non ex his verbis in coelo existimandus Paradisus,
neque enim in ipso die futurus erat in coelo homo Christus, sed in inferno
secundum animam, and in sepulchro secundum carnem.
Soul of Christ, when it departed this life, could not be in Heaven, and in
Hell at once.

As for the Being of God in diverse places at once, which was your Cardinals
instance, for proof of a Possibility of the Being of Christ's Body in many
places, without Contradiction of making One not One, by dividing it from it
self; we know not whether rather to censure it egregiously absurd, or
extremely impious; seeing that the Being of God in diverse places at once
without Contradiction arises from the very nature of Gods Infiniteness Being
in whatsoever place: which is (as your own School might have taught him) so,
as Aquinas 1^ quaest. 52. Art. 2.
Containing all places, and not contained in any: which the Fathers have as
fully declared, in making Being in all places, as filling them with his
presence, to be the property of his Deity. Such then is the impiety of your
arguing; by laboring to defend the manner of the Being of a Body, by the manner
of Being of a Soul or Spirit; denied by Nazian. Orat. 51. cont. Apollinar.

humanitatem. Resp. (...) ut vas unius modij non duos modios continet.) (...),

Nazianzene; and manner of the Being of a Creature, by the manner of the Being of
God the Creator, exceeds all Absurdities that can be named. The holy Fathers
will have Below. Chap. 7. Sect. 2. and 4.
say to you; but first we are willing to hear what you can say for your
selves.

A Confutation of the Third Romish Pretense, why they need not yield to these
Reasons whereby their Doctrine is proved to be so grossly Unreasonable.
MYsteries of Faith (says your Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. Argumentum
sumitur a mysterijs, etc.
Cardinal) which exceed man's understanding, are only to be apprehended by
Faith, Such as are the Articles of the Trinity, of Christ his Incarnation, of
the Resurrection, of the Creation, and of Eternity it self; and so ought this,
concerning the Presence of Christ his Body, notwithstanding any Objection from
Reason. So you. We answer. Some of these former Mysteries we confess to be
such as exceed man's understanding, yet such again they Trinity there is One
God, and Three Persons, because the Essence of the Godhead is common to each
person: or to say in the Incarnation there is one Person, and two natures; no
more than to say, that in one man there is one person, and two essential
parts, one his Body, the other his Spirit: or in the Resurrection to believe
the same that was created, might be restored to life, more than to believe that
one grane of Corn Creation to believe that something may be made of nothing,
than to say that a blind man was made to see. As for the last Objection,
saying that Aeternitas est instans Darationis, Bellar. ibid.. Quintum.
Eternity is the instant of Duration, it is a Paradox: for Aeternitas est
duratio immutabilis, principio and fine carens. Lessias Ies. Opus^. Var. de
Perfect. devia l 4 c. 1. yet is it true, that Aeternitas est nunc stans, non
nunc volans, ut tempus. Cap. 3.
Eternity is Duration it self, without beginning, or ending; which is
conceived without Contradiction.

In all these your former Pretenses nothing is more considerable than the
miserable Exigence whereunto your Disputers are brought, whilst they are
constrained, for avoiding of Contradictions in things subject to the
determination of Sense, to pose us with Spiritual Mysteries, which are Objects
only of Faith, by reason of the Infiniteness of their properties; and
therefore may well exceed the reach of man's wit, and apprehension, without any
prejudice unto Truth, by Contradiction: as if they meant to teach men to put
out their eyes, and never any more to discern any sensible things, by sensible
means. By which manner of reasoning all the Arguments used by the Apostles,
against Infidels, for proof of the Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ's
Body; all the Reasons of Fathers, against Heretics, in distinguishing of the
Properties of the Divine and Humane nature of Christ in himself, and their
former Testimonies in discerning Bodies from Spirits, by Circumscription, and
Spirits from God by Determination in one place; and lastly your own
Consequences of many confessed Impossibities, concerning Place, (as the
Impossibility that God should be contained in Place, as for one Body, having
Qantity, to be incapable of a Place, and the like) are all utterly made void.
For to what end were any of these, if your Pretenses have in them any shadow
Contarenus observed more solidly out of Dionysius Areopagita, that the Set
hereafter, Chap. 10. Sect. 6. nu. 6.
Godhead differs from all other things in that it exceeds all apprehension
of man. *

CHAP. VII.
The third Romish Contradiction, against the words of Christ [MY BODY,] is by
making a Body Finite, to be a Body not finite. SECT. I.
IF (as you have said) the Body of Christ is, or may be at one time in so many
places, then may it be in more, and consequently everywhere at one instant.
This Consequence your ancient Schoolmen Quasi non possit creatura esse ubique
hoc (inquam) non obstat, nam omnipotentiam illi intellexerunt prorsus
naturalem: quia si non aliena virtute, sed suapte natura res existat ubique
praesens, haec revera nulli creaturae convenit. At nos altero modo non nisi per
absolutam Dei potentiam ubiquitatem creaturae arbitramur. Valent. Ies. lib. 1.
de vera Christi praesent. in Euch. cap. 12.. Quae sane. page 241.
Valentia does seem to avow, saying, What hinders that a Body may be
[Vbique] everywhere at once, not by it is natural power, but by the
Omnipotency of God? So he. This we say is to make a Finite Infinite, and
your old Schoole-Doctors are hereunto witnesses, who have judged it Veterum
Theologorum apud D. (...) ratio (...) est si idem corpus ^ssit esse in ^^^^bus
locis simul, potest in ^luribus, atque (...) ubique. -- Et qua ^um eodem Thoma
dicunt, Haereticum esse affir^^^^e, corpus Christi esse (...) in duobus locis
simul, quia ubiqu^ esse, est p^oprium Deo. Peste Su^rez tom 3. qu 7^. Artic. 1.
disput. 48. Sect. 4.
Heretical, to say, That the Body of Christ can be in diverse places at once;
because then he may be in infinite. So they. And hear you what your Cardinal
Bellarmine has publicly taught? To say ( Dicere corpus Christi esse, vel esse
posse in insinitis locis ^^nul, immensitatem divinam requirit. Bellarmin. lib.
3 de Christo cap. 8.
says he) that the Body of Christ may be in infinite places at once, is to
ascribe an Immensity and infiniteness unto it, (namely, that) which is proper
unto God. So he, and so also your other Doctors, to whom the Evidence of Truth
commands us to assent.

For what greater Heresy can there be against that Article of our Faith,
concerning the Deity, and Godhead of Christ, begotten, not made, than to
believe that there can be a made God? for so doubtless do they (whosoever they
be) that think a Finite Body may be made Infinite.

CHALLENGE.
YOu understand the Argument, viz. To believe that Chirst his Body may be every
where, is a flat Heresy: but to affirm that the same Body is in many places
at once, does consequently infer that it may be every where (as has been
directly professed.) Ergo your Doctrine of attributing to the Body of Christ an
Existence, in many places at once, is by the confessed general grounds of
Christianity plainly Heretical. And from this our Conclusion your Aquinas will
in no-wise dissent, who himself concludes Aquinas 1, qu. 52. art. 2. Deus e^t
^lentia in^init^, ide^o non solu^ in p^uribus locis est, sed unique. Angelus,
quia est virtutis. sinnae; non se extendit nisi ^d unum determinatum -- unde
sequitur quod non si^ubique, neque in pluribus locis, sed in (...) loco rantum.
That the Angel is not in diverse places at once, because an Angel is a Finite
Creature, and therefore of a Finite So he.

That, by the Judgment of Ancient Fathers, the Being in diverse places at once
infers an Infiniteness Proper unto God: which without Heresy cannot be
ascribed to any humane Body; Proved from the manner of Existence of the Holy
Ghost.
STill you maintain the Real and Corporal Presence of Christ his Body in so
many place as there are consecrated Hoasts at one time in the whole World, be
they ten thousand times ten Millions of Millions, or how many soever: which,
say we, is to make the Finite Body of Christ Infinite. For Aquinas (as your
Vnum corpus esse ubique affirmare est Haereticum. Thomas. Quia Catholic^ ex hac
proprietate essendi ubique dicunt antiquos Patres sufficienter probasse
Spiritus Sancti Divinitatem, ut patet ex Augustino, Fulgent. Ambros. Basil.
Test Suarez ies. Tem 3. Disp. 48. 4. Rat. 1.
Jesuit witnesses) held it Heretical, to affirm One body to be everywhere,
because this is a Divine property, by which the Fathers did sufficiently prove
the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, (namely) Augustine, Fulgentius, Ambrose, and
Basil. So he.

But how did the Fathers prove this, think you? it were good, that where your
own Authors be silent, we heard some of themselves speak. Fulgent. ad Tra.
simud. lib. 2. page 325. Spiritus Sancti in nobis habitatio non localis est,
inhabitat enim Tunitas in su^s fidelibus, sicut tota in cunctis: nec per
separatos homines, and separata loca particulariter separatur
Fulgentius his reason is, Because the Spirit of God dwells wholly in all the
faithful, separated in diverse places. Basu. de Spir. Sancto, cap. 22. sub
finem Reliquae virtutes omnes in loco circumscriptae esse credu^tur nam Ange

determinatam naturam? Ideo cum Dominus servos suos Apostolos destinare voluit,
ut agnosceremus aliam esse naturam, aliud gratiam spiritualem, alios alioo
destinabat, quia simul omnes esse ubique non poterant^ dedit autem Spiritum
Sanctum, qui licet separatis Apostolis inseparabilis ^

severed them, giving them all the Holy Ghost, which was inseparable in them:
none therefore can doubt but it is a Divine Essence. S. August. contra Maxim.

sanctificandis fidelibus ubique praesentem esse dicatis, tamen negare audeatis
esse Deum? [The Vbique, spoken of the Faithful, has the sense of Vbicunque,
because the number of the Faithful is but finite, and their places distinct,
here and there, and not absolutely every where.]
Augustine confuteth an Arian Bishop thus: You that praise the holy Spirit, in
sanctifying his faithful wheresoever they are, how can you deny him to be God?

* Saint Hilary, to evince Christ to be a Divine Spirit, uses this Argument:
Hilarious in Ps. 124. in illo verba Christi, [Ecce ego vobiscum sum, usque ad
consummationem seculi.] Spiritus namque adest omnia penetrans and continens.
Non enim secundum nos corporalis est, ut cum alicubi adsit, absit aliunde.
The Scripture (says he) says, He is with his Church unto the end of the
World; but not as a Corporal nature, which is, when he is present in one
place, to be absent from another. Accordingly, for proof of the Godhead of
the same Holy Ghost, Athana^. de ^^umana Christi natura. Plane eadem a Davide
de Sp. Sancto tradita sunt, Psalm. 138. [Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo?] quibus verbis
nos edoctos voluit, Sp. Sanctum esse qui omnia replet: and a facie tua quo
defugiam? S^alcende^o in coelum, tu illi^ praestoes: si descendero in infernum,
tu ibi ades.
Athanasius argues out of the same Psalm, [Whither shall I go from thy
presence?] Concluding that The Holy Ghost fills all things, and is therefore
But how is this Infiniteness of Being in all places proved? The Reason
follows, in the same place, from the Instances of Being in diverse places at
once: If I go into Heaven, Thou art there, If into Hell, Thou art there also.
So that still the Argument, for the Godhead, is taken from Being both There,
and There *

The Holy Ghost, if it were a Creature, should have it is Substance
circumscribed; which because it is in many places at once cannot be
circumscribed, as all things that are made. Upon the same ground Cyrill of
Alexandria, makes the same Conclusion Cyril. Alex. de Spiritu Sancto (quod non
est Creatura.) Cum in loco and circum scriptione intelligant quae facta sunt,
Spiritus autem sancti non sit, de quo psallit David, Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo?
The Spirit of God is no Creature (says he) because things Created are in one
place, but of the Spirit of God it is written, whither shall I go from thy
presence?

* Let us fall to Reasoning. The Enthymem^ of the Fathers The Holy Chost is in
diverse places at once, Therefore is he God: The Major Proposition, you know,
by the Rule of Art must needs be this: Whatsoever is in diverse places at once,
is God. So then the Syllogism or form of Argumentation must necessarily stand
thus:

Ma. Whatsoever is in diverse places at once, is God.

Mi. But the Holy Ghost to in diverse places at once:

(The Conclusion necessarily following is this,)

Con. Therefore the Holy Ghost is God.

Godhead of the Holy Ghost. By whose Judgments we are taught that (...) does
Infallibly infer a (...); and that therefore the Contrary Profession of a
Being of a Creature, in diverse places, or spaces at once, is Heretical;
because the aforesaid Fathers Disputed against the Heretics (named by Epiphan.
Haeres. 69. Contra Ar^omanita, qui dicunt Spiritum Sanctum esse creaturam
creaturae.
Epiphanus the Ariomanitae) who, as Pneumatomachi, madly oppugned the Godhead
of the Holy Ghost.

Now lest when we seek to plead our own Cause, We Lutheranes, We held it a
part of Brotherhood to take with us an excellently learned Doctor of
Wittenberg, John Gerhard: who producing Bellarmines Objection against them, to
prove them them to be Heretics, in the opinion of the Presence of Christ's
Body, thus: If you give Divine Attributes to Christ's Body as Essentially, then
are you Eutychians: and if you give them accidntally, then are you Nestorians.
The same Gorhard argues thus: Ioh. Gerhard. Confess. Cathol. lib. 1. part. 2
cap. 19. page 887. In hunc modum bellar. lib. 3. de Christo, cap 1. contra nos
tale producit Argumentum. Eutherani docent carnem Christi habere Attributa
Divinitatis: ex quo sequitur eos vel esse Eutychi^nos, vel Nectorianos* vel
Monstrum ex utraque Haeresi. Si enim dixerint ea esse communicata
essentialiter, erint Eutychiani; si Accidentaliter, erint Nestoriani, Respondet
Gerhardus -- Nec Essentiaiiter, nec Accidentol^^er ea communicata dicimus, sed
Personaliter.
We (says he) give not Divine Attributes to the Body of Christ either
Essentially, or Accidentally, So he, which has in it a true and Orthodox
Sense. *

CHALLENGE.
Again, another Syllogism from these Premises will set all straight. To
ascribe to a Body an Omni-presency, and power of Being everywhere, is
Heretical. But to say that a Body is in diverse places at once, does
consequently infer a power of Being in every place (as it does, in
demonstrating the Holy Ghost to be a Divine Spirit.) Therefore to attribute to
a Body a Being in diverse places at once, is a Doctrine Heretical, and implies
Contradiction, by affirming that a Finite thing either is, or possibly may be
Infinite. Add but hereunto the former See above, Chap. 5. and 6.
Testimonies of Fathers, who have distinguished the humane nature of Christ
from his Godhead, and their denying of all Possibilities of Existence of
Angels in two places at once; and your Consciences must needs tell you, that
it was Impossible for the Fathers to have believed your Romish Article of a
Corporal Presence in every Host Consecrated at one time, on diverse Altars, in
your several Churches. What shall we then furher say concerning the Being of
a Body in diverse places at without Place, is egregiously (...), and absurd as
well in Divine, as natural Philosophy, because (as this whole Discourse
shows they have verified that saying of Aristoile; (...)

* A Vindication of Truth, against an egregious Infatuation of the Jesuit
Lessius, in framing an whole Army consisting of but one man.
AMong other multitudes of Absurdities, take unto you the Assertion of your
Jesuit Lessius, (wherein notwithstanding he is not alone) which we propound
unto you, not for your Instruction, but for your Recreation. Lessius Ies.
Opusc. de perfect. divin. lib. 12. cap. 16 nu. 199. Existentia rei non impedit
quo minus secundo, tertio, quarto centies, millies, eadem res produci possit --
Vnde sequitur ex uno homine effici posse integrum exercitum. [And this
multiplication by production is desended by Johannes Lot^us the ^esuit in his
Epistle to Conradus Verstius; Secundo, tertio, quarto and Iohann^m product
posse, etc.
The Existence of a thing (says he) hinders not, but the same thing may be
produced once, twice, thrice, an hundred, or a thousand times, so that an whole
Army and Host may consist of one man. Do you hear your Jesuit telling you of
an Army of a Thousand, or (and if you will) a thousand thousands of one man?
which Army, if you shall range into certain Quarters, you shall have in one, a
Squardon of five thousand of a Horseman; in another, Five thousand of a
Pike-man; in a third Five thousand of a Musketier; in a Fourth, Five thousand
of a Pyoner: Insomuch that upon such a multiplicity of Productions of this one
man, the said one man should be said to be furnished with all the different
thousands of Armor and weapons, of Pikes, Muskets, Pickaxes, or Shovells, as
might belong to so many thousands of men.

Although this Idle and dreamish Fiction deserve no other answer then laughter,
yet seeing that Doctors of his Profession, and Jesuits also of his own
society are at hand, we may not deny them Access; Bellarmine, Suarez, and
Vasquez, these three Jesuits have See Book 3. Cap. 3.. 1.
concluded, that Production cannot (say they) had a Being, before any Priest
could make his Consecration. So they. How then could this Jesuit soberly
feign to himself a thousand Productions of a man, that could have but one
Production an being at all. Again, you have neard, from your Doctors, two
other Conclusions, One, That if we consider the Bodily presence of Christ, as
he is out of the Sacrament visible, See above cap. 3.. 3.
It is not possible for him (say they) to be in more then one place at once. And
so Lessius his great Champion must have no Being at all. The second, See belew
cap. 9.. 2.
It is Invisible (say they) and cannot exercise any faculty of Sense or Motion.
And then must Lessius his imaginary man of Arms be such a Captain, as can
neither see any enemy, nor yet be seen of any: or if seeing, yet, as a man
bound hand and foot, has no power to pursue his Foe, or if he should make an
encounter, yet is he not able to strike one stroke, Who will not now say that
your Jesuit had no other harness upon himself than pertinacie in this
Impugnation

Gregory Nyssen, confess, to be whole, as well in a part of Bread consecrated,

penny, as in a shilling. But neither he, nor any Father ever said that a
little Host, (which Host you call Christ) is equal with a great Host; No,
for the Fathers in the Council of See below, ^. 11.
Nice absolutely denied this: nor yet is Christ wholly represented in the least
part of the Host, as your Fathers of See. 3. following.
Trent have taught, because no such part can resemble Totum Christum, whole
Christ Sacramentally, which is not of sufficient bigness to be sensibly eaten in
the nature of nourishment; thereby to resemble the Spiritual nourishment of
our Souls, which is the Body of Christ. So that all you have said makes just
nothing for the Corporal, and material Presence of Christ's Body, which we
further impugn.

Church of Rome. The exact discussion of this one point will in it self
illumnate the Eyes of any Reader, to discern between the Spirit of Truth, and
of Error; namely, to know, that there cannot be a greater Contradiction (and
consequently Impossibility) than for a Body, consisting of proportionable
dimensions of Parts, such as are Hands, Legs, Eyes, and other Organicall
members, to have Being any where without Extension, Commensuration, and
distinct Proportion of the same to the space, wherein it is, as the

That the Organicall parts of the Body of Christ must be proportionable
THE reason, which your See above, 2.
Cardinal layet down to prove it necessary, that Christ his Body should have
in it self (according to the nature of a Body) distinct parts of head and
eyes, and other Organs fit for the use of a reasonable Soul, he takes
Magnitude, which is an Extension of parts into their proportionable length,
breadth, and depth: This says he is inseparably united to Christ his Body in
it is own intrinsecall disposition, in it self; but not so (says he) in
regard of the place.

CHALLENGE.
THis your own Reason may we justly retort upon your selves, proving, that if
the natural disposition of the Body of Christ be thus proportionably extended
in it self, it must be so likewise in respect of Place and Space; because the
three dimensions of the Body of Christ (as you have confessed) stand thus, that
one is an extension in Length, another in Breadth, the third in Depth, and each
of these three are distinct one from another. Well then, the Arm must be here,
and thus far longer than the Foot, the Leg here, and thus far thicker
than the Finger, the Hand here, and thus far broader than the Toe, and
accordingly distinctly in other parts. But Hic, and Huc^sque; Here and There,
thus far and so far, being Relatives of Space, and Place, do
demonstratively show that that Extension of distinct parts of the Body, which
they have in themselves divisibly, the same they must necessarily have in
respect of the Vbi, Place, or Space, wherein the Body is. If therefore you will
not Heretically teach a Mathematical, or Fantastical Body o^ Christ, you
must deny the Article of Trent, until you can believe, and make good, that a
part of a divisible Body, longer

This is confirmed by the Essence of Christ his glorified Body, (as you
confess it to be) now in Heaven, possessing a Real place in the said
proportion of Spaces of length, and breadth, as it had here upon earth, which
it does by the natural Magnitude, or Quantity thereof. But the said natural
Magnitude, or quantity of the said Body of Christ is (according to your wone
general Doctrine) in this Sacrament. Therefore must it have the same
Commensuration of Space, although not

We should be loath to trouble your wits with these speculations, if that the
necessity of the Cause (by reason of the Absurdities, of your Romish
profession) did not enforce us hereunto; Therefore must you suffer us a little
to sport at your trifling seriousness, who writing of this Divine Sacrament,
and seeing it to be round, solid, broken, molded, in the one kind; and liquid,
frozen, and sowring in the other, do attribute all these to Quantities, and
Qualities, and Accidents, without any other subject at all. So then by the
Romish Faith we shall be constrained Host is sed with colors, and forms:
that it is Coldness that is frozen, and Roundnesse which weighs down, and
falls to the ground; as if you should describe a Romish Communicant to be a
creature clothed with Shadows, armed with Idaea's, fed with Abstracts,
augmented with Fancies, second Intentions, and Individual Vagues, and
consisting wholly of Chimaera's.

That your Romish Doctrine is contrary to the Judgment
IF this your profession had been a Catholic Doctrine, doubtless S.
Augustine (who is so devout in his fervent Meditations upon this holy mystery)
would not have oppugned it, as he did, when unto that Question of Volusianus
(whether the Body of Christ before his Birth did fill the Body of the Blessed
Virgin) he answered, Aug. Nullum corpus potest esse ubique totum,
quantumcunque corpus, vel quantulumcunque corpusculum loci occupet spacium,
eundemque locum sic occupet, ut in nulla ejus part sit totum necesse est:
long alia natura est animae, quam corporis, quanto magis Dei? Lib. 1. Ep. 3.
ad Volusian: [Whose question to S. Augustine was; Vtrum Christus intemeratae
foeminae corpus impleverit?]
That every Body, be it greater or less, wheresoever it is, must needs fill
that space wherein it is, so that the same, Body cannot be the whole in any
part thereof. So he: which is directly Contradictory to your Article of Trent,
for here is express mention of Relation to Place and Space.

And whereas for usual color of a Possibility, that the whole Body of Christ
is in every part of the Host, you have objected the Example of Man's Soul,
which is said to be whole in every member and part of the Body: Saint Augustine
(as if he had foreseen your mystery of Error) pre-occupateth, saying, In eo
quod dicitur Deus ubique, carnali cogitationi resistendum est, and men's
acorporis sensibus amorenda, ne quasi spaciosa magnitudine opinemur Deum per
cuncta diffundi, ut aer, aut lux: omnis enim hujusmodi magnitudo minor in sua
part, qua in toto: sed ita potius, ut est magna sapientia etiam in homme,
cujus corpus est parvum -- N^m si duo sint homines aequal^er sapientes, quorum
alter est corpore grandi^r, non plus sapiunt ambo, quam singuli; sic in minore
corpore non minor est sani tas, cum minora, and majora corpora tam san^ sine --
Disp^r est profecto in membroru^ molibus quantitas: sed par est in disparatis
sanitas -- quae non quantitas, sed qualitas est. Non pot^^t ergo obtinere
quantitas corporis quod qualitas. Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan.
The nature of a Soul is far different from the nature of a Body. And again
the same holy Father, seeking to find out some Similitude, whereby wholly to
resemble the Existence of God, in respect of Place, in the end says, that
Quality has a prerogative to make some Similitude hereof: and he does
instance in Wisdom, which (says he) is as great in a little man as in a
great man; but denies that Quantity has any such Privilege, for speaking of
Quantity and Magnitude, In all such Quantity, or Magnitude (says he) there is
less in the part, than there is in the whole. And by this same Maxim
(concerning Whole in respect of Place) he distinguishes the Godhead from the
Manhood, by which you have confounded them. And yet again elsewhere (as
though he thought this your delusion could never be sufficiently contradicted,
or rather derided) he will further have you not to be so Childish, as not to
know, that Idem. Minor est unus digitus quam tota manus, and minor est digitus
unus quam duo; and alibi est iste digitus, alibi ille, alibi coetera manus --
Nec solum immobilibus corporis articulis -- sed etiam aeris parts suos implent
locos -- Lucisque pars alia infunditur per hanc fenestram, alta per aliam, and
major per majorem, per minorem autem minor. Idem Tom, 6. (...) fundament cap.

The little finger is less than the whole hand, and one finger is less than
two, and that one finger is one where, and the other another where. Upon which
where, and where, being notes of distinct places; we may ask, where are your
Disputers now? Nay yet furthermore, passing from grosser Bodies, he says as
much of Air; yea, and of the most subtle of subtills, the light of the Sun;
one part whereof (says he) comes in at one window, another at another
window, yet so, that the less passes through the less, and the greater
through the greater.

Moreover, if Saint Gregory once Bishop of Rome had believed that Christ his
Body is whole in every least indivisible part of the Host, he would never
have condemned the Eutychian Heretic for believing Au^ungebat (Haeretious)
omne illud, quod in Domino (...) potuit, post resurrectionem in so^^itatem
aliquam esse redactam. Greg. Exposit. Moral. lib. 14. cap. 31.
The Body of Christ to have bin brought into such a subtilty, that it cannot be
felt. But a greater subtilty there cannot be, than for a divisible Body to be
enclosed in every the least indivisible point. Show us this Doctrine taught by
any Catholic Doctor in the Church, within the compass of the twelve hundred
years after Christ, and then shall we conceive better of your Cause. And lest
you may talk (as you use) of one Body penetrating another, we lay unto you,
as Damascen said unto his Reader, that Damasien. l. 1. de Orthodox (...) (...).
This is impossible, but that either the one or the other must be divided

That the Romish Objections, against our former Tenet, taken from Miraculous
Penetrations, are feeble and vain. SECT. VII.
Miraculous entrance of Christ into the house, the doors being shut; his
coming out of the grave, when it was covered with a sto^e (as some think;) his
Birth from his mother, her womb being shut; besides the miraculous passing of
a Camel through the eye of a needle, spoken of by Christ; all Miraculous
indeed, as we, with many holy Chrysostom. Nazian^^. Aug. Ambros.
Fathers, do willingly Confess. What therefore? Therefore (say you) the Body
of Christ did pass through the substantial dimensions of the Body of the
Doors, Stone, and womb; and Organicall proportions of a Body, in respect of
Space, or Place. So you. We grant unto you as much as these Fathers speak, in
noting each of these to have been the Acts, and works of Omnipotency, but
yet without any penetration of Dimensions at all, or yet Alteration of the just
proportion of Christ's Body. Which penetration of Dimensions seemed to your

Durand as incredible, as unto us; and is Impossibil^m etiam (...) hac putat

Impossible.

The principal Testimony, which is insisted upon, concerning the Doors, is the
saying of Chrysostom, viz. (...). Chrysostom. Hom. ^7. in Ioh. 21. [but according
to the Latin Edition, Hom. 86. super Ioh. 20. This testimony was objected
against P. Mar^^ in the Disp. at Oxo^. fol. 60.]
Christ's Body was thin, or small, changed from [(...)] that is, it is
thickness, impalpable unto mortal man's hand, but only by Divine permission
and dispensation. So he. And this is alleged for proof of a Possibility of
his now Corporal Presence in the Sacrament, void of Palpabilitie: never
considering the Ordinary and confessed Hyperboles, wherewith Chrysostom
embellisheth his Sermons; insomuch that we may oppose Chrysostom against
Chrysostom, even in the point in question: who elsewhere speaking of this
Sacrament, says that Christ herein Book 3. cap. ^. Sect. 6.
Gives his Body both to be felt and seen; whereas every Priests hands and eyes
can testify the contrary.

* Would ye understand the judgment of Chrysostom. de Resurrect. Hom. 9. Non est
meum ludificare meos phantalmate, etc. See this Testimony above Book. 3. Chap.
3.. 9.
Chrysostom indeed? then leaving his Amphibologies, consult with him in his
plain and direct Assertions, where he doubts not to say, that If Christ at
his Resurrection had offered his Disciples only an Image of his Body, to the
deceiving of their eyes, it had been a Delusion. Next that, Howsoever the
sight of his Disciples might have been deceived, yet their touch could not
err, in discerning a true Body. And is it not then a mavelous Infatuation in
your Professors, who whilst they Taste, See, and Touch Bread in the Sacrament,
believe contrary to their senses, that they are mere Accidents? Thirdly, in
Conclusion, he says that his Passing through the Door was not in his Humane
Substance alone, but by his Divine virtue. What can this mean, but that the
Penetration made was not by extenuation of his Body, but by the Omnipotent
power, constraining the place to make a passage to his Bodily Substance? *

For what? that Christ his Body, in passing through the Door, should not
always have been palpable in it self? The Fathers of the General Council
at Ephesus would have protested against this, whose Resolution is, that Conc.
Ephesians. Tom. 5. Cap. 1. Anathem. 3. Non alien^u esse ab illo corpus, quod sibi
univit, quod ubique palpabile, and aspectabile existit.
The Body which Christ united to his God head is palpable: but you will ask
then, how could it pass through either Stones, or Doors, without penetration
of Dimensions, or else by an extreme tenuity of the Body it self? We answer,
that the Divine power constrained the Stone and Doors to yield a passage, the
Thickness of his Body continuing the same. We have Hierome for the first part
Hier. Creatura cessit Creatori.
The Creature (says he) yielded to the Creator? and ancient Iustine, for the
second, most aptly, and exactly, Justin Martyr quaest. ad Orthodox Quest. 117.
page 363. (...) etc.
As Christ did tread the Water, not by changing his Body into Spirit, but by
his Divine power: So he passed through both Doors and Sepulcher being shut, by
his Divine power, above nature, in his unaltered Body. He proceeds, showing
how; even as was his walking, by his Divine power working upon the water,
without any Alteration of his Body, more than was of the Body of Peter, who was
enabled by the same power to tread the water.

* The Alteration then was not in his Body, but in the other things, such as
were the Doors, through which he passed: Cyri^. Alexandr. in Johan. lib. 12.
cap. 53. Clausis foribus Dominius omnipotentia, sua, superata natura rerum,
intravit.
The nature of things being overcome by Christ's Omnipotency, he made his
entrance, as says Cyrill of Alexandria. And why should not the Creature yield
(...) Creator, rather than the Creator to the Creature? Will you give you
Jesuit Lessius license to interpose his judgment, who maintaining a
Possibility of a manner of Penetration of a Body by a Body, yet discussing the
manner [How, will tell you that (...). Ex quibus patet, juxta hanc sen^^^^ (...)
penetr (...) ponere in ip^s beatis, nisi potentam quindam mor^^^, quae in eo
consisti^, quod Deus (...), ipsis volentibus, assistere ad hunc effectum. Lib.
7. cap 9.
It is done not by the Quality, whether natural, or Supernatural in a
glorified Body; but by Gods immediate Assistance: and that the Saints
themselves (who are said to penetrate other bodies with their bodies) have no
other power than that which may be called moral, which is to be willing to
pass through any body: and God, according to their wills, assiteth to work the
effect. *

Each of which Sayings of the Fathers, professing a Body of Christ palpable,
(whether Thin with Chrysostom, or Thick with Iustine) do confute your
Tridentine Faith in believing a Body of Christ whole in the whole, and whole in
every least part of the Host, as unpalpable to man, as you have said it is
invisible to the Angels themselves: which is to bring it to such a Subtilty, as
will draw you whether you will or no into a kindred with Eutychian Heretics,
who (as your Aquinas par. 3. quaest: 54. art. 2. Respondeo. Vide corpus Christi

Some more difficulty you suppose to be in the manner of Christ his Birth,
whereunto when we answer, that Christ in his Birth opened the Womb of his
Mother, although without violation of her Sacred Vessel, we are therefore
presently branded by your Bellar. lib de notis Eccles. cap. 9. Sander. de visib

Fathers, Origin, Tertullian, Ambrose, Gregory Nyssen, Epiphanius, Hierome,
Theophylact, Eusebius. So he. A fair company of fellow Heretics with
Protestants, we trow: to whom the same Jesuit joyneth diverse Doctors of your
Romish Church, whom he calls Docti and Catholici. Thus your own spirit of
Contradiction, whereas two words might have quit the Heresy, maintained the
Miracle, and defended the Integrity of that sanctified Womb of the Blessed
Virgin, (to wit) that the Virginal cell might be said to open it self, which
was shut in respect of other Women (who necessarily suffer violent rupture by
the Birth)

Furthermore hearken to the Answer of some other Doctors of your Church, and
you shall find your own Doctrine to smell rank of the Heresy of the
Marcionites, in the opinion of the forecited ancient Fathers; for your
forenamed Apud Maldon. Ies. in Luc. ^ Id Patrea dixisse ardore abreptos
disputationis contra Marcionitas, ne Christum corporeum phantasma facere
viderntur, si dixissent matris uterum non aperuisse.
Jesuit tells you of some Doctors in your Church (whom he himself
approves) who taught that The Fathers, who said that Christ did open the
Matrix of his Mother, spoke it in the heat of Dispute against the Heretical
Marcionites, who denied that Christ So they. Which proves, that in the
judgment of those Ancient Fathers, all your defense, in this Case, is at least
Fantastical. Let Isiodore Pelusiota his sufferage be aded to the rest, who in
an Epistle calmely, and as it were in cool blood, teaches that Ibid.

As for the Entrance of the Matt. 19. 24
Camel, which is said by Christ, to pass through the eye of a needle; the
subtlty of your Objection is not so needle-sharpe, but that it may be easily
blunted: for Christ spoke by way of comparison, and employed as well an
Impossibility, as a Possibility. Thus; as it is simply Impossible for a Camel
(be it Rope, or be it Beast) to pass through the eye of a Needle, retaining
the same Dimension and Property: so is it Impossible for a Rich man, so long as
he has on him a great Bunch or grossness of confidence in his riches, and
worldly possible for God, by his miraculous power so to contract the Camel,
that it may pass through the Needles eye; so is it as possible to him, by his
Omnipotent power of Grace to abate the swelling bunch of worldly Confidence in
the heart of the Rich-man, that he, being truly mortified, may repose his
whole trust in God himself, and at length enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

* This you might have learned from Saint Hierome, who says that in this
Similitude Hieron. advers. pelag. lib. 2. Vnde difficultas difficultati, imo
impossible impossibili comparatur, quia nec Camelus potest intrare per foramen
acus, nec divites in Regnum Dei.
Impossibility is compared with so living and dying, as making Mammon their
God; and not using them unto works of Piety and Charity; for so the same holy
Father expresses himself, Hieron. in Matthew. 19. v. 24. Sed si legamus Esaram,
quomodo Cameli Madiam and Epha veniant Jerusalem cum donis atque mu^^^bus: and
qui p^ius curvi erant, and vitiorum pravitate distot^i, ingrediantur port^s
Jerusalem: videbimus quomodo ^sti Cam^li, quibus Divites comparantur; cum
dep^^^^^ grave in Sarcia^^^ peccatorum, and totius corporis privitatem intrare
possint per a^gustam portam.
As the Camels Beasts to whom the rich are resembled) could pass through the
straight gate of Jerusalem, as soon as they were disburthened of their loads;
So Rich men, casting off the load of their sins, may enter

A Vindication of Truth against an Objected Testimony under the name of Pope
Hilary, for proof of the Being of the whole Body of Christ in every part of
the Host
WE are to insert in this place the (forgotten) Objected words, which pass
under the name of Pope Hilarie, and recorded in your Papal decrees, Decret. de
Consecratione Did. 2. [Vbi pars.] ex Hilario Papa. Vbi pars est corporis est
and totum: eadem est ratio in corpore Domini q^ae est in Manna, quod in cjus
figura praecessit; de quo dicitum, Qui plus collogerat' non habuit amplius:
neque qui minus (...) hab^^^ minus. Non enim est quantites visibilis aestimanda
in hoc mysterio, sed virtus (...) spiritualis (...)? Non est quantitas
aestimanda, ut sub minori quantitate minus sic Corpus Christi, and sub (...).
where there is part of Christ's Body, (in the Sacrament) there is the whole:
there being the same reason of this as there was of Manna, whereof it is
written, He that gathered much had no more than others: and he that gathered
not so much had no whit less. Which your Romish Gloss applies to the
Sacrament, to signify that There is no less quantity of Christ's Body, under a
less quantity of the Sacrament; none greater, under a greater.

Our Answer is Threefold. I. That your Doctors could never yet prove the
writings, which go under the name of Popes Legate qai velit nostri Roberti Coci
Censuram Scriptorum.
Decret all Epistles to have been truly theirs, whereof Body of Christ to be
whole in the whole, and in every the least imaginable part of the Host,
without all manner of situation therein, so, as not having the Head above, and
the Feet below. This you cannot deny to be your own positive Tridentine
Sense. But the Manna, which was diminished and augmented in Quantity by Gods
providence, had notwithstanding a certain Every man a Gomer, according to
their families namely every one an equal, but yet a several measure and
Quantity; for one man's Manna was not the same which another had. This agrees
not with your Corporal eating of one, and the same Body of Christ. Next, the
Granes of the same Manna (for it was like Coriander-seed) had their several
situations and distinct places in every Gomer, some lying above, and some
below, some on the right side, and some on the left side of the Measure; which
differences you absolutely whole Christ, by Faith, whether in a Greater or
lesser Host, without all proportioning of his Bodily Dimensions. *

CHALLENGE.
SHall not then the Novelty of your Romish Article, which was Contradiction to
your own Romish Principle? Shall not the express Testimony of Saint
Augustine, who as he was universally acknowledged to be a Catholic Father; so
was he never condemned by any other Catholic Father for this his Doctrine
concerning the Existence of Bodily parts according to proportionable Dimensions
of Space? Finally, shall not the affinity, which your opinion has with
damnable Heresies, persuade you of the falsity of this your Romish Faith?


Of the fifth Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] as the
same Body is now considered to be most perfect, by making it most Imperfect.
NOne will think we need to impose any absurd Doctrine upon your Church; the
Absurdities which we have already heard professed therein, under the
testifications of your own Disputers, having been so marvellously and
palpably absurd, as has been shown. Among which we may reckon this, that
follows, as not the least prodigious Consequence of your Romish Corporal
Presence

That your Church of Rome allows a Doctrine, teaching a Body of Christ, now
glorified, to be destitute of natural and voluntary motion of Sense, and of
Understanding. SECT. II.
Catholic Faith never conceived otherwise of the humane Jesuit Suarez. Ies.
Dico secundo corpus Christi, ut est in hoc Sacramento, potest per se moveri
localiter a Deo: loquor de potentia Dei absoluta, Nam juxta legem statutam

Suarez, and other Romish Doctors: First, that Christ, as he is in this
Sacrament, has no power naturally of himself to move himself. And this your
own daily experience has brought you unto; whilst believing Christ's
Corporal Presence in the Host, you shut him up in a Box, where you still
find the same lying as destitute of power of motion, as any other unconsecrated
Bread; which being put together with it lies so long, until they both equally
wax moldy, putrify, and engender worms. Secondly, that Christ in himself,
as being in this Sacrament, has no natural faculty of sense, nor ability
(without a miracle) to hear or see, etc. Thirdly, That he is void of all
sensible appetite. Lastly, that (without some miraculous power) he cannot
possibly apprehend in his understanding any thing present, nor yet remember any
notions past. So he.

potest, nec actionem transientem agere. Communis opinio est Scoti, Christus non

vast and wild Paradoxe of an Existence of Christ's Body in this Sacrament

well that you would take the Testimonies of your other two Jesuits for a
supplement: as namely of Vasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. qu 76. Art. 7. Disp. 191. c.

Gordon, affirming the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, to be
Plainly after a deadly manner, as he was in the grave, neither hearing, nor
seeing, nor exercising any virtuall Act *

That this is a new, brutish, and barbarous Doctrine, destitute of all
HAve you any Text, yea or yet pretext either of Scripture, or humane Tradition
for countenancing this so prodigious and monstrous a conception? Certainly
Scripture tells us, that Christ his Body by Resurrection is perfected in
Sense, and Agility; and his soul in Judgment, and Capacity. Nor can you show
any Father in the Church of Christ, within the Circumfrence of 1400. years
after Christ, who held this your doctrine so much as in a Dream; or who has
not esteemed the Body of Christ to be of the most absolute perfection: we say
no one Father, or Teacher of the Evangelicall Truth once fancied this
un-christian, and false faith. * No, no; your own Fran. Collius lib. 5. De
sanguine Christi, Disp. 5. cap. 1. Athanasius Sermon. 2. in illa verba ad Philip.
2. [Propter quod Deus eum exaltavit] Hic solus e mortu^s integer resurrexit. Et
libro de Incarnat. verbi, Cum omni integritate surrexit: quae est Patrum omnium
doctrina. Et Leo Papa Tract. explicans illud. 2. Cor. 5. [Cognovimus Christum
secundum carnem.] Christi corpus post Resurrectionem factum. est Impassibile --
nihil in eo enim infirmum remansit.
Doctor of Theology will tell you, out of Athanasius, (of many surnamed the
Great) and out of Pope Leo (whom you your selves instiled Great, Both so
entitled for their singular worthiness) Christ rose again Perfest in his
Body, So Athanasius. And that No infirmity remained in him. So Leo. And
adds of himself, that All the Fathers were of the same Judgment. If so,
then were they directly Adversaries to your prodigious Belief, except you will
dare to say that Blindness, Deafness, and Senslesnesse are no Infirmities.

We return to the written word of God. When the Apostle, for the magnifying
of the perfection of Christ's glorious Resurrection, as the Head, by Analogy
with the Phil. 3. He shall transform our vile Bodies, and make them
conformable to his own glorious Body, (namely) according to those Celestial
Dotes and Indowments, set down 1. Cor. 11. Incorruption, Immortality, Glory,
Power. By all which the excellency of the Corporal state of the Saints is
delineated; whereby to excite all the faithful to possess their bodies in
sanctity, and to prepare them to Martyrdom, for the hope-sake of the glory,
whereof it is said; The afflictions of this life are not worthy of the glory
that shall be revealed. We suppose the Apostle could not then dream of a Body
of Christ, without faculty of Sense, or power of Motion. * You must therefore
derive this from him, whom Christ calls the Father of lies. We shall give
you good reason for this our Declamation.

That this Romish Doctrine is Blasphemously Derogatory from the Majesticall
Body of Christ.
WHat is this, which we have heard? Christ his humanity, after his Resurection,
not to have so much Capacity as a Child; which is (as he is here) to
understand or imagine any thing done? not the power of a Moale, or Mouse; which
is to hear, or see? not the faculty of a little Ant, so as to move it self?
as if this were not an Antichristian Blasphemy against that all-Majesticall
Body, and humane nature of Christ: which being 1. Cor. 15. 44
Sown in Infirmity, is (as the Scripture says) since risen in power. Do you
hear? In power, says the Spirit of God, showing that Infirmity is changed
into Potencie, in the Body of every Christian: and you have turned Power into
infirmity, even in Christ himself, whom you have now transformed into an Psalm.
116.
Idol having eyes, and sees not, ears, and hears not, feet, and walks
not, heart, and imagines not: and yet this you profess to adore, as the
person of the Son of God. O the strength of Satanicall Delusion?

That this Romish Doctrine contradicts your own Principle. SECT. V.
REmember your See above, (...)
former general Principle, which we acknowledged to be sound and true, viz.
All such Actions and Qualities, which are real in any Body, without any
relation to Place, cannot be said to be multiplied in respect of diverse places,
wherein a Body is supposed to be. As for example: The Body of The reason. These
are impossible (say you) because of Contradiction: for that the same thing
should be capable of such Contrarieties, it is repugnant to the understanding
of man. So you; which is an infallible Truth, when the Modus, or Manner of a
thing is compared to it self, and not to any thing else: it is necessary that
at one and the same time the Modus be only one, the same Jesuit cannot be
sick in Iapan, and sound and in health at Rome, in the same instant.

* Take you, for a Conclusion, the Confession of your much approved Doctor, who
doubts not to call the opinion, which holds that [The Body of Christ is
imperfect] to be Petrus Arcad. Corcyren. de Concord. Eccles. Occid. and Orient.
Anno 1626. (Approbantibus Episcopo Bargi, Episc. Zacinth. Andraea Eud^emone
Ioh. and Doctoribus Facult. Parisien. Tract. de Eucharistia. Dicere corpus
Christi esse quandoque imperfectum, est mira blasphemia.
Blasphemous, Nor may you deny the Disabilitie of Motion in Christ's Body to be
an Imperfection, seeing that, as the Head of your Church taught (that which all
Christian, Churches Innocent 3. Papa de offic. M^ssae. lib 3. cap. 22. Quatuor
sunt corporis glorificati propriae qualitates, Claritas, subtilitas, Agilitas,
and Impassibilitas.
Agility is a proper (...) of every glorified Body, wheresoever it is. And you
may call to mind the Conclusion of your Jesuit Conincks abovementioned, (Cap.
4. Sect. 10.) Showing that for the Same Body to be said to move in one place,
and stand still in another, is as flat a Contradiction, as to say, It is frozen
and warm both at once. Which he confirmed (in the Margin) with several
Reasons, which do accordingly confute your Doctrine of Possibility of the
voluntary Motion of Christ's Body in Impossibility thereof, as it is in this
Sacrament. *

CHALLENGE.
NOw say (we beseech you) is there not the like Contradiction to make the same
Christ, at the same time, as he is in Heaven, Intelligent, and Sensitive; and
as on earth, Ignorant, Senseless? Or Powerful to move of himself on the
Throne of Majesty; and absolutely Impotent, as he is on the Altar? Because
these Attributes, of Christ being Intelligent, and Potent equally, have no
Relation to Place. Notwithstanding all which you shame not to profess a
senseless, ignorant, and feeble Christ. O come out of Babylon, and be no more
bewitched by such her Sorceries.

CHAP. X.
The sixth kind of Romish Contradiction against these words Of Christ [MY BODY,]
as it is now most Glorious, by making it most Inglorious. SECT. I.
BEfore we proceed in discovering the ouglinesse of the Romish Doctrine in this
point, we are willing to hear your In his book of the Liturgy of the Mass
Tract. 2.. 4. Subd. 1.
M. Brerely his preface in your defense: The carnal man (says he) is not for
all this satisfied, but stands still offended at sundry pretended, absurd,
and undecent indignities: Calvin saying, That he rejected them as unworthy of
the Majesty of Christ; And Doctor Willet says, That they are unseemely, and
against the dignity of the glorious and impassible Body of Christ. So he, at
once relating, and rejecting their opinions.

That the Indignities, whereunto the Body of Christ is made subject,
ALl Christian Creeds tell us, that Christ our Savior sits at the right
hand of God, that is, in perfection of glory. But your Jesuit Suarez
delivers it in the general Doctrine of the Suarez. Ies. Dicendum tamdiu

wheresoever the forms of Bread are moved, be it into the dirt, or into the
Dunghill. Secondly, that according to your Potest corpus Christi per accidens

That the Romish fore-sayd Indignities are contrary to holy Scriptures, and
Judgment of Ancient Fathers.
HOly Writ teaches us, that there is as great differerence between the
Humiliation of Christ, when he was on Earth, and his now Exaltation in glory,
in Heaven, as there is between shame, and Glory, it being now 1. Cor. 15.
Philip. 2. 8. 9.
[(...)] A Body of Glory. Now for you to believe and profess the personal
burning, devouring, regorging, yea and the hiding of that glorious Body of
Christ in a dunghill, and the like, are such execrable speeches, as that we
stand astonished with horror to

If this had been the ancient Faith, some Fathers doubtless upon some
occasion, by some one sentence or other, would have revealed their Judgment
therein: from whose diverse and copious Volumes neither do you allege, nor we

That the Romish Answers, for defense of this their vile and beastly Opinion,
are but false and fond. SECT. IV.
IT was said of Philosophers of old that nothing was so absurd, but some one or
other of them would take in hand to defend it: the like may be said of our
Romish Opposites, whereof Card. Bellar. and Master Brereley in places
above cited.
Answers. Both which are taken from the condition of Christ his humane Body,
whilst he was in the World: No^nulli vix far possunt Christu^ quoquo modo
includi in pa^va pixide, cadere in terram, co^mburi, rodi a best^a -- Annon
credunt Christum parvulum inclusum in angustissimo utero? eundem potuisse in

potuisse? si ita pati potuit in propria specie, cur mi^um videtur si illa sine
laesione in specie aliena eidem accidere posse dicamus? Bellar. l. 3 de Euc.
cap. 10.. Denique.
Many (says your Cardinal) can scarce endure to hear that Christ is included
in a Box, fallen to the earth, burnt, or eaten of Beasts: as though we do
not read, that Christ was included in the Womb of the Virgin, lay upon the
Earth, and might without any Miracle have been eaten of Beasts, why may not
such things now happen unto him, but [sine laesione] without any hurt at all.
So he.

School; That the Substance of Christ his Body remains still, although the
Host be eaten with Dogs. But Master Brerely more cunningly, that he might not
only disguise your opinions, but also make Protestants odious, (if it might be)
for their exceptions against them, does readily tell us, that Pagans, Jews,
and Heretics conceived Indignities against some mysteries of Christian
Religion, as So he. Both which Answers are but mere tergiversations, by
confounding the two most different conditions of Christ: That, then in the
state of his humiliation, with This, which is Now in the highest exaltation of
Glory. We therefore rejoyne as follows.

Your Disputers have so answered, as if Christ his Incarnation in the Womb of
a Virgin, his Conversation upon earth, and his Passion upon the Cross were not
objects of Indignity, notwithstanding the Spirit of God, has blazed them to
the world to have been the Indignities of all Indignities, Thus: Philip. 2. 6.
Who being in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal wi^h
God, yet [(...)] made himself of no reputation but took upon him the form of
a servant (such was his Incarnation) and became obedient to death, even (spoken
for aggravating the Indignity thereof) The [shamefull] death of the Cross.
Than which never any thing could make more either for the magnifying of Gods
grace, Ioh. 3. 16.
God so loved the World, that he sent his Son, (namely to suffer) that
whosoever should believe in him should not perish, but have life everlasting.
How could your A^swerers but know, that it was not the observation of the
Indignities, which Christ suffered, that wrought to the condemnation of Pagans,
Jews, and Heretics: but their faithlessenesse, in taking such scandal
thereat, as to deprive themselves, by their Infidelity, of all hope of life by
Christ crucified. Hearken furthermore.

That the state of Christ his Humanity cannot be now obnoxious to bodily
Indignities; and that the Comparing both the Estates (in your answering) is
unworthy the learning of very Catechumenists and Petties in Christian Religion.
SECT. V.
THis Disproportion between Christ his estate in the days of his flesh in
this World, and his now present Condition at the right hand of God, is as
extremely disproportionable as is 1. Cor. 15.
Mortality and Immortality, Shame and Glory, Misery and Blessedness, Earth and
Heaven; that being his state of Humaliation, and this Contrariwise of his
Exaltation, as all Christians know, and profess. And although the Body of
Christ, now in eternal Majesty, be not obnoxious to Corporal injuries, yet
may Moral and Spiritual abasements be offered unto Christ, as well in the
Opinion, as in the Practice of men. Of the Opinion we have an Example in the
Capernaites concerning Christ, whenever he should give his Flesh to be eaten
carnally: for Corinthians, who abusing the Sacrament of the Lord did thereby
contemn him, and were made guilty of high Profanation against the glorious
Body of Christ. And what else sounds that Relative injury against Christ, by
murdering his Saints on earth, complained off by his voice from Heaven; Act.
9. 4.
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

Your Cardinal, in answer to the Objection of Indignity offered to Christ, by
putting him in a Box, and of being Eaten with Worms, and the like; opposed
(as you have heard) saying, Why may not such things now happen unto him but
[sine laesione] that is, without any hurt? We answer, that if he should suffer
nothing in his humanity passively, to the Laesio corporis, that is, hurt of the
Body; yet should there be thereby, in the opinion of men; Laesio dignitatis,
that is, a lessening and obscuring of that his Dignity, which is set forth in
Scripture, and which our Article of faith, concerning his Bodily sitting at the
right hand of God in Heaven, teaches us to be in all Celestial glory and
Majesty. Aquinas well saw, when in regard of Indignity he judged it Nesas nunc
esset Christum in propria specie in pixi^le includi putare. A. quin. part. 3.
quaest. 76. art. 8.
An heinous wickedness for any to think Christ should be enclosed in a Box,
appearing in his proper form. And what greater difference can it be for a Body
to be Boxed under another form, more than when that one, and the same Person
is known to be imprisoned, whether open-faced, or covered, whether in the day,
or in the night, it mattereth not much, for still the same person is shut up in
prison? Again, if that these Circumstances now spoken of were not Arguments of
Indignity, why do your Jesuits, in a point of Opinion, deny that
Transubstantiated into the flesh of the Communicant, because of the Sea
hereafter Book 5. Chap. 7.. ^.
Indignity against his Majesty?

Come we to the point of Practice. Let this be our Lesson; when there is
Reverence in the use of a thing, then there may be Irreverence, and Indignity
in the abuse thereof. But your Church has provided that the Priests Beards be
shaven, and that the Laics abstain from the Cup, in a pretense of Reverence.
The first, lest some part of the Host (which you believe to be Priest's Beard;
the second, lest any whit of Christ's Blood in the Cup should be spilt. But how
much more Indignity must it needs be, to be devoured of Mice, Worms, and
sometimes (as your own See above in this Book C. 2. Sect. 2.
stories have related) kept close in a Dunghill? One word more. If these seem
not sufficiently indigne, because there is not Laesio corporis, Hurt to the
Body, (this being your only Evasion) what will you say of your framing a
Christ unto your selves, who as he is in this Sacrament, Is (you say) without
power of motion, of sense, and of understanding? Why, my Masters, can there be
Lamenesse, Blindness, Deafness, and Impotencie it self, without Hurt of the
same party so maimed? etc. This is worse than Dunghill.

amongst you, most plausible) Defense of your seeming Romish Absurdities, in
Master Fishers Answer to KING JAMES, of Blessed and ever surviving Memory.
SECT. VI.
Compendium, which consists of two Generals, and of diverse Particulars. His
two Generals are his Position, and Supposition.

Master Fisher his General Position, for Defense of Romish Absurdities, the
Consequences of your Transubstantiation.
Numb. 1.
A Christian Catholic (says he) Seeing in the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
many seeming Absurdities that press carnal Imaginations to the ground, grows
more and more strong to believe them, embracing these difficulties, as signs
of that doctrine which was believed of the Primitive Church. -- And again, The
seeming Absurdities should rather incline a Christian to believe this mystery.

Our Reply in General, to prove that his former Assertion may truly be termed
For if the Absurder a thing be, it shall deserve a more belief; then the
Pagans (of whom Tully could say, There is nothing so Absurd, which is not
taught of some Philosopher, even to the affirming of Snow to be Black,) should
be held to be more faithful, than the best of Christians: and Heretics, who
have turned their Fantastical dreams into Articles of Faith, should be
judged to be more true Believers, than are true Catholics. And sure we are
that, by this Position, the Left hand was his Right, should be esteemed no
less Faithful, than the Papist, who by like Doctrine of blind Obedience have
professed that Christ his Body, being in diverse Hoasts, takes the Right hand
and left hand of it self. And by the same Assertion shall Master Fisher think
himself to be a better Catholic than were any of the ancient Fathers, or yet
any Romish Doctor, yea or than is M. Fisher himself, as will appear in the
sequel of our Reply.

The second General is, Master Fisher his Supposition.
Numb. 2.
Master Fisher his Supposition is, That although the Absurdities, which are
imputed by Protestants to your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, seem to be
such, Because they are not apprehensible by reason, yet are they therefore
(says he) the rather to be believed, notwithstanding whatsoever
Impossibilities that can be pretended. So he. Our Confutation must be
accordingly twofold: The first in respect of Impossibilities, and the next of
Indignities.

Our Reply, displaying the Absurdity of Master Fishers Supposition in respect
of Impossibilities, by the General Doctrine of Fathers, Consent of Romish
Divines, and by his own particular Praevarication.
First the Ancient Fathers, of the Primitive age, have unanimously professed a
Doctrine of an Absolute Impossibility in all such things which imply any
Contradiction, as you have See above in this B. 4. cap. 3. Sect. 2. and 3.
heard; and maintaining this Doctrine of granting an Impossibility in such
Cases to be a Truth greatly magnifying the Omnipotency and Almighty power of
God; even by reason of Contradiction in them, which is an affirming and denying
of the same thing. Concluding furthermore that gainsaying of Impossibility,
in things contradictory, has been anciently The Sanctuary of Heretics. So
the holy Fathers.

Secondly, all the Doctors of the Romish Schools, of whatsoever Age, Sect,
Society, or Denomination, have subscribed to the judgment of those Ancient
Fathers, in the same point of Impossibility, but why Impossibility? Because,
say they, that such things are unconceivible in man's reason, and that they
seem Absurd, because of Contradiction. And hereupon have concluded of many
Impossibilities touching a Body: as for example, See above c. 3.
Impossible for a Body to be produced in diverse places at once: Impossible for
a quantity of a Body not to possess a place: Impossible for Christ's Body, as
in this Sacrament, to go from one place to another: Impossible for the same
Body to be equal with a greater quantity: and many other more Impossibilities
have they reckoned upon the same ground, that the Reason of man could apprehend
nothing in such points but an implication of Contradiction. And now all these
great pillars of Christianity, as well in the Universal Church, Primitive, as
in the now Romish, must, by Master Fishers former Assertion, be held to have
been no better than underminers of the Christian Faith, in that they did not
Rather believe those things to be possible, even because they seemed
Impossible, by reason of Contradiction.

Lastly, to come to Master Fisher his own Praevarication: Mr. Fisher in his
Answer to the (...) upon the seventh point, which is the ^ommunion in both
kinds.
How can the Body of Christ (says he) be without either Blood or Soul
unless it were dead, and so should Christ be massacred in this Sacrament, and
that Eucharist be a Bloody Sacrifice; and Christ glorious in Heaven, cannot say
truly, that a Body void of Soul, Blood, and Sense is his Body: Yea as (Calvin
himself confesses) It is an Absurd manner of speech to term Christ, the mere
Body of Christ. So he. Whereupon he will be found so implicated within the
hor^es of a Dilemma, that he cannot expedite himself: For say, good Master
Fisher, should a Christian man (as you have said) the rather believe a Doctrine
because it seems to be Absurd? (we speak of sensible Objects) why then do
you not believe these Absurdities, which you your self now do so utterly
Rather believing things, because of their seeming Impossiblities? So easy it
is for a Patron of Absurdities to prove himself notably Absurd.

Master Fisher his General Supposition, in respect of Seeming Indignities,
happening to the Body of Christ, from the Doctrine of Transubstantiation.

As he said of Absurdities in respect of Impossibility, so does he also
argue from Seeming Indignities,condemning Protestants for arguing against
Transubstantiation, because of Seeming Indignities: As in not conceiving
Christ's Body (says he) to be combined unto the Consecrated forms of Bread,
and not to be polluted with such Indignities and Obscenities. So he.

Our Reply.
Corporal hurt or pollution. There were, and are amongst the Romish See Book
5. cap. 7. Sect. 1.
Professors, (and that no small Babes) who have taught a properly Mingling of
Christ's Flesh, with the flesh of him that Communicates of this Sacrament: and
have been Confuted by your own Jesuits for the same Opinion, judging it to
be Rash, Absurd, and Repugnant to the Majesty of the Sacrament. Your Aquinas
(as you have See the former section.
heard) held it an Heinous wickedness for any man to think that Christ should
be enclosed in a Box, appearing in his proper form. Nevertheless Master
Fisher (as the Cat that covers her excrement with dust) meant by this his
former Answer to cover, or at leastwise color your Romish Barbarous
Indignities, in professing the Sea Book 5. cap. 7.
Cleaving of Christ's Body unto your guts, the vomiting of it, and a passable
transmitting thereof unto the Seege, and other the like execrable Romish
Indignites against the Body of Christ, so as the holy Fathers abhorred the very
thought thereof. But we chose rather to confute Master Fisher, by Master
Fisher himself; who, in his Answer to Saint Augustine, (who called the
Capernaiticall manner of Eating Christ's Flesh Flagitious) says, that Saint
Augustine excluded the gross imagination of Eating Christ's Body in his proper
Shape, tearing it in pieces with their teeth. Do you not hear? The opinion of
Tearing Christ's Flesh with men's teeth in his Proper Shape, he termed Gross, or
Absurd.

Do you but now compare this his Confession with his former Assertion, which
was, that we are Rather to believe a doctrine, because it seems Absurd; and
then try him when you please how he will avoid this Dilemma. Either ought
Master Fisher to believe the Eating of Christ's Flesh, in it is Proper Shape, or
he ought not: If he say he ought, then must he turn Capernaite, to believe
the Body of Christ to be eaten with tearing it in pieces with men's teeth in
it is Proper Shape, which he himself disliketh as Gross and Absurd; and Saint
Augustine abhorred as Flagitious. And if he Answer that he ought not, then is
his former Position both Flagitious, Gross, and Absurd, in affirming that A
doctrine is the rather to be believed, because it seems Impossible. From
these Generals, we pass to his Particulars and specialls: to wit in his
particular Exposition, Reasons, Inferences, and Confirmations, etc.

Master Fisher his Particular Exposition of Christ's words [This is my Body] as
the Foundation of the former seeming Romish Absurdities, and Indignities.
He thinking to qualify all the Absurdities and Indignities, which
necessarily follow upon your Romish Exposition of Christ's words, as being the
foundation thereof, in the First place insisteth upon Christ's speech [This is
my Body,] Why should Catholics fear (says he) any hard Sentence in respect
of their prompt Credulity of Gods word taken in a plain and proper Sense? So
he.

Our Reply, revealing the Absurdities both of the Romish Exposition, and of
their Deduction of Transubstantiation from thence.
His Defense is, that the Speech of Christ is to be interpreted plain and
proper Sense. Now whatsoever Relation the word [THIS] has in Christ's Speech,
it cannot, without Absurdity, be taken in a proper and literal Signification,
even by the Confession of your Romish Doctors themselves; as has been See
Book 2. cap. 1.
plentifully proved. For if (as some of them affirm) the Pronoune [This (...)
be referred to Christ's Body; as if Christ had said [This my Body is my Body:]
This Exposition has bin exploded by some Romish Doctors, of best note in your
Church, expressly calling it an Exposition very absurd in Tautologie. And if
the same [This] should betoken a Third thing, named an Individuum vagum, or
confused Substance, (which is your Second Romish Exposition) this likewise has
been scornfully rejected by other of your Jesuits and Doctors, as an
Interpretation full of Absurdities. And lastly, if it shall be said to relate
to [Bread,] as to be said [This Bread is my Body in a proper and literal
Sense; All your Romish Disputers, with one Consent, abandon this also, as no
less false, than for to say a Man is an Ass, or (as one of them feared not to
write) to affirm Christ to be Judas.

[This is my Body] were taken properly, yet the Doctrine of Transubstantiation,
which you do erect upon this foundation, would prove to be truly Absurd and
Impossible, even by the Confession of your own Romish Doctors themselves, who
are, in their patronizing of your Article of Transubstantiation, distracted
into two contrary Opinions; some saying that the Change, called
Transubstantiation, is made by Production of Christ's Body out of Bread: Not
so, says the other Party, holding this manner of Change as See above, Book 3.
Chap. ^.. 1.
Absurd, as to affirm Christ's Body to have had any Existence, before Christ
had spoken these words. The Second manner maintained by a later sort is a Change
of Bread into Christ his Body, by Adduction of the Body of Christ unto Bread:
No, says the Former; Because this Change is but the changing of one Substance
into the place of another, and therefore a Translocation only, and no
Transubstantiation. Now all these Three Interpretations (and Three are all)
together with your Two manners of Change of Christ's Body thereby, being thus
utterly rejected by your own Divines; let us argue the Point with you upon
these Premises. Either all your other Doctors, who have cashiered all the
former Senses of Christ's Words, even because of Absurdities, had been
Faithless; or else your Jesuit Master Fisher (which consequently follows
thereon) in concluding that your Romish Doctors are Rather to be believed,
because they seem to be Absurd, was no better than Fantastical.

Master Fisher his Particular Reason, for Defense
Numb. 6.
The Primitive Church (says he) preaching to Jews and other Infidels the
rest of the other Mysteries, as of the Trinity, and Incarnation; yet kept
secret as much as might be the Knowledge of the Mysteries of the Eucharist: yea
the Catechumenes and Novices before Baptism were not fully instructed therein.
And their Reason was, lest one should be scandalized, and the other mocked.
This supposed,

Our Reply, noting a double Error in Mr. Fisher's Reason.
His first Error is, that he supposes that The Primitive Church did
absolutely conceal the Eucharist from Pagans and Catechumenists, and that more
precisely than any other Mysteries; each of which are See Book 7. cap. 3.
proved to be false. For neither could the Mystery of the Eucharist be said to
have been concealed, which the Fathers both preached in their Sermons, and
expressed in their public Writings (as is to be seen in the Books of
Iustine, Cyprian, and other Fathers:) nor yet can it be truly affirmed that
they more precisely kept secret this Sacrament than the other Mysteries, seeing
the same Primitive Fathers professed as strictly, that They durst not reveal
the Sacrament of Baptism either to Pagans or Catechumenists, as they did the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, as will be proved at large in the Seventh Book.

His Second Absurdity is to be seen in his Comparison Trinity and of the
Incarnation of Christ, are above man's Capacity and Reason, being only to be
apprehended by Faith, and therefore ought men to inthrall their Reason to
believe what the Romish Church teaches, concerning the Eucharist, and not
examine their Mysteries of Transubstantiation, which implies an Absolute
Absence (in this Sacrament) of the Substance of Bread, and an Existence of the
Natural Body of Christ. Whereas, indeed, there cannot be a more absurd
Comparison; because the Mystery of the Trinity, and manner of Hypostaticall
Union of the Godhead and Manhood of Christ, are Objects transcendently
spiritual, and matters of Infiniteness in themselves: but the matters of all
Sacraments, are Corporal Objects of Sense, and therefore discernable thereby,
and subject to the Examen of Reason, according to the Practice, and See Book 3.
Conclusions Contarenus Cardinal. Tractat. de officio Ep. lib. 1. Dei
cognitionem Summam appellat scientiam divinae ignorationis -- Dei namque

Contarenus teaches you out of Dionysius Areopagita, that our chief Knowledge
of God is our Ignorance of him: because the knowledge of those things, which
ought to be believed concerning God, differ from the knowledge of all other
things, in this, that they excede all aprehension of man's mind.

Master Fisher his Inference, upon his former Supposition.

This being supposed, (says he) I infer that the Seeming Absurdities of
Catholic Real Presence should encourage a true Christian mind to believe it,
as to that which was believed in the Primitive Church, although accompanied
with so Seemingly Gross Absurdities: as being of things above our
Imaginations. So he.

Our Reply, noting the Absurdity of his Inference upon his false Supposition.
The Supposition having been proved to be false, concerning Primitive Fathers,
his Inference from thence cannot be Really true: which we shall now confute by
the Sayings of your own Doctors. For if Romish Doctrines, concerning the
Eucharist, were therefore the Rather to be believed, because that they were
accompanied with Seeming Absurdities; then was it either Faithlesnesse or
extreme Folly in your own Romish Divines, who reasoned Contrariwise (to give
you Five Examples instead of fivescore.) I. Gabriel Biel against the Motion of
Christ's Body from one place into another; and so to East and West both at
once; which (says he) were See above, Chap. ^. Sect. ^.
Absurd and Ridiculous. II. Your Jesuit Coninks against the Possibility of
Christ's Body to move and to be still, in the same Instant, gain-sayth it;
Ibid. cap.
Because that is (says he) altogether Inconceivable. III. Pope Innocent
against the Possibility of Christ's Body to be Mortal and Immortal at once;
See Book 4. Chap. ^. Sect. ^.
Because (says he) it is Incredible. And IV. (as other of your Ibid. See the
Marginells.
Theologues in the same place do affirm) Because it is Repugnant to the
Understanding of man. V. Your Collius, Declaming against pretended Miraculous
Issues of Christ's Blood out of the Eucharist, and sometime out of Images,
impugneth it, saying, Book 4. Ca. 2. Sect. 6. and 7.
Whose ears can abide to hear such a Copy and abundance of Blood of Christ
to be separated out of his Veins now after his Resurrection? yea, who without
horror can think thereof? He that believes this, let him hear that notable
Saying of Solomon [Hee that is sudden (or easy) of Belief is of a light and
unconstant heart.] Nor could such Copy of Blood issue out, without some
injury to the Perfection of his Glorious Body. So they. Which Sentence of
Solomon, if Master Fisher had truly had by heart, he could never have held
your Romish Doctrines to be the Rather Credible, because of their Seeming
Absurdities.

Master Fisher his particular Romish Instances of Seeming Absurdities.
Numb. 8.

As for Example, I. That a Body so big should be in so little an Host. II.
That a Body so Glorious should be subject to such Indignities and Obscenities.
III. That the same Body should be in innumerable places at once. IV. That Bread
being converted into the Body of Christ, the sole Accidents should remain,
performing the office of the Substance even to the nutrition of man's Body.
These Difficulties scandalize Protestants, and thereupon they hold the Doctrine
of Transubstantiation to be Absurd and Ridiculous, but we must not depend upon
our Senses. So he.

Our Reply, especially out of the Fathers, for Discovery of Master Fishers
Falsehood in pretending the Patronage of Antiquity, for Defense of these
Particular Romish Absurdities.
Master Fisher, in his former Inference, pretended the Belief of the Primitive
Church, as holding of Seeming Absurdities, as being things above Imaginations:
and now insisteth Seeming Absurd Tenants, if they should be judged by our
Senses; as though this had been the Doctrine of Primitive Antiquity, whereas
indeed he could not have done a greater injury to the Church Primitive, which
is ready to Contradict him in each Particular.

The First objected Seeming Absurdity of the whole Body of Christ in so little
an Host; or (as your Tridentine Fathers said) In every least part thereof, was
contradicted by Saint Book 4. cap. 8. Sect. 6.
Augustine, holding it Incredible, as well as by some of your Schoolmen, who
judged it Monstrous; and as much as to make the Nose of Christ to stand
together with his Heel; and so to make his Body a Confused See Book 4 c. 8.
Sect.
Chaos.

The Second, That a Body so glorious should be subject to such Indignites and
Obscenities, was contradicted by all these holy See Book 5. throughout.
Fathers, who have gain-sayd The Eating of Christ with Teeth, The devouring
with the Throat, and abhorred the passing it down through the Entrails into
the Draught, as vile and execrable Indignities.

The Third, which is The being of the same Body of Christ in innumerable places
at once. A Doctrine unanimously contradicted by See Book 4. cap 6.
Ancient Fathers teaching: I. Circumscription to be Inseparable from a Body:
II. Proving thereby Christ's Humanity to be a creature, and not God, because
Circumscribed in one place: And III. The Holy Ghost to be God, and no creature,
because not Circumscribed in one place.

The Fourth, That Sole Accidents should remain and nourish man's Body; which
one Instance follows two falsehoods: Sole Accidents do remain, without all
Substance of Bread; contradicted by See Book 3. cap 3 12.
Theodoret, your Pope Gelasius, and by other holy Fathers. The other Falsehood
is your professing, that Sole Accidents do nourish the Bodies, whether of Man
or Mouse, (as you teach) But expressly contradicted by the Ancient Father
Gregory Nyssen, who held it Impossible for any thing which is not a Substance
to nourish a Substance.

Lastly to his Additionall; That we are not in the discerning of the matter of
this Sacrament to depend upon our Senses; See Book 3. throughout.
that we see Bread and Wine: the Bread which consists of granes of Corn, and
Wine of Grapes) have justified the Judgment of our Senses in sensible Objects;
and not this only, but by the same Argument taken from our Senses, have
furthermore confuted and confounded both the Heathen Academicks, and Heretical
Marcionites, Manichees, Eunomians, Eutychians, and others the most grossly
Absurd Heretics of those Ancient Fathers ought to have submitted their Faith
to those Absurd and damned Heretics, or else Master Fisher ought to recant
this his pernicious and Heretical Paradox of Believing Doctrines the Rather,
because they seem to be Absurd.

Master-Fisher his Particular Confirmation of one of his Former Instances of a
Body being in diverse places at once, by a quaint example of his own.
Numb. 9.
The Body of Christ (says he) being glorious, is as swift in operation as
any Thought, but a man's Thought is so quick, that one may be by Thought in two
disjoined places at once, for example, in London and at Rome.

Our Reply, detecting the Stupidity of this Objection.
We (to omit that which is more He uses the Common Objection of Man's soul,
and God himself, which has been confuted formerly. See above, cap. 6. Sect.
2.
common) note in Master Fisher, now Objecting his own fancy, not so much a
Seeming Absurdity, as a palpable Stupidity in this his exemplifying the
Possibility of the Being of a Body in diverse places at once, as namely at
London and at Rome. If Master Fisher thinking of Rome, at his being in London,
should say that even then his Thought was Really at Rome; it were London he
himself was; because that every Sober man will believe that Master Fisher, in
thinking of Rome, had his Thought then in his own Brain, and not at Rome. And
though it should be possible for him to think both of Rome and London at once,
yet could not this any way exemplify the Possibility of the Being of one and
the same Body in two places in one moment. For his Thought of London and of
Rome are not one and the same Thought, but as distinct and different about the
subject matters of his Thoughts, as namely the plotting of Treason in Rome, and
practicing and exequuting the same in London should be.

Master Fisher his Particular Confirmation of the Possibility of Accidents to
nourish a Substance, from a rare example of his own.
Numb. 10.
It seems difficult (says he) to conceive that Accidents can perform the
office of any Substance, as to nourish a man: But we should perchance find as

Our Reply, manifesting his Absurd Exemplification.
This his Comparison of Likeness (as any one may discern at the first sight)
consists merely of unlikelihoods, and Dissimilitudes; for he labors to
prove it to be an equal Difficulty for an Accident to nourish a Substance (as
it is in his Examples) as for a Substance to nourish a Substance. The
Absurdity whereof is no less, than for any to argue, that because the Body of
a man does beget a Body; So the shadow thereof can also beget a Body. It is
irksome unto us to have stayed so long in Master Fishers Absurdities, we
hasten to our General Challenge. *


THese above specified Six Contradictions so plainly and plentifully proved by
such forceable Arguments, as the light of Divine Scripture has authorized, the
profession of Primitive Fathers testified, Confessions of Romish Doctors
acknowledged, and the Principles of your own Romish learning in most points
confirmed; your Abrenunciation of your so many Gross Errors may be as
necessary, as your persisting therein will be damnable. Before we can end, we
are to consult with the Fathers Council of Nice, especially seeing that as well
Romanists as Protestants will be known to appeal to that Council.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Canon of the Council of Nice, objected for proof of a Corporal
Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; and
THis (as it is delivered by your Concilij verba. Iterum etiam hic in divina
mensa ne humiliter intenti simus ad propositum panem and calicem, sed

us not here in this Divine Table, bend our thoughts downwards upon the Bread,
and the Cup, which is set before Us, but lifting up our minds let us understand
by faith the Lamb of God, set upon that So the Canon.

The General approbation of this Canon by Both sides. SECT. II.
SCarce is there any one Romish Author, handling this Controversy, who does
not fasten upon this Canon of Nice, for the countenancing of your Romish Mass.

them (Bucer by name) subscribing unto it with his own hand, in these words: So

pains.

was said; [(...), etc.] as much as There, to Here. *

The state of the Difference, concerning
THis (as is propounded by your Cardinal) stands thus. Per Agnum omnes
intelligunt Christum, ut distinguitut contra symbo la, Bellar. quo supra. --
Illi (Protestants) quasi admonea^t, ne quaerendum Christum in Altar^ lapideo.
Sed monte conscendamus ad coelum, in coelo sisum Agnum. -- At vult Concilium,
ut ad sacram ipsam mensam attendamus; sed in ipsa non tam Symbola, quam quae
sub illis latent consideremus. Ibidem per totum.
All (says he) by the Lamb understand Christ as he is distinguished from
the Symbols and Signs upon the Altar. Next, But the Protestants think (says
he) that the Council admonishes not to seek Christ on the Altar, but to
ascend up unto him in Heaven by faith, as sitting at the Right hand of God. But
we all say (says he) that the Council would have us to attend unto the holy
Table (meaning the Altar below) yet so, that we see in it not so much the
outward Symbols, and Signs, as that which lies hid under them, viz. The Body
and Blood of Christ. So he. The difference then between him and us is no
less than the distance between Aloft and Under, that is, between Heaven
above, and Earth below. Let us set forward in our progress, but with easy,
and even paces; to the end you may better understand the strength of our
Proofs, and rottenness of your Objections.

That the Nicene Council is marveilously prejudicial to your Romish Defense:
proved by diverse Observations; Three here. SECT. IV.
Canon. First is the nomination of Bread. Secondly, the mention of two Tables.
Thirdly, the admonition to lift up our minds. Fourthly, the expression of the
Reason thereof. Fifthly, the Confirmation of the same Reason. First, That, which
the Council would that men be not too intent unto, they call Bread after
Consecration; for the Error, which they would have avoided, was either the too
much abasing of this Sacrament (according to your Cardinals Iubet Concilium ut
non inhaereamus speciebus panis and vini; quasi ibi nihil sit, nisi quod oculi
renuntiant. Bellarm. quo supra.
Gloss) and then was it after Consecration; because they needed Bread
unconsecrated; (which you your selves hold to be a common and profane thing:) or
else the Error must have been, as indeed it was, too high a valuation of the
outward Element of Bread, which must needs be so, because it was Consecrated,
and notwithstanding it being so Consecrated, in the Canon it is called Bread.
Which your Fathers of the Council of Trent would not have endured, especially
seeing that we find that your Nic. Cabas^las. Latini dicunt eos, qui panem and
vinum nominant, and tanquam nondum sanctificatis precantur sanctificationem
post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum,] rem supervacuam facere. Expos. Liturg.
c. 29.
Latin Church was offended with the late Greek Church, for calling the parts
of the Eucharist by the terms of Bread and Wine, after the pronunciation of
these words [This is my Body,] by you called the words of Consecration. Besides
they so call them Bread Wine, as they name them Symbols and Signs, which
properly they could not be, until after Consecration.

Secondly, the (...), etc -- (...). Conc. Nicen.
Canon expressly notes and distinguishes two Tables, in respect of place; the
one, as Here; being as much as to say, The Table: and the other opposed
hereunto is instiled, That Table, I say. And now be it known, that [The Table
here] which is not to be represented by the Antithesis of [But that Table] must
necessarily infer two distinct Tables; as, Here, and, There, do prove two
distinct Places: except one can make [That Table Here.] Which I note, in
Confutation of a vain and crotchetive Objector. And, of this Table Here, the
Council forbids Christians to look Too attentively to the thing set before
us: But contrarily, concerning That other Table, they command men to Lift up
their minds aloft. And not thus only, but they also distinguish them, in
respect of their different Objects. The Object of the First Table, Here, they
name Bread, and the Cup, the Objects of Sense: And the other Object, opposed to
this, is that on the other Table, expressed to be the Lamb God, the Object of
our minds.

Thirdly, the Admonition or Caution, which the Council gives concerning the
Bread, is, not to be too intent to it: but touching the Lamb Christ, they
command us to lift up our minds aloft; for so the world (...).
[(...)] does signify; not to be used (we think) for an inward looking into
the sublimiy of the mystery of the matter before us, as your Cardinal
fancieth: but for looking up aloft unto the Lamb of God in Heaven, according
to the Catholic Sense of those words, See hereafter, Book. 7. Chap. 4.. 2.
SVRSVM CGRDA.

The next two Proofs out of the same Canon of Nice, to manifest our Protestant
profession touching the Question in hand. SECT. V.
Our next two Proofs out of the Canon are these. First is their Reason of the
former Caution: The Second, the Canon it self. Why then did those holy Fathers
admonish us, not to be too intent to the Bread and Wine set before us? It
follows; Because they are not ordained to satisfy our Natural man, namely,
by a full Eating and Drinking: but for a Sacramental participation of the
Body, and Blood of Christ, to the sanctifying of our Souls: whereas your
Church does attribute to that, which you eat in this Sacrament, a power of
sanctifying the Body by it is Bodily touch. But much more will the next Proof
undermine your Defense.

To confirm their Reason, why the Sacrament was not ordained for the
satisfying of the natural man, they add saying; For this canse we receive
not much, but little. Which one Clause most evidently proves it to be spoken
of Bread and Wine; and not of the Body, and Blood of Christ: as your general
Roman Catechism (if you have not already learned it) will now teach you to
believe, saying that Catechis. Romans Christum Dominum esse in hoc Scramento non
dicimus, ut parvus aut magnus est, sed ut substantia est. Tract. de Eucha^.
number. 36.
Christ is not great or small in this Sacrament. And indeed none ever said of
the Eucharist, that he ate a little of Christ Body, or a little Christ; but
yet the Sacrament eaten is sometimes more, sometime Canon furthermore speaks
of taking a little of that, whereof if much were taken (says it) it might
satiate the natural man. So the Canon. But that the outward Sacrament can
truly satisfy the natural man, you your selves will testify in your
Booke-Cases and Missals, See Book, 3. chap. 3.. 10. Chap 6.. 1. and 2.
acknowledging men Drunk with the Sacrament, even unto vomiting with the one
part thereof, and also making mention of Men, and Mice being fed and nourished
with the other. So then the natuturall man may be satiated with this Sacrament;
but with what therein? The Body and Blood of Christ? you abhor to think
that, with Accidents? You may be ashamed to affirm it, as from the J^dgement
of Antiquity, seeing you were never able hitherto justly to produce one Father
for proof of the Existence of Accidents without their Subjects: or of
nourishing a Substance by mere Accidents.

Wherefore until you can prove some one of all these, give us Gregor. Nyssen.
Quomodo enim res incorporea corpori cibus fiat? In Orat. de vita Mosi^, p. 509.
Father, who held it Impossible for an Incorporeall, or not-Bodily thing to be
food to a Bodily substance. And so much the rather, because the Fathers have
manifoldly See above, Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. and 10. etc.
acknowledged in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the substance of Bread.
Wherefore the Reasoning of the Council, touching the Eucharist, was like as if
one should say of Baptism; We take not too much, but little, lest it might be
thought to have been ordained not for a Sacramental means of sanctifying the
Soul, but for the clensing of the Flesh. None is so stupid as not to
understand, by Much and Little, the substance of water; and not only the
Accidents thereof.

And if you shall need a further Explication of the same sentence of the
Fathers of Nice you may fetch it from the Fathers in another Council held at
Toledo in Spain, Anno 693. who show this Reason, why they Conc. Tolet 16 Anno
693 Can 6. Integrum panem esse sumendum -- neque grande aliquid, sed modica
tantum oblata, secundum id quod Ecclesiastica consuetudo retentat: cujus
reliquiae aut ad conservandum modico loculo absque aliqua injuria Sacrificijs
confecrotur; aut si sumendum fuerit necessarium, non ventrem illius, qui
sumpserit, gravis farciminis onere premat, nec quid indigestice vadat, sed
animum alimonia spirituali resiciat.
Take little portions of the Host, (namely say they) lest otherwise the belly
of him that takes this Sacrament may be stuffed, and over charged, and lest it
may pass into the Draught, but that it may be nourishment for the Soul.
Hereby plainly teaching, concerning the consecrated matter, Draught: whereas,
if Less, it would serve as well, or better for a Sacramental use, to the
replenishing of our souls in the spiritually receiving of the Body of Christ.
But never was any of the Primitive Age so far bereft of his wits as to
imagine that Much, which stuffeth, and after passes into the Draught, to be
Christ's Body: and you may swear that the Fathers meant not mere See above
Book 3. Chap. 3. ^ ^.
Accidents; For mere Accidents have not the property of Substance, through the
Muchnesse thereof, either to satiate the natural appetite, overcharge the
belly by weight, in prossing it down to the Draught. Never did any Father
father such an Imagination. What can be, if this be not true reasoning, and
consequently a full confutation of your Roman Faith.

Therefore this one Canon of Nice being thus undoubtedly gained, concerning he
not seeking Christ, Here, on this Table, is sufficient of it self to batter
down your Assertion by a fivefold force. First, by proof of no
Transubstantiation of Bread; Secondly, no Corporal Presence of Christ's Body;
Thirdly, no Corporal Conjunction with the Bodies of the Communicants; and
(consequently) Fourthly, no Proper Sacrifice thereof; and Lastly, no Divine
Adoration due unto it. Therefore ought you to bid all these your Romish
Doctrines and Delusions avaunt.

Your Objections, from the former Canon, answered. SECT. VI.
FIrst, you Ob. 1. Cum dicit agnum Dei situ^ esse in sacra mensa, and eundem
agnum opponit symbolis, declarat agnum proprie esse in mensa: and non solum ut
per symbola reprae sentatur. 2. Agnus dicitur a Sacerdotum manibus immolari,
quod non fit in coelo: neque enim tam longas manus habent Sacerdotes, ut ad

Object, that The Lamb is said to be placed on the Table, mistaking what Table
is meant; for the Canon specifying two Tables, one Here, which is of the
Eucharist, and another That Table, namely in Heaven, says that Christ is
placed on That Table, according to our Faith of his sitting at the right hand
of God in Heaven. Secondly, he is said (say you) to be Sacrifised by the hands
of the Priest; which cannot be done, as he is in Heaven. The words of the
Canon, truly The Lamb of God set as that Table (namely in Heaven) is
sacrifised by the hands of the Priest Here, to wit, on the Table below
(representatively) as hereafter the Catholic Fathers themselves will show. And
these two may easily consist, without any necessity of the Priest reaching his
hands as far as the highest Heavens; as your Cardinal objecteth. * The
Priest (says he) has not so long hands as to reach it in Heaven. So he,
delicately, and like a Romish Cardinal, carnally conceiting only a Touch, by
the Finger, of Flesh, never regarding Touching Christ by Faith, whereof first
Saint Ambrose: Ambrosius in Luc. 24. Paulus docuit ubi te reperire possi^^^,
ubi ait; Si consurrexistis cum Christo, quae sursum sunt sap^^e, non super
terram. Ergo non quae supra terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem te
quaerere debemus, si volumus invenire. Nunc enim secundum carnem jam non
novimus Christum. Denique Stephanus non supra terram quae (...), qui stantem
(...) ad dextram Dei vidit. Maria autem quae quaerebat in terra, tangere non
potuit. Stephanus te^igit, quia quaesivit in coelo.
Many (says he) sought Christ on Earth, but could not touch him; But Stephen
touched him, who sought him in Heaven. Consonantly Saint Augustine; who to this

There is a Touch by Faith; he that believes in Christ, Touches him, *
Thirdly, you allege; We are said to partake truly of the Body of Christ. As
though there were not a Truth in a Sacramental, that is Figurative Receiving;
and See above c. 1. Sect. 2.
has been both proved, and confessed) a Real, and true participation of
Christ's Body and Blood spiritually, without any Corporal Conjunction.

But it is added (says he) that These (namely, the Body and Blood of Christ)
are Symbols of our Resurrection; which is by reason that our Bodies are joined
with the Body of Christ: otherwise if our Conjunction were only of our Souls,
only the Resurrection of our Souls should be signified thereby. So he,
that is to say, as successesly as in the for^er.

For the word, HA^C, These, (which are called Symbols of our Resurrection) may
be referred either to the Body and Blood of Christ, immediately spoken of, and
placed on the Table in Heaven (which we Commemorate also in the Celebration of
this Sacrament) and in that respect may be called Symbols of the Resurrection
of our Bodies: because, See below Book 5. Cap. ^.. 1.
If Christ be risen, then must they that are Christ's also rise again. Or else
the word, These, may have relation to the more remote (after the manner of the
Greeks) to wit, Bread and Cup on the first Table; because (as immediately
follows) they are these whereof not much, but little is taken; as you have
heard. Which other See below Book 5. Cap. ^.. 1.
Fathers will show to be indeed Symbols of our Resurrection, without any
Christ's Bodily Conjunction with our Bodies, more than there is by the Sacrament
of Baptism; which they call the Earnest of our Resurrection, as does also your
Jesuit Ad futuram Resurrectionem, per Baptismi Sacramentum, jus and pignus
accepimus. Coster. institut. Christ. lib. 4. c. 4. [See more in the Book
following. c. 8. Sect. 6.]
Coster call it The pledge of our Resurrection. (But this our Conjunction with
Christ is the Subject matter of the fifth Book.) Lastly how the Eucharist, was
called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, is plentifully resolved in the Sea Chap. 5.

THE
CHAP. I.
The State of the Question. SECT I.
A Christian man consisting of two men, the Outward, Inward, which is,
Spiritual: this Sacrament, accordingly, consists of two parts, Earthly and
Heavenly: as Irenaeus spoke of the bodily Elements of Bread and Wine, as the
visible Signs and Objects of Sense; and of the Body, and Blood of Christ,
which is the Spiritual part. Answerable to both these is the Double
nourishment and Union of a Christian; the one Sacramental, by communicating of
the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, united to man's body, in his Taking,
Eating, Disgesting, Transubstantiated into him, by being Substantially
incorporated in his Flesh. The other, which is the Spiritual, and Souls food,
is the Body and Blood of the Lord, (therefore called Spiritual, because it is
the Object of (...)) by an Union wrought by Gods Spirit, and man's Faith; which
(as has been professed by Protestants) is most Real and Ineffable.

But your Church of Rome teaches such a Real Union of Christ his Body and
Blood with the Bodies of the Communicants, as is Corporal; which See below Chapter
^ Sect. ^.
you call [Per contactum] by Bodily touch, so long as the forms of Bread and
Wine remain incorrupt in the Bodies of the Receivers. Our Method requires,
that we first manifest our Protestant Defense of Union to be an Orthodox
Truth. Secondly, to impugn your Romish Union, as Capernaiticall (that is)
Heretical. And thirdly, to Determine the Point by comparing them both
together. Our Orthodox Truth

That Protestants profess not only a Figurative and Sacramental
Participation and Communion with Christ's Body; but also a Spiritually-Reall.
SECT. II.
IN all the Books of our Adversaries written against Protestants,
Sacramentaries, as though we professed no other manner of feeding and Union
with Christ's Body, than only Sacramental and Figurative. For Confutation of
which Calumny it will be most requisite to propose the Apology of Calvin. in

Him, who has been most opposed and traduced by your Disputers in this Cause,
to show, first, what he held not; and then what he held.

If you shall ask Calvin what he liked not, he will answer you, I. I do
abhor your gross Doctrine of Corporal Presence. And II. I have an hundred
times disclamed the receiving only of a Figure, in this Sacrament. What then
did he hold? III. Our Catehisme teaches (says he) not only a signification
of the Benefits of Christ to be had herein, but also a participation of the
substance of Christ's flesh in our souls. And with Swinckfeldius, maintaining
only a Figurative perception, we have nothing to do. If you further demand
what is the Feeding, whereby we are united to Christ's Body, in this
Sacrament? he tells you, IV. that it is Not Carnal, but Spiritual, and
Real; and so Real, that the Soul is as truly replenished with the lively If
you exact an expression of this Spiritual Union, to know the manner, he
acknowledges it to be V. above Reason.

If further you desire to understand, whether he were not Singular in this
opinion, he has avouched the judgment of other Protestants, professing not
to dissent one syllable from the VI. Augustane Confession, as agreeing with him
in judgment herein. Accordingly our Church of England (in the 28 Article)
says, that To such as worthily, and with faith receive this Sacrament. The
Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ, which Body is
given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after a spiritual and heavenly
manner, the mean whereby as Faith.

That the Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, was ordained only for food to the
Christian man's Soul. SECT. III.
WHat need we seek into the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, which are many,
in this Point of Dispute, having before us the judgment of your Summus

Chapter, and last Section of this Fifth Book.

That the Spiritual feeding and Union with Christ's Body is more excellent and
Real than the Corporal Conjunction can be. SECT. IV.

named by Christ Ioh. 6. 32.
The true Bread, and the Life thereby (which is the Effect of the Spiritual
eating thereof) is the most true and Real Life, because Everlasting: So the
Union Spiritual, which a Christian has in his souls feeding, is the most
Real and true Union, as may sufficiently appear by Analogy. To wit, that
Bread and Wine being the most vital nourishments, for the conservation of
man's bodily Essence, are therefore chosen (as the Fathers teach) to represent
and exhibit unto him (although, in themselves, but Signs and Symbals) the very
Body and Blood of Christ. Therefore the Body and Blood of Christ are our Real
nourishments in this Sacrament.

And such as is our food, such must be our Union, by feeding Faith, in this
Sacrament; and you may not gainsay it, who, to comfort your Disciples, are

taught to instruct them, that even without this Sacrament the Spiritual Union
may be presented to the Soul of man, with the Body of Christ; and that as a
sufficient means of uniting him to Christ, by a Spiritual manner of Eating.
And this (you say) is To receive Christ his Body truly; albeit this be to
receive him only by faith and desire. So you. Whence you perceive our
Inference, viz. If our Spiritual Union with Christ his Body may be really and
truly made by Faith, and Desire, without this Sacrament; then, in our
Sacramental Eating thereof, may the Faith and ardent Desire; the Sacrament it
self being a S^^le of this our Christian Faith.

CHAP. II.
That only the Godly-faithfull Communicants are Partakers of the Body and
Blood of Christ; and thereby united to Christ; in the judgment of Protestants.
SECT. I.
Church of England in her 28. and 29. Article says thus; The Body of Christ is
given to be eaten in this Sacrament only after a Spiritual manner, even by
faith; wherein the wicked, and such as are void of faith, eat it not: although
they do visibly press with their teeth the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of
Christ, yet are they in no wise Partakers thereof. But your Romish Church
flatly otherwise, as you all know; and therefore has your Sympresbyter Master
Mr. Brerely Tract. 2.. 5. Sub 2.
Brerely endeavored to assume some Protestants to be on your side, whom he
has alleged with like faithfulness, as he has cited Master Calvin: than
whom he could not have, in this case, a greater Adversary. For although Calvin
grant, with all Protestants, that the wicked and faithless receive truly, by
way of Sacrament, the Body of Christ; yet does he deny that they have in their
Bodies any Corporal Conjunction or Union with Christ, because the Union, which
we have Calvin Epist. 372. yet in the same Epistie he says of Papists,

says he) is Only Spiritual; only with the soul; only with the heart;
only by faith; and although it be offered to the wicked, to be really
received, yet do they not receive it, because they are Carnal. Their only
Receiving therefore is but Sacramental. So Master Calvin.

It had been good that your Priest had suspected his own Judgment, and (as
well in this case, as others) by doubting his own eyesight, had borrowed your

Cardinal his Spectacles: then would he have clearly perceived that (together
with other Protestants) Calvin held that The wicked, although they receive the
Symbols and outward Signs of Christ's body, yet the Body it self they do not
receive. So your Cardinal of the Doctrine of Protestants. For although,
indeed, Calvin said that The wicked eat the Body of Christ; yet, explayning
himself, he added these two words [In Sacramento, that is, Sacramentally;]
which in Calvin's style is taken for Symbolically only. As for the Consent of
Protestants herein, we put it to your great Cardinal and Champion, their
greatest Adversary, to express. Ex Vbi quitistarum opinione sequitur corpus
Christi non posse Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 17.. Secundo ex.
He joyneth Lutherans to the Calvinists in one Consent, for denying the Orall
and Corporal Eating thereof; and for believing the Eating of it Only by
Faith.

That the wicked Communicants, albeit they eat not bodily Christ's Body, yet
are they Guilty of the Lord's Body, for not receiving Spiritually, (namely)
through their Contempt, in not receiving the Blessing offered thereby. SECT. II.
THe Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 27. Whosoever (says he) Eats this Bread, and
Drinks this Cup unworthily, he shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the
Lord. And (verse. 29.) eats and drinks Damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lords Body.

Your Remish Professors (men not the least zealous for your Romish Cause)
objecting this against the Protestants, call upon you, saying first Rhemists
Annot. in 1. Cor. 11. verse. 27.
Here upon mark well, that ill men receive the Body and Blood of Christ, be
they Infidels, or ill livers, for else they could not be guilty of that which
they receive not. Secondly, Chrysostom. Hom 60. and 61. ad Pop. Antioch.
Chrysostom says) do vill any to Christ's own Person, as the Jews and
Gentiles did, that crucified him. Which invincibly proves against the
Heretics, that Christ is herein really present. And guilty is he, for not
d^scerning the Lords Body, that is, because he puts no difference So your
Rhemists.

Your Cardinal also, as though he had found herein something for his purpose

fasteneth upon the sentence of Cyprian, who accounted them, that after their
denial of Christ presented themselves to this Communion, without repentance,
to offer more injury to Christ, by their polluted hands and mouths, than they
did in denying Christ* and besides he records Examples of Gods miraculous
vengeance upon those, who violated the Body of Christ in this Sacrament. So
he. All these points are reducible unto three heads. One is, that Ill men
might not be held guilty of the Body of Christ, except they did receive it, as
being materially present in this Sacrament. Next is the Guilt of profaning
this Sacrament, which being more heinous than the abuse of any other Sacrament,
therefore the injury is to be judged more personal. The last, that the Examples
of Gods vindicative Iudgemeuts, for Contempt hereof, have been more
extraordinary: which may seem to be a Confirmation of both the former. Before
we handle these points in order, take our next Position for a Directory to
that, which shall be answered in the sixth Section.

That some Fathers understood the Apostles words, 1. Corinthians. 10. Spiritually,
(namely) as signifying the Eating of Christ's Flesh, and drinking his Blood;
both in the Old Testament and in the New. SECT. III.
Upon those words of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10. verse 4. [They ate of the same
Spiritual meat* etc.] The Jews received the same Spiritual meat Aug.
Tract. 26. in Ioh. sup. illa verba Apostoli, 1. Cor. 20. de fidelibus Iudaeis.
[Omnes candem spiritualem escam (in Manna.) edebant; and bibebant eundem potum
spiritualem, etc.] Corporalem escam diversam, illi Manna, nos aliud,
spiritualem sed candem: aliud illi, aliud nos bibimus, sed aliud specie
visibili, idem autem significante virtute. Item. Eandem quam nos escam; sed

says Saint Augustine; namely they who were faithful. Yea (says your At
eandem inter se; non nobis. cum candem Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14.. Quia.
Cardinal) the Jews received the same among themselves, but not the same with
us Christians. So he. Albeit the words of Augustine are plainly thus; The same
which we eat: so plainly, that diverse on your own side do so directly and
truly acknowledge it, that your Jesuit Iudaeos candem escam spiritualem edisse
nobiscum; exposuit hunc locum de Manna Augustinus, and qui eum secuti sunt
multi; ut Beda, Strabo, and Author Glossae ordinariae -- reprobatum hoc esse a

Calvinistas ad eundem fere modum hunc locum interpretari. Maldon. Ies. in Ioh.
6. verse. 50. col. 706.
Maldonate, not able to gainsay this Truth, pleases himself notwithstanding
in fancying that If Augustine were alive in this Age, he would think
otherwise, especially perceiving Heretical Calvinists, (and Calvin. Instit.
lib. 4. Cap. 14. Sect. 23. Eandem nobiscum -- contra Scholasticorum dogma, quo
docent, veteri lege tantum adumbrari gratiam, and nova praesentem conferri.
Calvin himself) to be of his opinion. So he. Was it not great pity that
Augustine was not brought up in the School of the Jesuits! surely they would
have taught him the Article of Transubstantiation, of the Corporal presence of
Christ in the Sacrament, and Corporal Union; against all which there could not
be a greater Adversary than was Augustine; whom Maldonate here notes to have
been the Greatest enemy to all Heretics: whom Bertram. de Corp. Dom. page 20.
Quaeres, fortasse, quam eandem? nimirum ipsam, quam hodie populus credentium in
Ecclesia manducat. Non enim licet -- diversa intelligi,
Bertram followed in the same Exposition: and by your leave, so did Eandem
escam spiritualem id est, Corpus Christi in signo spiritualiter intellecto:
idem, quod nos, sed aliam escam corporalem, quam nos. Aquinas in 1. Cor. 10.
Aquinas also; The same (says he) which we eat. Yea and Anselme imbraceth
the same exposition, in the very words of Saint Augustine, The same which we
eat. Thus much by the way. We go on to our Answers.

That the wicked Receivers are called Guilty of Christ's Body; not by properly
Eating of his Body unworthily, but for unworthily Eating the Sacrament thereof
Symbolically. SECT. IV.
THE Distinction used by Saint Augustine (who is still a resolute Sacrament
from the thing represented, and exhibited thereby. Of the Sacrament he says
that Aug in Ioh. Tract. 26. Sacramentum ^umitur a qui^^^dam ad vit^^m (...)
quibu^dam (...) exitium: Re^ vero ipsa, cujus est Sacramenttum, omni homini ad
vitam, null^ (...) mortem, quicunque ejus particips ^uer^^.
It is received of some to Life, and of some to destruction: but the thing it
self (says he) is received of None, but to Salvation. So he No Protestant
could speak more directly, or Conclusively for proof; First, That, in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, the Body of Christ is as well tendered to the
Wicked, as to the Godly. Secondly, That the Wicked for want of a living faith,
have no Hand to receive it. Thirdly That their not preparing themselves to a
due receiving of it, is a Contempt of Christ his Body and Blood. Fourthly, and
Consequently that it works the judgment of Guiltiness upon them.

* If it shall be proved that the like judgment follows upon the Wicked, for
absenting himself from receiving of this Sacrament, in Contempt thereof; as
well as it does upon the unworthy Receiver, it Determinateth the Point in
question, to prove the inconsequence of your reason, whereof you conclude, that
the Guiltiness of Judgment arises Corporal participation of Christ's Body,
Now Saint Augustines words are, that Aug de Necessitate poeni^e^tiae. Tom 10.
Hom. 50. Verset ante oculos Imago futuri Iudici^, ut cum alij a^cedunt ad
aliare Dei, quo ipse non accedit, con^^git quam sit contremiscenda illa poena,
qua percipi^ntibus alijs vitam aeternam, alij in mortem praecipitentur
aeternam. Item (...) Tom 6. contra (...) Manichaeum lib. 13 c. 6. Qui autem
manduca^^ contemnit, non habet in se vitam, and ideo non perven^^t ad vitam
aete^nam.
He that contenineth to eat this, has no life in him, and shall be deprived
of life eternal. Which is by his Contempt, not in the Receiving, but in the
Not-Receiving thereof.

All which both the Evidence of Scripture, and Consent of Antiquity do notably
confirm. For the Text objected does clearly confute your Romish Consequence,
because Saint Paul's words are not; He that eats the Body of Christ, and
drinks his Blood unworthily, is guilty of his Body and He that enteth the
Bread, and drinks the Cup of the Lord unworthily, etc, Which we have proved
throughout the second Book to signify Bread and Wine, the Signs and
Sacraments of his Body and Blood, after Consecration. And (to come to
Antiquity) All the Fathers hereafter cited, who deny that the wicked
Communicants are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ (albeit knowing, as
well as you, that all such unworthy Receivers are guilty of the Body and Blood
of Christ) will thereby sufficiently confute your Consequence, which is, that
because the Wicked are guilty of Christ's Body; Ergo his Body is Corporally
present in them. But we pursue you yet further.

That a Guiltiness of Contempt of Christ's Body and Blood is to be acknowledged
in all Profane Neglect, even in not communicating thereof, by whatsoever
person capable of this Blessed Sacrament. SECT. V.
GVilty of the Lords Body:] that is, Guilty of the Contempt thereof, as you
well know. Now because Contempt of a good thing is as well seen in a wilful
refusing to receive, as in a Contemptuous manner of Receiving; the Guiltiness
by the same Contempt must needs be against the thing offered, whether it be
Corporal or Spiritual; and Consequ^ntly against the Giver himself. In which
respect Christ compares the Refusers of the promises of the Gospel of
Salvation unto beastly Hogs, which trample under their feet Pearls Believing
being our Spiritual Receiving. From the same Guilt of Contempt follows the
Obnoxiousnesse to punishment, denounced by our Savior; Luc. 9. 5.
To shake off the dust of their feate for a testimony against them, in not
receiving the Gospel of Peace. Therefore is that saying of Hierome common to
every Sacrament, Below Sect. 6.
Contempt of a Sacrament (says he) is the Contempt of him whose Sacrament it
is: As also that other of Rupertus, saying; Rupertus in Ioh. 6. Si quis
existimat illo Sacrame^to se non egere, in eo ipso, quod manducare and bib^ere
contemnit, quantumvis Catholicae professionis homo sit, a Societate membrorum
Christi, quae est Ecclesia, se praecidit etc.
The not receiving the Eucharist (if it be in Contempt) does separate the
Contemner from the society of the members of Christ. Hence it was, that whereas
Quemadmodum enim accedere frigide [(...)] -- sic non communicare de istis
[(...)*] Chrysostom. in 1. C^^. ^0. Hom. 24
Chrysostom called man's Ind^votion in receiving the Eucharist Dangerous, he
named the Contempt of Not participating thereof, Pestilence, and death it self.

But not to press you further with other such like speeches of the Fathers,
we shall refer you to your Divines of Collen, who in their Council censured
those, who Contemptuously refused to Communicate of this Sacrament, to be but
Conc. Provincia^e Coloniense fol. 29. Cap. 14. Qui non (...) hunc panem vitae,
qui de coelo descendit, accipere deside^ant, homines solo nomine Christiani
sunt, Capernaitis deterio^es, etiam voluntary in filium Dei peccantes, (...)
Co^pori Dominico and sanguini contumeliam inferentes terribilis quaedam
expectatio j^dicij manet.
only in name Christians, worse (say they) than the Capernaits, offering
Contumely (mark we pray you, against your Rhemists) to the Body and Blood of
Christ; and are made thereby Obnoxious to the terrible judgment of God. A
Conclusion, whereby is satisfied, from your own Doctors, your own maine
Objection, even in Terminis terminantibus, as the School speaks: professing
both man's Guiltiness of Christ's Body in not receiving this Sacrament, and
Obnoxiousnesse thereupon unto Gods judgment; as also has been evinced by the
Judgment of S. Augustine, in the former Section.

As for the objected speech of Saint Objected by Bellarmine above. 2.
Cyprian it is of ^asie disgestion, because Comparisons of Magis, and Minus,
(as learning teaches) are altered upon all different respects. Some in
persecution denied Christ, in the extremity of their fear; and some in their
wilfulness profaned the Sacrament of the Eucharist, instituted by Christ.
This latter is the greater sinner before God, who judges sin not only
Secundum actum, aut effectum, according to the wicked deed done; but Secundum
Affectum, that is, but much more according to the Depraved Affection* and
Disposition of the mind of the Doer. In which respect we may well think that
Judas his traitorous, and scornful Kiss was more heinous than Peter's
perjurie. Have you not read what the Apostle has written against such as
Apostate from their Faith, and vow of Baptism, saying, Hebr. 6. 6.
They Crucify unto themselves the Son of God? which is much more than
Cyprian spoke of the Guilty Receiver of the Eucharist; yet dare not you
conclude that therefore there is a Corporal presence Water of Baptism. And as
in the Guilt of sin; so is it in the Guilt of punishment also, which
follows sin, as a shadow does a Body. In which consideration Augustine does
parallel Baptism, and the Eucharist together, saying, Aug. lib ^ontra
Fulgent. (...) Sicut qui mandu^^t, and bibit sanguinem Domini indigne, judicium
sibi manducat and bibit. Sic qui indigne accipit Baptis^a, judicium sibi
accipit, no^ salutem.
As he that drinks the Blood of the Lord unworthily drinks his own
judgment: So does he who receives Baptism unworthily.

By these Premises you will furthermore easily discern, that you other Romish
Doctors have been no less ignorant than they were arrogant, in concluding it
to be an Infallible Consequence, that because Christ receives an injury in his
Body and Blood, by the abuse of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; therefore his
Body and Blood is Corporally present therein. As if they would teach, by the
like Inference, that because the Empress Contumelia illata imagini, ad
personam repraesentatam pertinere censetur. Nota est historia Theodo si^, de
vindicta quam in Antiochenos exercuit, propter dejectam Imperat^cis imaginem
Niceph. lib. 13. Hist. c. 43. Test Suarez Ies Tom. 1. in 3. Thom. Disp. ^4. 3.
Eudocia was (as is confessed) reproached by the Citizens of Antioch, in their
despite wrought upon her Image; therefore was she personally present in the
same Image. Yea and your selves, when you plead for the Reverend use of Images,
can be content to take your reason from the Non enim levem injuriam seculi
Principes sibi putabunt illatam in quolibet numismate a Subjectis despici
noverint and calcari. Speculum antiquae devot^onis circa Missam, a Ioh. Cocl^o,

Example of Kings or Princes; as being injured by the abuse of their pictures.

Unworthy Receiver (in the judgment of Saint Ambros. in 1. Cor. 11. Indignus
est Domino, qui aliter mysterlum celebrat, quam ab ^o traditum est.
Ambrose) who does celebrate it otherwise than was appointed by Christ
himself. Your Ten Transgressions of Christ his Institution in this Sacrament
(discovered in the First Book) convinces you of a Ten-fold Guiltiness of the
Unworthy Receiving of this Mystery. Your last Objection of Guiltiness has
been taken from the Executions of Gods punishments. We therefore rejoyne.

That the Examples of Gods Vindicative Justice have appeared against the
Contemners of many holy things, without respect to the Corporal presence of
Christ therein. SECT. VI.
COme we to the open judgments and punishments of God, upon the Contemners of
this Sacrament, The visible Testimonies of his Justice, and Arguments of the
preciousnesse and holiness of this Mystery. These we believe to be true, And
the Apostle has made it manifest, where (speaking of the great plague, which
fell upon the Corinthians, who had profaned this Sacrament of the Body and
Blood of Christ) he points this out as their sin, saying, 1. Cor. 11.
verse* ^0.
[Ob hanc causam] For this cause are many sick among you, and many sleep,
etc. Yet was not this for no Discerning the Body of Christ to be Corporally in
the Eucharist (as your Disputers pretend:) but (to use Saint Hier. in 1. Cor.
11. Reus erit Corporis and sanguinis Christi, qui tanti mysterij Sacramentum
pro vili despe^etit.
Hieromes words) They were guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, because they
despised the Sacrament of so great a Mystery; (namely) by their profane
behavior at their receiving thereof, as if they had been at the Heathenish
Bacchanalls: or, as Primasius yields the Cause, Primas. in ^und. locum. Quia
acciperent quasi cibum communem.
For that they took it as homely, as their common bread.

* And why should you conceive that to be singular in this one Sacrament, which
Saint Hierome teaches to be common Hier. Com. in Malach. c. 1. Dum Sacramenta
violantur, ipse cujus sunt violatur.
When the Sacraments (says he) are violated, he, whose Sacraments they be,
is violated and vilified. *

All can point at the doleful Example of Gods vengeance upon Judas, the first
unworthy Receiver; and therefore the subject of the first Document of Gods
judgment, notwithstanding that he received but the Sacrament only, and not
the very Body of Christ, as Saint Augustine observed, saying; See after in
Sect. 10.
He received not the Bread, the Lord, but the Bread of the Lord. And how
justly may we think, did God punish certain Optatus lib. 2.
Donatists, who casting the holy Sacrament to Dogs, were themselves devoured of
Dogs? Neither have these kinds of Gods judgments been proper to the Abuse of
this Sacrament only, as you have instructed men to believe; for look into the
sacred story, and you shall find the men of 1. Sam. 5.
Ashdod, for modling with the Ark of God, afflicted with Emrods: the men of 1.
Sam. 6.
Bethshemesh smitten with a great slaughter, for but peeping into God's Ark.
Also 2 Samuel 6.
Vzzah, no Priest; does but touch the same Arc, (albeit with a good intent, to
support it) and he is suddenly struck dead. Levit. 10.
Nadab and Abih^ profaned the Altar of the Lord with offering st^a^ge fire
thereon; and both of them were immediately burnt with fire from Heaven, and
perished* Dan. 5.
Belshazzar will needs carouze in the sacred boles of Gods Temple, in the
Contempt of God, and of his Law; and behold a Writing upon the wall, signifying
that his Days were at an end, as it came to pass. And yet was there not any
peculiar 2 King. 2.
Boys are mocking Gods ^rophet in Bethel, by noting him for a Bald pate, and
are devo^red by Bears. The Numb. 11.

If sacred stories will not prevail, peradventure your own Legends will
relish better with you: so the^ your Quidam, qui sancti Anthonij Imaginem
abolere cupiebant, non tulerunt illud scelus impune, sed e vestigio peste illa,
quae dicit^o Antonij, correpti interierunt. Bozius de signis. Eccles. lib. 15.
c. 12. ex Lindano.
Bozius will tell you of them, who were suddenly struck with the plague,
called Saint Anthonies plague, one by for seeking to pull down and demolish
Saint Anthonies Image. Have you faith to believe this? and can you not conceive
a like right Judgment against

Be it therefore furthermore known unto you, that the Sacrament, which is
celebrated by Protestants, although* it contain no Corporal Union of the Body
of Christ, yet is it not so Bare Bread, as your Doctors have calumniously
suggested unto you, but that God has manifested his Curses upon profane
Communicants and Contemners of this holy Mystery, which has in it a
Sacramental Union of the Body and Blood of Christ. One example, whereof we
read, is of one that Manlius locorum Communium Collect. Minister cujusdam
Sartoris Lipsiae, Anno 1553. Ob temeratam institutionem divinam qua praecipitur
and species utraque administretur, unicam tantum recipiens, conscientiae
crimine oppressus, exclamavit, o (inquit) Ego sum etc.
Did cast himself headlong out of a window, and so dyed. The other is that
which he (who now writes these things) saw and can testify, viz. Sir Booth
of S. John's Coll. in Cambridge.
A Bachelour of Arts, being Popishly affected, at the time of the Communion,
took the Consecrated Bread, and forbearing to eat it, conveyed and kept it
closely for a time; and afterward threw it over the walls of the College: but
a short time after, not enduring the torment of his guilty Conscience, he
threw himself headlong over the Battlements of the Chapel,

That only the Godly Christians are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ,
and thereby United unto him, is not Contrary to the Judgment of Ancient
Fathers, as is Objected. SECT. VII.
YOur Doctor has performed great diligence in collecting Sentences of Ancient
Fathers, sounding to the Contrary, Dr Heskias in his Parlia. of Christ. Book 3.

indigne, Reus est corporis Domini.] de ijs dictum, qui corpus Do mini velut
quem libet cibum sumebant, etc.
Augustine, that Judas sinned in wickedly receiving the Body of Christ. But
(not to usurp in this place the Answer of your own Doctors unto the Ordinary
speeches of Chrysostom in his Homilies noting his Rhetorical Hyperboles) we
answer directly from Saint Augustine himself, who has already told you, that
the calling Bread the Body of Christ, is not spoken in the strictness of the
truth of the thing, but in a Mystical Signification, that is (said your own
Romish See above ^. 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
Gloss) unproperly.

The same Answer may serve for the Objected place of Cypri^n de Coena D^m
Sacramenta quidem quantum in se sunt, sine propria virtute es^e non possunt,
nec ullo modo divina majetas absentat se mysterijs, sed quamvis ab indignis se
sumi and contingi Sacramenta permittant, non possunt tamen spiritus esse

c. 49.
Cyprian, wherein furthermore we find a clear Distinction, between the Being
of Christ's Body Sacramentally in the Eucharist, (together with the Receiving
thereof) and it is Being Spiritually; Concerning the Sacramental virtue (namely
the thing signified) which is ministerially offered to every Communicant, in
every Divine Sacrament; but that this should be effectual to any Communicant,
it is necessary Spiritual. For Grace is the virtue of Baptism to every Person
baptized; yet (according to the terms of Schools) He, who either by his
Infidelity, or Impenitency shall Obicem ponere, that is, set a Bar, and
resist that Grace, he does not receive it. A man that receives with his hand
a politic Instrument, and Scale offered unto him, yet if he yield not his
Consent to accept of the Gift it self, thereby conveyed, and in the manner that
he ought; it may well be said, that the thing thus bequeathed is really
tendered, yet in respect of the Parties Contemning it, although it be touched
and taken after the public and Civil touch, yet notwithstanding is he not
partaker thereof: For which Cause it is added in Cyprian, that These are
therefore the Savor of Life unto Life, to some; and the Savor of Death unto
the Contemners of them; which, as the Scripture teaches, is common to the
preaching of the Word of God likewise. Besides, do you not mark tha^ Cyprian
speaks of [Sacramenta, Sacraments,] in general: But you have See above ^. 1.
c. 3. * 6. at (...)
told us, that the two parts of the Eucharist, make but One Sacrament, and then
may you, by the same Alchymie, as well extract a Corporal Presence of Christ
out of Baptism, as out of the Eucharist.


AFter that you have heard the Symbolicall Phrases of the Fathers, so
Dissonantly objected for proof of a Bodily Irenae^ adversus Haeres* lib. 5.
confesses, Caro sanguine Christi nutrita membrum ejus est.
He is a member of Christ. So Irenaeus. And Cyrill. Alex. in Ioh lib. 11. c

He that eats this Bread of life is joined with Christ, and Christ dwells

Whosoever eats of this meat shall live for ever. So Origin. And Ambrosius

It is living Bread, which who so eats, lives everlastingly. So Ambrose.
Chrysostom. Hom. 61. ad. Pop. Antioch. Tradit un^onem ratione cujus dicuntur

The Union is that whereby the Eaters are said to be the members of Christ. So
Chrysostom. Sometime more Emphatically, in a Negative style, Origin. vide

again in Isai^^^ 66. speaking conclusively, says, Omnes qui non sunt sancti
spi^itu and corpore, non comedunt carnem nec bibunt sanguinem eius.
All that are not holy, do not eat Christ's Flesh or drink his Blood. We
reserve Saint Augustine for a peculiar Section, and our reason is, because your
Disputers do so earnestly struggle to draw him to your part; but yet most
vainly and unconscionably, as will appear in the Section following.

Now whether side, yours, or ours, can more satisfactorily reconcile the
seeming Contradictions of the Fathers, in saying and gainsaying the Eating of
Christ's Flesh by the Wicked, it will stand with equity and good Conscience,
that they may carry the Cause. Your All-answer, and the Answer The wicked eat
the Body of Christ Corporally in this Sacrament, by a Bodily Touch; but they
eat it not Spiritually: for they eat it not worthly, and in that respect are
said not to eat it. So you. As if the Fathers, in denying the Wicked to be
partakers of Christ's Flesh, must have meant that they Eat it not worthily. But
this Distinction cannot possibly accord with your own Romish Faith, which
teaches a Bodily Eating, with a Bodily Touch by a Bodily. Union of the Eater
with the Body of Christ, common as well to Judas, as to Peter; to the
Prophanest

If this had been the ancient Catholic Faith, then could not these Fathers so
peremptorily and precisely have denied, that any Wicked is joined and united
with Christ's Body, and especially when they mention in express terms a
Natural and Corporal Conjunction of Christ's Body with the Bodies of the
Communicants, by this Sacrament; which you your selves interpret to be spoken
of your Corporal Union by a Bodily Touch; nor would Origin give this his
absolute [Non posse,] The Wicked cannot (says he) be partakers of the flesh of
Christ, which is employed in the Sayings of the rest of the Fathers, when they
speak so universally of the True Eater of Christ's Body, See above in this
Sect. n. 11. etc.
That every such are joined with him to Immortality. Whereof somewhat more
hereafter.

But our Protestant Distinction, for reconciliation-sake, is, that the Fathers,
in affirming The Wicked to eat the Body of Christ, spoke only Symbolically, to
wit, as they called the Sacrament of Christ's Body, the Body of Christ,
Sacramentally and Figuratively (as has been See Book 2. thorowout.
copiously and convincingly Eaten of the Wicked, that is to say, Symbolically,
by eating only the Sacrament of his Body: But in affirming that the Godly
only eat Christ's flesh, they spoke of the Spiritually-Real Eating by Faith,
which was the manner and means Spiritual of being truly United to Christ's
flesh, and so to his person, God and man; and so, as his lively members, made
Capable of Immortality it self, as well in Body, as in Soul. This our
Distinction, we have received from Saint Augustine, for whom both you and we
strive, as for the Homer of his age, and Patron of our Faith in this Point,
which is to be tried in the Section following.

In the Interim, you (who so earnestly plead against this privilege of the
Godly to be partakers of Christ's Body, by making the Wicked to be as Capable
thereof, as any Sanctified member of Christ can be) think but with your
selves, Satan is said to have entered into the heart of Judas, after his
receiving of this Sacrament; and then tell us, if the Wicked be really
partakers of Christ's Body, and not to Contradict that Scripture, which denies
that there can be any Communion with Christ and Beliall; yet will you infer
(in Judas,) a Communion between Christ and Satan.

That Saint Augustine (to whom both sides appeal) is a Direct Patron of our
Protestant Cause, for proof, that the Wicked
YOu allege, and we as willingly acknowledge, that Saint Augustine said, that
the Wicked, (and among others, even Judas,) do eat the Body of Christ; which
he meant (say we) Metonymically and Figuratively, in as full a sense as if
he had flatly said, The Wicked eat only the Sacramental Sign of his Body,
because he spoke so, only [Sacramento tenus] that is Sacramentally. Which
Distinction, as often as it is seriously used by us, is as scornfully rejected by
you: and therefore it will be requisite, that we produce some Author hereof;
who may be beyond all exception: And none, think we, rather than Saint
Augustine himself, Saint Augustine denied, that the Wicked receive the Body of
Christ properly but only the Sacrament thereof.

There were Profane Spirits in the days of Saint Augustine, who pampering
themselves in their vices, notwithstanding presumed of Salvation, because of
their professing of the Catholic Faith, and of their being the Members of
Christ's mystical Body, which is his Church, and Concluded thereupon, That
they, in communicating of this Sacrament, eat not only the Sacrament, but
indeed the Body of Christ. These Saint Aug. lib. 21. de Civitate Dei. cap. 25.
Respondemus ijs, qui salutem promittunt ijs, qui Baptismate abluti and corporis
and sanguinis Christi participes facti, quomodolibet vixerint, in quacun que
haeresi and impietate ^uerint. Respondendum est etiam ijs, qui hanc
liberationem polli centur, solis Catholicis, quamvis male viventibus; qui non
solo inquiunt Sacramento, sed reipsa manducaverunt corpus Christi, in ipso
scilicer eius corpore constituti, de quo dicunt Apostoli, unus panis, unum
corpus, multi sumus. [At the end of the Chapter he concludes against these
from the nature of Truly Eating this Sacrament] Nec ergo dicendi sunt manducare
corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt, quia non possunt esse
membra Christi, and membra meretricis: Christus dicit, Qui manducat meam
^arnem, and bibit meum sanguine^, in me mane^, and ego in eo, Ostendit, quid
sit, non Sacramento tenus, sed revera manducare Corpus Christi, manducare, hoc
est, in Christo manner -- non autem in eo manet, qui non est membrum Christi.
Augustine confuteth at large, instancing in the Eating of Christ's Body, says
First, that They cannot be said to eat the Body of Christ, who are not to be
reputed the members of Christ: But are then the Wicked to be esteemed, by Saint
Augustine, the Members of Christ's mystical Body? Saint Augustine himself
says no, and proves as much from the Apostles words, [You cannot be the
members of Christ, and the members of an Harlot.] How then are they said, in
Saint Augustine, To eat, and now in the end thereof, Not to eat Christ's Body?
This [Hovv] is the very Birds eye, let therefore our aim and level be at this.

Those foresaid Profane livers took to themselves this presumption for their
Pillow to lean and sleep upon, in indulging themselves in their wickedness.
We (say they) do eat, no only the Sacrament, but indeed we eat Christ's Body
it self, because we are members of his mystical Body. S. Augustine answers
directly, that Christ by saying [Hee that eats my flesh abides in me,]
shows what it is to Eat Christ's Body [non Sacramento tenus] that is, Not
only as concerning the Sacrament, but [Indeed,] So he. Where we have a flat
opposition, between that which is called [Revera] a Real eating, against
Eating only Sacramentally. So that the Antithesis falling between these
Terms, of Eating Christ's Body [Revera, Indeed] by the Godly; and of Eating it
only [Sacramento tenus] as much as to say, Not indeed, by the Wicked: It must
necessarily follow, that the not eat, Indeed, the Body of Christ; and
Consequently, that there is [not Indeed] in this Sacrament, the Corporal
Presence of Christ, which your Profession teaches to be Eaten as well of a
Wicked man, or of vile Myce, as it can be of the most Faithful member of
Christ. Again Saint Augustine once told us, That the Sacrament is called the
Body of Christ, not in the Truth of the thing, but in a Significant mystery,
which your own Romish Gloss expounds to mean, that It is called Christ's
Body Improperly.

The Second Assertion of Saint Augustine will accord to our former Conclusion,
Aug. Tract. 26. in Ioh. [Qui manducat carnem meam, in me manet.] Qui non manet
in Christo, proculdubio non ma^ducat Spritualiter carnem Christi, nec bibit
ejus sanguinem, (...) carnaliter and visibiliter prem at dentsbus Sacramentum
corporis -- Tantae rei Sacramentum ad judicium sibi manducat.
He that abides not in Christ although he press with his Teeth, the
Sacrament of Christ's flesh; yet does he not Eat the Spiritual flesh of
Christ. The Observable is, that he says not, They eat not Spiritually the
flesh of Christ; But [They eat not the Spiritual flesh of Christ:] therefore
called Spiritual, because it is Hypostatically united unto his Deity. So then,
that which they properly Eat, is not Christ Body, but only the Sacrament
thereof: allowing no Corporal Touch with the Teeth, but only of the Sacrament
it self. Compare we now this Doctrine of Saint Augustine of Pressing only
the Sacrament of Christ's Body, and not Christ's Body it self; with your Pope
Nicholas his Profession of Tearing of Christ's Body with men's Teeth, See below
Chapter 5. Sect. 1.
(above mentioned) and then will it be easy Pope Nicholas, by his Affirmation,
meant as directly to proclaim your Romish Article of the Corporal Presence of
Christ's Body in the Sacrament; as S. Augustine, by his Denial, meant utterly
to disclame and abandon it.

In the thire place, Saint Augustine, for your better instruction, and
apprehension of his meaning, exemplifyeth it by two notable Instances and
Comparisons; the First, between two different kinds of Communicants, at our
Lords own Table, namely Christ's faithful Apostles, and the Reprobate Judas,
saying, Aug. Tract 59. in Ioh. Illi manducarunt panem, Dominum; Judas autem
panem Domini.
They received the Bread, the Lord; (meaning the Body of Christ) But Judas,
What? He received but the Bread of the Lord (which was but the Sacramental
Bread.) The only Answer which your Resp. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Eucharist^. cap.
13. Judas inutiliter edebat, sicut qui comedit et rejicit ^^^sus, dicitur non
comedere.
Cardinal vouchsafes is, that Saint Augustine spoke so, because Judas ate the
Bode of Christ Unprofitably: as if the Difference of Eating, and, Not Eating,
Christ's Body had been between the Different effects, Eating Profitably, and
Not Profitably, which you call Spiritually, and not Spiritually, which is the
Evasion of others: when as indeed the Comparision is expressly between Bread,
the Lord, which is Christ's Body; the other being the Bread of the Lord, which
is the Sacramental Bread; as any, (...) but an Halfe-eyed man, may easily
discern. Another Comparision remains, whereabout we are to have (...)
Conflict with your Doctor Heskins.

A Vindication of a Special Testimony of Saint Augustine, in the same point,
against the notorious Falsification
DOctor Heskins, before that he deliver the Sentence it self, as a man but
about to put on his Harness, and yet sounding a Triumph before the victory,
prefaceth saying; This place of Saint Augustine presses our Adversaries so
hard, that they have no refuge. So he. The words of Saint Austine (speaking of
Moses and other Faithful, in the Old Testament, who in eating Manna, ate
Christ Spiritually, and therefore although they died in Body, yet died not
Spiritually in their souls) are these Aug. To. 9. Tract. 26. in Ioh. Illi
manducaverunt Manna, and mor^^ non sunt: Quare? quia visibilem cibum
spiritualiter intellexerunt, nam and hodie visibilem cibum accipimus; Sed aliud
est Sacramentum, Aliud virtus Sacramenti. Quam multi de Altari accipiunt and
moriuntur? unde dicit Apostolus judicium sibi manducant.
[Multi manducaverunt Manna and mortui non sunt, Quare? quia visibilem cibum
Spiritualiter acceperunt -- nam and hodie visibilem cibum accipimus; sed aliud
est Sacramentum, Aliud virtus Sacramenti. Quam multi de Altari accipiunt and
moriuntur?] That is, Many of them (the Jews) ate Manna and died not; (namely
in Soul) But why? Because they understood it Spiritually; So he. Namely (say
we) Because they ate only the Sacrament, as the visible meat, and not the
Virute, that is the Body of Christ signified thereby: And by this our
Paraphrasis Saint Augustine is fully Protestant, professing with us, that the
Wicked Communicants do not eat the Body of Christ.

Your Doctor, to make Saint Augustine as flatly a Papist as Dr Heskins in his
parliament of Christ. Book 3. c. 48. fol. 368. and 369. The place of Saint
Augustine presses our Adversaries so strictly, that they have no refuge,
Saying, Manducaverunt multi qui Domino placuerunt, and mortui non sunt; Quare?
quia visibilem cibum spiritualiter intellexerunt -- Nam and hodie nos accipimus
visibilem cibum; [Scd aliud est Sacramentum, aliud virtus Sacramenti, quam
multi de Altari accipiunt and moriuntur. Note here (says he) the Distinction
that Saint Augustine makes betwixt the Sacrament, and the virtue of the
Sacrament, Saying: that the Sacrament is one thing, and the virtue of the
Sacrament another. Then of the virtue of the Sacrament, he says, that many do
receive it at the Altar and do die. Meaning according to the Saying of the
Apostle, that receiving, it unworthily
See the Margin) a false Allegation, by depraving the latter part of the
Sentence of Saint Augustine, alleging them thus: Nam and multi hodie de Altari
accipimus cibum visibilem: [Sed aliud est Sacramentum, aliud Virtus Sacramenti?
quam multi accipiunt and moriuntur.] that is, Many now receive from the Altar
the visible meat; [But the Sacrament is one thing, and the Virtue of the
Sacrament another thing, which, many eating die.] And thereupon taking a full
Cariere in a large Discourse (See the margin) argues By the word [Virtue]
(says he) is meant the Body of Christ: And by [Dying] is meant the death of
the Soul; But Saint Augustine affirms that the Wicked do eat of this
[Virtue] or Body of Christ. So he; Point-blanke Contrary to our Interpretation
as can be, not but that we confess, that Saint Augustine by this word,
Virtue, meant the Body of Christ; and that by Dying, is understood the Death of
men's Souls; but that his Assertion affirming Saint Augustine to teach herein
That the Wicked Receivers that Dye in their Souls, do eat the Virtue which is
the Body of Christ; is a plain Imposture by a Grossly false Construction and
Composition of Saint Augustines words thus: [Aliud est virtus Sacramenti. Qudm
multi etc.] wherein you see a full point, as a deep Ditch, to sever virtus
from the immediately following word, Quam, which your Doctor joyneth together,
whereby the word, Virtus, is Vitiously abused. Then is he injurious to Quam,
which being an Adverbe, and carrying the Adverbiall Accent above-head, as a
Badge of Distinction, he notwithstanding Quam; And thirdly, He wrongeth the
Construction of them both, in matching, as it were in marriage, a littleu in
Virtus, with a great Q in Quam, whereas every Grammarian, by all the rules of
Syntaxis, would forbid the Banes.

We know you (Romish Priests) to be reasonable men, and will therefore demand;
whether he had not reason, by some other Edition of Saint Augustine, to
justify his Allegation, and thereby his own Conclusion, as if Saint Augustine
had meant, That the wicked do Dye in their Soul, by unworthy Eating of the
Real Body of Christ? We answer, no: It is Impossible he should evade by any
such excuse, and lest we may seem to speak partially, we shall offer unto
you a witness hereof, without all exception, and that shall be the Author
Saint Augustine himself, the Expositor of his own meaning in the very same
Tractate, and in his words a little after expressly concluding the Contrary,
saying: that Aug. Tom. 9. (...) Ioh. Tract. 26. Hic est panis qui de coelo
descendit, ut si quis manducaverit ex ipso, non moriatur. Sed quod pertinet ad
virtutem Sacramenti; non quod pertinet ad visibile Sacramentum; Qui manducat
intus, non foris, qui manducat in cord, non qui premat dente.
[Hee that eats of this, so far as concerns the virtue of the Sacrament,
cannot Dye; albeit otherwise in respect of Eating only the visible Sacrament,
he do dye.] Where you see, Virtue, which is (as has been confessed) the Body
of the Lord, dye the Death of the Soul. And for better explanation, he
distinguishes, affirming that the Manner of Eating of the virtue of this
Sacrament, is, Eating it, [Intus cord, Inwardly in the heart:] and the Eating
of the other Sacrament it self, is Eating outwardly, and with the Teeth.

Now then, that your Doctors Error is found to be so palpable, and our Cause so
Justifiable, even by the Judgment of Saint Augustine, will you, (as you are
reasonable) be also Epiphonema, wherewith your Doctor concludes against us,
after his Discourse of this and other Testimonies of Saint Augustine, already
Answered, viz. Thus have you received the mind of Saint Augustine, as the
Catholic Church teaches, and not as the malignant feigneth. *

Sacramental Eating with the mouth, as some

We return to the Discourse of your Romish Priest, Above at (a)
Christ having spoken (says he) of Eating his Flesh, and the Capernaites
answering [How can he give us his Flesh to eat?] They understood eating with
the mouth, yet were (a special observation) never reproved of Christ for
mistaking the meaning of his words, a strong reason that they understood them
rightly; but for not believing them: and Christ often repeating the eating of
his Flesh, and drinking of his Blood, and requiring them to believe, and
believe; for had he, for their better understanding, intended hereby to have
qualified, or corrected his former sayings, as to be meant Eating Spiritually
by Faith, he would have explained himself in plain terms, and so have
satisfied the Jews. Upon which premises I do conclude, that because our
Savior did reprove his Scrupulous hearers not for want of understanding, but
for want of belief, it does from thence, and from other premises abundantly
follow that his fore-sayd promise was not obscure, and Figurative, but plain
and literal for our receiving of him without our

Thus far your celebrious Priest, namely so, as in almost all other his
Collections, not understanding the Truth of the matter. His Inferences stand
thus. First, Christ reprehended the Capernaites, for not Believing his words
concerning Eating his Flesh: but not for not understanding them. Therefore it
follows that they understood his words, of Eating his Flesh, right well.
Secondly, They understood his Speech: Therefore Christ, in saying, The Flesh
profits nothing, it is the Spirit that quickens, did not thereby qualify
his former speech, to Eating his Flesh, were not Figurative. Fourthly, these
his words were not Figurative: Therefore his words of Eating his Flesh, teach a
Corporal Presence thereof in the Sacrament.

Each of these Consequences are delivered as ignorantly; as confidently. For
common learning teaches, that there is a double consideration of Truth, in
every True speech; the one is (...) that it is True; the second is (...) what
is the Truth, or true sense thereof? To the apprehending of the first is
required Aristotle gave that Rule to every Scholar, that intends to learn
the principles of any Art (to wit) Oportet discentem credere: A Scholar is
bound to believe. The other point, touching the Truth, or true sense, what it
is, is the Object of man's understanding; so that there is a great difference
between both these in the case of a Reprehension. As for example; the Master
teaching the definition of Logic, saying; It is an Art of Disputing rightly,
may justly reprove his Scholar for his not believing it, because his not
believing is wilful: so can he not for his not understanding it, for that he

This agrees with the Current of Scripture John 6. verse 38. Christ being the
Oracle of Truth, which descended from Heaven to reveal the will of his Father,
might justly exact Belief, that whatsoever he spoke to the sons of men was
most true: as it is written, The will of God is, that whosoever believes in
me, etc. verse 40. viz. That they must Eat his Flesh. But his hearers could
not understand (...) What was the true sense of these words, which caused them
to say, This is an hard saying. Therefore (like Scholars of preposterous wits)
would they not believe (...), namely That they were True: hence it was that
Christ reproved them for not believing only verse 64. and not for not
understanding. Because it was as lawful for Christ's Disciples to be ignorant
of his dark sayings and Parables (which were therefore so spoken, that his
Scholars might more earnestly labor to know them) as it was after lawful for
them to Matthew. 7. 7.
Seek, and promise to Find) how to understand them. As it is written; Matthew.
13. 36.
His Disciples said unto him, Declare unto us the Parable of the Seed: and
Christ answered them, He that sows, etc.

That admirable Doctor of Gods Church Saint Augustine will show himself herein
an understanding Scholar of Christ (see his Testimony) requiring of all the
Disciples of Christ, in the first place, Belief of Christs-words, that they
are True, before they did understand what was the Truth thereof: confirming his
Rule by that Scripture; Except you believe you shall not understand. O, but)
the Capernaites (says Master Brerely) did understand Christ's words right well.
And Saint Aug. in Ioh. 7. Tract. 27. [Sunt quidam in vobis, qui non credunt.]
Non dixit, sunt quidam in vobis qui non intelligunt sed causam dixit quare non
intelligunt, nempe quia non credunt -- ut Propheta, nisi credideritis, non
intelligetis. Aliquanto superius. Illi putarunt illum erogatu^um corpus suum --
Ille autem dixit, se ascensurum in coelum -- Certe tunc intelligetis, quia eo
modo, quo putatis, non erogat corpus -- [Caro non prodest quicquam.] Sicut illi
intellexerunt carnem, spiritualiter intellectum vivificat. And Master Brerely
out of Augustine in Psalm. 98. [Nisi quis manducavetit.] Dixerunt, durus hic
sermo; accep^unt illud stulte carnaliter illud cogitaverunt.
Augustine contrary to Master Brerely, expressly answers, They did not
understand the Truth of Christ his Speech, but apprehended it foolishly and
literally; nor was there ever any Father, or Author, no not in your own Romish
Church (we think) before one Master Brerely, that thought otherwise. We are
willing your Bishop Iansenius may moderate this Difference. (See the Iansenius
Concord. cap 59. upon the very words of Saint Augustine. [Non dixit, sunt
quidam in vobis qui non intelligunt, sed causam dicit quare non intelligunt.]
Advertenda differentia inter credentes and non credentes: non credentes ob
verba non intellecta offendebantur, credentes vero verba non intellecta
humiliter susceperunt, and admirabantur.
Margin.)

His second Assertion, touching that speech of Christ, [The flesh profits
nothing, it is the spirit that quickneth,] That it was Qualify his former
terms of Eating his flesh, is very like also to be his own, being flatly
contrary to the same Father, whom he avouched; for Saint Augustine says that
Christ, by these words, taught the Capernaites to understand his other words of
Eating Spiritually; a Truth which Master Brerely's own great Master, Cardinal
Sed verus and literalis sensus eorum verborum est, carnalis intelligentia nihil
prodest, ut exponunt Chrysostom. Theophyl. Euthem. nec non Origines. Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 14.
Bellarmine, has published, alleging for proof thereof the Testimonies of
other Fathers, saying; Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthemius, and also Origin so
expounds it. So he. * Who notwithstanding should not have balked Tertullian,
where Tert. de Resurr. Quia durum and intoler abilem sermonem ejus
exis^imarunt, quasi vere carnem suam illis edendam determinasset, subjunxit:
[Caro nihil prodest] sed ad vivisicandum exequitur quod velit intelligi,
spiritum [verba quae locutus sum, sunt spiritus and vita.]
They thought that speech of Christ to be hard and intolerable, as if Christ
had determined to deliver his flesh to be (Mark) truly Eaten: therefore Christ
added, saying The flesh profits nothing,] But for giving of Life, is required
the Spirit, [The words which I speak are Spirit, and Life.] What can be more
plain to prove that the Truly proper Eating must needs signify an Eating
Carnal, and Capernaiticall. *

Master Brerely his third Inference is; Therefore the words, speaking of Eating
his flesh, are not Figurative; which indeed Truth be according to a Literal
sense, (as Master Brerely would have it) or else in a Figurative; which has
been our defense and proof throughout the Second Book, from all kind of
Evidences of Truth.

Here therefore we are only to deal with Master Brerely, and with his
pretended witness Saint Augustine, to whom he Brerely himself) Mr. Brerely
Liturg Book 4.. ^. at Fourthly.
If we should attend to the properiety of Speech, Christ's Blood is not
properly drunk. So he; albeit Christ his speech was as expressly for drinking
his Blood, as for Eating his Body. And he (we suppose) will confess, that
every speech, which is Improper, is Figurative. As for Saint Augustine, he
stands as a sworn witness against the proper and literal sense of Eating
Christ's Flesh, calling it See afterward, Chap 6. 3. in the Challenge.
Flagitious. Besides, rather than we should want witnesses, to aver this
Truth, Diverse Jesuits will be ready (in the Sea afterward c. 5. Sect. 2.
following Brerely flatly, that if he say the words, Eating Christ's Flesh, are
properly spoken, he speaks False.

II. Proving the Objected Saint Augustine to Contradict the Romish Doctrine of
Corporal Presence, as Protestantly as can be. SECT. II.
MAster Brerely his Conclusion, taken from Christ's speech of Eating, is to
infer a Corporal presence of Christ in Saint Augustine upon these words of
Christ, John 6. Aug Tract. 27 (...) Ioh. [Si ergo videritis filium hominis
ascendentem ubi erat prius] quid est ^oc^ (...) sol vit quod illos moverat?
hinc aperuit unde fuerant Scandalizati? Hinc plane, (...) in^lliger^nt Illi
enim pu^abant cum erogaturum corpus suum, Ille autem dixit se ascensurum in
coelum, utique integ^^^ Cum (...) hominis ascendentem ubi erat p^ius, cer^e vel
tunc videbitis, qui non eo modo, quo pu^atatis, (...) corp^s suum: certo vel
tunc intelligetis, quia gratia ejus non consumitur (...).
[When you shall see the Son of man ascending into Heaven where he was
first] says that Christ by those words, Assoyleth the doubt, which troubled
and scandalized the Capernaites, who thought that Christ should give them his
Flesh to eat; by saying, that he was to ascend into heaven, doubtless with
his perfect Body; and that therefore they were not to think that his Body was
to be given unto them, in the manner which they conceived, by eating it by Bits
and Morsels. * Wherein you may plainly discern the Argument of Saint Augustine
to be, that Christ by his Bodily Ascension would show to the world, that he
being Bodily absent from the Earth, his Flesh could not be here Eaten by Bodily
Tearing asunder. Thus he against the Capernaites, which must as necessarily
Confute the Romanists Corporal Eating his Flesh, whether it Chewing, or
Swallowing; whether Visibly, or Invisibly it mattereth not; because it being
the same Body that ascended, were it Visibly, or Invisibly, it is equally
absent from Earth.

* As for the Remainders of that which is eaten of in the Sacrament, the Sea
above Book 3. c. 3.. 11.
Fathers (as we have heard) have called them Fragments, and Bits. And that
which Judas received from the hand of Christ, Saint Augustine himself calls
Aug. Tract. 26. in Job. 6. Nonne Buccella Dominica venenum fuit Iudae? and
tamen accepit; sed non quia male, sed quia male malus.
Buccella, a Morsel. If then by the judgment of Saint Augustine, Christ his
Bodily Ascension into Heaven, proved that he was not to be Eaten by Morsels
here on Earth; then Judas, which Saint Augustine calls a Morsel, was not the
Body and Flesh of Christ. * We have no list, after so plain a discovery of
Master Brerely his manifold ignorances, to play upon his Person, but rather do
pray that at the sight of his Errors he may be reduced unto the Truth, now,
after his (fondly miscalled) Strong Reasoning to the Contrary.

CHAP. IV.
That the now Romish manner of Union, and Bodily receiving of the Body of
Christ, is sufficiently Capernaiticall in Five kinds. SECT. I.
TEll us not that no Doctrine of your Church can be Heretical, before that it
be so judged by some General Council: no, for Rectum est Index sui and
Obliqui, and therefore an evident Truth, written in the word of God, does
sufficiently condemn the Contrary of Heresy, as well as Light does discover
and dispell Darkness. And this is manifest by the example, which we have now
in hand, of the Capernaites, old Heretics, (as all know) even because they are
set down in Scripture to have perverted the sense of Christ his words of
Eating his Flesh; and thereupon to have departed from Christ, John 6.

Your Romish particular manner of Corporal Receiving to wit in the 1. Hand, by
Touch, for Eating. 2. Mouth, by Eating. 3. Throat, by Swallowing. 4. Belly, by
Commixture. 5. By Union in the Inferior parts, unworthy to be named.


* That the First manner of Romish Corporal Union of Christ's Body with the
Bodies of the Communicants, by Bodily Touch, is Capernaiticall, and the
Testimonies of the Fathers are unconscionably urged to the Contrary.
Union of Christ his Body, by a Bodily Touch, in general, is the Adequate and
Proper Subject of this whole Question, concerning Christ his Conjunction with
the Bodies of the Receivers, in this our present Discourse; whether it be Touch
by Hand, or Mouth, or Throat, etc. and therefore we begin with the First
degree of Touch, as it were by Hand; which, in the generality thereof, may
imply all the other Touches. Your Objected Testimonies are, either our Cyrill,
talking of bringing our Earthly Bodies, by participation of this Sacrament to a
Cyril. Alex. lib. 4. in Ioh. cap. 14. Vnde ut hoc corpus (...) cibo sibi
cognato gustu, tactu, ad immortalitatem reducetur? Objected by Bell. lib. 2. de
Euchar. c. 25.
Kin-like Touch of Christ's Body; or from Saint Chrysostom, where speaking of
this Sacrament, Chrysostom, Multi desiderant Videre formam Christi: Ipsum
vides, (...) Objected by Doctor Heskins in his Parliament of Christ. book 3.
c. 54. out of Chrysostomes Hom. 3 in Eph^^. tous; Imput^s manibus ausus es
ipsius Corpus attinge. ^.
Many (says he) desire to see the form of Christ, and here Christ yields
himself (in this Sacrament) not only to be seen, but also to be felt and
Touched. And this will your Doctors needs enforce upon us, for proof of a
Corporal Touch, and Consequently a Corporal presence of Christ's Body in the
Eucharist.

But do you not see, in this Testimony, the word [See,] [Touch?] and are you
now to learn that which you all teach, that Christ's Body, as it is in this
Sacrament, is altogether Invisible beyond man's Imagination, and not to be seen
of men; no, nor yet to be discernd by the very Devils. Besides, that All men's
eyes, by Contemplation, can avouch it to be nothing less than Seen. So that
the word [Seene] being so Improperly and Figuratively spoken, might have given
you reason to discern, that he used the same Impropriety of Phrase in the
other word [Touch.] Yea, and Chrysostom himself will tell you, that has
Rhetoricated as fully in the word Touch; when in an Homily he willed the
People Chrysostom. in Mart. 14 (To people that were to be baptized.) Tenete pedes
Salvato^s
To hold Christ our Savior by the feet.

But what need many words, your own Doctor and Dictator of Romish Profession,
Aquinas affirms also Aquinas part 3. quaest 76. Art. 7. Corpus Christi, a
nullo in hoc Sacramento videri potest, corporali oculo, quia ibi est per modum
substantiae -- neque accidentia Corporis Christi habent immediatam habitudinem
ad hoc Sacramentum, neque corpora quae circumstant eum ad modum substantiae,
quae non subjacet alicui sen sui, sed nec etiam imagine itioni, sed soli
intellectus -- Imo nec Daemones possunt videre Christum per intellectum, ut est
in hoc Sacramento.
That the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is not subject to any
sense at all. And more particularly, for the sense of Touching, your Vasquez
speaking with Assurance, Vasquez Ies. in 3. Tho quaest. 76. Ant. 7 Disp. 191.
c. 3. Christus, ut est in hoc Sacramento, neque alium tangere, neque ab allo
tangi protest, non incerta ratione dicimus.
Christ, (says he) as he is in this Sacrament, can neither touch, nor be
touched of any thing. And your* School again gives reasons hereof.

Therefore can it be no less than a blind Boldness, to urge the word [Touch,]
as Properly spoken by these Ancient Fathers, which you have learned, by your
Fathers, of the Romish Profession, cannot properly agree with the Body of
Christ. What evasion have you now? Forsooth Idem Ibid. quaest. 75. Art. 2.
Disp. 180. cap. 9. Tangi dicitur sub pa nis speciebus remote, sicut Christus
Luc. 8. [Quis me tetigit] cum tamen nullus ipsum proxime, sed tetigit vestem
ejus.
The Cause (says the same Vasquez) is, as it was with Christ when he said Who
Touches me] when men touched him, but not immediately, but by Touching his
garment. So he. But soft Sir, you your self have already affirmed, That Christ
cannot possibly either Touch or be Touched of any thing in this Sacrament,
according to the Doctrine of Aquinas, who gives this reason, for See the
Testimony of Aquinas, here above cited, at (4).
That the sense of Touch has no habitude at all to Christ's Body herein, not so
much as by the Accidents, or forms of Bread and Wine, neither mediatly nor
immediately; which shows the Dissimilitude of the Comparison taken from
Touching Christ's Vestment, (and thereby his sacred Body, which was touched by
the same Vestment immediately) and here Touching Christ's Body by the Accidents
of Bread, neither Touch Christ's Body, nor are Touched by it; because Christ's
Body is therein Simply as a Substance without Accidents. From the Manual
Touch, by Handling, we proceed to the Orall, by Eating. *

CHAP. V.
Of the Second Romish Bodily manner of Union with Christ's Body by Eating.
That the Second Romish Bodily manner of Union with the Body of Christ, which is
by Orall Eating, once professed in the Church of Rome, was both
Capernaitically-Hereticall, and
THe first member will appear by the Faith of the Church of Rome, in the Days
of Pope Nicholas, whose Faith (about the year 1509.) may be best known by the
Oath, which was prescribed by him unto Berengarius, concerning the Eating of
the Body of Christ in this Sacrament. Which Oath (as your Baron. An. 1059. number.

Cardinal Baronius does certify you from the Stories of those times) Pope
Nicholas and a General Council held at Rome revised, approved, and prescribed
to Berengarius to take, for the abjuration of his Error, concerning the manner
of Eating the Body of Christ; and the same Oath was after published by the
Popes authority throughout all the Cities of Italy, France, and Germany; and
wheresoever the Report of Berengarius should come. So he. You cannot now but
expect such a form of an Oath, which must be as truly Romish, as either Roman
Pope, or Roman Council could devise.

Oath. I Berengarius Archdeacon, etc. do firmly profess, that I hold that
Faith, which the Reverend P. Nicholas and this holy Synod has commanded me to
hold, (to wit) That the Body of Christ is in this Sacrament, not only as a
Sacrament, but even in truth is sensibly handled with the hands of the Priest,
and broken and torn with the Teeth of the faithful. So the Oath. The same
form of Abjuration is registered in the public Papal Ad perpetuam rei
memoriam, etc. Bulla P. ante Gratian. Extat in Decret. de Consecrat. Did. 2.

Decrees: and the Body of these Decrees has been lately ratifyed by the Bull
of Pope Gregory the thirteenth. The same Faith was embraced Waldensis, Ruardus,

Schoolmen, who, without any Distinction, used the same Phrase of Tearing with
Teeth.

Secondly, of aftertimes, your Quod si corpus Christi in Eucharistia editur,

and conjunctum and proprium. Can. loc. Theol. lib. 5. ca. ult. sub finem.
Canus asseverantly infers of the Body of Christ, that If it be eaten, then
certainly it is broken and torn with the teeth. But most Emphatically your
Cardinal Tam miro modo corpus Christi connectitur speciebus, ut unum ex
ambobus fiat Sacramentum -- Ex hoc sequitur, sicut antea per eadem panis, ita

Alan. It is said (says he) to be torn with the teeth of the faithful, no
less properly, than if it should be said so of the Bread, if it were eaten. *
Flat Contradictory to the Determination of your own Pope Innocent the third,
teaching that Innocent. lib. 3. de offic. Missae. cap. 21. Dicamus ergo quod
forma panis frangitur and ^atteritur, sed corpus Christi sumitur and comeditur.
Ea quae notant corruptionem, referentes ad formam panis: ea vero quae notant
acceptionem, ad Corpus Christi.
Not the Body of Christ, but the forms of Bread are said to be broken, because
this notifyeth a Corruption (meaning) Broken and Torn. * Yea and your
Cardinal Hoc Concilium Generale fuit. -- Et haec Abjuratio apertissime
significat rem a Concilio definitam sub Anathemate: nec anathematizantur nisi
Haereses damnatae ab Ecclesia. Bellarmin. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 21.. Primum,
Bellarmine, for proof of Transubstantiation, has recourse unto the same
Roman Council, which he styleth General, and notes the thing defined to
have been the Judgment of the Church; and that the same Judgment was
Delivered under the Censure of an Anathema and Curs^ against the Gainsayers:
and therefore He, with his Disciple Master In his Rejoynd. page 270.
Fisher (who also allegeth the same) are Challengeable to hold it according to
the literal sense thereof; because it will not admit any qualification, by any
Trope or Figure that Form of Recantation and Abjuration of Heresy: but (as
Nullae sunt exactiores formulae loquendi, in materia fidei, quam eae quibus
utuntur ij, qui Haeresin abiurant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. Sanct. cap. 21..

you confess) There are no forms of speech more exact and proper in phrase,
concerning the matter of faith, than such as are used by them that abjure
Heresy. And Secondly, for that this Form of words, of Tearing with the teeth
the flesh of Christ, was also made purposely for Abjuration, and abandoning all
Figurative sense, for the Defense of the literal Exposition [This is my Body,
etc.] therefore was it taken literally: But what (think you) will Calvin say
to this your (then) Romish form of Profession, in the literal sense? Calvin.

A man should rather wish to die on hundred times (says he) than once to
entangle himself in a Doctrine, so monstrously sacrilegious. Which Censure of
his we now endeavor to make good.

That the foresaid Roman Faith, of Properly Eating the Body of Christ, is
Capernaitically-Hereticall; as is proved by some of your own Doctors of the
now Romish Church. SECT. II.
YOu have heard of Berengarius his Abrenuntiation of Heresy, according to the
faith of the (then) Roman Church, in Breaking the Body of Christ, and tearing
it sensibly with their teeth. Hearken now a little, and you shall hear, in a
manner, an Abrenuntiation of that (then) Roman faith, by denying it to be
either properly Broken or yet really Torn, even by the Jesuits themselves.
Caro Christi, dum in hoc Sacramento manducatur, non dentibus atteritur, quia
tangi nequit, estque immortalis and impartibilis. Manducatio autem realis
requirit contactum rei edendae, ut possit dividi and transmutari. Quod hic de
Corpore Christi fieri nequit. Salme^on. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 20. page 136*
Real Eating (says your Salmeron) requires a real touch and tearing of the
thing which is eaten: but the Body of Christ is not torn with teeth, or
touched by them that eat him, because he is herein impartible. So he. Your
Jesuit and Cardinal Bellarmine is as it were in a maze, saying Si de ratione
manduc^tionis esset attritio dentibus facta, Dico, Christi corpus vere and
proprie manducati, etiam corpore in Eucharistia, non quod attritio est
necessaria ad manducationem, satis est enim transmissio in stomachum
deglut^endo Sin vero attritio dentibus facta sit de ratione manducationis: Dico
Christi Corpus proprie manducari, non tropice: non enim dicimus corpus Christi,
absolute manducari, sed manducator sub specie panis: quae sententia significat
species manducari visibiliter and sensibiliter, ac promde dertibus atteri.
Bellarm. lib. 1. de Euch. ca. 11.. Respon. Corpus.
The Body of Christ is not absolutely eaten, but eaten under the forms of
Bread: and that is to say (says he) the forms of Bread are sensibly and
visibly eaten. So he. If this imported a literal manner of Eating, then might
your Cardinal have said as literally of himself; My Clothes are torn,
therefore my Body is rent in pieces. Not to trouble you with the Cardinall's
Philosophy, that talks of Eating and Tearing of Colors. But to the point.

If only the Accidents of Bread be (as he says) sensibly eaten, then was
Pope Nicholas his Prescription of Eating Christ's Body sensibly, in your
Cardinals opinion, not True. And upon the same Ground it is, that your Jesuit
Frangi, metaphorica, and non propria locutio est, colligitur ex Thoma, qu. 77.
Art. 7. and patet, quia fractio proprie and in rigore significat divisionem and
discontinuationem partium: quae constat non fieri in partibus corporis Christi,
Suarez in Thom. qu. 75. Disp. 47. Art. 1.. 4.
Suarez, out of Thomas, and other Schoolmen, affirms the word [Broken] to be
a Metaphorical phrase, not properly belonging to the Body of Christ; because
it requires that there should be a Separation of the parts of that which is
properly broken. So he, as also your Canus, see in the former Section.
Canus has concluded. And your Si proprie loqui velimus falsae sunt hae
propositiones, Corpus Christi manducatur a nobis, Corpus Christi devoratur,
Corpus Christi frangitur, quia ipsi modi, qui his verbis significantur, non

Euch. page 144. Vere sumitur, sed non atteritur. Ibid. page 143.
Jesuit Maldonate is so bold as to tell you, that these Propositions, The Body
of Christ is Eaten, is Broken, Torn with the Teeth, or Devoured of us
(properly taken) are false. Thus your Jesuits, as Body of Christ to be eaten,
torn, or devoured (properly taken) is a Carnal, Capernaiticall, and (as your
own Nisi sane intelligas verba Berengarij, in majorem Haeresin incides qua^
Ipse fuerit. Igitur omnia referas ad species ipsas, etc. Gloss. apud Gratian.

one of your grave Critics so much abhorred the conceit of proper Tearing
Christ's Body, that he called the Objecting hereof against your Church, in his
blind zeal, Blasphemy: and answers, that you do no more Tear Christ's
Flesh, than Caiphas tore his, when he rent his Clothes. The case then is plain
enough, for Confutation of your more ancient Romish

That the former Romish and Popish Faith, for the Manner of receiving of the
Body of Christ, is at this day but somewhat altered; yet miserably inconstant
and Faithless.
PRotestants may have in this place just matter of insultation against your
Romish Professors, to prove their Infidelity in that which they seem to
profess. As first, that the Ground of your Doctrine of Corporal presence is
the litterall and proper interpretation of the words of Christ, when he said
[Take, eat, this is my Body:] yet now are you compelled to say, that Properly
eaten, is no proper, but a false sense.

Your Second Doctrine is, that the Judgment of a Roman Pope, in a Roman
Council, in a matter of Faith, is Infallible. Notwithstanding Pope Nicholas,
with his Roman Council, is found to have grossly erred in a tenor of
Abjuration, which of all others (as has been confessed) is most Literal, and
was therefore purposely devised against a Figurative Sense of the words of
Christ; and forthwith published throughout Italy, France, Germany, etc. to
direct men in the Faith of sensual Eating, breaking, and tearing the Flesh of
Christ with their teeth: yet notwithstanding, your common Judgment being now
to reject such phrases, taken in their proper Signification, and in Berengarius
his Abrenunciation, what is, if this be not an Argument that either you say,
you care not, or else you believe you know not what? Let us go on, in pursuit
of your Doctrine of the Corporal manner of Eating, which you still maintain,
and it will be found to be Capernaiticall enough. And lest that you may evade,
by pretense of Not- Chewing, we add as follows.

That the Orall Eating of the Sacrament, was anciently by Chewing. SECT. IV.
CHewing the Sacrament with the Teeth was the form of Eating, at the time of
Christ his Institution, as is proved by your own Suarez. See above, Book 1.
Cap. 1. Sect. 4.
Confession, in granting that the unleavened Bread, which Christ used, was
[Glutinosus,] that is, gluish, clammie, and such as was to be cut with a knife.
But that the same manner of Eating, by Chewing, was altered in the Apostolical
or Primitive times, is not read of by any Canon; yea or yet Admonition of any
one Father in the Church, whether Greek, or Latin: among whom, Saint Augustine
called the manner of eating, a See above, cap. 2. Sect. 9.
Pressing the Sacrament with the Teeth. That also Chewing continued in the
Romish Church till a Thousand and fifty years after Christ, is not obscurely
employed in the former tenor of the Recantation of Berengarius, prescribed by
the By tearing it with teeth. And lastly, that this has since continued the
ordinary Custom of the same Church, is as evident by your Cardinal Alan, and
Canus, See above in the former Section.
who have defended the manner of Eating, by Tearing. Nor was Swallowing
prescribed by any until that the queazie stomaches of your Hostiam saliva
reverenter liquefactam in corpus dimittat: non est enim dentibus terenda, vel
palato admovenda, sed ante ablutionis sumptionem deglutienda. Coster. Ies.
Institut. lib 1 cap. 5.
Jesuits, not enduring Chewing, persuaded the Contrary. Which kinds of Eating,
whether by Chewing; or Swallowing of Christ's Flesh, being both Orall, none can
deny to have been the opinion of the Nimis carnaliter intelligebant (Discipuli
Capernaitae) credentes ejus carnem comedi oportere, sicut edebantur animalium
carnes, quae dentibus conteruntur. Madridius. Ies. de frequenti usu
Eucharistiae, cap. 4.
Capernaites. First of Chewing; and then afterward of Swallowing

That the Corporal and Orall Eating of Christ's Flesh is a Capernaiticall
Heresy, is proved by the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers. SECT. V.
Capernaites, set down John 6. concerning their false interpreting the words
of Christ, when he speaks of Eating his Flesh, which they understood
literally. But this literal sense Origin. Hom. 7. in Levit. page 141. [Nisi
manducaveritis carnem meam] Si secundum literam sequaris hoc: ipsum quod dictum
est, occidit haec litera: vis tibi aliam proferam ex Evangelio literam quae
occidit, [Qui non habet, inquit, gladium, vendat tunicam, and emat gladium] Si
vero spiritualiter, non occidit, sed est in eo spiritus vivificans.
Origin calls a Killing letter, that is, a pernicious interpretation, even as
of that other Scripture [Hee that has not a Sword, let him buy one: etc.] but
this latter is altogether Figurative, as you know, and has a Spiritual
understanding, therefore the former is Figurative also.

Athanasius Athanas. Tract. in illa verba. [Quicunque dixerit verbum in filium
hominis, etc] Quod hominibus corpus suffecisset ad cibum, ut universis mundi
alimonia fieret. Sed propterea ascensionis suae meminit, ut eos a corporali
intellectu abstraheret, -- Quae locutus sum (inquit) spiritus sunt and vita, id
est, corpus in cibum dabitur, ut spiritualiter unicuique tribuatur, and fiat
singulis praeservatio ad Resurrectionem.
confuting the Capernaiticall conceit of Corporal Eating of Christ's Flesh,
will have us to observe, that Christ after he spoke of his Flesh, did
forthwith make mention of his Ascension into Heaven, but why? That Christ
might thereby draw their thoughts from the bodily sense, namely, of Eating it
Corporally upon Earth, which is your Romish sense. * His Capernaites (who
imagined a Carnal Eating of Christ's Flesh.) That which was to ascend into
Heaven, could not be eaten Corporally on Earth: But Christ said that his Body
should ascend into Heaven. And therefore signified thereby that he could not
be eaten upon Earth; which ought to have been a Satisfactory reason and
Answer to the Capernaites themselves. *

Tertullian likewise gives the reason of Christ's saying, [It is the Spirit
which quickeneth] because the Capernaites so understood Eating his Flesh, As if
(says Tertul. de Capernaitis. Quia durum and intolerabile existimarunt
sermonem, quasi vere carnem suam illis edendam determinasset, praemisit,
[Spiritus est qui vivificat] lib. de Resurrect. carnis.
Tertullian) Christ had truly determined to give his Flesh to be eaten.
Therefore it was their Error to dream of a truly Corporal Eating. Aug. in
Job 6. [Non moritur] Non qui panem premit dente, sed qui man ducat in Cord.
Tract. 26. -- Idem in Psalm. 98. Spiritualiter intelligite, non Hoc corpus, quod
videtis, manducaturi estit, and bibituri sanguinem illum, quem fusuri sunt, qui
me crucifigent: Sacramentum commendavi vobis, spiritualiter intellectum
vivificabit vos.
Augustine, out of the sixth of John, brings in Christ expounding his own
meaning of Eating his Flesh, and saying, You are not to eat this flesh which
you see, I have commended unto you a Sacrament, which being Spiritually
understood shall revive you. Plainly denying it to be Christ's Body which is
Eaten Orally; and then affirming it to be the Sacrament of his Body: and as
plainly calling the manner of Corporal Eating, A pressing of Bread with the
teeth. We say Bread, not the Body of Christ. For, when he comes to our
Eating of Christ's flesh, he exempteth the Corporal Instruments, and requires
only the Spiritual, saying, Aug. apud Gratian. de Consecrat. (...) 2. Vt quid.
Quid pa^^ dentem and ventrem? creed and manducasti. Ex Aug. de remed. (...). ut
quid.
Why preparest thou thy Tooth? It is then no Corporal Eating: and he adds;
Believe, and thou have eaten. Saint Augustine goes on, and knowing that
Corporal Eating of any thing does infer a Chewing, by dividing the thing
eaten into parts (as your own Jesuit has See above, Book 5. cap. ^.. 2.
confessed) lest we should understand this properly, he teaches us to say
Idem rursus apud Gratiam ibid. Christus manducatus vivit; quia resurre^t it
occi^us: nec, quando mandu^^us, parts de illo facimus, and qu^dem Sacramento
id ^it: no^ut fideles quemadmodum manducent carnem Christi, per parte^
manducatur in Sacramentis m^net integer c^^lo and in cord. Ex Aug. Sermon. de
verbis Evangeli^.
Christ is not divided into parts. Contrarily, when Sacramentally, that is,
Figuratively, and improperly, he will have us to grant that Christ his Body is
divided in this Sacrament, but remains whole in Heaven.

Say now; will you say that Christ's Body is Divided by your Eating the
Eucharist, in a literal sense? your own Jesuits have abhorred to think so.
And dare you not say that in Eating this Sacrament you do Divide Christ's Body,
in a literal sense? then are you to abhor your Romish Literal Exposition of
Christ's speech, which cannot but necessarily infer a proper Dividing of the
flesh of Christ.

* We may not conceal the Evasion, which your Disputers have devised, for
blunting the Di^t of this notable Sentence. You see not the same Body (says
Saint Augustine) Bellarm. lib. 2, de Eucharist cap. 24. ^uxta Lanfrancum. Resp.
non Idem corpus, id est, non eodem modo, non in specie visibili aut mortali;
Idem quoad substantiam, non Idem quoad modum.
That is (say they) not after the same manner (namely) not in a visible and
mortal shape. So they. Than which Exposition what can be more extravagant, by
skipping from the Predicament of Substance, to the Predicament of Quality? You
shall not eat the same Body (says Saint Augustine) What then shall they eat?
He adds, I have commended to you a Sacrament to be eaten. Therefore the
Opposition used by Saint Augustine, is to Distinguish between Christ's Body,
and the Sacrament of Bread; as between Substance, and Substance; As you see
it, to signify the manner of Eating invisibly: but you are not to eat That which
you see; as denying Christ's Body to be the matter of their Sight; even as Saint
Augustine does often express himself, as well in that place where he called
his Body, The Bread, the Lord: and the Sacrament, The Bread of the Lord: like
as your own Gabriel Bi^l, Lect. 80. lit. n. Non, cum manducamus, parts de
illo facimus, and quidem in Sacramento id fit: intelligit nos non parte^
corporis Christi sumer^e, sed Sacramenti.
Schoolmen discerned his meaning in the other words, of Eating* as yet not
making parts of his Body, but of the Sacrament of his Body. *

Lastly, do but call to mind Saint See above Chap.. 2. (...)
Augustines Observation Athanasius) to wit, Christ's mention of his Ascension in
his Body from Earth, lest that they might conceive of a Carnal Eating of his
flesh; and these Premises will fully manifest, that Saint Augustines Faith was
far differing from the now Romish, as Heaven is distant from Earth. We still
stand unto Christ's Qualification of his own speech, when he condemned all
Carnal sense of Eating his flesh, saying thereof, The flesh profits nothing,
etc.

For Conclusion of this Point, you may take unto you the Saint Chrysostom. in
Johan. 6. (Grace) Homi. 47. (Latin) Homil. 46. [Verba, quae ego locutus sum,
Spiritus and Vita.] Su^ritus, hoc est, Spiritus alia, hoc enim nihil carnale,
nullam consequentiam carnalem habentia: [(...) -- (...) to non prodest
quicquam.] Quid hoc? nunc de ipsa carne dixit? absit, sed pro carnaliter^
audite de ijs, qui carnaliter accipiunt quae dicuntur -- Quomodo non prodest
quicquam caro, sine qua nemo potest rivere? vide quod non de carne, sed de
carnali auditione dictum est.
Chrysostom, as follows; Did not Christ therefore speak of his flesh? far
be it from us (says he) so to think! for how shall that flesh not profit,
without which none can have life? but in saying [The flesh profits nothing]
is meant the carnal understanding of the words of Christ. And that you may
know how absolutely he abandoneth all carnal understanding of Christ's words,
of Eating his flesh, he says, They have no fleshly, or natural Consequence
at all. So he. Ergo, say we (to the Confutation of your Romish Belief) no
Corporal touch of Christ in your mouths, no Corporal Eating with your teeth,
no Corporal Swallowing down your throat; how much less any Corporal mixture
in your Bellies or Guts, as your Roman See Chapt. 6. Sect. ^. following.
Church professes.

CHALLENGE.
WHether therefore the Capernaites though to eat Christ's Flesh raw, or
roasted; torn, or whole; dead, or alive; seeing that every Corporal Eating
thereof, properly taken, is by the Fathers held as Carnal and Capernaiticall,
it cannot be that the Romish manner of Eating should accord, in the Judgment of
Antiquity, with the Doctrine of Christ. Notwithstanding you cite us to appear
before the Tribunal of Antiquity,

the other figure.] Cum hic sanctus cibus, and incorruptibile epulum, etc.
Origin (say you) will have the Communicant to think himself unworthy, that
the Lord should enter under the roof of his mouth. Right, he says so, but in
the same sense wherein he equivalently said, that He who entertaineth a
Bishop and Spiritual Pastor, must know namely, Christ, Figuratively. II.
Chrysostom (who speaks in the highest strain) says that Chrysostom. Hom. 60.
ad Pop. Antioch. Mul^i dicunt se velle videro ejus formam, ipse concedit, non
tantum videre, sed and tangere, and monducare, and dentibus terere. So Chrys^t.
ibid. Lingua rubescit sanguine Christi. Et lib. 3. de Sacerd^^io, and ^om. 47.
in Ioh. [(...).] Spiritualia sunt.
We see, touch, eat, and tear with our teeth the Flesh of Christ. True, but,
to note that he spa^e it in a Rhetorical and Figurative sense, he
equivalently says also in the same place; Our tongues are made red with his
Blood. And elsewhere, to put all out of question; See his testimony in the
former Section at (i)
These (says he) are Spiritual, and contain no Carnal thing. Yet what need
you our Comment? Your Josuit Maldonate would have gladly prevented us, Dentibus
teri, quemadmodum Chrysostom. locu^us est, haec non postunt nis^ Sacramento tenus
intelligt, non propri^. Maldon. Ies. in Matt. 26. 26.
The words of Chrysostom (says he) of tearing the Flesh of Christ, cannot be
otherwise understood, than Sacramentally. Even he, which concluded but now,
that to say See above, Chapter 4. Sect. 2.
We eat Christ's Flesh, properly, is a false proposition. S. Augustine as
Emphatically of Baptism, Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 11. Vnde rubet Baptismus, nisi
Christi sangu^e consecratus?
It is red with the Blood of Christ. *

III. Gaudentius (say you) says Gaudent Promisit corpus suum; por^igit tibi
corpus suum, corpu^ accipis, De pane fecit corpus proprium, etc. Obj. Bellar
lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 21. [Albeit a little after upon these words. Nist
manducaveritis:] Volu^t Christus animas nostras precioso suo sanguine
sancti^icari^ per imaginem pretiosae passionis, qu^ omnes fideles populi
exempla passions ante oculos h^bentes quotidie gerentes in manibus, and ore
sumentes ac pectore, redemptionis nostrae opas indelebili memo^a teneamus.
Gandent. Tract. 2. de Ratione Sacramentorum.
We receive the Body which Christ reaches, making of Bread his Body. We grant
he said so, but he interprets himself, saying; Christ would have our souls
sanctified with the Image of his Passion. Again, scan but his former words,
Christ made his Body [de Pane, of Bread] in the literal Sense, and it will
infer a Body of Christ not made of the flesh of the Virgin. IV. But Aug lib. ^
Con. adver. Legist Proph. cap. 9. Christum sanguinem dantem, fideli cord ac

Augustine teaches that We receive the Body of Christ both with heart and
mouth. Which your Notandum, non cord tantum, sed etiam ore dici -- Bellar.
Ibid. [yet it follows immediately in S. Augustine, giving this general Rule
for such Say^ngs^] Agi in omnibus Scripturis secundum sanae fidei regulam,
^igurative dictum vel factum si quid exponitur de quibus^ibet rebus and verbis,
quae in sacris paginis continentur, expositio illa du^atur, etc. [Teaching in
all other Scriptures (as in this) a figurative sense, wherein any matter of
Horror, or Turpitude may seem to be contained]
Objector notes, as being very not able for the Orall Receiving, Corporally;
albeit the same S. Augustine immediately expresses, that this, and all other
such speeches are to be understood figuratively; and unproperly. V. But Pope
Leo is brought in, saying [ Leo Ser^ 14. de passione Christi. Ipsum per omnia
and spiritu and catne gustemus. Ob Bellar. quo supra, cap. 28. [Gustemu^^, pro
Gestamus; for he speaks of Baptism lawfully administered, where by we are

Other places objected out of Leo we grant, as Sermon. 6. de (...). 7. Hoc ore
sumitur, quod cord^. creditur: And so say we; Ore, Sacramentally]
Gustamus] We taste with our Flesh the Flesh of Christ. Nay, but you have
corrupted his Saying, for his word is [Gestamus] We bear or carry it,
(namely) by being Baptized (as there is expressed) whereof the Apostle said;
You have put on Christ. VI. But Pope Gregory ( say you) says; Greg Papa Hom.
22. in Evang. Qui sanguis super ^^^que postem ponitur, quando non solum ore
corpous, sed etiam ore cordis hauritur. Ob. Rollar. lib 2 de Euch. cap. 23.
[But Gregory a little after of Baptism,] Et in superlim nare domus agni
sanguinem po^imus, quia crucem illius passionis in front portamus.
The Blood of Christ is sprinkled upon both Posts, when we receive it both with
heart and mouth. Which (we say) he spoke with the same Impropriety of speech,
wherein he adds equivalently, that The Blood of Christ is sprinkled upon (by
Baptism) the Sign of the Cross. VII. But Isych. l. 6. in Levit. c. ^2 Per
ignorantiam percipit, qui nescit quia corpus hoc and sanguis est secundum
veritatem, etc. Ob. Bellar quo supra [Yet the same Isych. lib. ^. in Levit.
cap. ^. Carnem aptam cibo feclt post passione^: si enim non fui^^et crucifi^us,
sacrificium ejus corporis minime concederemus, comedimus autem nunc cibum
su^ences memoriam passionis.
None receives (says Hesychius) save he that perceives the truth of his
Blood. But how? even as he himself there adds, By receiving the memory of
his Passion.

* In all the former Sentences of Saint Augustine, Pope Leo, and Pope Gregory,
all that we read of is, that the Body of Christ is Received in the Sacrament,
not only with the heart, or by Faith; but also with the mouth. And so will any
Protestant affirm, not only in the same words of the Fathers, but also in
their own genuine Sense: if Saint Augustine, who is objected in the first
place, may interp^et his other Contests, who (in a Section before) says, as
you have heard, that Bread is called Christ's Body, not in the Truth of the
things, namely, of propriety of speech, according to the letter, but in a
Significant mystery, or Mystical Signification. To signify unto us that
Christ's Body is in our heart Really, and in our mouths Sacramentally. *

VIII. But Optatus tells us Optat. Milevit. lib. 6. contr. Parmen. In Altaribus
Christi membra sunt portata -- Altar seeds est corporis and sanguinis Christi

passus est in Altari.
that The members of Christ are upon the Altar: And that The Altar is the Seat
of his Body and Blood: and that it is an bainous thing to break the Chalices
of the Blood of Christ, etc. We grant these to be the Phrases of Optatus,
indeed, which you have objected: but, alas! my Masters, will you never learn
the Dialect of Ancient Fathers, after so many examples, as it were lights, to
illuminate your Optatus will instruct you in his own language, who presently
after inveighing against the same Donatists, says; Christ is now beaten by you
on the Altar. So he; by the Hyperbole making Christ to be beaten, wherewith
he said Christ was seated on the Altar. Yea and that the Members of Christ are
carried also on the same Altars: meaning thereby the Faithful Communicants, as
is confessed by your own Gabriel. Albispin. Episc. Aureliens. Not. in illud

vestra.
Bishop (in the margin.) Namely in the same Rhetorical sense, wherewith Aug.
Vos estis in Calice, vos estis in mensa. Test Beda in 1. Cor. 10.
Augustine said of all the Faithful Christian Communicants: You are on the
Table; you are in the Cup.

IX. Augustine doubted not to say of this Vi^^^ word, the Sacrament of Christ,
De Consecrat. Did. 2. Can. Cum frangitur. -- Dum sanguis de calice in or^
fidelium funditur. Aug.
The Lords Blood is po^^ed out into the mouths of the faithful. And Hierome
is as bold to say of the audible word of God, that when it is preached Hier. in
Psalm. 147. Quando audimus sermonem Dei, (...) Christi and sanguis ejus in
auribus fidelium sunditur.
The Blood of Christ (by it) is powered into the ears of the Hearers.

Master Master Brerely. Cyprian. de Coena Dom. Christus pincerna porrexit hoc
p^culum, and docuit, ut non solum exterius hoc sanguine frueremur, sed and
inte^ius asp^isione omnipotenti anima muniremur. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 2. Subd. 4.
Brerly would think much not to be suffered to put in his Vie, in the name of
Cyprian; We are joined with his Blood, not only outwardly, 'but also inwardly
our souls are fortified with the Sprinkling thereof. So Cyprian. What means
Body (says Master Brerely, and adds) which convinces our Bodliy Receiving
thereof So he. From the same Cyprian, who, in the same place, says in the same
style, Cyprian, paulo post. Cruci haeremus, sanguinem sugimus, and intra ipsa
Redempptoris vulnera figimus linguam, etc.
We cleave to his Cross, suck his Blood, and fix our tongues within the
wounds of our Redeemer, which are all Sacramental, Allegorical, and
Tropologicall Phrases; as Cyprian will clearly express himself, in respect
of our outward man, and spiritually of the inward. We shall desire Cyprian to
be Moderator between us in this question, before we come to an end of this
Book.

CHALLENGE.
Corporal presence of Christ in this Sacrament, and Union with the Partakers
thereof, are found by this Encounter of just Parallels, to be indeed the idle
imagination of your Teachers, and the erroneous Intoxications of all their
Disciples, who yield assent unto them. For to interpret the Figurative speeches
of the Fathers literally, is all one, as to stick Goose-feathers in their
Caps, and plainly to befoole them; by making Gaudentius; Gaudent. Tract. 2.
Jubemur Caput Divinitatis ejus cum pedibus Incarnationis manducare.
We are commanded to eat the head of Christ's Deity, with the feet of his
Incarnation. Or the saying of Saint Hierome; Hier. in Psalm. 147. Ego corpus
Jesus Evangelium puto -- Et cum dicit [Qui bibit sanguinem meum] licet in
mysterio possit intelligi, tamen verius sanguis ejus, sermo scripturarum est.
When Christ said, He that drinks my Blood, although it may be understood in
a Mystery, yet the truer blood (says he) is the word of Scripture. Or as
before him, Origin; Origin. in Numb. 23. Hom. 16. Bibere dicimur sanguinem
Christi, non solum Sacramentorum ritu, sed cum Doctrinae ejus verba recipimus,
in quibus vita consistit: sicut ipse dicit, Ioh. 6. Verba mea Spiritus sunt and
vita.
We drink the Blood of Christ (says he) not only by the rite of a
Sacrament, but also in receiving his word, whereof it is said, My words are
Spirit and Life. So they.

And so just Cause have we to complain of the Inconsionableness of your
Objectors, by their so often abusing the Testimonies of these holy Fathers;
insomuch that you had need of the often Admonition of your own Senensis: Saepe
monuimus non esse Concionatorum verba semper in rigore accipienda: multa enim
Declamatores per Hyperbolen enunc^t and inculcant vel occasion persona^um
inducti, vel affectuum impetu, vel orationis cursu rapti, Hoc interdum
Chrysostomo contigit Sixtu^ Senenfis. Biblioth. lib 6. Annot. 152.
I have often given warning (says he) that the Sayings of Fathers be not
urged in the rigidnesse of their words, because they use to speak many times
HYPERBOLICALLY, and in excess, being either transported by the vehemence of
their Affections, or carried with the Current of their Speech. So he. * Thus
have we

The Inconsionableness of the Romish Disputers, in Objecting the former
Testimonies of Ancient Fathers: from the Confessions of the Romish Doctors
themselves. SECT. VII.
THis Section is to be divided into two Classes of Authors: One is of the
Sayings of the Fathers, which you have Jesuits as others, by whom the literal
sense of the same Sayings and Phrases of the Fathers, are as liberally and
expressly rejected. The Terms of the Fathers, which have been alleged in the
two former Sections were of these kinds; to wit, Christ's Body, received in this
Sacrament, is Tasted, Divided, Broken, Torn with the Teeth; And his Blood
Sprinkled, and Powered into our mouths, and Drunken. If any Protestant should
say that these speeches of the Fathers, are all Improper and Figurative,
Corporal presence of Christ in this Sacrament) you would say that he
interpreted the sayings of the same Orthodox Fathers falsely and Heretically,
according to your manner of phrasing and en^tyling Protestants, to make their
Answer^ seem Odious. Wherefore we now crave leave of you that we may believe
your own Doctors themselves, from their own Confessions, (See the Margin:)

Respectively. I. Of [Taste.] We cannot say that one does Taste of Christ's
Body properly, but by a Figure. II. Of [Dividing.] Christ, in this Sacrament,
is whole in every part thereof, and cannot be Divided; because he is
impartible. III. Of [Broken.] Christ's Body is not said to be Broken in it
self, but only in the Sacrament of Bread; and to say that Christ's Body is
properly Broken, were a false speech, and not agreeable to Christ's Body. IV. Of
[Tearing.] Christ's Body (say they) cannot be said to be Torn, but only
Tropically, because it is not Divisible: and to say that your Church of Rome
holds that Christ's Body is Torn with the teeth of the Communicants, is
Blasphemous. V. Of [Eating.] The Body of Christ is not absolutely Eaten,
because if absolutely Eaten, then should it be torn with the Teeth, and if so,
then also divided into parts: It is therefore said to be torn, by a Figure,
because the forms of Bread are torn with the Teeth. Of the VI, and VII.
[Sprinkling, and Pouring out of Blood.] Those are not to be attributed to
Christ's Blood in the Sacrament; because these betoken a Shedding thereof, which
is a Separation of it from his Body, which was never but once on the Cross;
nor is it properly Drunken. So they. That is to say; So have they Objected the
Sentences of the Fathers: and So have they answered: and consequently So have
also confuted themselves. *


The Third Romish Corporal Union of the Body of Christ, with the Bodies of
the Communicants, is with Swallowing it down. SECT I.
YOur General Tenet is, That the Body of Christ is present in the Bodies of
the Receivers, So long as the forms of Bread and Wine do continne. Nex that
Satis est ut transmissio fiat in stomachum, deglutiendo. Bellarm. lib. 1. de
Euc. cap. 11.
It is swallowed down, and transmitted unto the Stomach: Yet further, that
your Priest in your Roman Mass is enjoined to pray, saying; Missale Roman.
authoritate Concilij Tridentini, and Papa Pij Quarti. Ordinarium Missae. Corpus
tuum Domine, quod sumpsi, and sanguis quem potavi adhaereat visceribus meis.

Missall (but yet of equal Authority) teaches all you English Priests to
pray, saying; O God who refreshest both our Substances with this food, grant

concludes, Aquin^ in 3. qu. 7^. Art, 6. ed 3. Subst (...) Corporis Christi non

That the Body of Christ cease not to be in this Sacrament, so long as the
form of Bread continues in the Eater thereof. So he. Not excepting any
Eater, whether it be Man, or Beast; thereby embracing this Opinion; namely,

fuit express definita per Gregorium undecimum, Testo nostro Riv^to Pictavio,
in Academ. Battaviae Prosessore in lib. Orthodox. Cathol. Tract. 3. qu. 18.
That a Beast eating this Sacrament, thereby does Devour the true Body of
Christ: which you call The Common Opinion of your Church, taught and defined by
Pope Gregory the Eleventh. *

That this former Doctrine is fully and filthily Capernaiticall
IN this Romish Profession every one may see, in your Corporal presence, two
most vile and ugly Assumptions; One is, of your Devouring of Christ, and
feeding bodily on him. The other is a Possibility of (saying your presence)
passing him downward Into the Draught and Seege; that being as ill, this
peradventure worse, than any Capernaiticall Infatuation; for which cause it was
that your Jesuit Maldonate, although granting that you do Corporally receive
it into your stomachs, yet See above, cha. 4.. 2.
denied, for shame, that you are Devourers thereof.

But, I beseech you, what then means that, which your Romish Instructions,
Decrees, and Missals (as we have Ibid.. 1.
heard) do teach you to do with the Host, in case that any either through
Infirmity, or by Surfeit and Drunkenness, shall cast up the same Host out of
his stomach? We demand, may your Communicants be [Vomitores,] to cast it up
again, and can you deny but that they must first have been [Voratores,] to
have devoured that which they do so Disgorge? Will you believe (...) Ies. Tom.
2. Cont. 2. in Ioh. ^. (...) mea ve^os est cibus etc.] votare, est ^ine
masticatione glutire.
Osorius? To Devour a thing (says he) is to swallow it down by Chewing. Say
now, do you Swallow the Sacrament by Chewing it? then are you Capernaiticall
Tearers of Christ's Body. But do you Swallow it without Chewing? then are you
Capernaiticall Devourers thereof. Say not, that because the Body of Christ
suffers no hurt, therefore he cannot be said by Corporal Swallowing to be
Devoured: for his Body was not corrupted in the G^ave, and yet was it truly
Buried; and his Type thereof, even Jonas without Mastication was Swallowed up
into the Belly of the Whale, and yet had no hurt. Notwithstanding, devoured,
who was afterward cast up and vomited.

That the same Romish manner of Receiving it down into the Belly, is proved to
be Capernaiticall, by the Judgment of Antiquity. SECT. III.
TTheophylact Theoph. in Ioh. 6. p. 304. Capernaitae putabant, quod Christus
cogeret eos (...), voratores carnis suae esse: nos hic spiritualiter
intelligimus, neque carnium voratores sumus.
noted the Capernaites Opinion to have bin, that the Receivers of the Body of
Christ are (...), Devourers of flesh, where as the words of Christ (says he)
are to be understood Spiritually, and so will it be known that we Christians
(what?) are not Devourers of Christ. So he. But, that Swallowing (properly
taken) is a Devouring, has been proved: and, if Devoured, then why not also
(that which is the Basest of all Baseness) passed down, by Egestion, into the
Seege? whereof the Ancient Fathers have thus Determined. Origin, that Origin in
Matthew. ca. 15 [Quod si quicquid in os ingreditur, in ventrem abit, and in
secessum eijcitur.] Et ille cibus sanctificatus verbo Dei, juxta id quod habet
materiale, in ventrem abit, and in secessum ^ijcitur. Caeterum juxta
precationem pro proportione fidei factus sit utilis, efficiens ut perspicax sit
animus. Nec materia panis, sed super eo dictus sermo prodest non indigne
comedenti. Et hae^ quidem de Symbolico corpore: multa porro and de verbo dici
possunt, quod factum est caro, verusque cibus, quem qui comederit vivet in
aeternum.
The material part of this meat, Sanctified by prayer, passes into the
Draught: which (says he) I speak of the Symbolicall Body, etc.

Bellar. Ista omnia recte intellig^ possunt de Eucharistia -- at materiale,
quod in secessum abit, sunt accidentia, non respectu formae naturalis, sed
sanctificationis and magnitudinis: nam magnitudo ad materiam potius pertinet
quam ad formam -- Et per hoc quod Symbolicum corpus vocat, intelligit corpus
Christi, ut est hic Symbolum and signum sui^psius, ut ^rat in cruce. lib. 2. de
Euch. cap. ^.
Cardinals Crotchets, who confessing Origin to have spoken all this of the
Eucharist, would have us by Materials to understand Accidents in respect (says
he) of Sanctification, which they had, and of Magnitude, which belongs
rather to the matter of a thing, than to the form: and by Symbolicall Body, to
conceive, that this was meant of the Body of Christ it self, as it is present
in this Sacrament, a Sign, or Symboll of it self, as it was on the Cross. So
he; as if he meant to Cross Origens intention throughout every part of his
Testimony.

Bread, he calls also meat Sanctified. Secondly, That Meat he terms
Material. Thirdly, This Material, he says, passes into the Draught. Lastly,
concluding his speech, concerning the Sacramental Body, and saying; Hithe^
have I spoken of the Symbolicall Body; immediately he makes his ^ransition to
speak of the Incarnate Body of Christ, as it is the True Souls meat. But
first, merely Accidents were never called, by Ancient Fathers, Meats.
Secondly, never Materials. Thirdly, never Magnitude in it self, without a
Subject, was judged otherwise than Immateriall. Immateriall thing to have
Gravity, or weight in pressing the guts, to make an egestion into the Draught.
If every one of these be not, yet all may make up a fourfold Cord, to draw
any Conscionable man to grant, that Origin was of our Protestants Faith.

* And although Obstinacy it self should struggle with us, touching the
former sentence of Origin, yet his words immediately following, should (we
think) challenge a Consent: Because cause, after he had spoken of Sanctified
meat, meat Material, meat which goes into the Belly, Meat whose matter
does not profit the Eater, Meat passing into the Draught, Meat named the
Symbolicall Body; (which your Cardinal teaches to betoken Christ's own
natural Body:) He immediately after makes a Transition from this Meat, to
that which he calls the True meat, and says; Sequ^tur apud Orig. in Matthew
c. 15. Haec quidem de Symbolico corpore, multa porro de ipso verbo di^i
possunt, quod factum est caro, ve ^usque cibus, quem qui comederit, ommino
vivet in aeternum, quem nullus malus potest (...); nam si malus ederet verbum
carnem factum, cum sit panis vivus, nequaquam scriptum (...) Quisquis ederi^
hunc panem viv^t in ae^ernum.
Further more many things might be spoken of the word, which was made Flesh,
even the True Bread, which, whosoever shall eat, shall live for ever: which no
wicked man can eat, else should he live for ever. Directly opposing this Word
made Flesh, to that which he had called the Symbolicall Body. Ergo say we,
Origin (your Cardinal must pardon us) taught the Symbolicall Body, and Christ
True and proper Flesh to be two different Subjects. And again, for better
manifestation, he distinguishes in their effects; the one to be insufficient
to give life, the other to be Salvificall in it self, even to Life
everlasting. And Thirdly he differenceth them in their Eaters, intimating, The
wicked may be partakers of the former Symbolicall Body; because, of this
flesh, whereof the Scripture says, [The Word was made flesh,] called the True
meat, he testifies and professes, that No wicked man can eat this.

If, in imitation of Origens discourse upon the Eucharist, one should say of
the Baptism of a man of years and growth, thus; Water in Baptism, is in it
self a Liquor, although profitable to the Receiver, according to the
proportion of Faith, yet does it cleanse only the flesh, and is afterward cast
out of the Font into the Channel: (adding immediately) Thus much be spoken of
the Symbolicall Water: many things of the True Water, which is the virtue and
grace of the Holy Ghost, which whosover shall partake, shall live for ever: but
whereof, No wicked man can be partaker: What man can be so seely, as not to
apprehend a plain distinction, made bet^^ ^^ene the Symbolicall Water, and the
Truly Spiritual, which is the Grace of the Holy Ghost, as differing in respect
of their Essences, Effects, and in the Persons capable thereof? *

As for your Cardinals Pageant of Christ's Body in this Sacrament, as being a
Sign and Symboll of it self, as it was on the Cross, it See Booke^. Chap. 2.
Sect 6.

Chrysostom (as judging the very thought thereof Execrable) denies it with an
[Absit!] Finally, Ambros. l. 5. de Sacram. ca. 4. Non iste panis est, qui vadit

supersubsta^ (...).
Ambrose is so sarre from the proper Swallowing of Christ in this Sacrament,
that Distinguishing between Corporal Bread, and the Body of Christ, (which he
calle^h Super substantial Bread, and Bread of everlasting life, for the
establishing of man's Soul) he denies flatly that this is that Bread which
goes into the Body. If any Mouse (which, you say, may run away with the Host)
be wholly fed thereon for a months space, the Egestion of that Creature will
be as Absolute a Demonstration as the world can have, that the matter fed upon,
after Consecration, is Bread. And why may you not as well grant a power of
Egestion, as confess (which you do) in that Creature a Digestion

Two false Interpretations fell upon the Catholic Profession, concerning the
Doctrine of the Eucharist, in the days of S. Augustine; both which that holy

Christ was Hanged on every tree, and tied unto all meats which they eat,
would needs have their Religion to be somewhat agreeable to the Catholic
Profession. An Imputation which Saint Augustine did abhor, namely, that it
should be thought that there was the same reason (concerning Christ's Body) of
the opinion Mystical Bread, among the Orthodox, which the Man^chees had of
their Corporal Bread. As for example, that Christ should be fastened or tied to
men's guts, by eating, and let loose again by their belching. Which Heretical
Doctrine how shall it not accord with your Romish, which has affirmed a
passage and Entrance of Christ's Body into, and Cleaving unto men's See Chap. 7.
Sect. 1.
Guts by eating? and a Repasse again by Vomiting, albeit the matter, so fast
and so loose, be (in the judgment of Saint Augustine) Bread still, after
Consecration?

Catholics in the Eucharist adored Ceres and Bacchus, after the manner of the
Pagans. What answer, do you think, would a Romish Professor have made in this
Case? doubtless (according to your Doctrine of Corporal Presence) by saying
thus: Whereas some affirm that we do adore Bread and Wine in this Sacrament,
yet the truth is we adore that, whereunto Bread and Wine are
Transubstantiated, (to wit) the Body and Blood of Christ the son of God. But
Saint Augustine, as one fancying nothing less; We (says he) are far from
the gods of the Pagans, for ^ee embrace the Sacrament of Bread and Wine. This
is all, and all this he spoke after Consecration.

Whereupon we are occasioned to admonish our Christian Reader to take heed of
the fraudulent practice of the Romish Sect, because of their abusing of the
Writings of ancient Fathers, whereof take unto you this present Editio Paris
Anno 1614 Noster panis -- mysticus fit nobis [Corpus Christi] non nascitui
[Whereas the direct sense is that Bread Consecrated, is not naturally bread (as
it were the spicae, that is Eare^ of Corn, spoken of by the Mani chees) but
made My sticall; and Sacramental by Consecration.]
Example. The Paris Edition An. 1555. has the Sentence of Saint Augustine
thus: Noster panis -- Mysticus fit nobis, non nascitur. But the last Paris
Edition Ann. 1614. has foisted in and inserted [Corpus Christ;] albeit the
sense be full without this Addition, to signify that Common Bread is by
Consecration made Mystical or Sacramental (according to Saint Augustines own
Exposition, we embrace the Sacrament of Bread and Cup;) and also the Phrase of
[Panis fit Corpus Christi; Bread is made Christ's Body] be repugnant to a common
Principle of all Christianity, which never believed a Body of Christ made of
Bread. So that the aforesaid Addition is not a Correcting, but a Corrupting of
the Text.

* The miserable straights of Romish Disputers, in answering the Definitive
Sentence of Saint Augustine, concerning
SAint Aug. de Doctr Christ. lib. 3. cap. 16. Si praeceptiva locut^o flagitium
aut facinus videtur jubere figurata est, ut [Nisi mand^^ averitis ca^nem meam]
facinus videtur jubere; Ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse
communicandum, and suaviter and utiliter recondendum in memora, quia pro nobis
caro ejus crucifixa, and vulneata sit.
Augustines Determination is set down in that his one famous Sentence, for the
expounding of those words of Christ [Except you eat the flesh of the Son of
man, etc. Ioh. 6.] thus: Whenever we find in Scripture that is, As when it
is said [Except you eat my flesh:] which seems to command some heinous Sin,
therefore it is Figurative, commanding us to communicate with Christ's passion,
and sweetly and profitably record in our memory, that his flesh was crucified
and slain for us. So Saint Augustine; which one Sentence has been always
held, of Protestants, to be convincent, for strangling of your Romish Cause.
Which your Cardinal seeing as it were Bellar. lib. 1 de Euch. cap. 7. Non vult
Augustinus dicere, carnem Christi Tropice manducari, si essentiam manducationis
spectemus, quae solum requirit, ut verus cibus ab ore traijciatur in stomachum,
per instrumenta vitalia; sed vult dicere Tropice manducari quoad modum, nam
Ordinanus and proprius modus manducandi est, ut caro visibiliter secetur in
parts, and particulatim sumatur: and cocta, non creda: Caro autem Christi
sumitur integra, and invisibiliter, et sine ulla laesione sui, qua manducatione
figurate significamus and representamus passionem Christi. 1. probatur, quia
non est scelus carnem Christi spirituali modo sine fuilaesione sumere. 2. quia
per scelus intellig^^ modum edendi Capernaiticum, nempe tatnem lan^ando.
Augustine (says he) meant not to say that Christ's flesh is eaten Tropically,
inrespect of an Essential Eating, wherein is required only, that True meat be
let down from the mouth into the stomach, by vital Instruments: but called
it a Tropicall Eating, in respect of your ordinary and proper manner of Eating,
by a visible dividing of Christ's flesh into parts and morsells, and that it be
sod, and not raw. But Christ's flesh in the Eucharist is received whole,
invisibly, and without any hurt, by which manner of Eating we represent the
Passion of Christ; which is thus Saint Auigustine understands by an Heinous
offense, the Capernaiticall manner of eating thereof, namely by Tearing it in
pieces. So he. We must take this whole Answer in pieces, for Confutation of
each particular point, lest otherwise a General and Brief Answer might breed
Obscurity.

Your Cardinal thinks to evade, by multiplicity of Distinctions. Ob. 1. He
meant not Eating with Teeth, but a passing of it from the Mouth into the
Stomach. Sol. This is Chewing, your own Jesuit Suarez confessing that the
Sacramental Bread in Christ's time was See Book 1. cap. 2.. 2.
Glutinosus: And that this manner of Tearing with Teeth had been continued many
Ages in the Church of Rome, as also used among some of your Church at this day,
as has been See above Cap. 5. Sect. 4.
proved. And lastly that Saint Augustine himself meant Eating by Tearing with
Teeth, who (as the Bellar lib. 1. de Euch. Cap. 7. Qui manducat cord, non qui
premit dente, etc. Vbi de Sacramento loquitur, non qui premit dente, nimirum,
solo.
Cardinal himself confesses) mentions the Sea above, Cap 5. Sect. 5.
Pressing of the Sacrament with Teeth. Secondly, Ob. But the manner of Tearing
(says he) is not essential to eating, but only the pressing of it down
into the Stomach. So he. Sol. Notwithstanding Pope Nicolas in his Roman
Council expressly required the Sensible Tearing of Christ's flesh (as has been
showed See above, Cap. 5. Sect. 5.
) whereof you have also heard your Jesuit See above, Cap. 5. Sect. 2.
Salmeron confess, saying, that Proper Eating requires a Proper Tearing, even
as your Cardinal himself, calling Eating, by Dividing into Parts, a Proper
manner of Eating. Ob. 3. Augustine spoke of a visible Eating of Christ, and not
as ours is, Invisible. Sol. As if a blind man could not eat meat as perfectly
as he that sees. Ob. 4. But Saint Augustine understood Christ's flesh Sod, and
not Raw. Sol. As though the Eating of man's flesh Raw, or Sod, could distinguish
a Canniball. Ob. 5. But Saint Augustine spoke of Eating Christ's flesh with
hurting him, which appears by this, that he called the manner of Eating,
which he spoke of, an Heinous offense. Sol. As though your See above; Book 4.
Cap. 10 Sect. 5.
Aquinas had not as well judged it an Heinous offense to put Christ in a Box,
appearing in his visible shape, notwithstanding Christ's No-sensible-heart
thereby. Ob. 6. But he spoke against the Capernaiticall manner of Eating, which
was Tearing it in pieces, and requires a Spiritual order in eating; and ours
is Spiritual. Sol. First as if your Eating were not Capernaiticall in any
degree, which is False. Because as the Capernaites interpreted Christ's words in
a literal sense of Eating it perfectly, so did they also conceive a Real
Swallowing of it after it had been Eaten. And does not your Cardinal plead
here wholly for Swallowing of Christ's Body? or has not also your Jesuit
Coster defined Devouring to be a Swallowing of meat without Mastication, or
Tearing? Or can you deny but the Primitive See before, in this Chap. 6.
Fathers Detested the very conceit of Devouring Christ's flesh? And Secondly,
where Saint Augustine opposes Carnal manner of Eating to the Spiritual, could
he possibly mean your Romish kind, which you profess to be a taking it into
your Mouths, and by your Corporal Swallowing and Transmitting through the
Throat into your Stomach, whether Visibly, or Invisibly, whether Sod, or Raw?
No no, nothing less, but the flat Contrary, a mere Spiritual manner of
Communicating of Christ's passion (says he) and by See (...)
Sweetly recording in our memories his flesh once crucified for us.
Establishing this latter Eating with Mind and Heart, that he might exclude
the other of Eating with Mouth and Teeth. *

CHAP. VII.
The Fourth Corporal manner of Union of Christ
We hear your Jesuit reporting that Multi Catholici his temporibus, in odium
Haeresis, veram praesentiam corporis Christ in hoc Sacramento -- Sumptione ejus
fieri unionem inter Corpus Christi and suscipientem, quam real^m, naturalem,
and substant^dem, atque e^am corporalem vocant Sic Algerus, Turrecremata,
Rossensis, Hosius, Turrianus, Bellarminus, Alanus. Suarez. Ies Tom 3 qu. 79.

Many latter Divines in your Church, have been authorized in these days to
write, laboring to bring the Roman Faith to so high a pitch, as to persuade a

Among others we find your Cardinal Card. Alan. Cum comedimus Eucharistiam,

temeraria est. Suarez quo supr. page 822.
Mendoza. And what else can that sound, which we have heard out of your Roman
See above, Chap. 6.. 2.
Missall, praying that the Body of Christ eaten may cleave unto your Guts? just
Manichean-wise, as you have heard even now out of Saint Augustine. * And it may
be you have Faith also to believe your own Legendae, telling you of the In

The Confutation and Expulsion of this Foggie Mist of
THis first opinion of mingling the Body of Christ, Corporally with man's Bodily
parts, what think you of it? Your Jesuit calls it Suarez in 3. Tho. qu 79.
Disp. 64. Sect. 3. Nihilominus haec sententia improbabilis, and aliena
dignitate and majestate hujus Sacramenti, quod non propter corporalem
conjunctionem, sed propter spiritualem institutum est, dicente Christo [Mea
verba spiritus sunt and vita. Ioh. 6.] p. 822.
Improbable, and as repugnant to the dignity and majesty of this Sacrament:
See above in the first at the letter (D)
Rash, and Absurd. Justly, Ass unto Balaam) condemn the foolishness of your
Prophets, namely those, of whom you have See above at (B)
heard your Jesuit confessing, that this is the Doctrine of Almost all late
Divines; which is to add one Capernaiticall Absurdity to another.

It only remains to know with what Spirit these your New Divines have thus
written; your See above his Testimony cited at the letter (A)
Suarez. tells us, saying, That they spoke so in hatred of Heretics (meaning
Protestants) against whom they write. Who would not now magnify the Profession
of Protestants, to observe their Adversaries to be so far transported with
the Spirit of malignity and giddiness against them, that by the just judgment
of God they are become so struck blind in themselves, as that they fall into
opinions not only (as is confessed) Rash and Absurd: but also
Capernaitically-Hereticall? And indeed they who imagined a Corporal Eating,
how should they not as well have conceived a Corporal fleshly Commixtion?

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Romish Objections out of the Fathers, for proof of an Union of Christ's
Body by a Bodily Commixture with the Bodies of the Communicants.
SOme of their Objections are taken from the Sentences of the Fathers, Some
from their Similitudes, and Some from their Historical Reports. We begin
with their Sentences.

That the Objected Sentences of Fathers make not for the Romish Corporal
Union; but are proved by their own Dialect to be unconscionably alleged. SECT.
I.
THe express Testimonies of the Objected Fathers you may read in the Margin,
as they are marshalled by your own Jesuit Suarez Ies. in 3. Tho. Disp. 64.. 3.

Suarez, to wit, Irenaeus, Chrysostom, Cyril Alexand. Greg. Nyssen, Pope Leo,
and Hilarie. The sum is, The mixture of Christ's Body with ours, by a
Corporal and Natural Union indeed,

Two kind of Semblances are to be Observed, one in their like Hyperbolicall
Phrasing, concerning Baptism; and the other touching our Conjunction with
Christ.

Of Baptism, Hilarie the VI. objected, says, Christians by Baptism, which is
one, are made one, not only in affection, but also in nature. Leo the V.
objected, says also that By Baptism the Body of the Regenerate is made the
flesh of Christ crucified. And furthermore mark what your Cardinal Tolet has
collected from Augustine, namely that Tolet. Com. in Job. ^ A^not. 26. D^cet
Augustimus lib. 1. de Pec^ merit. Parvulos per B. p^^smum participes fieri
hujus Sacramenti (Eucharistie) quod nac (...) nam per Baptismum sunt de corpore
mystico Ecclesiae, ad unitatem Christi pertinent; hoc Sacramentum hujus
unitatis corporis signum est, and ideo hoc Sacramento aliquo modo participant,
nempe quantum rem significatam, and dici possunt carnem Christi manducare and
bibere sanguinem.
Infants, by being Baptized, are made partakers of the Eucharist, because they
are Members of the Mystical Body, and are so made in a sort partakers of this
Sacrament, (that is to say) of the thing So he. By which your Objectour must
be enforced to admit a like Real Conjunction, and Consequently of a Real
presence of Christ in Baptism, as they have for the Bodily Union and Presence
of Christ in and by the Eucharist.

Yea, and the Fathers with the like accent and Emphasis of speech say as much
of other things: Isidor. Pelus. Verbum Dei [(...)] l. 2. Epist. 281. Item Greg.
Nyssen de soncto Stephano; Gratia spiritus sancti permixtus est and
contemperatus.
Isidore Pelusiota of the word of God, that It feeds men's souls, and is in a
manner mingled therewith. Of the Baptized, that by Baptism August. apud
Gratian. de Consecrat. Did. 4. Ad hoc. Ad hoc Baptismus valet, ut Baptiza^i
Christo incorporentur.
They are incorporate into Christ, says Augustine: And that thereby Chrysostom.
in Ephesians. Hom. 20 (de Baptismo.) Facti sumus os ex ossibus, and caro ex carne

They are made bone of Christ's bone, and flesh of his flesh, says Chrysostom.
Of the Eucharist, Domase. Epist. ad Zachar. Episc. D^arorum. Quod accipitur,

It is mingled with our souls. So Damascen. Of the participation of the Bread
of Idolaters, with the participation of the Sacramental Bread of the Lords
Supper, that Primasius in 1. Cor. 10. Sicut salvator dixit [Qui manduc^at
carnem meam, in me manet] -- Sic Idolorum panis Daemonum participatio est. Et
ut multi de uno pane participantes, unum corpus sumus: Sic si de eodem pane
manducamus, unius Idololatriae, unum cum illis corpus efficimur.
As by the one Christians are made partakers of Christ's flesh, so by that other
are men made partakers with Devils. So Primasius.

Wherefore your Disputers, by comparing these Sentences of the Fathers with the
former, if they shall take them as spoken properly, and not Sacramentally and
Figuratively, shall soul, by the word. First, a proper Mingling of Gods spirit
with Man. Secondly, a proper Incorporating of man into Christ; and a proper
Mixture of Man with Devils. And again upon due Comparison of the Testimonies
of Fathers, objected by you, with these now alleged by us, concerning the
Eucharist it self, it will necessarily follow, that by the same reason,
wherewith you have sought to prove one kind of Proper presence of Christ's Body,
and Transubstantiation, and Unions you must allow August. Confess. lib. 7. cap.

Four more: One of Christ's Christian Communicant into Christ Body; a Third of
a Natural bodily Union of Christians among themselves. And Fourthly (which is
Damascen's) of Christ's Body into men's souls. All which kind of Presences,
Unions, Mixtures, and Transubstantiations, taken in a proper sense, you cannot
but condemn as Atheologicall and senseless, in your own Judgment;
notwithstanding all the former alleged Phrases of ancient Fathers, for your
Corporal Conjunction.

We have therefore singled apart the Testimonies of these two Cyrillus. (...)

Fathers, as being, in your Choice, More special, because that all your
Disputers, whenever Corporal Union, they esteem them Insoluble above all
others; Insomuch that one of your Doctors, after he had objected the Sentences
of Irenaeus, Greg. Nyssen, Damascen, Leo, and Saint Augustine, no sooner names
the Sentence of Hilarie, but prefaceth of it, saying; This is a more notable
Place. Another concludes the Doctrine of Cyril to be so absolutely Romish,
that he accounts Protestants no better than Men sold over to the Devil, for
not assenting to your Common Interpretation of him. But this Flash of your
Doctor Ignis fatuus, or a Blind Zeal without knowledge, when we come to this
Particular.

In the Interim, that you may know we mean to deal clearly, we First grant
unto you the Scope of either of these two Fathers, in their Discourses.
Hilarious sought to confute the Arian Heretics by defending a Natural Union of
the Godhead of Christ, the son of God, with God the Father. Cyril intended to
convince the Nestorian Heretics, for proof of an Hypostaticall Union of the
two Natures, Godhead and Manhood, in one person of Christ. Secondly, General
Council at Ephesus, call the Flesh of Christ, which Christians participate in
this Sacrament, [Vivificatricem,] that is, Vivificall, or giving life to the
Receivers, even unto Immortality. Thirdly we grant, that they name our
Conjunction of Christ by this Sacrament to be, not only an Union in Affection
and Concord, but also a Natural and Corporal Conjunction of the Body of
Christ with the Body of the Communicants. And Lastly we grant, that one of
them adds a Similitude of the Union of Waxemelted with Wax. And yet
notwithstanding all these our Acknowledgements and Grants, we presume to
affirm, that all these Testimonies teach, indeed, a Mystical, not your Romish
Missaticall Union, by a properly Corporal Touch of Christ's own natural Body,
with the Bodies of the Receivers. Our ground is the same, which we have often
laid Union of the Eucharist (as it is to be seen in the Margin) with other
Unions mentioned by both these same Fathers, in as Aequivalent and Equipollent
terms (equally named by them both) Natural and Corporal; albeit void of any
Corporal Touch of the Body of Christ, as you your selves will grant.

For the Instances, used by these Fathers, are diverse, Some consist only in
Relation, and some in Application also. The Instance given in the Relative
only, is in respect of the Incarnation of Christ, when he took the same
nature of our flesh upon him; which Relation of a Christian man's flesh with the
Humane flesh of Christ, is universally in all persons, at all times (even
without this Sacrament) called by Hilarie, [Vnio Corporalis Nativitatis
Christi] that is, an Union wrought by Christ his Incarnation in our flesh,
being the same Specifically with his; and notwithstanding it is called by him
an Union Natural and Corporal, and not only the Union of Will and Affection,
albeit void of all Bodily Touch.

Next of the Unions made by Application, some are Spiritually only, and some
are Sacramental also. Of the Spiritual Union (which is also free from all
Bodily Touch) they Christ, and of True Christians, that they are United by the
Unity of Faith; which notwithstanding is likewise called by him, a Corporal
Union, and not only in Will and Affection. I come to the Sacramental Union.
Some of this kind are found in other Sacraments, and some in the Eucharist it
self. Of others it is indefinitely here said, that Christians are united by
the Sacraments, and namely (as is confessed) The Regenerat, by Baptism, have
an Union Corporal with Christ, and not only in Affection and Concord: albeit
this also be (as you know) exempted from all Bodily Touch. Unions made by the
Eucharist; Some are of Christians among themselves; and some of Christ with us.
Of the former, the Union of the faithful Communicants, as the Members of
Christ, is named by them a Natural and Corporal Union, and not only in
Concord, although (as you know) this can be no coincident Corporal Touch of
their Body reciprocally.

Thus these holy Fathers. And now that you may understand, from them, Four
several Unions, One Relative; Another Spiritual; A third Sacramental in
General; And a Eucharisticall; (peculiar only to the Sacrament of the
Eucharist) all of them equally named of these Fathers Corporal and Natural
Unions, and not Unions of Affection and Concordonely; notwithstanding each one
of the former Three exclude all Bodily Touch. We demand therefore why all
these Four, being named Natural and Corporal, Improperly, only the last
should infer a Real Corporal Touch of Christ's Body, by the virtue of the
same words, Natural, or Corporal? Your Cardinal gives his maine reason;
Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 12. Aliud esse, apud Hilarium, aliqua esse unum
naturaliter, aliud autem, unum esse in alio naturaliter. Nam ut aliqua sint
unum naturaliter, satis est, si vere participent naturam ipsius rei, in qua
sunt unum: and hoc modo dicit ipse omnes fideles esse unum naturaliter per
fidem -- sed ut unum sit in alio naturaliter -- necesse est, ut natura unius,
mere sit in alio: and hoc modo -- Christum esse in nobis per carnem
naturaliter; quia natura carnis ejus nobis vere unitur per Eucharistiam.
It is not the same thing with Hilarie (says he) Some things to be one
Naturally; and to be one in another Naturally: For things to be one Naturally,
it is sufficient, if both of them partake truly of the Nature of the thing
wherein they are one; and so he calls all Christians one Naturally by Faith.
But to be one Naturally [In] another, it is necessary that the Nature of the
one be merely within the Nature of the other: and so (in the meaning of
Hilarie) is Christ's Body said to be Naturally within ours by the Eucharist.
This is your Cardinals Ground of Assoilement, whereupon he relyeth as on a
Rock, immovable; which will instantly prove as wavering as a Reed; both False
and Fond; (as you may find in the Marginalls.)

For Hilarie speaking of one of the other Unions, which he calls Natural,
by reason of Christ's Incarnation, in taking our nature of Flesh upon him, says
that we are [In him.] Therefore is your Cardinals Distinction False. Next
Sacramental Union, whereof it is said, that Christ is [Naturally In us,] it is
also as expressly said, that we are likewise [Naturally In Christ.] But none
can affirm, that We, in true propriety of speech, are Naturally in the Body
of Christ. Therefore is his Answer most Absurd. But you will ask, how then can
this stand with the scope of the same Fathers, for the Confuting of the two
former Diverse Heresies, by an Only Symbolicall and Mystical Conjunction with
the Body of Christ? First thus; By our Eating and Drinking in this Sacrament
(according to Christ's Institution) Vivificall flesh of Christ, giving eternal
life unto the world; which (as these Fathers truly teach) it could not do, if
it were the Flesh of a mere man: And therefore he is, by Nature, God; one with
God the Father. Ergo Avaunt! Thou Arian-Heretike. The Second thus; The same
Humane flesh of Christ would not have the same divine Vivifical power and
virtue, except it were perfectly United to his Godhead; and therefore is Christ
both God and Man; and that not by Relation of two different Persons only, but
by an Hypostaticall Union of two Natures. Ergo thou Nestorian Heretic

The meaning of these holy Fathers is transparent enough, by their own
Sentences, as is now proved; which if it needed any further Illustration, might
be manifested by the like Testimonies of that Great Athanasius, who, from this
Article, of Christ his Incarnation only, whereby his Godhead assumed our
nature of flesh, spared not to say: Athanasius Tom. 1. Orat. 4. Contra Arianos,
page 487. (...).
that By his flesh, thus assumed of the word, (God) we men are Deifyed and
made Gods. So he; without any Relation to the Sacrament at all. And again,
when he spoke of the same Article Baptism, as either Hilarie or Cyril did of
the Eucharist. Ibidem. page 486. (...).
We, (says he) being borne again of water and the holy Ghost, are all made
alive by Christ; and our flesh is no more Earthly, but now by that [word, God]
Wordifyed, and made the same by him, that for us was made flesh. So he. And
so, according to the Romish presumption of Arguing, from the like words of the
Fathers, concerning the Eucharist, Athanasius must be said to have judged of
Baptism. I. That the Substance of water is changed. II. That by it, there is a
Corporal Union properly with the Bodies of the Baptized. III. That by the
same, the Flesh of the Baptized is made the Word, God. Which nothing but
Stupidity could conceive, or Impudency utter, or else Obstinacy defend.

The miserable Inconsionableness of the Romish Objecturs made clearly
Discernable, by their own Confessions, in granting that the Formerly alleged
Testimonies of the Fathers are Not to be taken in a Literal Sense. SECT. III.
ALl the Questions between your Romish Disputers and Us (concerning the
Speeches of the Fathers, objected Bodily Presence) is, whether they are to be
taken Literally and Properly, as they sound to the ear; or Improperly and
Figuratively, as they are to be apprehended by our understandings, in a
qualifyed Sacramental and Mystical Signification. And whether you can conclude
from them a Properly (so called) Corporal Union with his sacred Body; whether
by a Corporal Touch and Taste, Mixture, or Nutrition and Augmentation thereby,
or no. You have heard your Doctors object against Us the naked and Symbolicall
Phrases of the Fathers: will you be so good as hear them

These you Doctors certify you (see the Margin) that Calvin indeed Expounds
each phrase as spoken by an excess and exuberancie of speech, for extolling,
and commending the Dignity of the Sacrament. So he, of Calvin. Likewise of
your own Romish Doctors (says your Vasquez) Some of the University of
Complutum in Spain, did interpret the words of the Fathers, as spoken
Hyperbolically. And if you Some; we shall enquire into other Some, of better
eminency. As namely your Bellarmine, and Tolet, both Cardinals: your Suarez,
and even Vasquez himself, all Jesuits in their Times.

Let them (we pray you) make their own Answers in order, as they have been
Cited. First Bellarmine; Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4. Secundo Respondeo.
(Wherein also he expounds the like words of Justin.) Non est novum apud
Itenaeum, Hilarium, Nyssenum, Cyrillum, and alios, ut Eu charistia dicatur
alere corpora nostra, sed non intelligunt Patres, cum hoc dicunt, Eucharistia
nutriri vel augeri mortalem substantiam corporis nostri; sic enim facerent
Eucharistiam cibum ventris, non mentis, qu^ nihil absurdius fingi possit.
It is ordinary (says he) with these Fathers, to wit, Irenaeus, Hilarie,
Nyssen, Cyril, and others, to say that the Eucharist nourishes our Bodies: But
they did not understand a Substantial nutrition, or augmentation of our
Bodies; for so they should make it to be meat for the Belly, and not for the
soul, than which nothing could be feigned more Absurd. So he. Cardinal Tolet
is the Second, we desire to hear his Judgment. Tolet. in Ioh. cap. 6. Annot.
29. Cum dicunt Hilar and Cyril nostra corpora habere unionem corporalem and
naturalem cum corpore Christ, Doctores ^i non sunt ita intelligendi, ut velin^
ex Christo sumpto and sumen^e fieri unu^ Ens natural, indigna est illis
Doctrina) sed hoc dicere voluerunt, praeter unionem, quae ratione charitatis
and fidei sit, adesse intra nos ipsos vere and realiter Christum ipsu^, qui
causa est fidei ejusdem.
These Fathers (says he) Cyril and Hilarie, when they tell us, that we have
a Corporal and Natural Union with Christ's Body in the Sacrament, are not to
be understood, as if our Bodies and Christ's So he. Observe that Cardinal Tolet
notes the Fathers to have said, that the Bodies of the Communicants and the
Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, have One natural Being; because of their
other Sayings, that by eating of this Sacrament our Bodies are Nourished and
Augmented by Christ's Body. All which are spoken in a Sacramental tenor of
speech, and not properly, as you hear. Francis Suarez his Course is next;
Suarez. in 3. Tho. qu. 79. Disp 64. Sect. 3. Nihilominus haec sententia
improbabilis, and aliena dignitate and majestate hujus Sacrame^ti, quod non
propter corporalem conjunctionem, sed propter spiritualem institutum est,
dicente Christo, Mea verba spiritus sunt and vita. Ioh. 6. [See above, Chap. 7.
Sect. 2. at the letter f.] Suarez. Damascen. lib. 4 cap. 14. Hoc Sacramento --
nos Christi concorporei existimus -- and animo and voluntate copulamur. Cyril.
Hierosol. Catechis. 4. Mystag. Sumpto corpore and sanguine Christi efficimur
comparticipes corporis and sanguinis, (...), -- cum ejus sanguinem and corpus
in nostra membra receperimus, arque ita (ut B. Pe^ius dicit) Divinae naturae
consortes efficimur. [Hinc Suarez:] Vbi propter Sacramentalem susceptionem, non
agnoscit aliam unionem praeter spiritualem per gratiam, etc. In 3. Tho. qu. 79.
Disp. 64. quo supra.
I say (says he) (namely, as out of the Fathers) that Christ's Body is so
united with our Bodies, that they are both jointly mingled in parts, one with
another. Which is an Opinion Improbable, and unworthy of the Majesty and
Dignity of the Sacrament, which was instituted by Christ, not for a Corporal,
but for a Spiritual Conjunction: and the other Conjunction is False and
Absurd. So he. Gabriell Vasquez is now to take his turn, first to make his
Preface, and then to deliver his Opinion. Vasquez in 3. Thom. quaest. 79. Art.
2. Disp. 204. cap. 2. Tametsi Antiqui Ecclesiae Patres in exponendis mysterijs
nostrae fidei, insolita, and pa^um in Scholis usitata ratione dicendi interdum
utantur, ita tamen eorum verba and sententias accipere debemus, ut licet primo
aspectu aliquid Absurdi continere videantur, nihil tamen contra ipsos; nisi
maturo consilio and examine, aliorumque patrum, aut conciliorum testimonijs
nixi pronunciemus. Ibid. cap. 3. Aliqui omnia Patrum Testimonia, quae
allegavimus, per figuram Hyperbolen interpretantur; ut ita Patres virtutem
jujus Sacramenti eximie commendare viderentur: non quod revera fieret ita. Ex
Haereticis hoc modo testimonia Hilarij and Cyrilli interpretatus est Calvinus.
-- Neque defuerunt Complutenses aliqui, qui eodem modo per Hyperbolen illa
explicarent -- Ibid. cap. 4. Quidam putarunt, si sine Hyperbole explicarentur,
sequi, ut caro Christi per omnem partem corporis nostri dissunderetur, ut cera
cerae lique facta -- at non sic dissunditur -- Cyrillus usus est hac
similitudine ad ostendendam veram and realem mixtionem corporis nostri cum
corpore Christi, non tamen quoad dissusionem eam similitudimen locum habere
putabat -- Nec enim est Physics unio carnis nostrae cum carne Christi, sicut ex
duabus ceris, neque fieri unam carn^m per conversionem unius in alteram, sicut
fit in nutritione animalis naturali, neque id ullus sanae mentis, ullo modo
assereret.
Although the Ancient Fathers, in expounding these So he. And for Instances
he brings diverse, and more particularly that Similitude of Conjunction,
already objected out of Cyr^l; As wax with wax melted are joined together.
And this (if it be taken in the Rigidity of the words) he denies to note
either Diffusion of Christ's Body into the parts of man's Body, or else a
Substantial Conversion into them.

All these acknowledgements being so plain and ingenuous, and delivered with
so full an Assurance and Resolution of your own Doctors, of most exquisite
judgment above Others in your Church, do minister unto us matter of
Astonishment, to wonder with what Consciences they could urge us with these
Literal habit and propriety of Speech; seeing that now, after some
Deliberation, they find the same to be so glowing hot, that they themselves,
not daring to touch them with their bare fingers, take hold of them with a
Distinction, as it were with a pair of Tongs, saying, that Suarez. in 3. Thom.
qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. Existimo omnino certum, praeter contactum
corporis nostri and Christi, medijs speciebus Sacramentalibus, non intervenire
materialem aliquam unionem physicam and veram.
Because there is no Natural Conjunction between Christ's Body and ours,
excepting only a Touch of the one by the other, under forms of Bread: The
Union, spoken of by the Fathers, is not Physical, or Natural, but Spiritual.
So Suarez. Not Physical, or Natural, but Metaphorical. So Vasquez. But yet
Mystical it is, this will be handled in the next Section.

Can there then be any thing more Odious or Unjust, than for your Disputers to
proclaim their Adversaries Heretics, for expounding the aforesaid Sentences of
the Fathers, in an unproper Sense; which liberty, They themselves both now have
practiced, and also instructed Others to do the like by their own words and
examples? wherein as they are generally found Contradictory to themselves, so
are they more particularly one to another. For Doctor Heskins objecting the
Sayings of Chrysostom and Cyril, concerning the Conjunction of Christ's Body
with ours, to be like as when Wax is melted with wax in one Union, He
himself waxed wroth with Protestants so far, as to judge them Men given over
to the Devil, because they did not believe them according to the outward
letter. Notwithstanding your own Vasquez (as you have heard) taught that the
same words cannot be admitted in the strictness of the Terms; as also your
Suarez and Tolet in saying, that to Interpret them Literally, were to detract
from the Wisdom of those Fathers, and from the Dignity and Majesty of the
Sacrament itself. Lastly, albeit your Vide Bellar. quo supra de Euchar. lib.
2. cap. 13. supra citat.
Bellarmine presses Cyril, wherein the Christian Communicants are called
(...), that is, Cariers of Christ; yet your Suarez expounding this, and that
other of Damascen, calling them (...), that is, Joint Bodies with Christ, and
so partakers of the Divine Nature; allows no more in the Continuance of this
Carrying of Christ's Body, and Union therewith, but only a Spiritual, that is,
of Grace and Affection.

That the Former Objected Testimonies of the Fathers, make flatly against the
Romish Faith of a proper Corporal Conjunction and Mixture of Christ's Body with
the Bodies of the Communicants, in two more especial Points. SECT. IV.
Mutual Contactus or Touch of his Body with theirs, as your Jesuits every
where teach. Our Observables hereupon, at this present, are especially two. One
in respect of the Time of Continuance of the same Union: The other in respect
of the Persons united together. Of the former, you profess by your Vasquez. in
3. Tho. qu 7^. Art. 2. cap 4 Disp. 204 Christus tamdiu est in nobis, quamdiu
speci^s in nobis incorruptae perseverant, atque extra eas non est, antequam
corrumpantur.
Jesuit, that Christ is but only so long in the Bodies of the Receivers, as
the forms of Bread and Wine do continue incorrupt. And, concerning Bodily
Union (as your Suarez. in 3. Tho qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. Quoad hoc,
unio haec co^munis est peccatoribus indigne manducan^ibus Corpus Christi.
Suarez relates) that It is common to the wicked, and to the faithful
Communicants of the Body of Christ. So you. And now (O you great pretenders of
Antiquity!) behold a Torrent of Ancient Fathers against you, both in respect of
Continuance of Time, and of the Difference of Persons: to wit, Irenaeus,
Origin, Chrysostom, Hierome, Ambrose, Augustine, Hilarie, Cyril of Alexandria
(under the Confession of your forenamed Jesuits, to whom we may adjoyne both
Basil, and Theodoret) acknowledging, that whereas the Union which you believe
to have with Christ's Body in this Sacrament, only by Bodily Touch, is
Transient, during Suarez. quo supra. Sancti (Patres) non loquuntur de unione
Transeunte, ut sic dicam, cum speciebus Sacrame^talibus, sed permanente and
Durabili.
no longer, than the forms of Bread and Wine, eaten and transmitted into the
stomach of the Eater, are incorrupt, (this Conjunction being indeed
momentary,) They, I say, do contrarily teach a Conjunction absolutely
Permanent, even to Immortality it self.

And again, your Romish Conjunction being Common to the wickedest of men, and
this Conjunction, spoken of by the Fathers, being Vasquez. in 3. Tho qu. 79.
Art. 2. Disp. 204. cap 3. Vnio quam Patres constituunt inter nostram carnem and
carnem Christi, tamdiu manet, quamdiu a Charitate Christi non separamur.
Proper only to the Godly and Faithful, who are joined together in Faith with
Christ, and in Charity with all Christians (which therefore you your selves
call a Suarez quo supra. Non est haec unio corporalis aut Physica, sed
spiritualis and Mystica. Et Vasquez. quo supra. Neque aliam quam moralem and
mysticam, Paties, inter carnem nostram and carnem Christi, intelligi voluerunt.
Moral and Mystical Union:) It follows in both these Respects, that you may
easily deserne in your Romish Faith notable degeneration from the Judgment of
Antiquity. The seeming Contradictions of the former Speeches of the Fathers
will be reconciled in the next Chapter, and the Third Section.

CHAP. IX.
Of the Second kind of Objections out of the Fathers, from their Similitudes,
especially insisted upon by Romish Sophisters, because of their calling Christ
both Feast and Guest, and the Eucharist Viands and Pledge; Confuted by the like
language of the same Fathers, in respect of
LEt us look down to the Idiome and language of the Fathers, and compare
their Sayings together, and we shall find these Testimonies no less
vehemently, than violently and unconscionably objected. Hier Epist. 15. ad
Hebdidiam, objected by Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 23. and Doctor Heskins cap.
53. and others. Dominus Jesus, ipse est conviva, and convivium: ipse comedens
and qui comeditur: -- illius bibimus sanguinem, and sine illo potare non
possimus -- and quotidie in Sacrificijs ejus ex genimine verae vitis, and
vineae Sore^, quae interpretatur electa, rubentia musta calcamus, and novum ex
ijs bibimus vinum -- in ecclesia, quod regnum patris est.
Hierome is alleged, as calling Christ both Feast and Guest, (namely) by giving
this Sacrament to be Eaten of others, and Eating it himself: Corporal
Presence in the Eucharist) Interpret to be Properly understood. But we say not
Properly, but Figuratively and Improperly, even as well as are his words
following, where he names our Drinking Christ's Blood, the Pressing out, with
the feet, the elect and chosen Vines: as also, in calling the Church of Christ,
the Kingdom of the Father. Might not these his latter Improper Phrases of
Speech have been clear Spectales unto you, to Diserne the like Impropriety in
the former? The same Answer may be given to the like objected speech of
Chrysostom, And Chrysostom also by Doctor Heskins (See in the Section
following.)
Eating himself, which is, together with the former, to be Discussed in the
next Section following.

In the Second place, the Eucharist is called in the Greek In Liturgijs, ut
patet ex Casaubon. Exerc. 16. cap. 52. (...). And
Liturgies, and in the Council of Conc. Nicen. can 13. Si quis egreditur de
corpore, ultimo and necessario viatico non privetur, etc.
Nice, the Viaticum, that is Viand, or Provision for our Travel in our way to
Life everlasting. A word objected by your Aquinas part. 3. quaest. 73. Art. 4.
Hoc Sacramentum est praefigurativum fruitionis Dei, quae erit in patria, ideo
dictum via^icum quia hic praebet nobis viam illu^ perveniendi.
Aquinas and others, which notwithstanding can prove no more for your
(properly) Corporal Receiving the Eucharist, than it can for receiving the
same Corporally in Baptism, which is called Basil. Exhort. ad Baptismum, De
Baptism sic monet Iuvenem; (...).
Basil and Nazian. Orat. 40. de Baptismo, vult morientem (...).
Gregory Naxianzene our Viaticum. (See the Gahrie^. Albispin. Episc. lib.
Observat. 11. Qui hoc viaticum in omnibus Canonibus Eucharistiam
interpretantur, non mious labantur -- cum tot sint genera viatici, quot sunt
modi and viae ad Ecclesiae communionem obtinendam -- Consideres nihil aliud
dici viaticum, nisi quod in morte sumitur, and in alteram vitam proficiscenti
prodesse potest. At Baptismus and Absolutio, quando morientibus impartiuntur,
quid ni viatica censeri possint?
Margin.)

The Third is the Title of Pledge, which your Bellar. lib. 2. (...) cap. 17. ex
Optato. Optatus vocet Eucharist^^. (...) fidei, et spem Resurrectionis*
Cardinal has urged out of Optatus, naming the Eucharist, the Pledge of
Salvation, help of Faith, and hope of our Resurrection. Which are (say we)
delivered in the same Te^or, and sense of speech, wherein Basil exhort. ad
Baptis. Baptismus namque ad resurrectionem facultas quaedam et a^^abo, etc.
Basil, and Theodoret. in Divinorum Decretorum Epitome de Baptismo. Baptismus
est pignus et A^^a futuroru^ bonorum, et futurae Resurrectionis.
Theodoret termed Baptism, the Pledge and Earnest of Blessings to come, and of
our future Resurrection. The Common Id^ome of Antiquity being so frequent and
familiar, equally for Baptism, as for the Eucharist; who can but admire the
Boldness

That the former Objected Sentences of Antiquity, concerning Feast and Guest,
etc. Viand and Pledge, do, in themselves, altogether Confute your Romish
Pretense, to the further manifestation of the Inconsionableness
CHrist, by Saint Hierome (as you have heard) is said, in receiving this
Sacrament at his first Institution thereof, to have been both Convivium, and
Convivam, that is, both Feast and Guest, Eating his own Body. And your Doctor
Heskins Instan^eth in the like speech of Chrysostom, saying: that Dr. Heskins
in his Parliament of Christ. Book. 2. cap 55. objected out of Chrysostom in
Matthew 26. Hom. 83. Ipse quoque orbit ex eo, ne (...) ^^^bis illis dicerent;
Quid (...) sangui^^m bibimus et carnem (...) ac ideo per^urbarentur -- Ne
igitur tunc quoque id accideret, primus ipse (...) fecit, ut Tranqu^lo animo ad
communicationem mysteriorum induceret.
Christ himself drank thereof in the behalf of his Disciples, lest they
should be troubled with his words of [Eating his Flesh, and Drinking his Blood]
therefore did he himself first receive, that he might induce them to take it
with a Quiet Mind. So Chrysostom; whom your Doctor allegeth for proof of a
Corporal Presence of Christ; and then applying himself to his Reader, Now you
have heard (says he) the mind of Chrysostom upon the words of Christ, and by
the same also, you may know, both how He, and how also the Apostles (who first
received the Cup at Christ's hand) did believe. So he. And we shall as
willingly subscribe to the Orthodoxe meaning of Hierome and Chrysostom (for
they Both agree in one.)

Thus then, Christ must have been a Guest and Feast himself unto himself, in
Eating his own Body, either Naturally, or Spiritually, or Romishly, or else
Sacramentally. But not Naturally, to have his Body fed by the same his own
Body; for this Conceit, in your See above.
own Judgment, is Absurd. Nor Spiritually; Because he needs not any
Spiritual help of any Sacrament, for nourishing or augmenting any Grace in
his Soul. Nor yet Romishly, by a Bodily Touch (which is your Professed
Corporal Union;) Because it was never heard, that any man was fed and feasted
by an only Touch. A Bullet, (for example) transmitted into the Belly, does
Touch, not feed: Nutrition and Feeding being, Properly, a Substantial Change
of a thing Nourishable, into the Substance of the Body Nourished. And again,
what can be more gross, than to imagine (albeit but in a Dream) of a man
Eating Eating his own Body.

Therefore must we apprehend such Speeches of the Fathers in a fourth sense,
to wit, Sacramentally, by attributing the name of the Thing unto the Sign, as
we teach; which sense the Objected Testimony of Chrysostom does confirm unto
us: who says not, that Christ Drank or Ate himself; but that he drank of
the Passover, lest they that heard him should say, What shall we drink his
Blood? which is as much as if Chrysostom had directly said, that Christ
therefore drank of the Cup, that they, seeing him drink, might thereby
understand, that He did no more drink his own Blood, than He, in Eating,
did appear to Eat his own Flesh. He therefore Drank (says Chrysostom)
lest they should be troubled to think; what? what, but that he Drank his
own Blood? which sense of Chrysostomes the sentence it self does evince: lest
that (says he) they should say within themselves, Shall we drink his Blood?
Such Interrogative speeches (as your own School teaches you) have Vim
Negationis, that is, imply a Negation, and import as much, as to think that
Christ did not Drink his own Blood. Will you have any more? Chrysostom
explayning the words of Christ, Ioh. 6. of Eating his Flesh, and Drinking his
Blood, gives all Christians a Caveat, not to understand them Carnally;
Chrysostom. in Ioh. 6. Hom. 46. Quid est carnaliter intelligere? simpliciter ut
res dicuntur, neque aliud quippiam excogitate.
And what is it (says he) to understand them Carnally? even to understand
them simply, as they are spoken, and not conceive any thing else.

The Atribute of Viaticum is next, which having so great feeding, may afford us
the same Reason of Retorting the same Argument (borrowed from the same word)
upon your Objectors themselves, which we permit to your own wits to examine,
that with more Brevity we may descend to the last Adjunct, which is, a Pledge
of our Resurrection to Immortality, which has been applied by your Cardinal
as peculiar to the Eucharist, to prove a Corporal presence of Christ therein;
It being a Term taken from the mouth of the Father Optatus, whom we have
answered out of two Fathers, Basil and Theodoret, who have as well given the
same word [Pledge of our Resurrection to Immortality] unto the Sacrament of
Baptism. From whom it may be your Costerus. See above, Book 4. ca. 10.. 5.
Jesuit Coster borrowed his Assertion, where he also names Baptism, the
Pledge of our Resurrection to life everlasting; which one word [Pledge,] now
Objected by you, will prove as good as Bellerophon's Letters to confute your
selves, and to vanquish your Romish Defense, even from the nature of a Pledge,
as it is applied to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, by three Fathers.

I. Hierome, Hieron. See above, Book 3. Ca. 3.. 11.
Christ (says he) left this his last memorial of his Passion, like as one
that is travailing into a strange Country, leaves a Pledge with his friend for
a memorandum of his benefits. II. Gaudentius thus: Gaudent. See above, Book 3.
Chapter 3. Sect. 1^. at (^).
Christ (says he) being about to be Crucified, left that Hereditary gift of
the new Testament, as a Pledge of his Presence. And III. Primasius, concerning
the Institution of this Sacrament says, that Primas. in 1. Cor. 11. Salvator
Deus exemplum dedit, ut quotiescunque hoc facimus in mente habeamus, quod
Christus pro nobis mortuus est, ideo nobis dicitur Corpus Christi, ut cum hoc
recordati fuerimus, non simus ingrati gratiae ejus. Quemadmodum si quis moriens
relinquat ei, quem diligit, aliquod pignus, quod ille post mortem ejus
quandocunque viderit, nunquid potest lachrymas continere si perfect dilexerit?
Christ left us an example, that as often as we celebrate this, we should
call to remembrance that Christ dyed for us. And therefore is it called the Body
of Christ, (says he) that, as often as we remember, we be not ingrate and
unthankful to his gratiousnesse; like as when one, Dying, leaves a Pledge of
remembrance unto his friend.

All these holy Fathers (you see) interpret this Sacrament to be unto us as a
Present Pledge of a Friend Absent, whether he be a living Travailer, or one
departed this life. Primasius his Observation of the [Pledge] is very
remarkable, when Pledge) that It is Therefore called the Body of Christ, giving
the name of the Thing to the Token thereof; than which Similtude what can be
more pregnant and pertinent for the Confuting of your Tridentine Faith,
concerning the Corporal Presence of Christ in the Eucharist? Seeing now that
the Ancient Fathers have shown themselves Patrons and Favorers of our Cause,
it will become us, as true Children, to do them right. To which purpose we
add, and show


FOr our making good of this Section, it will be required that we perform it
so, that the Doctrine of the Fathers (notwithstanding this Reconciliation) may
appear to be both Adverse to the Romish Corporal Conjunction; and also
agreeable to our Protestant sense, as well in respect of the Sacramental, as
of the Spiritual Conjunction, which the Receiver of this Sacrament has with
the Body of Christ.

The Repugnancie of the Fathers to the Romish Corporal Conjunction.
Sometimes the Fathers are found, in this Sacrament, to Exactly and precisely,
and sometime (...), and (...), Improperly. When they speak of a Corporal
Conjunction with Christ's Body, Exactly and simply so taken, so often they
appear to deny it absolutely from point to point. As I. by their Ambros. Sermon.
58. in illud Christi ad Magdalen. [Noli me tangere.] -- Ergo eum non super
terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem, debemus quaerere Salvatorem.
No Bodily Touc^ of Christ after his Resurrection. So Ambrose. II. Aug. Non
dentis cibus. Idem. Sermon. 33. de verbis Dom. Nolite parare fances, sed cor.

(...); that is, Having no fleshly thing, nor yet that has any Natural
Consequence thereof, namely of fleshly Union. In which you have all as ^^at
Negatives to your Romish Corporal Union, by your Bodily Touch, whether by
Hand, Mouth, or Belly, as the Ancient Fathers could Union, by Touching, Eating,
Tearing, and of your Corporal Conjunction, even unto the Feeding thereby* This
is the next Doubt, which we are now to assoyle, in the next Section.

The meaning of the words of the Ancient Fathers is fully Consonant to the
Doctrine of Protestants.
THe Sacramental Union, which Protestants teach, (besides that which they call
Spiritual) consists wholly in the Resemblance, which is between the Body of
Christ, and the Substance of Bread and Wine, and this is Analogicall: which was
the Ground of all the Fathers former Speeches, concerning a Bodily Union with
Christ's Body in every Degree. First then the Fathers, in their Symbolicall
language, have called Bread the Body of Christ, only Sacramentally; because it
is a Sacrament and Sign of Christ's Body; which was the Conclusion of our
Second Book. II. They have not spared to call the Change of Bread into our
Bodies, a Change of Christ's Body into ours, in a like Sacramental
signification, as has been showed in the Third Book. III. Upon the we See,
Touch, Taste, and Eat Christ's Body, albeit Improperly, as has been plentifully
declared, and confessed in this Fifth Book. IV. (Because Eating produces a
Nourishing and Augmentation of the Body of the Eater, by the thing Eaten,) they
have attributed like Phrases of our Bodily Nourishment and Augmentation by
Christ's Body; which you your selves have confessed to be most Improperly
spoken; in the same Book. V. Almost all the former Unions Corporal of our
Bodies with Christ, have been ascribed by the Baptism; wherein there cannot
Properly be any Corporal Touch, or Conjunction at all.

As for example, in saying; I. That We, in Baptism, hold the feet of Christ.
II. Are Sprinkled with his Blood. III. Do Eat his flesh, have Union with him in
Nature and not only on Affection. IV. Being made Bone of his Bone, and Flesh
of his Flesh. V. Thereby have a Pledge of our Resurrection to Life: And a
Pledge (as you have now heard) is of that, which is Absent. Each one of these,
and many other the Symbol and Sacrament of Christ's Body, their Symbolicall and
Sacramental, that is, Figurative Meanings. And lest you may Doubt of the
reason hereof,

The Divine Contemplations, which the Holy Fathers had, in uttering their
Phrases of our Natural and Corporal Conjunction with Christ's Body, and
Nourishment thereby to Immortality; for the Elevating of our minds to a
Spiritual apprehension of his Body and
YOur Jesuits, Bellarmine, Tolet, Suarez, and Vasquez, have already instructed
you, not to take such Sayings of the Fathers as they are uttered, lest the
Fathers might be held to be Absurd in themselves, or Derogatory to the Dignity
and Majesty of this Sacrament. And they say well. But it had been better if
they had furthermore unfolded unto us the Fathers true Mystical meaning
therein; which we Christ has a Natural Union by his Godhead with God the
Father. II. That this Godhead of Christ, by his Incarnation, is united
Hypostatically into our Nature of Manhood in him; whereby we have with Christ
our Natural and Corporal Conjunction. III. That by the same Hypostaticall
Union of his Divine and Humane Nature together, his Bodily Flesh is become the
Flesh of God, his Blood the Blood of God. IV. That these being the Flesh and
Blood of God, are become thereby to be Vivificall, that is, giving Life,
Bliss, and Immortality, both to the Bodies and Souls of the Faithful in
Christ. V. That the Faithful, by Reason of the Specificall Union of their
Humane nature, with the Humane Nature of Christ, are made partakers the reby of
his Divine Nature, and of all the Infinite Vivification and power of grace, in
this world; and of Glory and Immortality, in the world to come, wrought by his
Death and Passion. VI. Both by Baptism, and by the Eucharist, we have a
Natural and Corporal Union with the Body of Christ, mystically; in as much as
the Sacrament of Bread and Wine (the Choycest Refections of man's Touched,
Tasted, Eaten, and Sensually mixed with our Flesh to the nourishing and
augmenting the same, until it become of the Essence of our Bodily Substance
unseparably. Therefore has this Sacrament most aptly been called a Pledge of
an unspeakable Union of Christ's Body with ours unto Immortality, and an Earnest
of our Resurrection.

Lastly, from this Sacrament there resulteth a Spiritual Union, continuing in
the Faithful after the Receiving of this Sacrament, even all their life long;
and notwithstanding called by the same Fathers Corporal and Natural, that is,
(as they interpret themselves) from the Nature of Faith, by believing that
Christ had truly a Natural and Bodily flesh, the same Specifically with ours:
Which Union, your Jesuits have been enforced to acknowledge, to be in it
self not Properly a Corporal and Natural Union, but Spiritual and
Mystical, wrought only in the Soul. But how? This indeed is worthy our
knowledge, as a matter full of Christian Comfort. Thus then: The Disposition of
the Body, in Christian Philosophy, follows the Disposition of the Soul: For
when the Souls of the Faithful, departing this life in the state of Grace,
and the Souls likewise of the Ungodly passing but from hence into the
thraldom of Sin, shall resume their own Bodies; by virtue of that Resumption,
shall be made possessors of Life and Bliss both in Body and Soul; and the
Wicked (contrarily) of Curse and Come you Blessed, unto the one, etc. and Go
you Cursed, to the other, etc.

Nor will your learned Suarez deny this. Suarez in 3. Tho. qu 79. Disp 64.. 2.
Gloria corporis respondet gloriae animae, sicut beatitudo animae respondet
gratiae and charitati: ut sicut hoc Sacramentum, neque habet, neque habere
potest aliam efficaciam circa gloriam animae, praeter eam quam habet circa
gratiam and charitatem, itaque neque aliter p^^est efficere gloriam corporis,
quam gloriam animae (Co^dudit;) Hoc Sacramentum non aliam confer vitam and
immortalitatem corporis, quam nutriendo and conservando charitatem and gratiam.
The Glory of the Body (says he) depends upon the Glory of the Soul, and
the Happiness of the Soul depends upon Grace therein; neither does the
Sacrament any otherwise confer Immortality to the Body, but by nourishing and
preserving grace in the Soul. Which is Divinely spoken. And yet we have a
more Ancient than your Jesuit, even Cyprian, one of the Ancientest of the
Primitive Fathers, whose words may serve us for a Comment upon the former
objected Sayings of other Fathers. He, in his Discourse of the Supper of the
Lord, the Blessed Sacrament of our Union, which the Faithful Communicants have
in receiving it; Cyprian de C^na Dom. Potus and Esus ad eandem pertinent
rationem, quibus sicut corporea nutritur substantia, and vivit, and ^^colum
(...) perse^erat; ita vita spiritus hoc prop^io alimento nutritur: and quod est
es^a (...), hoc animae est fides; quod cibus corpori^ est verbum spiritui,
excellentiori virtute peragens aeternaliter, quod agant alimenta carnalia
temporaliter.
As by meat and drink (says he) the Substance of our Bodies is nourished and
lives, in health; so the life of the Spirit is nourished with this Aliment.
For what Meat is to the Flesh, that is Faith to the Soul: and what Food is to
the Body, that the Word is to the Spirit working by a more excellent power for
Eternity, than So he.

Nothing now remains but the last exercise of Faith, which is by Application
in Special, taught by our Savior, in saying to his Disciples, [Take ye, Eat,
this is my Body, given for you, and This is my Blood of the New Testament shed
for you.] Hereby (although it be spoken, as has been proved, Sacramentally
and Figuratively) to instruct every of his Disciples in taking thereof, to
apply those words [Body given for you, etc.] as verily spoken to himself, as
if he had said, Take thou John, and Take thou Peter, My Body given for thee
John, and for thee Peter, etc. in a Sacramental Analogy. So then as my Bodily
hand takes the Sacramental Bread, the Sign of Christ's Body; and my Bodily
mouth eats, and my Bodily stomach digesteth, and turns it, as nourishment,
into my flesh; so my Soul says that I believe that the Body of my Savior was
Crucified, and his Blood shed for me, whole man, Body and Soul: And that
Pledge, by the converting of Bread into the Substance of mine own Flesh:
According to the Consonant Doctrine of Antiquity, set down in the last Chapter
of this Fifth Book. *

CHAP. X.
Of the Romish Historical Objections Chiefly insisted upon, out of Iustine,
concerning the Slander raised against Christians of Eating man's flesh, sprung
(as is pretended) from the Catholic Doctrine of Eating Christ's Body in the
Eucharist; which is their First Argument.
MAny leaves are spent by M. Mr. Brerely in his Liturgy Tra. 2.. 2. Subd 4. p.
121. Where in his Margin he cites Vadian, whom he names a Zuinglian: [And
if so, how far^e he was from confessing a Corporal Presence, the Romish
Authors, who condemn him for the contrary opinion, do prove.] See above,
Chap. 5. Sect. 3.
Brerely in pressing this Objection; the strength of his Inforcement stands
thus: Iustine Martyr, in the year 130. writing an Apology to the Heathen
Emperor, when he was in discourse of the Eucharist (The reported Doctrine
whereof, concerning the Real and when he should have removed the suspicion
thereof, did notwithstanding call the Eucharist, No common Bread, but, after
Consecration, the food wherewith our Flesh and Blood is fed, etc. Then he
proceeds in urging his other Argument (as follows) borrowed from the
Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4.
Cardinal, to wit, Iustine his comparing the Change in the Eucharist to be a
work of Omnipotency, and for his not expounding the words of Christ
Figuratively. Then is brought in In the Margin of Master Berely. Ibid.
Attalas the Martyr, whilst he was under the Tortures, and Torments of his
Persecutors, saying, Behold your Doing, [Hoc est homines devorare] This is a
Devouring of men: we Christians do not Devour men. To whom is joined
Tertullian, making mention of the same Clamor of Sacrifising a Child, and
Eating his flesh, [Ad nostrae Doctrinae notam:] To the infamy of our
Profession. At length Master Brerely concludes as follows; So evidently

So he. * And so, long before him, Doctor Heskins; He^kins in his Parliament,

Body in the Eucharist.


What? That the Catholic Doctrine of Ancient Eating of Christ's Body in this
Sacrament, should have been the Cause; yea, or yet the Occasion to the Heathen
and Jews, of imputing to the Christians a Capernaiticall Eating of Man's
flesh? This is the first Argument, which your Objectors, from Historical
Relations, use for proof of a Corporal Presence of Christ in the Eucharist,
out of this Ancient Father Iustine Martyr; In Confutation whereof we produce

the Cataphryges and Gnostics, who did indeed and Really eat Humane flesh. So
they.

But most especially is this Romish Figment confuted by the Story it self,
which by the Relation of the foresaid The Eating of a Child or Infant; which
makes the falsehood of your Objections to seem, in a manner palpable unto us;
because Christ being crucified by both Jews and Gentiles, when he was above
thirty years of Age, and the whole Church of Christ professing as much, it was
not possible that the Eating of an Infant only, should produce an opinion of
Eating a Man of growth; much less could it be credible, that they imputed the
Eating thereof in the Eucharist, if (as your French Gabriel Episcop. Albispin.

Bishop Eating the flesh of a Child, was not practiced in the Feast of the
Lord's Supper, but at their Love Feasts, called Agapae. So he. And
consequently so sandy and boggie is this foundation of your maine Objection,
for proof of the Corporal Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

The Second Romish Argument out of Justine, termed Insoluble before all others,
is, because when he called the Eating of the Eucharist, the Eating of the Body
IVstine writes an Apology unto Antoninus Pius, an Heathen Emperor, at what
time the Slander of Eating Humane flesh fell upon the Orthodoxe Christians,
Originally from the impious Practice of Heretical Christians, as you have
heard; and now are you to hear the Insoluble Argument forsooth, which your
Cardinal Bellarmine extracteth from thence. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4.
Insolubi^e manet hoc Dilemma; Aut poterat Justinius vere dicere, carnem Christi
a Christianis solum in signo manducari; aut non poterat; si poterat,
P^aevaricator fuit causae Christianae: Nam odiosissimam reddidit fidem, and
auxit criminum supicionem, cum posset unto verbo, and fidem probabilem facere,
and crimen diluere: Si non poterat, certe id eo non poterat, quia vere, and non
in signo tantum datur nobis comedenda Christi caro.
This Dilemma (says he) remains Insoluble. Either could Iustine truly have
said, that the flesh of Christ is Eaten of Christians only in a Sign: or he
could not have so said. If he could, then did he play the Praevaricator in
betraying the Christian cause, by making the Christian Profession So he,
Ostentatively of his own Argument, insigned by himself Insoluble, as you see;
Notwithstanding this may admit diverse and sundry Solutions.


IVstine Justin. Apolog. 2. Refert praescriptum Antonini Imperatoris, ad
populos A siae. Sententiam little (Christianorum) ve^uti impiorum and nullorum
Deorum sugillatis et alia quaedam obi^citis crimina, quae non potestis probate.
showed to the same Emperor, that no Impiety at all (upon any Inquisition
formerly made) could be laid to the charge of Orthodoxe Christians, in this
Case, by good proofs. First Iustine propounds the Letters of the Emperor
Adrian, Father to Antoninus, who, upon experience of the extreme malice of his
Heathen people against Christians, required, that his Officers should not
prosecute against any Christian without proof of some Impiety. As also the
Epistle of Marcus, Emperor before his Father, who became both a Patron to
justify the Case of Christians, Crimes objected against them; and a Protector
of their Persons; commanding that whosoever should accuse a Christian (...).
Only for being a Christian (that is for his Profession sake only) should be
burnt Quick. And should not the Sacrifising of Infants (if any such had been
practiced by the Christians) have been held Capital Crimes with those
Emperors, trow ye? Besides this Iustine allegeth unto this Emperor Antoninus
himself, his own Epistle, whereby he testified in the Behalf of Christians,
(...).
that None of those Crimes and Impieties, whereof they were accused, could be
proved against them; which proves, that notwithstanding all the Inquisition
that Malice it self could make into the Mysteries of Christians, concerning
the Eucharist, either in Word, or in Act, was not held offensive unto those
Emperors, upon any Information, made by their Adversaries, against them.

The Second Solution, to prove their Dilemma
Our next Reason of the Insufficiency meets with the Cardinals Reason,
enforced by the First Horn of his Dilemma, thus: See above, Sect. 3.
If Iustine (says he) could have said that Christ's flesh is eaten in the
Eucharist, only in a Sign; then did he praevaricate in the Case of
Christians, and make their faith most odious, in increasing the Suspicion of
the Crime objected against them. We Answer, that although he might have said,
that Christ's flesh is eaten Bodily, only in a Sign, yet was not this
necessary for the freeing of the Christian Faith from that Suspicion of Eating
a Child. One Reason may be, Because nothing was more familiar, even unto the
Heathen themselves, than to use the like language, in calling their
Sacramental and Mystical, Signs, by the names of the Things signified
thereby, whereof you have heard a Memorable example out of See above, Book 2.
Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
Homer; where, even as Christ said of Consecrated Bread, [This is my Body;] So
those Lambs, for Ratification of their Oaths and Covenants, called those
Sacrifices their Oaths. And that nothing was more familiar among the Heathen,
you may know by that Proverbiall speech; Sine Cerere and Libero friget Venus:
without Ceres and Bacchus Lust does languish: where they give to Bread the name
of the Goddess Ceres, and the name of God Bacchus to Wine.

Secondly, and more especially may this appear out of Iustine, immediately
after the place now objected, thus: Justin. Loco supracitat [Hoc est sanguis
meus] (...).
Christ (says Iustine) receiving Bread, says [This is my (namely) for that
Bread and a Pot of Water is put in the Sacrifices of him that is initiated unto
their Communion, in the Sacrifices, by Addition of certain words, as you
either know, or might have known. So Iustine, To the Heathen Emperor. Do you
not see how the Devils in their Sacrifices and Mysteries (as Tertul. de Cor^na
(...)) Agnoseamus ingenia (...) ideuco quaedam de divims assectantis, ut nos de
suoru^ fide confundat, et ^ud^cet. Idem. de Praes^ription. Ipsus res
Sacramentorum. devinorum in Idol ^rum myster^^s aemulatur. Ti^git and ipse
quosdam, -- celebrat et panis oblationem; et imaginem Resurrectionis inducit.
Tertullian witnesses) affect Divine Rites; And by Imitation play Christ's
Apes, as other Fathers use to speak; And that not only in their Material
Ceremonies, such as are Bread and Cup, but also in their Verbal, by Addition
of words, as Iustine shows. Where you may perceive how Iustine argued with
those Heathen out of their own Mysteries, and (that we may so call them)
Sacraments: even as Saint Paul did with the Athenians out of the Inscription of
their own Altar.

It happened not above a quarter of a year, after that had set down this
Observation, that in reading a Book of that never too worthily Commended
Mirror of Learning, Master Isaac Casaubone, I found this my Opinion fortifyed,
and as it were animated with his most acurate Judgment, showing out of his
most exquisite Reading; that Isaac Casaub in (...) exercitat. 16. Justinius in
Apologia altera narrat, malos Daemonas in Mith^ae mysterijs S. Eachar^^liae
aemulationem quandam tradidisse. (...). Ecce panem et poculum; sed aquae, ut
dixi, non vin^ (...) verba solemnia super Symbolis proferri solita: id enim
significat isto in loco vox (...). q^d. super dicta: qua voce utuntur Iuris.
consulti. Etiam Arrianus, loco paulo ante indicato, sacras mysteriorum voces
commemorat, quas magna cum reverentia excipi solitas ostendit: (...), (...),
(...) (...) cum Eucharistia et sit et d^catur Communio, sicut ante est
expositum: in^^dem Mithr^^ mysterijs Communio quae est omnibus animantibus
inter se, miro Symbolorum genere expri^^ba^ur.
The Devils did, in aemulation of Christians, use in their Mysteries of Mythra,
Symbols of Bread and Cup, adding solemn Mystical words. He furthermore
shows out of Porphyrie, that Aenigmaticall expressions; Calling their
Communicants, if Men, Lions; if Women, Hyenas; and if Ministers, Crows. Still
(as you see) using Mystical and Figurative Appellations in their Ceremonial
Rites. Upon which evidence we may easily encounter your Cardinals Dilemma
with this that follows. Either the Emperor and the Heathen people did
perceive that the words of Christ, now published by Iustine, were spoken
Figuratively, signifying the Outward Eating of his Body, Bodily, in a Sign
only; or they did not. If they Figuratively and Mystically to be understood,
then would not those Emperors have absolved Christians from all blame (as you
see they did) but punished them for Sacrificing of Infants; which Act, among
these Heathen, was held to be Criminal and Capital. And that Iustine did not
Praevaricate by concealing his Figurative sense of Christ's words, it is as
manifest by that he Instructed them therein out of their own Phrases, Mithra.

The Impossibility that any Heathen could be offended at the former words of
Justine. SECT. VI.
NO Heathen, that heard of the Catholic Faith of Christians, concerning the
Body of Christ, in those Primitive times, published by Ancient Fathers, and by
Iustine himself, could, except it were against their Consciences, Corporal
Eating of the Body of Christ. For, first, the Articles of Christian Faith (for
which so many Armies of Martyrs conquered the Infidelity of the world, by
Martyrdom) being this; that Christ, the Savior of the world, God and Man,
ascended into Heaven, and there now reigns in the Kingdom of everlasting
Blessedness, adored of all Christians with Divine worship. Another Article,
Universally held of those Catholic Fathers (as has been See Book 4. c. 5.. 5.
proved) that the Body of Christ was ever, notwithstanding his Resurrection and
Ascension, Circumscribed in one place. And thirdly, All knowing that this
Principle Impossible for one Body to be in many places at once. Therefore was
it Impossible for the Heathen to conceive that the Christians taught a
Corporal Eating of that Body on Earth, which they believed was Circumscribed,
and contained in Heaven. Fourthly, That this was the Faith, which the same
Ancient Father Iustine did profess and publish at that time, is now to be
tried out of the Books of Iustine himself.

That Iustine himself did accordingly argue against the Possibility of Christ's
Bodily Presence on Earth; And that Attalas (objected) condemns the Romish
Capernaiticall Swallowing of Christ's Body. SECT. VII.
IVstine, in the same Apology, now objected, and by him directed Emperor
Antoninus surnamed the Godly, before his words of Eating Christ's flesh, sets
down the Christian Article of his Ascension into Heaven, saying Justin. in
Apologia secund page 64. Deus, Christum post Resurrectionem illaturus coelo
(...), etc. adversantes Daemones percutiat, et bonorum numerum expleatur,
propter quos nondum extremum Decretum et consummationem fecit.
that God the Father assumed Christ, after his death, into Heaven, there (...),
that is, To detain him, until he vanquished the Devils, and filled up the
number of the Godly. An Argument (as Athanasius, and Augustine observes) which
was used by Christ himself, as that which ought to have persuaded the very
Capernaites, that Christ was not to be Bodily Eaten upon Earth (as has been
See above, B. 5. cap. 3. Sect. 2.
proved.) The same Iustine in his Resolution of Questions, made by Orthodoxe
Christians, showed that Christ denied to have a Continual Conversation with
men, after his Resurrection, which he had before his Passion: Namely that
Justin. Quaest. and Resp. ad Orthodox^^. page 327. (...). adding that after his
Resur^ection (...).
He would by little and little disuse and unaccustome them with his sight and
(...), that is, Presence. Do you hear his withdrawing his Presence? That is,
will you say, his Visible Presence. Nay, but whatsomever Local Presence, which
he had among them formerly; whether (says Iustine) of Being Seen, or of Not
being Seen among them. This is plain.

Of Averroes his Imputing to Christians the Devouring of their God.
We are not ignorant what some of you would Reply, by Instancing in Averroes
his upbrayding of Christians with Devouring of their God, which we may justly
conceive he spoke in the spirit of Malignancie, and against his own
knowledge, as the Premises have proved, and against the express Profession of
Ancient Fathers, detesting the same Conceit of Devouring Christ's flesh (as you
have Justification only by Faith, do inveigh against Protestants, as
professing a Justifying Faith without Good works and Repentance. And
notwithstanding the same Objectors themselves, expressing the very words of
Protestants, confess that their Justifying Faith, which they teach, is a
Living Faith always joined with Contrition of heart for sin, and purpose of
Amendment of Life, and that this Justification by Faith can be no more
separated from Sanctification of Life, than can the Light in the Fire from the
Heart thereof.

How be it the Observation of some other is very probable; to wit, that
Averrages understanding of the Decree of Pope Nicolas (above Pope Nicolas the
Second, living Ann. 1059. Averroes (ut a^t Possevinus Biblioth lib 13. c. 23.)
fuit a Nativitate Christi, anno 1150.
discussed) in his Roman Synod, and imposed upon the Faith of all Christians
within his Romish Jurisdiction, teaching them to believe, that The Body of
Christ is sensually Eaten and Torn with the Teeth of all the Communicants of
this Sacrament: Which tenor of Speech has been abandoned by your own
Doctors; some censuring it as harsh and false, and some as Heretical. It can
be no marvel (say we) that Averro^s hearing of this, Then professed by
Papal Christians, did deride and detest all such Eaters of their God, and that
most Justly. Because that Devouring (as has been confessed by your Jesuit)
is nothing else but a Transmitting without mastication, or Tearing, into the
stomach* else could not Scriputre have said, that Jonas was devoured of the
Whale. Which your Corporal Swallowing of Christ's Body, if it had been held
Christian in the Days of Antiquity, then could not Attalas (as has been
objected) have upbraided the Heathenish Persecutors at the time of his
Martyrdom, saying, See above Sect. 1.
This (your persecuting of Christians to death) is a Devouring of men, We
Christians do not Devour men. Such is the Unluckiness of your Objectors to
urge most vehemently and eagerly, still, that which makes most against them.
And indeed the Romish must needs be said to Devour that which they profess to
Eat, Swallow, Bellies, and after into the Draught.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Fifth, Last, and Basest Romish manner of Union with Christ's Body, in the
Inferior
HItherto have your Romish Disputers labored to bring the Body of Christ into
your Bellies and Entrails: Now, as if they thought this not a sufficient
Vilfication of the Blessed Body of Christ, they proceed to depresse it lower,
into the Basest place of Baseness, which is the Draught and Seege it self: so
vile, that the very Ink may seem to blush, in setting down the Sordidity
Reverence; under our Readers patience therefore we proceed, as follows.

Showing the Romish Doctrine of an Union of Christ's Body with the Basest parts
of Man's Body, to be more Beastly than the Carnal and Capernaiticall conceit
of Eating Christ's Body is read of ever to have descended unto. SECT I.
CApernaites, when they were offended at Christ's words, concerning the
receiving of Christ's flesh, are not read to have proceeded further in the
grosenesse of their Imagination, than to a Proper Eating thereof. Our Savior
showing the Ordinary Course of meat, in the superfluity thereof, above that
which is turned into nourishment, and changed in the Substantial parts of man's
Body, says that Coming into the Belly, it descends into the Draught. A
Saying which holds true, as well in meat Sacramental, as Natural; as Manna,
for example (called Angels food) and the Paschall Lamb, neither of both were
privileged from the ordinary course of Nature. And as for the material part of
this Sacrament, Origin says as much of it, that Origin. See B. 4. cap. 9. 3.
and B. 3. cap. 3. ^1. and B. 5. cap. 6.. 3.
Going into the Belly, it passes into the Draught. But what now is your Romish
Doctrine? The general learning of your Schools is, that The Body of Christ is
under the forms of Bread wheresoever, so long as they remain incorrupt. Which
is so verily your Roman Faith, that one of your Cardinals in his Catechism,
tells his Catechumenist, that Contarenus Cardinal. Catechests Christiana.

No man, that has his wits, can doubt thereof.

This Ground being thus laid, we propound unto you the Consequences hereof, as
we find them divulged in print by your own Authors, and in their privileged
Books, Antoninus was (as Anton Possetia. Apparat. Tit. Antoninus -- Antoninus

Nicolas. He shall be our Relater of the Doctrine of Paludanus, whom your
Jesuit Possevin. Apparat. Tit. Petrus de Palude. -- Inter Theologos celebris,
and postea Patriarcha Constantinopolitanus.
commends for a Famous Divine, and sometime a Patriarch. This Petrus
Paludanus, from your former General Principle, argued, saying that Antonini
Summae, part tertia, Tit. 13. cap. 6.. 3. de Defectibus Missae Petrus de
Palude. Non potest evomi nisi quod in stomachum est trajectum. Et quod dicit
(...) illa Glossa, quod in secessum non emittitur, sed per sudorem aliter

species, sicut emitteretur substantia panis and vin, and non aliter. Illa autem
quanquam non corrupta emituntur, ut in habentibus fluxum*ergo and species,
propter quod non est danda Eucharistia habenti talem fluxum, quia se emittit

irreverentiam Sacramenti, quam illud. Igitur, Corpus and Sanguis Christi,
tamdiu manet in ventre, and stomacho vel vomitu, and quocunque alibi, quamdiu
species manet, sicut substantia conversa mansistet, and si species incorruptae
evomuntur vel egrediuntur, ut ibi vere Corpus Christ.
The forms of Bread and Wine do as verily go into the Stomach, and so after
into the Draught, as could the Substance of either of them, if they were there,
and yet sometimes pass out uncorrupted, in Bodies infirm, and especially
those that labor of the Flux: Because some so diseased persons do let pass
from them that which they eat, as incorrupt as they received it, whether it be
by Vomit, or by Egestion into the Seege. So he.

Which again is a Doctrine so verily Romish, that your own Casust, in his
Book enstiled Moral Resolutions, propounds two Cases; and afterward
manerly (saving your presence) resolves them thus: Johannes Baptista de
Bertis. Qu. 5. Art. 6. Dub. 5. Quid agendum sit, si post sumptionem sanguinis
patiatur Sacerdos vomitum, vel ex infirmitate emittit per secessum, quod
sumpsit. Et idem Iohann. Baptista. Qu. 5. Artic. 3. Dub. 5. Quid agendum, si

comburantur, and cineres in Sacrario recondantur; and idem dicendum est, si ex
infirmitate statim emittat per secessum.
that If any, after So he. Might this be Possible! We return to your Relater
Antoninus, out of Plaudanus, giving you an example of a Devout man much
commended by one Antoni^^ quo supra. Et siquidem homo esset tanti fervoris quod

quod debet comburi animal. Dictum vero Petri, cum factum est ita recens, quod
adhuc creditur species Sacramenti permanere in stomacho, and tunc debet
exenterari.
Hugo For Licking up the Host vomited; So they. How like you this? For mislike
it you may not, it being the natural Brat and Offspring of your General
Romish faith, (as has been said) that the Body and Blood of Christ is under
the Consecrated forms of Bread and of Wine wheresoever, so long as the same
forms remain uncorrupted. This Theme will not permit much Discussion, for, as
the Saying is, Omne Coenum ma^e olet, commove, and senties odorem. We hasten
to the next Section.

That the very Imagination of this Former Romish Beastly Doctrine would have
been held of the Ancient Fathers most Abominable. SECT. II.
THe Holy Fathers (if they had been of your Romish Corporal Presence of
Christ's Body in this Sacrament) must have held also your Romish Conclusion, of
a Possibility of Egestion; the Conceit whereof they did greatly abhor. For
Cyril. Hierosol. See above, Book 4. cap ^^.. ^.
Cyril of Jerusalem, to the end that he might abstract men's minds from all
such monstrously-prophane and Base thoughts and conceptions, concerning the
Body of Christ, denied peremptorily, that Christ's Body can pass into the
Seege. Which also seemed to be so unsavorie and loathsome to Chrysostom. Ibid.
Chrysostom, that he spit at the first thought thereof, with an Absit! as
much as to say [Fy upon it!] in execration thereof. Some Creatures are said,
for keeping Hunters from pursuing them, to cast Dung and Filth backward in
their faces: and so it falls out (in a manner) here, where the Turpitude and
Beastliness of your Doctrine forbids us to enlarge our Confutation,

That the Institution of this Sacrament was ordained to be Food only for the
Soul, and not for the Body, according to the Judgment of Antiquity. SECT.

this Life, but in the Everlasting Life of Glorification, in the Day of
Resurrection, after it be reunited to the Soul, according to that Promise of
Christ, Ioh. 6. excepting only the Analogicall and Sacramental Bread; so is
the Soul nourished Spiritually with Christ's Body and Blood. Otherwise the
Ancient Fathers maintained a sole Soule-feeding on Christ's Body; in which
respect (as one of your Casaub. Ex. er^it. 16. cap. 39. Vocant Graeci Patres

We add the particular accordant Testimonies of diverse Fathers, of whom if
you ask, What the Meat is, which you must believe to Eat in Not of the Body,
but of the Soul. If Who must be the Eater? Not the outward, but the Inward
man. If What it is that hungreth for this? The Inward Soul. If What must taste
it? The Soul. If with What mouth? That, whereof Tertullian said (speaking of
Christ's Flesh) It is to be devoured with the Ear, ruminated with the Mind,
and disgested with Faith. If How? Let Saint Augustine make up the whole
harmony; Eat his Flesh* See above chapter 6.. 4.
This (says he) is a Figurative Speech, commanding us to communicate of his
Passion; and sweetly and profitably close up in our memories, that his Flesh
was wounded and crucified for us. So the Fathers. Besides many other like
Sayings, by us already related in the former Sections, wherein has been
opposed out of the Fathers, against your Corporal Touch, saying of Christ,
Touch me not: against your Orall Eating thus, Not meat of the Tooth; but of
the Mind: against your Swallowing thus, We Devour not Christ's Flesh: against
your Corporal mixture therewith thus, We mingle not the Persons and
Substances: And against your Corporal Transmitting the same Body down by
Egestion thus, It descends not into the Draught.

We therefore (according to the genuine sense of Primitive Fathers, answerable
to the Doctrine of Christ) conclude; that such as is our Feeding of Christ's
Body in this Sacrament, such also must be our Eating, because Eating is
ordained for Feeding. But by the universal Consent of all Christian
Professors, of all ages, whether Primitive, or Successive, Greek or Roman,
Protestants or Papists; our Spiritual Feeding of Christ Body, in this
Sacrament, is devoyd Corporal Instrument, or effect. Therefore our Spiritual
Eating is no way Corporal. *

CHALLENGE.
THrice therefore, yea four times unconscionable are your Disputers, in
Objecting the former Sentences of holy Fathers, as teaching a Corporal and
Natural Union of Christ's Body with the Bodies of the Communicants; once,
because they, in true sense, make not at all for your Romish Tenet: next,
because they make against it: then, because the Corporal Conjunction, though
it be of the Body of Christ, and Bodies of Christians, in respect of the
Object, yet for the Matter and Subject, it is of Sacramental Bread united with
our own Bodies, in a Mystical Relation to the Body of our Redeemer; and
lastly, and that principally, because they meant a Spiritual Conjunction
properly, and perpetually belonging to the Sanctified Communicants, and herein
consonant to the profession Corporal Conjunction of Christ his Body in Boxes
and Dunghills, in Mawes of Beasts, in Guts of Mice, Worms and Dogs, and at
length into the Seege, as you have taught. Fie, Fie^ Tell it not in Gath, nor
let it be once heard of in any Heathenish Nation, to the Blaspheming of the
Christian profession, and Dishonouring of the Broad Seal of the Gospel of
Christ, which is the Blessed Sacrament of his precious Body and Blood.

* Thus much of the Romish Consequence, from their Proper and Literal sense of
Christ's words [This is my Body] so far as concerns Corporal Union. The
next Consequence will be touching the Proper Sacrificing thereof; whereunto we
proceed, nothing doubting but that we shall find your Romish Disputers the
same men, which

be Anatherna, or Accisrsed. Which one Canon has begot two Controversies (as

know.) One, Whether the Sacrifice in the Mass be a proper Sacrifice. 2.
Whether it be truly Propitiatory Your Trent-Synode has affirmed both;
Protestants deny both; so that, Proper, and Improper, are the distinct Borders
of both Controversies. And now whether the Affirmers or Deniers, that is, the
Cursers, or the parties so Cursed deserve rather the Curse of God, we are
forthwith to examine. We begin with the Sacrifice, as it is called Proper.

This Examination has four Trials: 1. By the Scripture. 2. By the Judgment
of Ancient Fathers. 3. By Romish Principles; and 4. By Comparison between this
your Mass, and the Protestants Sacrifice, in the Celebration of the holy
Eucharist.


CHAP. I.
Our Examination by Scripture.
SCriptures alleged by our Disputers, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice, are
partly out of the new Testament, and partly out of the old. In the new, some
Objections are collected out of the Gospel of Christ, and some out of other
places. We beginning Proper Sacrifice, it must necessarily appear either from
some special word, or else from some Sacrificing Act of Christ, at his first
Institution.

First of Christ's words. That there is no one word, in Christ his first
Institution, which can probably infer a Proper Sacrifice; not the first and
principal words of Luc. 22. [Hoc
WHen we call upon you for a Proof, by the words of Christ, we exact not the
very word Offering, or Sacrifice, in the same Syllables, but shall be content
with any Phrase of equivalencie, amounting to the sense or meaning of a
Sacrifice. In the first place you object those words of Christ, [Hoc facite:
Do this.] from which your Council of [Hoc facite] Tunc, uta Sancto Synodo
definitum est, Christus Sacerdotes instituit, praecepirgue ut and ipsi and qui
(...) eis essent, corpus ejus immolarent. Catechis. Trid. de Euch. Number. 58.
Trent has collected the Sacrificing of the Body of Christ: which your
Cardinal avoucheth Cerium est, probari Sacrificium Missae his verbis, [Hoc
facite] etc. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12.
Certum est, as a truth without all exception; as if [Doe this] in the literal
sense, were all one with [Doe you Sacrifice,] But why? because, forsooth, the
same word in the Hebrew Original, and in the Greek Translation is elsewhere
so used, Levit. 15. for Do, nor Make, spoken of the Turtle-dove prepared for
an Holocaust, or Sacrifice: and 1 King. 18. 23. where Elias (speaking of the
Priests of Baal, and telling them that he meant to have a Sacrifice,) said,
Do, or Make. So he, together with some other Jesuits. But vainly,
ridiculously, and injuriously.

I. Vainly, because the word, Do, in those Scriptures did not Sacrifice, but
only consequently (to wit) by reason of the matter subject then spoken of,
which was a matter of Sacrifice: and are so explained by just circumstances, as
may appear in the places objected, Lev. 15. where was speech of a Turtle-dove,
appointed for a Sacrifice. And so likewise in 1 King. 18. 23. was there mention
of a Bullock to be ordained for a Sacrifice. Whosoever, having spoken of his
Riding, shall command one servant, saying, Make ready: and after, being an
hungry, and having spoken of meat, shall command another, saying likewise, Make
ready, None can be so simple as to confound the different senses of the same
word Make, but knows right well that the Significations are to be
distinguished by the different subjects of speech; the first relating to his
horse, and the other to his meat, and the like, wherein the different
Circumstances do diversifie the sense of the same word.

II. Ridiculously. For if the Hebrew and Greek Gnaschah, Heb. the same in
Greek, (...), in Latin, Facio Iud. 6 29. Ios. 5. verse. ull. Job. 13. 7.
(...), and Marc. 11. 3. Si quis dixerit, (...)
Editions, which signify Do this, do necessarily argue a sacrificing act or
Sacrifice, then shall you be compelled to admit of strange and odd kinds of
Sacrifices; one in Gideon his destroying of the Altar of Baal: another in Moses
his Putting off his shoes. A third in Christ's washing his Disciples feet. A
fourth (to go no further) in the Man's Loosing of his Colt. In all which
Instances there are the same original words now objected, by interpretation,
Do, or Make. Even as it was also in Christ's words to Judas, then, when that
Monster was plotting that heinous Treason, saying. [(...)] That which thou
do, do quickly. Can your Alchymists possibly extract a dram of Sacrifice,
as offered by Judas, either Do, or Do, in that place?

III. Injuriously. First, to the Text of Christ, wherein the word is not
indefinite, Do, but determinate, [Doe this.] Next, Injurious to your own many
Authors: for the words, [Doe this] (by the Sea above Book. ^. Chap. 2.. 1.
confessions of your own Jesuits and others) have reference to all the former
Acts of Christ his Celebration, then specified; as namely, Blessing, Breaking,
Eating, etc. Yea, and if your Cardinals Answer were held so Certain among your
selves, then would not your Jesuit Maldonate have so far slighted it, as to
say, Maldon. Non quod contendam illud verbum [Facite] illo loco significare
idem quod sacrificare. Lib. 7 de Sacra. Tom. 1. part. 3. de Eucharist.
I will not contend, that in this place the word [Doe] signifies the same
with, Do sacrifice. * If you think this be not opposite enough, then behold
your Jesuit Estius flatly contending against it. Estius Ies Com in 1 Cor. 11
verse. 24. Non quod verbu^ [Facere] sit idem quod [Sacrificare] quomodo nonnulli
interpretati sunt, praeter mentem Scripturae.
The word [Facere] says he, is not the same with [Sacrificare,] as some do
expound it, besides the meaning of Scripture *. Next, Injurious to antiquity,
which (as is confessed) Quod olim dicimus, Missas facere, Veteres quoque
dixerunt Divina mysteria celebrare. Hilar. etc. Ex Cassand. Liturg cap. 16.
called Doing Mass the Celebration of the Sacrament. Besides, Injurious to
your own Mass, in the Canon inserted by Alexander Papa and Martyr, Passionem
Domini inserens Canoni Missae, ait, [Hoc quoticscunque feceritis,] Id est,
Benedixeritis, Fregeritis, Distribueritis, etc. Id. Cassander ibid. cap. 29.
Alexander Pope and Martyr, of the Primitive age, in these words; [Doe this as
often] that is, Blesseit, Breakeit, Distributeit, etc. A plain and direct
Interpretation of the words [Doe this.] Lastly, Injurious S. Paul, who, in his
Comment upon the words of Christ his Institution, does put the matter out of
question, 1 Cor. 11. where, after the words [Doe this, as often as you do it,
in remembrance of me,] verse. 25. immediately expounding what was meant by
Doing, expresses the Acts of Doing, thus; As often as ye shall eat this Bread,
and drink this Cup, etc. Which his Command of Doing, by Eating and Drinking,
was spoken generally to all the faithful in Corinth; that you may not imagine
it was wholly restrained to the sacrificing Priests.

Other Romish Doctors also, if they had been so sure of the force of the word
[FACITE,] as your Cardinal seems to be, then surely would they not have
sought to prove it from Virgils Calfe, where it is said; Cum faciam Vitula --
and were therefore noted by Calvin and Chemnitius of bold Ignorance. But these
two Protestants, for so saying, have been since branded by your Operae-pretium
erit imposturam Adversariorum refutate. Calvinus fingit Catholicos ita probare
Propositionem nostri argumenti ex Virgilii verbis, Cum faciam vitula, etc. Et
Kemnitius ridet Catholicos. -- sed errant, nee bonafide referunt argumenta
Catholicorum. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 12.
Cardinal with a mark of Imposture, as if they had falsely taxed your Romish
Authors of such fondness. But now what shall we say to such a Gnostick, who,
as though he had known what all the Doctors in the Church of Rome had then
written and vented, Iansenius will quit the report of Calvin and Chemnitius
from the suspicion of Falsehood, who witnesses, concerning some Romish Authors
of his time, saying; Sunt qui ex verbo [Facite] Sacrificium ostendere conantur,
quia aliquando accipitur pro Sacrificare, ut cum Vitgilius dicit -- Cum faciam
Vitula profrugibus, ipse venito. Iansen Concor. in cum locum cap. 131. p. 904.
There are some who endeavor to prove the word [Facere] to be put for
[Sacrificare] by that saying of Virgil, -- Cum faciam vitula. So he. And why
might not they have been as absurd, as some others that came after, yea (by
your leave) Et Poeta, Cum faciam vitula, etc. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de Sacrif.
Missa, c. 4.. Fatentur. p. 519. Eam vim habet verbum Faciendi, ut cum Poeta
dicit, Cum faciam Vitula, etc. Salmer. Ies. Tim. 9. Tract. 27. page 205..
Septi^^.
Jesuits themselves, of your Bellarmines own Society, who in like manner have
consulted with the Poet Virgil about his Calfe; but Walton's Calfe, which went
etc. For the matter Subject of the Poets Sacrifice is there expressed to have
been Vitula, a Calfe. You have failed in your first Objection.

That a Proper Sacrifice cannot be collected out of any of these words of
Christ's Institution; Is GIVEN, Is BROKEN, Is SHED. SECT. II.
THe Text is Luc. 22. 20. [Which Is broken, Is given, Is shed] in the Present
Tense; and This Is the Cup of the new Testament in my Blood; wherein, according
to the Greek, there is a varying of the Case: whereupon your Disputers, as if
they had cried (...), are commonly more Instant in this Objection than in any
other: some of them spending eight full leaves in pressing this Text, by two
Arguments, one in respect of the Case, and another in regard of the Time.

Of the Grammar point, concerning the Case.
This is the new Testament in my Blood:^ Now what of this? Bellarm. de Missa,
lib. 3. cap. 12. In Graeco Textu (...), dicit, Calix qui funditur, non hic est
sanguis qui funditur: itaque indicant sanguinem fundi, ut erat in Calice.
It is not said (says your Cardinal) This is the Blood shed for you, but,
This is the Cup shed for you: Therefore is hereby meant. The Blood, which was
in the Chalice, because wine could not be said to be shed for us for remission
of sins. But how gather you this? Because in the (...).
Greek (says M. M. Breerly Liturg. tract. ^. c. 3. subd. 2.
Brerely) (...), This Cup shed for you, varieth the Case from the word
[Sanguine] and the Genus from the word [Testamentum,] and agrees evidently
with Calix: so that the Cup being said to be shed, proves the Blood spoken of
to be shed verily in the Cup: which drives Beza unto a strange Answer, saying
that this is a Soloe cophanes, or Incongruity of speech. So he; which Objection
he learned peradventure of the Rhemists Annot. upon Luc. 22. 20.
Rhemists, who are vehement in pressing the same: their Conclusion is, This
proves the Sacrifice of Christ's blood in the Chalice; as also your Jesuit
Gordonus Scotus Ies. l. 1. Controvers. 3. c. 12. nu. 6. [(...)] est nominativi
casus necessario referendu^ ad (...), non dativi (...), ut pertineatad (...).
Gordon has done. In which one Collection they labor upon many ignorances. 1.
As if a Soloecophanes were a profanation of Scripture, by Incongruity of
speech; which (as one Rodolph. Goclenius Professor Marpurg Problem. Gram. lib
^. Demosthenes (...) -- Pro (...). Cic. 2. de Orat. Been dicere antem, quod est
perite loqui, non habet definitam aliquam regidnem, cujus terminis septa
teneatur. Vo^ [Septa] non congruit cum ^^ Been dicete, sed referenda est ad
voccm Eloquentiae Ne observes the like in Plato, Virgil, Homer, page 232, 233,
261, 262.
Protestant has proved) is used as an Elegancie of speech by the two Princes
of Orators, Demosthenes for the Greek, and Tully for the Latin; and by the
two Parents of Poets, among the Greeks Homer, and by Virgil among the Latins.

2. As though these our Adversaries were fit men to upbraid Beza with one
Soloecophanes, which is but a Seeming Incongruity, like a Seeming Limping, who
themselves confess Sixtus Senensis Biblioth. lib. 8. page ult. Nos ingenue
fatemur nonnullas mendas in hac nostra editlona inveniri, etiam Soloecismos,
and Barbarismos, hyperbata, etc.
Ingenuously, that in their Vulgar Latin Translation (which is decreed by the
Council of Trent to be Authentical) there are mere Solecismes, and
Barbarismes, and other faults, which we may call, in point of Grammar, down
right halting. 3. As if a Truth might not be delivered in a Barbarous speech,
or that this could be denied by them, who defend Solecismes, and Barbarismes,
which had crept into the Translation of Scriptures, saying that Rhemists
Preface before the New Testament.
Ancient Fathers and Doctors have had such a religious care of former
Translations, that they would not change their Barbarisines of the Vulgar
Latin Text, [as unbent, and unbentur] and the like. 4. As if there were not
the Soloecophanes of Relatives not agreeing with their Antecedents in case,
whereof you have received from D. Fulke against Greg. Martin.
D. Fulke diverse Apoc. l. 4 and 8. 9. and 3. 12, etc.
Examples. 5. As if this Soloecophanes now objected were not justifiable, which
is defended by the Mirror of Grammarians Joseph. Sciligeri Nota in novum
Testamentum. Luc. 22. 20. (...): Mera est Antiptosis, pro (...). Beza recte
exponit, and ait duplicem esse Metonymiam.
Joseph Scaliger, by a figure Antiptosis; and Beza (says he) does truly
expound it. Besides it is explained anciently by (...). Basil. Reg. Moral. 21.
Basil a perfect Greek Father: referring the Participle [Shed] unto the word
Blood, and not unto the Chalice; which marteth your Market quite. And that this
is an undeniable Truth, will appear in our Answer to the next Objection of
Time: for if by Given, Broken, Shed, is meant the time future, then these words
Shed for you, for remission of sins, flatly conclude that hereby is not meant
any proper Sacrifice of Christ's Blood in the Cup, but on the Cross.

* Lastly, if we shall answer, that the Cup, indeed, is taken for the Liquor
in the Cup, which is called Christ's Blood, per Metonymiain, that is,
Figuratively, the signo for the name of the thing Signified (whereof you have
heard plentiful examples thorowout the second Book) you shall never be able to
make any Reply. One word more. Seeing that it is the universal Confession of
all your Doctors, yea, even of the Objectors themselves, that See Book 2.
Chap. 2. Sect. 4. and in this Sect. in their own words.
Christ's blood is not perfectly shed in the Eucharist, how then can it stand
with common modesty, to pretenda Proper Sacrifice in the word [Shed? *] Let us
proceed therefore to that point, that you may know that Beza needed not a
Soloecophanes, to assoile this doubt.

Of the Time signified by the Participles Given, Broken, Shed.
These words being of the Present time, Therefore it plainly follows that
Breaking, Giving Christ's Body, and shedding his Blood, is in the Supper, and
not on the Cross: So your Bellarm. lib. 1. de ^^iss. cap. 12. Datur,
Frangitur, Funditur, in Praesenti tempore, docet apertissime non fusum esse in
Cruce sanguinem, sed in Coena.
Cardinal: most invincibly say your Rhemists upon Luc. 22. 20.
Rhemists, and Mr Breerly, as dancing merrily after their Pipes; M. Breerly,
Liturg. Tract. 3.. 3. subd. 1. p. 319.
This point (says he) is clearly determined by the Evangelists themselves, in
their own original writings, Broken, Given, Shed. And Ibid. subd. 3. p. 319.
The Evasions, which our Adversaries seek, whereby to avoid this, are
enforced, racked and miserable shifts. And again, for corroboration-sake.
Ibid. subd. 1. p. 317.
The word Broken also, spoken in regard of the outward forms, which are in
time of Sacrificing, is more forcible, Ioh. 19. 33. * And will you see your
Jesuit Gordon, frisking and keeping the same measure; urging the present-Tense
of the word, Broken, Given, Shed; calling this the Chief reason, and most
evident for proof of a Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ's Body in the Mass?
and censuring Protestants for saying that in the same words the Present Tense
is put for the Future; and that Broken does signify the Renting of Christ's
flesh with whips and nails: which he terms a seeking of refuge in Tropes as
that which cannot be proved by any Scripture. So he, with these others, most
ostentatively, as you have heard *. Alas! what huge Anakims and Giants have we
to deal withal! no Argument can proceed from them but most Evident, Forcible,
and Invincible; yet may we not despair of due Resistance, especially, being
supported by your own Brethren, as well the sons of Anak, as were the other:
besides, some better aid, both from Fathers and Scriptures, for proof that
these words Broken, Given, Shed, spoken in the Present time do signify the
Future time of Christ's body being and Bloodshed; and both Given up as a
Sacrifice instantly after upon the Cross.

Maldonate, [Shed] (says he) may be properly rendered, Shall be Shed *; or will
you be directed by most voices, whereby it is confessed (namely) that Iansenius
referring it to the Cup, yet says: [Qui effunditur] communiter intelligitur de
effusione facta in Cruce, and rect^. Concord 131*
By Bloodshed is commonly understood of it shed upon the Cross. But what need
have we of the several members, when as the whole Body of your Romish Church
is for us, rendering the word, Shed, in the Future Tense [Fundetur] shall be
shed, as referred to the Cross? What think you by this? say M. Breerly.
Liturg. Tract. ^.. 3. subd. 1.
Our Adversaries are in great straits, when they are glad to appeal from the
Original Greek Text which they call Authentical, unto the Latin Vulgar
Translation, which they call old, rotten, and full of corruptions. Vulgar
Latin Edition, as a purer Translation, and not as a true Interpretation of the
words of the Text; to teach you that it is meant of the Future Time: and that
this were urged by them, as a ground of persuasion to themselves, and not
rather (as it were by the Law of Arms) an Opposition, and indeed conviction
upon their Adversaries, who by the Decree of your Council of Trent, are bound
See hereafter Book. ^.
Not to reject it upon any pretense whatsoever. And to have this your own
Authentical Translation to make against you, is to be in straits indeed,
Council, by the Bull of Pope Pius 4. are put upon you to be believed under the
bond of an Oath.

Is it possible for you to shake off these shackles? Yes, M. Breerly can, by an
admirable trick of wi: Li^urg. in the place above cited.
Nevertheless (says he) I answer in behalf of the Vulgar Interpreter, that
as he translateth in the Future Tense, [which shall be shed] so does he use
the Present Tense in the other words, Given, and Broken, to signify that it
was then given in the Sacrament, and afterward to be given upon the Cross,
both together. As if you should tell us in plain English that your Church in
her Vulgar Latin Text does equivocate, teaching It shall be shed, in the
Future, does signify also the Present Tense, Is shed, that is, It is, shall
be, both together. A fit man (forsooth) to inveigh against a Soloecophanes. *
Your Jesuit Vasquez doubtless would have laughed at the ridiculousnesse of
this man's defense of the Vulgar Translation, Vasquez Ies in 3. Thom. Quest. 78.
Disp. 199. Cap. 1. Art. 3. In Vulgata noster Interpres semper utitur verbo

[Quod pro Vobis ^^^detur.] Nempe quod putaret Praesens pro Futuro sumi. Sa Ies.
Annot. in Mat. ^6. [Effundetur in (...).]
who contrariwise, that he might prove the Vulgar, in using the Present Tense
in [Datur, Is given] to understand thereby the Future Tense, [Dabitur, shall be
given] does observe with us, that the same Vulgar Translation uses the Future
Tense not only concerning the Blood, in [Fundetur,] but also concerning the
Body, [Tradetur. *] But how then can Protestants interpret the Present to
signify the Future? We tell you, because you have in Scriptures, and other
Authors, thousands of Examples of the Present tense put for the Future, to
signify the certainty or instancie of that which is spoken: but it was never
heard nor read, that the Future Tense was taken for the Present Tense, because
there is no Course nor Progress to the time past. And if, Shed, be taken not
in true sense, then shall it be lawful for every petty Romish Priest at every
Masse-saying to correct your Romish Missall, authorized by the same Tridentine
Fathers, which has it, Missale Romans Cali^ Sanguinis -- qui effundetur.

opinion of Bellarmine by name. Each one of which our Premises might be
sufficient to free us out, and to ensnare you in the [Great Straits] which your
Brother M. Breerly, pleasantly talks of. *

One word more with M. Breerly, as only desirous to know of him, if he allow of
the Tense either Present or Future, whether it straitness or loosnesse, that
occasioned him to deliver it in the Preterimperfect Tense, Liturg. Tract. 3. c.

Was shed. But he will expect that we answer his reason. He urged the word,
Broken, that because this could not be meant of Broken on the Cross, for that
His Legs were not there broken, (according as it was prophesied) therefore it
must infer it to have been Broken at his Supper, when he uttered the word
Broken. Which is like his other manner of Reasons, blunt, and broken at the
point, as it became one not much conversant in Scripture: else might he have
answered himself by another Prophecy, teaching that the word, Broken, is
taken Metaphorically Esaias, Chap. 53. speaking of the crucifying and Agonies of
Christ, and saying, He was Broken for our iniquities* (namely, as two of your

That the words of Christ, [Given, Broken, Shed,] are taken for the Future

because neither Judas, at that instant, being then present, practiced any

That the Objected words of Christ, and the whole Text, do
AMong the words of Institution, the first which offers it self to our use,
is the formerly-objected word, BROKEN; which word (said your Jesuit See above
Book 2. Chap. 2.
Suarez) is taken unproperly, because in the proper and exact acception it
should signify a dividing of the Body of Christ into parts. So he, and that
truly. Else [Broken] used by Christ in the words, which you term Words of
Consecration? But although you (peradventure) would be silent, yet your Bishop
Ex qua intellige, ea verba [Quod pro vobis frangitur] non esse ad
Consecrationem necessaria: sed consulto a Latinis praetermissa, ne esset locus
absurda^ intelligentiae, qua quis existimare possit vere frangi Corpus Christi.
Ians. Concord. c. 131. in Matthew. 26.
Iansenius will not forbear to tell us, that It was left out, lest that any
man might conceive so fondly, as to think the Body of Christ to be truly
Broken. So he. It is well.

The word, [Shed] is the next, which properly signifies the issuing of blood
out of the veins of Christ; But, That Blood of Christ (says your Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Missa; c. 12.. Ad secundum. Sanguis Christi reipsa non egreditur de
Corpore.

lateat, non tamen species illae totum Christum significant, sed solum sangumem

Christ his Blood was once Shed upon the Cross, never to be Shed again after
his Resurrection, which cannot be perfectly separated from his Body. And
accordingly your Jesuit Coste^. Enchirid c. 9. de Sacrificio.. Ex quibus.
Christus veram sanguinis effusionem passus in cruce, sanguine ipso a Corpore
separato. Hic vero tantum illius mortis repraesentatio.
Coster; The true effusion of his Blood, which is by separating it from the
Body, was only on the Cross. So they.

Hearken now. These words, Blood shed, and Body broken, were spoken then by
Christ, and are now recited by your Priest either in the proper Sense of
Shedding, or they are not. If in a proper Shed unproperly, then are your
Objectors of a proper Sense of Christ his words to be properly called
deceitful Sophisters, as men who speak not from conscience, but for
contention: who being defeated in their first skirmish, about Christ's words, do
fly for refuge to his Acts, and Deeds, whither we further pursue them.

That there was no Sacrificing Act in the whole Institution of Christ, which
the Romish Church can justly pretend for defense of her Proper Sacrifice;
proved by your own Confessions. SECT. V.
THere are six Acts, which your Proctors, who plead for a proper Sacrifice, do
pretend for proof thereof, as being ascribable to the Institution of Christ,
and are as readily and roundly confuted by their own fellows, as they were by
others frequently and diligently sought out, or vehemently objected: which the
Marginals will manifest unto you, in every particular, to be no essential Acts
of a proper Sacrifice. 1. Not Sotus cum alijs hanc Elevationem ut Oblationem

so judge? (say we,) for many things are Sacrata, that is, Consecrated, which
are not Sacrificata, that is, Sacrifised. Else what will you Water in Baptism,
yea of your Holy Water sprinckle? of your Pots, Bells, Vestments? which being
held by you as Sacred, are notwithstanding not so much as Sacramentals.
Besides, if Consecration made the Sacrifice, then Bread and Wine being only
consecrated, they alone should be the Sacrifice in your Mass, against your
former Assertions. 4. Post Consecrationem oblatio vocalis, his verbis, [Memento

Suarez, who is accompanied with his fellow-Iesuite Conincks, and seven other
of your Schoolmen do gainsay; because this is Rather proper to a Sacrament,
than to a Sacrifice. And for that also (if it were essential) the People might
be held Sacrficers as well as Priests.

Vasquez but leave to Fraction, Oblation, or Consumption, or any thing else,
excepting the Sole Act of Consecration: Explications of all Others, he
himself standing wholly for his own opinion of Sole Consecration: who
orders the different sorts of Expositors (whom he calls Modern Divines)
into four Ranks, proving all their Expositions to be Absurd. The first so
Absurd, as to make that the Sacrifice, which is not now Sacrificed, but only
about to be Sacrificed. The second so, as if Wood, changed into a Sheep,
should be therefore held a Sacrifice. The fourth so, as if they would make
Bread, and not Christ, a Sacrifice. The last so, as if the Chalice Sacrifice,
because it is Consecrated. And having thus as it were, cashiered all his
Fellow Soldiers, that stood in his way he places instead of all other the
whole and sole Act in Consecration, by way of Representation. So they of these
Particulars, which are afterward discussed at large. *

CHALLENGE.
COnsider now, we pray you, that (as you All Tota Essentia Sacrificij pendet

confess) The whole Essence of a Sacrifice depends upon the Institution of
Christ. And that Non est in potestate Ecclesiae instituere Sacrificium.
Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 28. page 2^9. Idem alibi, vide sup. at (h)
It is not in the power of the Church to ordain a Sacrifice. Next, that if any
Sacrifice had been institued, it must have appeared either by some Word, or
Act of Christ, neither of which can be found, or yet any shadow thereof. What
then (we pray you) can make more both for the justifying of your own Bishop
of Bitontum, who feared not to publish in your Council of Trent, before all
their Father-hoods, Quidam Bitontinus Episcopus in Conc. Trid. (ut Canus and
alij referunt) tentavit defendere, Christum in nocte Coe^ae non obtulisse
Sacrificium. Suarez quo supra Disp. 74. Sect. 2. page 949.
That Christ in his last Supper did not offer up any proper Sacrifice? As also
for the condemning of your own Romish Church for a Sacrilegious Depravation of
the Sacrament of Christ? Upon this their Exigence whither will they now? To
other Scriptures of the new Testament, and then of the old. Out of the new are
the two that follow.

Cardinals translate, They sacrificing. But why Sacrificing, say we, not some
other ministerial Function, as Preaching (in which respect S. Paul called
himself (...), Romans 15. 16.) or administering the Sacrament, seeing that the
words may bear it? They answer us, because 1. This Ministry is said to be
done To the Lord, so is not Preaching. 2. For that the word [(...)] whenever
it is applied to sacred Ministry and used absolutely, it is always taken for
the Act of Sacrificing. So they. When we Casaubon Ex^ercitat. 16. cap. 41.

Phoenix M. Isaac Casaubon. Look upon the Margin, where you may find the word,
(...), to have been used Ecclesiastically for whatsoever religious
ministration, (even for sole Praying, where there is no note or occasion of
Sacrifice) and he instanceth in the Fathers, mentioning the Morning and Evening
(...) of the Church. But you will not say (we think) that there was any
proper Evening Sacrifice in use in those times.

What can you say for your Cardinal his former lavish assertion, who is thus
largely confuted? Nay, how shall you justify your selves, who are bound by
Oath not to gainsay in your Disputations the Vulgar Latin Translation, which
has rendered the same Greek words [(...)] Ministrantibus eis, that is, They
ministering, and not, They sacrificing? which might be said as well of
preaching, praying, administering the Sacrament; all which (to meet with your
other Objection) being done according to the will of God, and belonging done
unto God. * Even as well as it might be said of him, that eats his common
food with Giving God thanks, that he Eats to the Lord, Romans 14. 6. else was

That the Second objected place out of the new Testament,
1. Cor. 10. 18. BEhold Israel -- are not they who eat of the Sacrifices
partakers of the Altar? then verse. 20. 21. 22. But that which the Gentiles
offer they offer to Devils, and not unto God, and I would not have you
partakers with Devils: ye cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Hence
Bellarmine; Postremum Argumentu^ ex Scri^turis habetur, 1. Cor. 10. Vbi primo

Altar, and proinde Eucharistia Sacrificium. ^. Ita vult Sacrificium Deo
ob^^tum in Eucharistia, sicut sunt Sacrificia a Iudaeis Deo, vel a Gentilibus
Daemonibus suis oblata. 3. Dece^^ita manducantem Eucharistiam participem esse.
Altaris Dominici, ut manducans Idolothyta particeps erat Altaris Idolorum, per
Sacrificia. Ergo Eucharistia est Sacrificium. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa cap. 14.
Here (says he) the Table of the Lord is compared with the Altar of the
Gentiles: Therefore is the Table of the Lord certainly an Altar, and therefore
it has a Sacrifice. 2. Because the Eucharist is so offered, as were the
Sacrifices of the Jews. And 3. Because he that eats the Eucharist is said
so to be partaker of the Lord's Altar, as the Heathen of things sacrificed to
Idols are said to be partakers of the Idols Altar. So he; following only his
own sense, and not regarding the voice or judgment of any other. If we
should say, in Answer to his first Objection, that your Cardinal wanted his
spectacles, in reading of the Text, when he said that the Apostle compares
the Table of the Lord, whereon the Eucharist is placed, with the Altar of the
Gentiles (which was the Altar of Devils) it were a friendly answer in his
behalf; for the words of the Text expressly relate a Comparison of the Table
of the Lord with the Table of Gentiles, and Devils; and not with their Altar.

* Can you then guess what Spirit it was that moved your Cardinal thus to
falsify the sacred Text, to the end that he might conclude the Romish
Sacrifice from the Altar of Devils? Even that wherewith the Fathers of the
Council Conc. Trident. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Quam oblationem non obscure innuit
Apostolus Paulus Corinthiis scribens, cum dicit: non posse eos, qui
participatione mensae Daemoniorum polluti sunt, mensae Domini participes fieri:
per mensam, Altar utrobique intelligens.
of Trent, when they (although to the Confutation of Bellarmines error)
acknowledged the words of the Apostle to be, Table of the Lord, and Table of
Devils, yet do they impose upon you a Belief, that The Apostle does in both,
by Table, understand Altar, thereby turning a Table into an Altar; albeit these
two differed no less than Offering (which Altar) and Eating of things offered,
which was never but upon a Table; and as much as Priest, (who only did minister
at the Altar) differs from Common people, who did jointly communicate of
Idolothytes by eating them upon a Table, as will be more fully manifested, in
Chap. 5. Sect. 15. * And although the Heathen had their Altars, yet (which
crosses all the former Objections) their common Eating of things sacrificed
unto Idols was not upon Altars, but upon Tables, in feasting and partaking of
the Idolothytes, and not in Sacrificing, as did also the Aenaeid. 8. post
Sacrificium Aenaeas invitatus est ad Epulas.
Gentiles, Chap. 5. Sect. 15.
hereafter.

The whole scope of the Apostle is to dehort all Christians from communicating
with the Heathen in their Idol-solemnities whatsoever; and the sum of his
Argument is, that whosoever is Partaker of any Ceremony, made essential to
any worship professed, he makes himself a Partaker of the profession it
self, whether it be Christian, verse. 16. or Jewish, verse. 18. or Heathenish
and Devilish, verse. 20. And again, the Apostle's Argument does as well agree
with a Religious Table, as with an Altar; with a Sacrament, as with a
Sacrifice, Aquinas. Non potestis Calicem Domini bibere and Daemoniorum simul.]
Quoad sacramentum fanguinis, Non potestis mensae Domini participes esse: quoad
Sacramentum corporis, and me^sae Daemoniorum. In 1. Cor. ^0.
Aquinas thought, who paraphraseth thus upon the Text; You cannot be partakers
of the Table of the Lord, in respect of the Sacrament of the Lords Body, and of
the table of Devils. To an Objector, who avoucheth no Father for his Assertion,
it may be sufficient for us to oppose, albeit but any one. Primasius therefore,
expounding this Scripture, makes the Comparison to stand thus: See above Book
5 Chap. 8 Sect. ^. at the letter (^).
As our Savior said; He that eats my flesh abides in me, so the eating of
the Bread of Idols is to be partakers of the Devils. But this participation of
Devils must needs be spiritual, and not

CHAP. III.
That no Scripture in the old Testament has been justly produced, for proof
of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist.
THe Places of Scripture, selected by your Disputers, are partly Typical, and
partly Prophetical.

That the first objected Typical Scripture, concerning Melchisedech, makes
not for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist.
WE are loath to trouble you with Dispute about the end of Melchisedech his
ministering Bread and Wine to Abraham, and his Company; whether it were as a
matter of Sacrifice unto God; or (as * Others have been alleged for this
Exposition, viz. Josephus and Cajetan in Genesis 14. and some Fathers, who in the
very phrase of [(...)] and, obtulit, said that it was offered to Abraham.

which was to Abraham, in the proper acception of Sacrificing, had been
Sacrilegious, as you very well know. *
Diverse have thought) only for refreshing Soldiers of Abraham; because the
Question is brought to be tried by the judgment of such Fathers, who have
called it a Sacrifice. Wherefore we yield unto you the full scope, and suppose
(with your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6.
Cardinal) that the Bread and Wine brought forth had been sacrificed by
Melchisedech to God, and not as a Sacrifice administered by him to his Guests.
Now, because whatsoever shall be objected will concern either the matter of
Sacrifice, or else the Priesthood and office of the Sacrificer, we are
orderly to handle them both.

That the Testimonies of the Fathers, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the
Eucharist, from the Type of Melchisedech's Sacrifice, are Sophistically, and
unconscionably objected out of Psalm. 110. and Heb. 5. SECT. II.

of a Sacrifice, do relate no further than Bread and Wine, The Sacrifice of
Christians: such are the Testimonies of Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom,
Theophylact, Oecumenius, and Cassidore, together with two Jewish Rabbis;
promising that at the coming of Christ all Sacrifices should cease, Except the
Sacrifice of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist. This is your first Collection,
for proof that the Eucharist is a Proper Visible Sacrifice. But first
Unconscionably, knowing and See hereafter Chap. 5. Sect. 1.
confessing it to be no better than a Jewish Conceit, to think the Bread and
Wine to be properly a Sacrifice of the new Testament. Wherefore, to labor to
prove a Proper Sacrifice, in that which you know and acknowledge to be no
Proper Sacrifice, do you not blush? How much better had it becomne you to have
understood the Fathers to have used the word Sacrifice in a large sense, as it
might signify any sacred ministration, as Isidore does instruct you? Who, if
you ask him what it is, which Christians do now offer after the order of
Melchisedech? he will say, that it is Bread and Wine. Isidor. Victimas jam, non

That is (says he) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood. Even as Hierome long
before him; Hiero. Epist. ad Evag. Pane and Vino simplice, puroque Sacrificio
Christo dedicaverit Sacramentum.
Melchisedech in plain Bread and Wine did dedicate the Sacrament of Christ:
distinguishing both the Sacrament from a Proper Sacrifice, and naming the
thing, that is the Body and Blood of Christ, but the Sacrament of both. * And
as well might you have produced Augustine, who is as express as any, teaching
that the Church now, as well as Melchisedech then, Aug. contr. Advers. Leg. and

Your second kind of objected Sentences of Fathers do indeed compare the Bread
and Wine of Melchisedech with the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. In
this Rank we reckon the Cyprian lib. 2. Epist. 3 ad Cecil. Christus idem
obtulit quod Melchisedech Panem and Vinum, se. suum Corpus and Sanguinem.
Eusebius. Caesar. lib. 5. Demonst^. cap 3. Sacerdotes Vino and Pane, and Corporis

Bellarm. lib. 1 de Missa, cap. 6.
Testimonies of Cyprian and Hierome, as also of Eusebius, who does only make
an Analogy between the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, and the Bread and
Wine, which Melchisedech brought forth, and wherein He, as in Types, saw the
Mysteries of Christ's Body and Blood. Eucherius and Primasius both say, that
Christ offered Bread and Wine, that is, his Body and Blood, like as
Melchisedech did, or according to the order of Melchisedech. which Body and
Blood of Christ you will All swear (we dare say) was not the proper Subject
matter Sacrifice of Melchisedech, who performed his Sacrifice many thousands of
years before our Lord Christ was incarnate in the flesh, to take unto him
either Body, or Blood. And therefore could not the Fathers understand, by the
Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood, any thing but the Type of Christ his Body
and Blood; these being then the Object of Melchisedech's faith, as the cited
Sentences of Hierome and Eusebius do declare. Which is a second proof of the
unconscionable dealing of your Disputers, by enforcing Testimonies against
common sense.

Sacrifice out of the Fathers, as properly used, whereas your Allegations tell
us, that they used it in a greater latitude, and at liberty. Secondly, and more
principally, wheresoever you hear the Fathers naming Bread and Wine the Body
and Blood of Christ, o then behold Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ his
Body; and behold it is Corporal presence, and that most evidently! this is your
common shout. And yet behold in your own objected Sentences of Fathers, Bread
and Wine of Melchisedech, was notwithstanding by the forenamed Fathers called
the Body and Blood of Christ. A most evident Argument that the Fathers
understood Christ's words, in calling Bread his Body, figuratively.

* A Vindication of the Truth of my former Allegations, against a Calumnious
Romanist.
MY Lord of Durham (says he) cries out against Bellarmine, that his former
Testimonies are unconsc^onably

Answer.
To have cried out of Inconsionableness against any man, without just Cause,
had been Injurious; To have skipped over any Testimony, which might be thought
not sufficiently answered in the Confutation of the other Testimonies cited,
had been Diffidence; To have quoted them, and not to the purpose, had been
mere Childishness. But so to have quoted them, that they should contradict my
purpose, had

The first point of my Vindication must be, to set down the other Testimonies,
which (he says) have been skipped over. This is now Bellar. lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 6. Theod. in Psalm. 109. Invenimus Melchisedech offerentem Deo
Sacrificia non ratione carentia, sed Panem and Vinum. Arnobius in Psalm. 109.

performed in the Margin.

The next Exception is, that they make nothing to my purpose, my purpose being
to show that the Testimonies objected speak not of Christ's. Body and Blood,
but only of the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine. These are fully to this purpose,
how then do they Contradict this Pretense? Give you me but leave to Appeal to
the Testimonies themselves, which are here (and in the former Section) cited
out of Melchisedech offered Bread and Wine, which is now offered. Item, He
sacrifised in Bread and Wine, wherein he dedicated this Sacrament of Christ.
(But yet in Bread and Wine.) Item, In Bread and Wine, which the whole world now
celebrateth. Item, In the same Bread and Wine now celebrated in the Eucharist,
Outcry against Bellarmine and other Objectors, for their Inconsionableness in
concluding a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, from the Testimonies of
Fathers, See this Treatise of the Mass, Book 6. Chap. 5.. 1
which mentioned only the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine herein; which Sacrifice
of Bread and Wine the Romish Objectours themselves do absolutely deny to be any
Proper Sacrifice. Than which manner of Arguing, what can be more Unconscionable,
and less to the purpose?

A second Vindication of my second kind of Allegations and Exceptions, against
the Calumnies of the same Romish Seducer.
Hear your Romanist. His second Pretense is, that the other of the Fathers
Testimonies say that Melchisedech offered the Body and Blood of Christ, which
yet is not said to be offered or continued by any of them, but only by Saint
Cyprian and Saint Hierome. So he.

Answer.
There needs no more, for my discharge, than to apply the Sentences of the
Fathers above cited to the point in Question. Christ (says Cyprian) offered up
the same which Melchisedech offered, to wit, his Body and Blood. Plain.
Bellarmine in his Chapter concerning Melchisedech produces Hierome saying of
this Bread and Wine offered, that it is the Body and Blood of Christ. This is
as Plain. Eucherius and Primasius do both say, that Christ offered Bread and
Wine, that is the Body and Blood of Christ, even as did Melchisedech. As plain
as the former. Now for any Romanist to reprove all this, without any Proof to
the Contrary, bewrays both Impotencie in not effecting, and Impudency in
attempting his pretended Confutation. *


But, Bellar. Non videtur posse negari, etc. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. Accedit.
you pre-occupate, viz. The Apostle, speaking of Melchisedech, says, [Of whom
I had much to say, and that Chap. 5. verse. 11. Whence it may seem (says your
Cardinal) a thing undeniable, that the Apostle meant thereby the Mystery of
the Eucharist, because it was above their capacity, and therefore he purposely
forbear to mention either Bread or Wine. So your Answerer. To whom you may
take, for a Reply as in our behalf, the Confession of your much-esteemed
Jesuit Ribera, who tells you that Ribera Ies. Id non ideo dixerat, quod
sermonem illu^ tracere vellet, erat enim id, id quod in hac Epistol^ agit,
valde accommodatum, sed ut magis illos excitatet studio audiendi, and
intentiores redderet -- Non desperate Paulus quae scripturus est posse ab illis
percipi, si animu^ attendant, aut certe a nonnullis eorum, qui eruditiores
erant, per quos caeteri etiam paulatim intelligerent. Ca^. in Heb. 6. number. 1.
Where also he has these words: Cum illorum and imbecillitatem and tarditatem
accusat, idcirco facit, ut pudore ad melius intelligenda incitarentur: [Missa
nunc faciamus rudimenta, and ad perfectionem seramur.] H^c est, Date operam ut
mecum intelligatis, quae perfectis dici solent.
The Apostle naming it a thing Inexplicable, and calling them Dull, meant not
thereby to conceal the matter employed (which was so pertinent to that he had
in hand) from So he, proving the same out of those words of the Apostle,
[Passing by the Rudiments, etc. Let us go on unto perfection:] that is, (says
he) Do your diligence in hearing, that you may attain unto the understanding
of these things, which are delivered unto those that are perfect. This is the
Brief of his large Comment hereupon.

* We may here take up the Argument commonly used by all Protestants, to prove
that although Christ be, in many respects, resemblable to Melchisedech, in his
Priesthood most properly; yet that in the manner of his Sacrifice not so:
because Proper Sacrifice of Christ and Christians should be in Bread and Wine,
as was that of Melchisedech. But the Sacrifice of Christ and Christians is not
offering Bread and Wine. Therefore cannot Christ be resembled to Melchisedech
in the matter and nature of the Sacrifice.

This Argument we formerly forbear to urge, because we wanted the Assent of
any of your Romish Doctors herein. But now we have found, among your Jesuits,
one confirming our Consequence, and saying, that Christ being considered to be
a Priest after the order of Melchisedech, in Iac. Gordon. Scot Ies. Controvers.
Contr. 9. Cap. 3. number. 1. Melchisedech non solum erat typus Christi, sed etiam
Christus ipse fuit vere Sacerdos secund^u ordinem Melchisedech, non secunduum
ordinem Aaron. Neces^e igitur est ut Christus, praeter illud cruentum
sacrificium, quod in cruce obtulit, obtule rit etiam incru^^^^m Panis and Vini
in ipsa ultima coena; alioqui non fuisset Sacerdos secundum ordinem
Melchisedech.
It is necessary that Christ, besides his bloody Sacrifice on the Cross,
should offer an unbloody Sacrifice of Bread and Wine. Nor can you justly oppose
against our Assumption, which is, that the Proper Sacrifice of Christ and
Christians is not the offering of Bread and Wine; because this is the
universal, absolute, and constant Consequence of your Romish Doctors, judging
and censuring the Contrary Assertion of this Jesuit to be Jewish and Absurd,
as you may find in the fifth Chapter following, Sect. 1. * Notwithstanding,
what our Opposites fail of, in the point of Sacrifice, they intend to gain
from the Priesthood.

Of the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as it is compared with the pretended Romish
Priesthood, out of the Epistle to the Hebrews. SECT. IV.

Cardinal) is translated into the Priesthood of Melchisedech, and this into
the Priesthood of Christ, [A Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech:]
which, because it is perpetual and eternal, cannot be performed properly by
Christ himself, and therefore must be executed by his Ministers, as Vicars on
earth. So he, accordingly as your Council. Trident. Sess. 22. Ca. 1. Christus
Sacerdos secund^ ordine^ Melchisedech; and si semel obtulic in cruce, ut
aeternam redemptionem operaretur: quia tamen per mortem ejus Sacerdotium
estinguendum non erat etc

whole Ministry of the new Testament to issue Novi Testamenti ministerium jam

(...).
Originally from Melchisedech. This is a matter of great moment, as will
appear; which we shall resolve by certain Positions.

Christ and Melchisedech, is set down in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

That the Analogy between Melchisedech his Priesthood, and the eternal
Priesthood of Christ in himself, is most perfect, and so declared to be,
THe holy Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, comparing the Type
Melchisedech with the Arch-Type Christ Jesus, in one order of Priesthood,
shows between Both an absolute Analogy, although not in equality of
Excellence, yet in similitude of qualities and offices. As first in Royalty,
Melchisedech is called Hebr. 7. 2.
The King of Justice and Peace. So Christ (but infinitely more) is called Romans
3. 26.
Our Justice and Peace. Secondly, Melchisedech, in respect of Generation, was
without Generation from Father or Mother (according to the formality of Sacred
Story:) so Christ, according to the verity of his Humanity, without Father;
and, in his divine nature, without Mother: of whom also it is written, Who
shall declare his Generation? Thirdly, in Time, Melchisedech a Priest for ever,
having neither beginning nor end of days (according to the same Historical
Tenure:) so Christ an eternal Priest, Chap. 5, 6. Fourthly, in Number, only
One, who had no Predecessor, nor Successor. Christ, who acknowledged no such
Priest before him, nor shall find any other after him for ever. Fifthly,
Christ was Universally King and Priest, as the Apostle noted, Chap. 7. 4.
saying, That the Priesthood was changed from Aaron and Levi to Christ, in Judah.
That is, that Christ's Power might be both Regal, and Sacerdotall, says
Mutatum Sacerdotiu^^ de Sacerdotali an Regalem, ut eadem ipsa sit Regalis and
Sacerdotalis. Chrysostom. in Heb. 7. Hom. 13 Fuit in Melchisedech singularis
dignitas, quod Sacerdotium administrabatur per Regem. Tes^e Greg. Valent. l. 1.
de Missa. cap. 4.
Chrysostom, which was a singular dignity, as your Jesuit well observes.

That the nature of every other Priesthood (be it of your Romish High Priest)
dissenteth as much from the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as the Priesthood of
Melchisedech agrees with the Priesthood of Christ. SECT. VI.
IF Comparison might be made of Priesthood, whom would you rather that we
should instance in, than in your entitled Summus Pontifex, that is, the
High Priest, your Pope: who notwithstanding cannot be said to be a King, as
Melchisedech, much less as Christ, Bellar. Regnum spirituale Christo proprium:
-- item Regnum divinum universale, ratione Hypostaticae Vnionis; item gloriae
in Beatitudine. Te^porale terrenu^ Christo conveniebat. Lib. Recog. page 28.
Everlasting. Secondly, much less a King of Peace, who has been reproved by
Antiquity for being Victor, Pacis perturbator. Irenaeus apud Eusebius. hist. lib 5
cap. 24.
A Troubler of the Peace of Christ's Church: And generally complained of by
others, as being Non tantum contra Barbaros, sed etiam ejusdem patriae,
sanguinis, and fidei principes Domini nostri Dei pacis minus pacifici Vicarij.
Espenc. in 1. Tim. digress. lib. 2. cap 6 page 273.
Nothing less than the Vicar of the God of Peace, because of his raising
hostile wars against Princes of the same Nation, Blood, and Faith: And for
Leodiens. Epist. ad Paulum 2. de Greg. Septimo; Novello schismate Regnum and
Sacerdotium scindebat. Test Espencaeo quo supra.
Distracting the Estates of Princedome and Priestdome. Thirdly, not King of
Justice, because some Popes have excited Subjects and Sons to rebel against
their Liege Sovereigns and Parents. Fourthly, not Originally without
Generation, by either Father or Mother; some of them having been borne in
lawful Wedlock, and of known honest Parents: albeit of othersome the Mothers
side has been much the surer.

It will be no Answer to say, as Pope Non secundum c^dine^ Aaron, cujus
Sacerdotiu^ per propaginem sui seminis in ministerio temporali fuit, and cum
Veteris Testamenti Lege cessavit: sed secundum ordinem Melchisedech, in quo
aeterni Pontificis forma praecessit. Leo papa Sermon. 2. in Annivers. die
Assumpt. ad Pontif.
Leo in effect did, viz. that, as Priests, you are not as were the Leviticall,
by natural Propagation; but by a Spiritual ordination: because a Spiritual
metaphorical Generation. Fifthly, not without Succession; seeing that
Succession, as from S. Peter, is the chief tenure of your Priesthood. Nor will
that of Epiphanius help you, in this Case, to say that Nunc sane non amplius
semen secundum successionem eligitur, sed forma juxta virtutem quaeritur.
Epiphan. cont. Haeres. 55.
You had no Succession by the seed of Aaron: because although this may exempt
you from the Leviticall Priesthood, yet will not it associate you with the
Priesthood of Melchisedech, or of Christ, whose Characters of Priesthood was to
be Priests soly, individually, and absolutely in themselves, without Succession
by another. And this Christ had an Intransmissible Priesthood, do fully
signify.

As little can your ordinary Answer avail, telling us that you are not
Salmeron. Ies. Nos in Christo Sacerdotes sumus tanquam Vicarij -- Satis est
nobis illum Principem semper vivere. Com. in Heb. cap. 10. Disp 19.
Successors, but Vicars of Christ, and Successors of Peter; because, whilst
you claim that the Visible Priesthood and Sacrifice of Christ is still in the
Church, which is perpetuated by Succession, you must bid farewell to the
Priesthood of Melchisedech. But if indeed you disclaim all Succession of
Christ, why is your Jesuit licensed to say, that your Ribera. Successor quidem
Christo Petrus, and reliqui post eum Pontifices in officio gubernandi
Ecclesiam, and p^scendi oves Christi Verbo praedicatinis, and Sacramentorum
administratione. At non successit in officio redemptionis, and Pontificis per
se Deum ir^t^m placantis, -- in quo non sunt Successores, sed Ministri Christi.
In Heb. 10. number. 8.
Roman Popes do succeed Christ in their Pastorsh^p over the Church, although
not in their Priesthood, by offering Sacrifices, expiating sins by their own
virtue? Are not the Titles of Pastor and Priest equally transcendent in Christ?
Again, if you be Vicars of Christ, then are you not after the Order of
Melchisedech, Vicar, than that he had either Father or Mother.

Sixthly, not in respect of the no-necessity of a Succession, which was Heb 7.
23.
Immortality, because the Popes showed themselves to be sufficiently mortal,
insomuch that one Pope maligning another, after death has dragged the Carcass
of his Predecessor out of his Platin^^ in Vitis Sergij 3. Formosi, ^tephani,
Christophori.
Grave; to omit their other like barbarous outrages. * In respect of which
Mortality, Athanasius is as contradictory to your Romish Doctrine as can be who
resolves, Athanas. con. Arian. Orat. 3. page 380. Aaroni quidem Successores
dati, and omnino legale Sacerdotium mortis and temporis progressu alios atque
alios Sacerdotes accepit: Dominus autem (...).
Aaron indeed had Successors, and in the Legal Priesthood, in process of
time, by reason of death one succeeded another: but our Lord had a Priesthood
without Transition and Succession, being himself always a faithful
High Priest.

From the same law of Mortality Theodoret concludes likewise that Christ in
the New Testament Theod. in Heb. 7. Quemadmodum non habuerit Melchisedech
Successores, ita nec hic ipsum ad alios transmittit. -- Item. Qui ex lege
Sacerdotes sunt, quia mo^talem habent naturam, ea de Causa habent filios
Successores: hic autem quia immortalis non transmitur ad alium munus Sacerdo^^j.
Transmitteth not his Priesthood to any other. Wherein we may say, that
Theodoret was Scholar to Chrysostom, Chrysostom. in Hebr. 7. Hom 13. Quia
semper vivit, non habet Successorem. Ostendit novum Testamentum praestantius
esse Veteri, inducta comparatione de Sacerdotibus: quod illud quidem homines
habuit Sacerdotes: hoc autem Christum.
who likewise makes the excellency of the New Testament, in comparison of the
Old, to consist in this, that they had many for that (by reason of Mortality)
they were but men: in the New Testament, we have Christ a Priest. So he. This
one Observation might satisfy any reasonable man, for the confutation of your
Romish Doctrine of Proper Priesthood; the rather because you were never able to
prove, out of any Father, that Distinction of yours, to wit, of one being the
Vicar, albeit the Successor of Christ. No, no this Distinction, now after a
thousand years since Christ his Incarnation, has been the adulterate Coin
of your own Romish forge. *

Personal Sanctity, Heb. 7. 26.
Holy, impolluted, and separated from sins. For whosoever, being merely Man,
shall arrogate to himself to be without sin, the holy Ghost will give him
the 1. John 1. 8.
Lie. As for your Popes, we wish you to make choice of whatsoever Historians
you please, and we doubt not but you shall find upon record, that many of
them are noted to have been as impious and mischievous in their lives, and in
their deaths as infamous and cursed, as they were contrarily Bonifaces,
Innocents, or Benedicts in their names. Can there be then any Analogy between
your High Roman Priest and Christ, the Prototype to Melchisedech, in so
manifold Repugnancies? yet notwithstanding, every one of you must be (forsooth)
a Priest after the order of Melchisedech.

Nay, but (not to multiply many words) the Novelty of your Pretense does bewray
it self from Lambard. de Ordinat. Presb. Accipiunt etiam calicem cum vino, and
patinam cum Hostijs, ut sciant se accepisse potestatem placabiles Deo hostias
offerendi Hic ordo a filijs Aaron sumpsit initium, etc. Lib. 4. Distinct. 24.
(...) I.
Peter Lombard, Master of the Romish School, who Anno 1145. taught (how truly
look you to that) that every Priest at his Ordination, in taking the Chalice
with Wine, and Platter with the Host, should understand that his power of
Sacrificing was from the order of Aaron. Nor may you think that this was his
private opinion, for He (says your Pet. Lombardus collegit sententias
Theologoorum, and Magister Theologotum scholasticorum dici meruit. Lib. de
Script. Eccles. Tit. Petrus Lombardus.
Cardinal of him) collected the Sentences of Divines, and deserved to be
called the Master of Schoolmen. Thus far of the Person of Christ, as Priest;
in the next place we are to enquire into his Priestly Function.

Of the Function of Christ his Priesthood, now after his Ascension into Heaven;
and your Cardinal his Doctrine Sacrilegiously detracting from it. SECT. VII.
BY the Doctrine of your Cardinal, in the name of your Church, Bellar. Crucis
Sacrificium non est perpetuum, sed effectum ejus -- nec dicitur aeternu^ quod
non jugiter sacrificatur -- non in caelis jam Sacerdos per solam oratione^, nec
mediante oblatione Victimae, quia tun. necesse est eum semper offerre: -- Ergo
Eucharistia and Sacrificium quod jugiter offertur -- Oblatio in coelis non est
proprie dictum Sacrificium -- Ergo non est vere ac proprie. Sacerdos, cum verum
ac proprium Sacrificium offerre non potest Lib. 1. de Missa. c. 6 sparsim. And
-- Christus non sacrificat nunc per se visibiliter, nisi in Eucharistia. Bell.
ibid c. 25. Quod autem. And, Sacrificium c^^cis, respectu Christianorum. ^b. c.
20. And, Per Ministros suos perpetuo sacrificat seipsum in Eucharistia: hoc
enim solummodo perpetuum habet Sacerdotium. Bellar. ibid. cap. eod. ad finem.
The old Priesthood of Aaron was translated into the Priesthood of Christ:
Every Priest (says the Apostle) must have something to offer, else he were no
Priest. Thus his Priesthood And again, His sacrificing of himself in the
Sacrament, by his Ministers, is that by which only he is said to have a
perpetual Priesthood. Accordingly your Cardinal Alan. Christus in (...) coelo
(...) aliquid Sacerdotal^ facit. nisi respectu nostri Sacramenti, quod ipse per
nostru^ ministerium efficit continuo and offert. Lib. 2. ^ Euchar. ca. 8.
Reliqua.
Alan; Christ (says he) performs no Priestly Function in Heaven, but with
relation to our Ministry here on earth, whereby he offers. So they, for the
dignifying of their Romish Mass, as did also Rhemists. Christ his Priesthood
consists in the perpetual offering of Christ his Body and Blood in the
Church. Annot. in Heb. 7. 17.
your Rhemists; but with what Eclipse of Judgment and good Conscience, is now
to be declared.

If we take the Sacrifice of Christ for the proper Act of Sacrificing, which
is destructive; so was Christ his Sacrifice but One, and Once, Heb. 7. and 8.
But understanding it as the subject Sacrifice, once so offered to God upon the
Cross, and after his Ascension entered into Heaven, and so is it a perpetual
Sacrifice presentative before God. For as the High Priest of the Law, after the
Sacrifice was killed, entered into the Holy place once a year, but not without
Blood, Heb. 9. 7. so Christ having purchased an eternal redemption, by his
Death upon the Cross, went into the Holy place (of Heaven) with the same his
own Blood. Verse. 12. To what end? Always living to make supplication for us.
Chapt. 7. Verse. 3. and 25.

Hence follows the continual use, which the souls of the faithful have, of
his immediate Function in Heaven: Having a perpetual Priesthood, he is able
continually to save them that come to God by him. Verse. 24, 25. Whence issues
our boldness and all-confidence, always to address our prayers to him, or by
him unto God: We having an High Priest over the house of God, let us draw nere
with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
from an evil Conscience. Chap. 10. 22. The evidence of these Scriptures has
drawn from your Jesuit Ribera (even then, when he professes himself an
earnest defender of your Roman Mass) these Acknowledgements following Ribera.
Ies. in his Comment upon the places. alleged, Chap. 7. 23. Chap. 8. 2. and 3.
Chap. 9. 23. His Book is familitar with you, where you may peruse the places.
viz. upon the Chap. 7. 23. That Christ is a true Priest, and all other do
partake of his Priesthood, in offering Sacrifice, only in remembrance of his
Sacrifice: And that he did not perform the office of Priesthood only upon
earth, but even now also in heaven: which Function he now discharges by the
virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Cross. He proceeds. No man (says he)
will deny this Position (namely) that Christ now ever exercises the office of
a Priest, by presenting himself for us. So he.

Another Theological Professor, of Bellarmines own Society, in the place
where he notes Bellarmine to walk in his own opinion alone, proceeds
further, Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Thom Disp. 225. c. 2. Nullus quic em ex
Doctoribus, quos recentiores Theologi pro hac sententia allegarunt, praeter
nostrum Bellarminum, qui express asserit Christum esse principalem offerentem
in hoc Sacramento -- Dicunt Patres Cyprian. Ambros. and alij, Nos Sacrificia
offerre vice Christi -- Signifitant nos esse Christi Ministros in hoc
Sacrificio, non quod Christus hoc Sacramentum offerat -- Vt Christus vere
dicatur Sacerdos secundum ordinem Melchisedech, non indiget Sacrificio usque ad
finem mundi, siquidem post mundi finem remanebit Sacerdos, and tamen nullum
proprie dictum sactificum habebit.
affirming that Christ needs not a Sacrifice to continue to the ends of the
world, to the intent he should become a Priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedech; because he is to continue a Priest for ever, even after the end
of the world, when he shall not have any proper Sacrifice at all. Yet lest
this Jesuit might seem but to lispe it, by mentioning an Eternity of the
Priesthood of Christ, only in respect of his person, your Jesuit Estius
comes off roundly, Estius Ies. Com. in Heb. cap. 7. verse. 17. Ex quibus
omnibus intelligitur, Christum vocari Sacerdotem in Aeternum ratione Personae,
ratione Officij, and ratione Effectus. Personae quidem ratione, quoniam nullus
ei Successurus. Officij ratione, quia semper in coelis interpellat pro nobis,
quod est Sacerdotis Officium. Nec caret hoc Sacrificium sua oblatione, qula
seipsum hominem, and vulnerum signa, quae passus est, exhibet, and offert Patri
pro salute Electorum. Denique ratione Effectus, quia per Sacrificium pro nobis
oblatum factus est nobis Causa redemptionis and salutis aeternae.
confessing a Priesthood of Christ both in Person, Office, and Effect, from the
Concurrence of the Text, as follows. From all these we (says he) that
Christ is called a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedech, First in
respect of his Person, because there is none to succeed him. Secondly in
respect of his Office, by making supplication in heaven for us. Nor does he
want an Oblation, which is the presenting of his Body that suffered to the
Father for our Salvation. And thirdly in respect of the Effect, being made for
us, by his Sacrifice of the Cross, the cause of our Redemption. So he, as
just Protestantiall as can be. *

This is still Christ's Function of Priesthood, whereunto this Apostle exhorts
all Christians, at all times of need, to make John propounds as the only
Anchor-hold of Faith in his Propitiation, 1. John 2. If any sin, we have an
Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is (what?) The
Propitiation for our sins. The which every faithful Christian does apply, by
faith, unto himself, as often as he prays to God, in Christ's name, for the
remission of sins, saying, Through Jesus Christ our Lord. How therefore can
this his Function of Priesthood, without extreme sacrilege, be held
Insufficient to his Church, for obtaining pardon immediately from God, who sees
not? As Examples of things celestial, and of Purging sins now with better
Sacrifices, you should not have troubled us with them, knowing them to be
satisfied by your own Authors Ribera Ies. Thomas Expositionem alteram
praefert, nempe per [Coelestia] appellari ipsum coelum, cujus ^igura erat
tabernaculum. Et emundari dicitur, quia homines per Christum emundati sunt, qui

That the former Romish Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christ's Priestly Function
in Heaven, is contradicted by ancient Fathers; first in respect of Place, or
Altar, and Function. SECT. VIII.
THeodoret is Theod. in Psalm. 109. Sacerdos nunc est Christus, non ipse aliquid
offerens, sed vocatur Caput Offerentium, quandoquidem corpus suum Ecclesiam
voca^. Objected by Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6.
alleged by you, as denying that Christ now offers any thing by himself, but
only in the Church: Church personally, which all confess: for otherwise
Theodoret presently after His words immediately following are these: Et
propterea Sacerdotio fu^gitur ut homo: recipit autem ea quae offeruntur ut
Deus. Offert autem Ecclesia Corporis and ejus sanguinis symbola. So Theod.
expresses, that Christ exercises his Priesthood still as man. As for the
Church, his words are not, that She offers the Body and Blood of Christ in
Sacrifice, but, The Symbols of his Body and Blood: Therefore is this his
Testimony unworthily and unconscionably objected. But we will consult with the
direct speeches of Antiquity. First if you ask the Offering, Ambrose answers
you, that Ambros. Nunc Christus offertur, hi^ in Imagine, ibi in veritate, ubi
apud Patrem Advocatus pro Nobis. Lib. 1 de offic. cap. 48. sub finem.
The offering of Christ here below is but in an image: but his offering with
the Father is in truth. If of the Priest, Augustine tells you, Aug. in Psalm.
94. Imponimus in a^a Sacrificium, quando Deum laudamus^ at vero Sacerdotem si
requiras, super coelos est, inter pellat pro te, qui in terris mortuus est pro
te.
The Priest is to be sought for in heaven, even He, who on earth suffered
Death for thee. There is some difference then sure.

As little reason have your Disputers to object that one and only Testimony of
Augustine, Aug. lib. 20. de Civit. cap. 10. Episcopi and Presbyteri (inquit)
sunt proprie Sacerdotes. Bellarm. obijcit. lib. 1. de Missa, cap 17. Sed erunt
omnes Sacerdotes Dei and Christi, and regnabunt cum eo mill annis. Apoc. 20.
Non utique de solis Episcopis and Presbyteris dictum, qui proprie jam Vocantur
Sacerdotes: sed sicut omnes Christianos dicimus, propter mysticum Chrisma: sic
omnes Sacerdotes, quoniam membra sunt unius illius Sacerdotis.
Presbyteri proprie Sacerdotes: which he spoke not absolutely, but
comparatively (namely) in respect of Lay-Christians, who in Scripture are
otherwise called Priests. (As your own Duplex Sacerdotium, alterum Interius,
omnium fidelium, qui aqua salutari abluti sunt, Apoc. 1. 16. -- alterum
Exterius tantum eorum, qui externo Sacramento ordinis ad aliquod proprium
sacrumque ministerium ascribuntur. Catechis. Romans par. 2. de Ordine, number. 22.
Bellarmine, and Roman Catechism distinguish, calling the former the Inward,
Baptism; the other Outward, by the Sacrament of Orders.) And with the like
liberty does Saint Augustine call the Sacrifice of the Old Testament (although
most proper) but a Sign, in respect of the Spiritual Sacrifice of this work
of mercy; which he Aug. ibid. in Apoc. 20. 6. [Sed erunt Sacerdotes Christi,
and regnabunt cum Eo, etc.] Non utique de solis Episcopis aut Presbyteris
dictum est, qui proprie jam vocantur in Ecclesia Sacerdotes: sed sicut omnes
Christianos dicimus propter mysticum Chrisma, sic omnes Sacerdotes, quia membra
unius Sacerdotis, etc. [For there is a double Reason of naming Christians
Priests; one is in general, because of their offering up spiritual Sacrifices
of prayers and Praises to God, 1 Pet. 2. 5. And another is in special, by
public Function, commending the same spiritual Sacrifices, in public
Service, in the name of the Church. ^ And so, according to the same liberty of
terming them properly Priests, wherewith before (as you have heard) in
comparing Alms with the Jewish Sacrifice, he called Alms the true Sacrifice,
and the other but The sign of it; notwithstanding the bodily Sacrifice of the
Jews was, in propriety of Speech, The true Sacrifice, and the other but
Analogicall.]
calls True, namely in the Truth of Excellency, although though not of
Propriety, as you may see. And lastly, here you have urged one, than whom there
is scarcely found among Protestants a greater Adversary to your fundamental
Article of your Sacrifice, which is the Corporal existence of Christ in the
Eucharist. All which notwithstanding, the dignity of our Evangelicall Function
is nothing lessened, but much more amplifyed by this Comparison.

If furthermore we speak of the Altar, you will have it to be rather on earth
below, and to that end you object that Scripture, Hebr. 13. 10. We have
[(...)] that is, an Altar (says the Apostle) whereof they have no right to
eat, that serve at the Tabernacle. This Rhemists in their Annot. upon the
Place: and M. Breerly in his Book of the Liturgy Tract. 3. Sect. 3. Subd. 4.
some of you greedily catch at, for proof of a proper Sacrifice in the Mass,
and are presently repulsed by your Aquinas. Istud altar vel est crux Christi,
in qua Christus immolatus est, vel ipse Christus in quo, and per quem preces
nostras offerimus: and hoc est Altar aureum, de quo Apoc. 8. Com. in hunc
locum.
Aquinas, expounding the place to signify Either his Altar upon the Cross, or
else his Body, as his Altar in Heaven: mentioned Apocal. 8. and called The
golden Altar. If we our selves should tell you, how some one affirms that
This Altar, spoken of by the Apostle, is the Body of Christ himself in Heaven,
upon which, and by which all Christians are to offer up their spiritual
Sacrifices of Faith, Devotion, Thankfulness, Hope, and Charity; you would
presently answer, that This one certainly is some Lutheran or Calvinist, the
words are so contradictory to your Romish Garb: notwithstanding you may find
all this in the Antididag. Coloniens. de Missae Sacrificio.. Posthac --
[Habemus Altare] Heb. 13. and Apoc. 8. [Aureum altar,] in quo, and per quod
omnes Christiani universa Sacrificia spiritualia fidei, devotionis, gratiatum
actionis, spei, and charitatis Deo Patri debent offerre. -- Atque ita sit, ut
Christus sit altar, Sacerdos, and Sacrificium. August. lib. 10. de Trinitate:
Antididagma of the Divines of Collen. Besides your Argument drawn from the
word Altar, in this Scripture, is so feeble and lame a Soldier, that your
Bellarm. Quia non desunt ex Catholicis, qui interpretantur hunc locum vel de
Cruce, vel de Christo ipso, non urgeo eum. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 14.
Cardinal was content to leave it behind him, because Many Catholics (says
he) interpret it otherwise.

* And, indeed, who is of so shallow a brain, as not to See above, Chap. 5.
Sect. 15.
Abstain from the words Sacrifice, Priest, and Altar, do notwithstanding
allege the word, Altar, in the Text to the Hebrews, for proof of a proper
Altar in the Mass? Will you be contented to permit the decision of this point
to the judgment of your Jesuit Estius? Estius Comment. in 13. ad Hebr.
[Habemus Altate.] Thomas Altar hoc interpretatur Crucem Christi, vel ipsum
Christum, de quo edere, inquit, est fructum passionis percipere, and ipsi
tanquam Capiti incorpocari. Crucem Christi proprie vocari Altar nulla
dubitatio est. Vnde Ecclesia vocat Aram Crucis -- Arbitror Expositionem Thomae
magis esse germanam, quam innuit Apostolous, cum paulo post dicit [Iesum extra
portam passum esse,] i.e. in ara Crucis oblatum. Vt taceam, quod toties in hac
Epistola, atque ex instituto per Antithesim comparat Sacerdotem ministrantem
Tabernaculo, cum Christo seipsum offerente in Cruce. -- Sane cum nullam facere
voluerit mentionem Sacrificij incruenti novae legis, non multum verisimile est,
eum nunc aliud agentem, velut ex abrupto voluisse de Sacrificio incruento
sermonem jungere; Sed potius cruenti in cruce oblati memoriam ex antedictis
renovare. -- Huc pertinet quod Corpus Christi in Cruce oblatum, Panis vocatur,
fide manducandus. Vt Ioh. 6. Pan^s quem ego dabo.
He adhereth to the Interpretation of Aquinas, which is, that here, by Altar,
is meant the Cross of Christ's sufferings: which he collecteth out of the Text
of the Apostle, where he says of the Oblation of Christ's Passion, that It was
without the gate; and observes, for Confirmation-sake, that the Apostle often,
of purpose, opposes the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross to the Bloody
Sacrifice of the Old Testament, so far, as never to make mention of the
Sacrifice of the New Testament. So he. What is, if this be not our
Protestantiall profession, concerning this word, Altar, to prove it to be taken
Improperly for the Altar of Christ's Cross; and not for your pretended proper
Altar of the Mass? *

But we are cited to consult with the Ancient Fathers, be it so. If then we
shall demand where our High Priest Christ Jesus is, to whom a man in Fasting
must repair, Origin. I^junans debes adire Pontificem tu^^ Christum, qul utique
non in terris quaerendus est, sed in coelis: Et per ipsum debes offerre Hostiam
Deo. In Levit. Cap. 16. Homil. 10.
Origin resolves us, saying, He is not to be sought here on earth at all, but
in Heaven. If a Bishop be so utterly hindered by persecution, that he cannot
partake of any Sacramental Altar on earth, Gregory Nazianzen will fortify
him, as he did himself, saying, Gregor. Nazianzen. Si ab his Altaribus me
arcebunt, at aliud habeo, cujus figurae sunt ea, quae nec oculis cermmus, super
quod nec ascia, nec manus ascendat, nec ullum Artificum instrume^tum auditum

praestantiora, quanto Veritas umbra. Orat. 28. page 4^4.
I have another Altar in Heaven, whereof these (Altars) are but Signs; a
better Altar, to be beholden with the eyes of my mind, there will I offer up my
Oblations: as great a Difference (doubtless) as between Signs and Things.
This could not he have said of those Altars, if the Sacrifices on them both
were, as you pretend, subjectively and corporally the same. If we would know
how, what, and where the thing is, which a Christian man ought to conte^plate
upon, when he is exercised in this our Eucharisticall Sacrifice? Chrysostom.
in 1. Cor. 10. Hom. 24. Illud sane tremendum Sacrificium, ut cum concordia ad
illud accedamus, ut Aquilae facti ad ipsum coelum evolemus: ubi enim cadaver,
ibi aquilae. Cadaver Domini corpus, propter mortem: Aquilas autem non oportet
ad inseriora trahi aut repere, sed ad superiora volare, and Solemn Iustitiae
intueri oculo mentis acutissimo. Aquilarum enim haec mensa est, non Graculorum.
Chrysostom is ready to instruct him, Not to play the Chough or Iay, in fixing
his thoughts here below, but as the Eagle to ascend thither where the Body is,
namely (for so he says) in Heaven. According to that of the Apostle, Heb. 10.
Christ sitting at the right hand of God. Verse. 12. What therefore? Therefore
let us draw near with an Assurance of faith. Verse. 22.

If we would understand wherein the difference of the Jewish Religion and
Christian Profession especially consists, in respect of Priesthood, Aug.
advers. Iudaeos, ca. 9. Nam and Aaron and Sacerdotium jam nullum est in aliquo
templo, and Christi Sacerdotium est aeternum in coelo.
Augustine tells us that They have no Priesthood; and the Priesthood of
Christ is eternal in Heaven. And the holy Fathers give us some Reasons for
these and the like Resolutions. For if any would know the Reason why we
Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar; Oecumen. in Heb. 10. super haec verba, [Cum
certitudine ^idei.] Cum deinceps nihil visible supersit, neque Templum, hoc est
coelum; neque Pontifex, id est, Christus; neque Hostia, quae Corpus illius est,
fido deinceps opus est.
Oecumenius and Ambros. in Heb. 10. Cum ^iducio, nit Apostolus: nihil enim hic
visible, neque Sacerdos, neque Sacrificium, neque Altar.
Ambrose will show us that it is because Here below there is nothing visible;
neither Temple, ours being in Heaven; nor Priest, ours being Christ; nor
Sacrifice, ours being his Body; nor yet Altar, says the other. Hear your own
Canus: Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. Oblatio, quam Christus in coelis
incruentum fecit. page 421.
Christ's offers an unbloody Oblation in Heaven.

* Chrysostom will not be behind his disciple Oecumenius, in expressions, who
differenceth our Christian Religion from the Jewish, for that Chrysostom. in
Hebr. Hom. 11. in Moral. Quantum est inter Aaron and Christum, tantum est inter
Iudaeos and nos: quippe nos habemus Sacrarium in Coelis, Sacerdotem in coelis,
and hostiam, etc. Talia igitur nos offeramus Sacrificia, quae in illo
Sanctuario possunt offerri. And then explaining what they were, viz.
Sacrificium laudis, justitiae, Spiritus contribulati; haec sacrificia offeramus.
Our Sanctuary, Priest, and Sacrifices is in Heaven. And if Christians intend
any other Sacrifice than that, he admonishes that they may be such, which may
be accepted of in the Heavenly Sanctuary; as namely The Sacrifice of Justice,
Praise, and of a Contrite Spirit, and the like, all merely Spiritual (as you
confess) and therefore but Metaphorically called Sacrifices: And Hierom. in
Epist. ad Hebdeb. quaest. 2. Ascendamus igitur cum Domino coenaculum magnum
stratum, and accipiamus ab eo sursum Calicem novi Testamenti, ibique cum eo
Pascha celebremus, inebriantes inebriemur ab eo Vino Sobrietatis.
Saint Hierome, also inviteth us To Celebrate our Passover with him above. *
Thus in respect of the place of Residence of Christ our High Priest, and his
Function, which has been already confirmed by the Fathers of the first
Council of Nice. And Altar, the Throne of Grace; something would be spoken in
respect of Time.

That the former Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christ's Priestly Function in
Heaven, is contradicted by Scriptures, and Fathers, in respect of the Time of
the execution thereof.
CHrist his Bodily existence in Heaven (as we have See above Chap. 3. Sect. 9.
heard) is set out by the Apostle in these terms: He abides a Priest for us.
He continues a Priest. He having a continual Priesthood. He, without
intermission, appears before God for us. Thus the Apostle. But what of this,
will you say? Do but mark. Are you not All heard still proclaiming, as with
one voice, that your Romish Sacrifice of the Mass is the only (...), and

Judge Sacrificium, that is, the Continual Sacrifice; Continually offered:
Whereof the [Iuge] and Continual Sacrifice of the Law was a Sign. So you. But
it were strange that the Judge Sacrificium of the Law, continuing both Morning
and Evening, should be a figure of your Masse-Sacrifice, which is but only
offered in the Morning. As if you would make a picture, having two hands, for
to represent a person that has but one. But, not to deny that the Celebration
of the Eucharist may be called a Judge Sacrificium (for so some Fathers have
termed it:) Yet, they no otherwise call it Judge, or Continual, than they call
it a Sacrifice, that is, Improperly; because it cannot possibly be compared for
Continuance of Time to that Celestial of Christ in the highest Heaven, where
Christ offers himself without Intermission.

Whereupon it is that Irenaeus exhorts men to pray often by Christ at his
Altar, Irenaeus. Nos quoque victimas offerre ad altar frequenter. Est ergo
Altar in coelis, illuc etiam preces nostrae and orationes dirigendae; and

exanguis offert. [That is objectively; for it is the Bloody Body, that is
presented by us in the Eucharist.]
Christ exhibiteth his Body wounded upon the Cross, and slain, as a [Iuge
Sacrificium] that is, a Continual Sacrifice, perpetually unto his Father for
us. And to this purpose serve the forecited Testimonies Augustine, Gregory
Nazianzen, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and Occumenius; some pointing out the Altar in
Heaven, as the Truth; some by Exhortations, and some by their Examples
instructing us to make our Continual Approach unto the Celestial Altar.

CHALLENGE.
NOw you, who so fix the hearts and minds of the Spectators of your Mass upon
your sublunary Altars and Hoasts, and appropriate the Judge Sacrificium
thereunto (in respect of Time) during only the hours of your Priestly
Sacrificing; allow your attention but a moment of Time, and you will easily see
the Impiety of that your Profession.

The Judge Sacrificium of Christ, as it is presented to God by him in Heaven,
has been described to be Continual, without Intermission, Always (that is)
without any Interruption of any moment of Time: to the end that all sorts of
Penitents and faithful Suitors, soliciting God by him, might find (as the
Apostle says) (...), that is, Help at any time of need. The Gates of this
Temple, Heaven, being ever open; the matter of this Sacrifice, which is the
Body of Christ, being there ever present; The Priest, who is Christ himself,
ever executing his Function. Whereas, contrarily, you will confess, (we dare
say) that the Doors of your Churches may happen to be all locked, or
interdicted; your Sacrifice shut up in a Box, or lurched, and carried away by
Mice; your Priest taken up with sport, or repast, or journey, or sleep: yea,
and even when he is acting a Sacrifice, may possibly nullify all his Priestly
Sacrificing Act, by reason of ( See hereafter Book 7. Cha. 5. Sect. 5.
Confessed) Almost infinite Defects.

Therefore the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Doctrine of your Mass is thus far
manifested, in as much that your own Ministerial Priesthood does so prejudice
the personal Priesthood In the two former Sections.
learned from the Fathers) Image with Truth; The state of Wicked Partakers with
the Godly; Matters Visible with Invisible; Signs with Things; Worse with
Better; Iayes with Eagles, and the like.

A SECOND CHALLENGE,
CHrist (says the Apostle) is a Priest for ever, according to the order of
Melchisedech. This [for ever] your Cardinal Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 6.
Quod si Sacerdotium Christi durat usque ad consummationem mundi (id enim
Scriptura aeternum vocat) certe Sacrificij ritus durate debet -- at Sacrificium
Crucis semel tantum peractu^ est, nec repeti potest, ergo aliud esse debet quod
jugiter offeratur. Et post aliquot paginas Quod ad aeternum Christi Sacerdotium
attinet, necesse est ut saepius offerat, vel per se, vel per Ministros, vel per
Ministros, non quidem cruente, sed aliquo alio modo. Idem Paulus docet, cum
dicit: Omnis Pontifex ad offerendu^ hostias constituitur -- nec dicitur
aeternum Sacerdotium, quod non jugiter Sacrificatur: nec sufficit aeternum
quoad effectum. So he, [His other Reasons have been alleged in the former
Sections.]
Bellarmine restrains to the time of Mortality, only to the end of the world,
and that Christ's Priesthood can He, either by himself, or by some other, must
necessarily offer some sacrifice unto the end of the world, because it cannot
be that that, which was but once done, can ever again be repeated, namely,
his bloody Sacrifice upon the Cross. So he, Concluding it must therefore be
the unbloudy Sacrifice in your Romish Mass.

Although this Argument deserve no other Confutation, than what has been given
out of the Confessions of your own Jesuit. Yet because another of the same
Society, and of Vasquez (who often expresses his reading of the works of
Bellarmine) may seem as it were to offer his service unto us, as being
desirous to oppose against the Judgment of your Cardinal, we may not deny
him our due Attention. He both out of Scriptures and ancient Fathers (alleged
in the Margin) concludes. Vasquez. Ies. in 5. Thom. Disp. 85. cap. 1 number. 1.

that Christ is called a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech, not
in respect only of the time, to the end of the world, but everlastingly beyond
all worlds: and this not only in respect of any Sacrifice to be made
hereafter, but of that his Bloody Sacrifice once and only offered upon the
Cross. Professing, that the contrary Assertion is repugnant to Scripture, even
By the Exposition of ancient Fathers, expressly teaching, that Christ's
Priesthood is called Eternal, because it reaches beyond all mortality.

And your Cardinal objected that out of Hebr. 5. Every Priest must have
something to offer: Ergo, Christ, being a Priest, must not be without a
present and continual Sacrifice, which can be no other than that in the
Eucharist. Against which the same Jesuit replyeth; But all the Greek Fathers
upon this Text (says he) and some of the Latin Fathers also, interpret this
not of the unbloody, but of the bloody Sacrifice of Christ: which may be
sufficient for his eternal Priesthood, by reason of the unity of his
Humanity and Divinity, which is eternal. Nor is there any one (says he) of
all the Fathers, So he, and much more, in the place quoted against the
particular and petty Reasons objected to the contrary. What Confutation can be
more convincent then that, which is warranted and fortified by the confessed
Evidences of Scriptures, and Testimonies of Ancient Fathers? *

Of the second Typical Scripture, which is the Passover: showing the
weakness of the Argument taken from thence, for proof of a proper Sacrifice
in the Mass. SECT. X.
FIrst, it is meet we hear your Objector speak, even your Bellarm. Immolatio
Agni Paschalis potest quidem dici figura Passionis: nam si Agnus ille fuit
figura Eucharistiae, Eucharistia autem figura Passionis, quis negat Agnum istum
figuram fuisse and Repraesentationem Passionis? Quare Ioh. 19. Videmus
Evangelistam reddere causam, cur non fuerant crura Christi confracta in
Passione, quia scriptum est de Agno Paschali, [Os non comminuetis ex eo.] Tamen
magis immediate and principaliter Ceremonia Agni Paschalis potius fuit figura
Eucharistiae, quam Passionis. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 7.. Illud. -- Quod
celebratio Agni Paschalis fuit figura celebrationis Eucharistiae, probatur ex
Scripturis, 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus: itaque epulemur

constat Apostolos in coena manducasse carnem Christi, -- Verum Agnum Paschalem,
ad cujus epulum nos hortatur Apostolus. 1. Cor. 5. Epulemur, etc Bellarm.
ibid.. Quod igitur, and. Dicent.
Cardinal, who albeit he confesses the Paschall Lamb to have been the
figure of Christ on the Cross, yet did it in the more immediately and
principally prefigure the Eucharist than the Passion, which is proved by
Scripture, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover is offered up, therefore let us feast it
in the Azymes of Syncerity and Truth.] Which offering up was not fulfilled on
the Cross; but it is evident that the Apostle did eat this true Paschall
Lamb, the flesh of Christ, at his Supper: and this Apostle exhorts us to
this Feast, in saying, [Let us therefore keep our Feast, etc.] So he,
bestowing a large Chapter of Arguments, wherewith to bleare our eyes, lest that
we should see in this Scripture [Our Passover is offered up] Rather the
Immolation Cross, than in the Eucharist. We willingly yield unto his alleged
Testimonies of ancient Fathers, who by way of Allusion, or Analogy, do all
call the Eucharist a Paschal Sacrifice. But yet that the words of this
Scripture should more properly and principally mean the Eucharisticall
Sacrifice (as if the Jewish Passover did rather prefigure the Sacrifice of
Christ in the Mass, than on the Cross) not one.

It were a tedious work to sift out all the dross of his Argumentations;
Nevertheless, because he puts Protestants unto it, saying as follows,
Bellar. quo supr^. Dicent etc. Dicent Adversarij Apostolum loqui de Immolatione
in cruce facta: at nos probabimus ^iguram illam proprie impletam fuisse in
coena.
But our Adversaries (says he) will say, that the Apostle, in saying our
Passover is offered up, speaks of Christ's Sacrifice offered upon the
Cross: but we will prove that this figure was properly fulfilled at his
Supper. (So he.) We will now show you, that other Adversaries, than
Protestants, are ready to encounter this your Champion.

First, the choicest Chieftaine of his own side, armed with the Authority of
Christ himself* Joh. 13. 1. [Before the day of the Passover, Jesus knowing
that his hour was come, that he must pass out of the world unto the Father.]
Now when was this spoken? Even then, says Ioh. 13. 1. [Ante diem Paschae
sciens Jesus quia venit hora, ut transiret ex hoc mundo ad Patrem.] Hic mortem
Transitum vocat. -- Alludit ad Pascha, ac si Latin disceret, Ante diem festum
Transitus, sciens quia venit hora ut transiret ipse: Ipse enim Pascha nostrum
immolatus est Christus. -- Optimus autem terminus, Transitus ejus ex hoc mundo
ad Patrem. Tolet. Ies. Com. in cum locum.
Tolet your Cardinal and Jesuit, When he that is, at his last Supper. But what
was meant hereby? namely, Christ alluded unto the Jewish Passover (says he)
in signification of his own passing over by death to his Father. So he. So
also your Jesuit August. in Psalm. 68. Cum Venit Dominus ad Sacranientum
Sangoinis and Corporis sui, (...) venit, ut (...) ad Patrem d^mundo.] Q^bus
ve^bis express^^ (...) Paschae. Testep^rerio Ies. in Exodus cap. 12 Disp. 8.
Pererius, out of Augustine.

Secondarily, to the Scripture objected, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover is offered
up, Christ*] that is, As the figurative paschall Lamb was offered up for the
deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt, so Christ was offered up to
death for the Redemption of his people, and so passed by his passion to his
Father. So your 1. Cor. 6. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, orgo epulemur
Azymis (...), and veritatis! [Aquinas assignat (...), quare fideles (...) esse
Azymi: quae quidem Ratio sumitu^ ex mysterio Passionis^] -- Sicut Agnus
figuralis i^mola^us est (...) Israel, ut populus liberaretur -- ita Christus
occisus ab Israelitis, ut populus liberare^^r a servitute Diaboli, Christus
enim per passionem trans^it ex mundo ad patrem. Ioh. 13. Haec Aquin. Com. in 1.
Cor. 5. And Tollet in his Testimony before cited. So Becanus Ies.
Aquinus. [Our Passover.] Namely, By his Sacrifice in shedding So your Jesuit.
[Pascha nostrum. 1. Cor. 5.] Nempe per immolationem in cruce, and effusionem
sanguinis illius, liberatum est genus humanum. Analog. utriusque Testam. cap.
13. page 313.
Becanus. And, By this his Passover on the Cross was the Passover of the
Jews fulfilled. So your Bishop Impleta erat figura Paschalis, quando veru^
nostru^ Pascha est immolatus Christus Jesus, and hos per ejus sanguinem
liberat^^eramus. I^^sen. Concord. Evang. cap. 13^. page 895.
Iansenius, as flat diameter to your Cardinal^s Objection as can be.

A third Scripture we find, Joh. 19. [They broke not his legs, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled which is written, A bone of him shall not be
broken:] which your Ioh. 19. [Crura non confregerant, ut impleretur quod
scriptum est, Os non comminuetis ex eo.] Bellar. quo supra, yet gain says
with his, Tamen, etc.. Illud.
Cardinal himself confesses to relate only to Christ's Sacrifice on the
Cross; and notwithstanding dare immediately oppose, saying, Nevertheless the
Ceremony of the Paschall Lamb did more immediately and properly prefigure the
Eucharist than Christ's passion: wherein, whether he will or no, he must be an
Adversary to himself. For there is no Ceremony more principal in any
Sacrifice than are these two, viz. The matter of Sacrifice, and the Sacrificing
Act thereof. Now the matter of the Sacrifice was a Lamb, the Sacrificing Act
was the killing thereof, and offering it up killed unto God. Whether therefore
the Paschall Lamb did more principally prefigure the visible Body of Christ on
the Cross, or your imagined Invisible in your Mass, whether the slain
Paschall Lamb bleeding to death, did more properly and immediately prefigure
and represent a living and perfect Body of Christ, than that his Body wounded
to death, and bloodshed, Common sense may stand for Judge.

The Ancient Fathers, when they speak of the Sacrifice of Christ's passion, in
a precise propriety of speech, do declare themselves accordingly. If in
general, then as Origin Sacrificium, pro quo haec omnia Sacrificia in typo and
figura praecesserunt, unum and perfectum immolatus est Christus. Hujus
Sacrificij carnem quisquis tetigerit, sanctificabitur. In Levit. cap. 6. Hom. 4.
Origin: All those other Sacrifices (says he) were perfigurations of this our
perfect Sacrifice. If more particularly, then as Chrysostomus de (...) and
Latrone 1. Cor. 5. Pascha ^ostrum immolatus est Christus: sestivitas ergo, etc.
Vide crucis intuitu porceptam laetitiam? in cruce enim immolatus est Christus:
Vbi immolatiotio, (...) peccatorum; ubi ampucatio peccatorum, reconciliatio
Domini -- novum Sacrificium -- nam ipse Sacrificium erat, and Sacerdos;
Sacrificium secundum carnem, Sacerdos secundum Spiritum, offerebat secundum
Spiritum, offereb^tur secundum carnem -- and Altar Crux fuit. Chrysostom. Tom.
3. page 826.
Chrysostom, from the objected Text of the Apostle. 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passover
is offered up, Christ, Let us therefore keep our Feast, etc.] Do thou see
(says he) in beholding the Cross, the joy which we have from it? for Christ
is offered upon the Cross, and where there is an Immolation, there is
Reconciliation with God: this was a new Sacrifice, for in this the flesh of
Christ was the thing sacrificed, his Spirit the Priest and Sacrificer, and the
Cross his Altar. Insomuch, that elsewhere he teaches every Christian how,
as a spiritual Priest, he may (...). Idem. Tom. 5. Ser. 88. Edi^. Savil. page
602.
Always keep the Passover of Christ. * And yet again the same Father, as if
he had thought this point deserved to be got by heart of every Christian: Idem
in Ioh. ^. Homil. 13. Vt de passione incipiamus, quid dicit figura? Sacrificate
Agnum Christus autem nihil hujusmodi praecipit, sed ipse sactus est
Sacrificium, and oblationem offereos seipsum.*
That we may speak of Christ's Passion (says he) what says the Figure?
[Take unto you a Lamb:] but Christ commands no such thing, for he himself
(namely at his Passion) offered up himself to the Father. So he. * What
greater plainness can be desired? and yet behold, if it be possible, a
greater from Socrat. Hist. lib. 5. cap. 22. Origenes Doctor valde sapiens cum
animadverteret Legis Mosaicae praecepta ad literam non posse intelligi,
praeceptum de paschate ad divinam contemplatione^ traducit: (...).
Origin, calling the Sacrifice on the Cross, the Only true Passover. Which
saying his Reporter Socrates imbraceth, as a Divine Contemplation.

* That the third objected Typical Scripture out of Exodus 24. [The Blood of
the Testament] is not justly objected for proof of a Proper Sacrifice
THis Text Exodus 24. speaking of the Sacrifice of the Old Testament [This is
the Blood of the Testament] being so consonant to the words of Christ,
delivered in his Institution of the Eucharist [This is the Blood of the New
Testament] in the Gospel, seems to your Cardinal to be an Argument of great
force, and therefore does he dart it against Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 8.
Terrium nostrum Argumentum sumitur ex Exodus 24. et Heb. Hic est sanguis
Testamenti, quod mandavit ad vos Deus. De quo Marc. 14. Hic est sanguis Novi
Testamenti -- Sic argume^tamur. Sanguis Testamenti veteris erat sanguis
victimae jam immolate et vere sacrificatae, Exodus 24. Ergo sanguis novi
Testamenti apud Christum est sanguis victimae vere and proprie sacrificatae:
Est autem sanguis ille Christi, ut ipse dicit, Hic est sanguis meus, Ergo ipse
fuit victima in coena immolata et sacrificata.
The Blood of the Old Testament was the Blood of an Host truly sacrifised;
Therefore the Blood of the New Testament mentioned in the Eucharist (whereof
the other was a figure) must needs be the Blood of Christ properly sacrifised
therein. So he, heaping up Reason upon Reason, as it were to make a mountain;
and presently after his much working and heaving, comes one of his own family
of the Jesuits, Vasquez by name, and kicketh all down with his heels, as it
had been but a Molehill, saying; Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Tho. Disp. 190. number. 15.
[Novum Testamentu^ in sanguine meo] apud Evangelistas and Paulum, in sanguine
Christi, prout est in hoc sacramento, non convenit. Nam qua^vis sacramentum
Eucharistiae sit sacramentum Novi Testamenti, and hac ratione dici posset Novi
Testamenti -- tamen long alio sensu dicitur Novi Testamenti, aut Novum
Testamentum, quod sit confirmatio and consummatio Novi Testamenti, hoc est,
gratiae, quam Christus promeruit generi humano; de quo Hebr. 9. [Testamentum in
mortuis confirmatum est] hoc est morte Testatoris, -- unde sequitur [neque
vetus Testamentum sine sanguine dedicatur] jude colligit, Novum sanguine
Christi confirmari -- Et rursus, [ubi Testamentum ibi mors intercedat
Testatoris necesse est] and tandem sic concludit Caput Apostolus: [sic Christus
semel oblatus est, ad multorum exhaurienda peccata] constat igitur sanguinem
Testamenti dici eatenus, quatenus est effusus in confirmatione illius, sicut
hac ratione sanguis hircorum and vitulorum essusus est. Exodus 24. [hic est
sanguis Testamenti] nam sacrificium incruentum in Eucharistia non erat causa
universalis Redemptionis -- illud ergo [Effundetur in Remissionem peccatorum]
significat futuram Effusionem in Passione.
That it is called [The Blood of the New Testament] by Christ, not as it is in
this Sacrament, but as it refers to the Sacrifice of Christ's Passion. Which
he confirms by the most Authentical kind of proof, even from the
Scripture, out of one Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in several
places. One from these words [A Testament is confirmed in men dead.] The next,
Heb. 9. [Where a Testament is, there does necessarily intervene the death of
the Testator.] And again; [Christ was once, sacrifised to take away the death
of many.] He might have added a fourth verse. 15. Christ is the mediator of the
New Testament, that death coming between, for Redemption. etc.

Each one of these pointing out Christ's Bloody Sacrifice on the Cross,
teaches us to deal with you, by law of Retortion thus: The Old Testament was
confirmed by the Death and Bloodshed of the Creature sacrifised: And so
(according to the Apostles Comparison) was the New Testament Christ our
Testator. Therefore could not the Bloody Sacrifice of the Old Testament be a
Figure of an Vn-bloody Sacrifice in the New.

That your Cardinal Bellarmine has Contradicted the Doctrine of the Ancient
Church of Rome, taught by Pope Leo the First. SECT. XII.
POpe Leo is he, whom the Church of Rome will be thought to esteem as equal
with the best of Popes, and Magnus, (Ob insignem sanctitatem, doctrinam and
eloquentiam, says your Jesuit Possevin. Apparat. Tit. Leo.
Possevin) who lived above a thousand years since. Him does your Bellar Lib.
1. de Missa, Cap. 7. Leo Sermon 7. de Passione Domini. Vt umbrae cederent
Corpori, and ce^^arent imagines sub praesentia veritatis, antiqua observantia

sacramenti institutione loquens, vetus Testamentum consummabat, and Novum
Pascha condebat.
Cardinal object for proof of the Sacrifice of the Mass, from the Sign of
the Paschall Lamb, in a Sentence, which in it self is sufficient to tell us
what was the Faith of the Church of Rome in his days; and to direct you in the
point now in Question: in manifesting that your Cardinal has egregiously
abused his Testimony, for proof of an Vn-bloody Sacrifice of Christ's Leo spoke
so evidently and expressly of the Sacrifice of his Passion, that your Jesuit
Vasquez was enforced to Leo Papa de Passione Domini, Sermon. 7. In solemnitate
Pasch li exercendi furoris sui Iudaei acciperent potestatem! Opportebat enim,
ut manifesto implerentur effectu, quae diu fuerant figurato promissa mysterio:
ut ovem significativam ^vis vera removeret, and ut uno explere^ur Sacrifi^ro
varsarunt differentia victimarum. Nam omnia illa, quae de Immolatione agni
divini^us per Moysen fuerant praestituta, Christum prophetarunt, and Christi
occisionem proprie nunciarunt. Vt ergo umbrae cederent corpori, and cessarent
imagines sub praesentia veritatis, antiqua observantia novo tollitur
sacramento, hostia in hostiam transit, and sanguinem sanguis excludit, and
legalis festivitas dum mutatur, impletur. Test Vasquez Ies. in 3. Tho. Disp.
223. Quest. 83. Cap. 6. Again. Solet ex Leone probari Missae sacrificium
unicum esse ex Sermon 7. de Paschate. Opportebat, etc. Verum ibi loquitur de
sacrificio cruento Christi, subdit enim [omnia illa Christi occisionem
pronuneiarant] per occisionem plane intelligit cruentum sacrificum. Eadem fere
verba hab^t Chrysostomus in Psalm. 95. [Lest the word, [Sacrament] in the
Sentence of Leo, may move any to conceive that it is spoken of the Eucharist,
or yet of any other Sacrament of the Church of Rome, It is to be observed,
that nothing is more familiar with Leo, than to call every Mystery and
Christian Article, Sacramentum. As for Example, in the beginning of this
Sermon, he calls the Feast of Easter, Sacramentum Salutis. De Festo
Nativitatis Sermon. 2. Reparator nobis salutis nostrae annua revolutione
Sacramentum. Et Sermon. 16. De voce Christi, [Transeat Calix iste] -- quod non
sit exaudita, magna est Expositio Sacramenti.]
confess thus much, even then, when he sought to defend the Romish Sacrifice
of the Eucharist.

The words of Leo are general. All those things which were performed,
concerning the Sacrificing of the Lamb by Moses, from Gods command, were
prophesied of Christ, and did properly declare the Slaying of Christ. So he.
Ergo he spoke of (...) bloody Sacrifice. And if these Prefigurations of the
Old Law, in the Sacrifice of the Lamb, do properly point at the Bloody
Sacrifice of Christ, then were they not properly Types of any Sacrifice in the
Mass. And lest you might think that Leo was singular In this Opinion, your
Jesuit will have you know that Chrysostom has also the same words. Now
whether you are bound rather to believe Ancient Roman Pope, or a late Roman
Cardinal; judge you. In the last place we are to remove an Objection.

An Objection taken from the Comparison between the figure of the Old
Testament, and the thing figured in the New; earnestly insisted upon, and as
easily refuted. SECT. XIII.
THe Brief of your Reason is this. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 3. [De figuris
veteris Testamenti.] Sumitur hoc Argumentum -- Figurae necessario inferiores
esse debent rebus figuraris -- Sed veteris Testamenti Sacramenta, panis
Melchisedech, panis Propositionu^ -- Agnus Paschalis, Manna, erant figurae
Eucharistiae simplici pani aequales, vel praestantiotes. Ergo Eucharistianon
est simplex panis, significans corpus Christi, sed et ipsum corpus Christi
Majorem et Minore^ probam ex Patribus.
Figures are necessarily But, In the Old Testament, the Bread of Melchisedech,
the Shewbread, the Bread of Manna, and the Paschall Lamb were figures of the
Eucharist in the New Testament; Therefore the matter in the Eucharist is not
simply Bread, but the Body of Christ. Thus your Cardinal. Your Dr. Heskins
also plays his descant upon this Base, and runs voluntary in a large
discourse from the Dr. Heskins in his parlam. lib. 3. chap. 14.
Brazen Serpent on a Pole, the figure of Christ Crucified: From Jonas in the
Belly of the Whale, a figure of Christ's Resurrection; and from the Paschall
Lamb, a figure of Christ offered in the Eucharist. Now the Thing being better
New Testament before the Old. Whereby I may Conclude (says he) that the
Paschall Lamb being a Sign of this Sacrament, this is not Bread, but the Body
of Christ. So he. The Answer is easy, by a Distinction of Things prefigured.
Some are Figures Principal, which are called Arche-types, and some less
principal, called only Antitypes. We shall make the matter plain by
Authentical Examples, 1. Cor. 10. 2. We are Baptized into Moses in the Cloud
and in the Sea. Hence all Expositors (as well as your Aquinas upon the same
place.
Aquinas) teach that The Sea, through which the Iraelites passed under Moses,
was This Exposition stands firm without any Contradiction. Whereby you may
perceive, that the Archetypon, or thing Principally prefigured by that Sea, is
Christ's burial: and Water in Baptism, is but as the Antitype, or thing less
principally prefigured thereby.

If then you shall compare the Type, or Figure, with the Thing prefigured, as
Archetype, or Principal thing figured or prefigured, we are bound by
Christian verity to believe Christ's burial is infinitely more excellent than
either the Type in the Old Testament, which was the Sea they passed through; or
yet than Water in Baptism in the New Testament, as the Antitype thereof. But
if you compare the Type of the Old Testament with the Antitype or figure of the
New, then can nothing be more false than is this your general Proposition,
affirming that Figures and Signs are inferior to the thing prefigured, as you
may see in the Apostles Example. The Sea under Moses, a figure of Baptism
under Christ. Athanasius Interpret. Parabol. de Baptismo post quaest. 103. Tom.
2. Baptisma secundum erat Mare rubrum. (...).
For as the Sea was there (says Athanasius) so is Water here. Yet was not the
Element of Water in the Sea of less worth in Substance, than is the Element of
Water in the Font of Baptism; both having equally in them the Substantial
Properties of Water.

Our next Example, in the same Chapter, is this: They (to wit, the Jews) ate
of the same spiritual meat, and drank of the same spiritual drink;
(namely) Christ's Body and Blood; the one whereof was prefigured by Manna, the
other by the Water out of the Rock in the Old Testament. Body of Christ is
configured by Bread; and his Blood by Wine in the Eucharist, which is the
Sacrament of the New Testament; as has been proved from Fathers, and Others,
in a full See above B. 5. Chap. 2. Sect. 2.
Section. And for this cause Gregory Nazianzen, Greg. Nazian. Orat. 42. (...).
I dare say (says he) that the Legal Passover was a Figure of a figure; but
somewhat more obscure. So he. Which scarce any of your Doctors dare say, lest
that the Eucharisticall Oblation should be judged a Figure of Christ's
Sacrifice, and not the Proper Sacrificing of Christ. Now then, Compare Manna
and Bread with Christ's Body; and the Water of the Rock, and Water of
Baptism, with his Blood, and your Consequence is most Divine: viz. The Thing
prefigured excels, beyond all Comparison, the Signs thereof. But yet again
Compare the Signs and Antitypes, viz. Manna with Bread, and the Water of the
Rock with Wine in the Cup: and in their Natures and Substances, the one does
not exceed the other.

You will then ask, If the Sacraments of both Testaments Antitypes, that is,
Correspondent Signs of the same Body and Blood of Christ; wherein then
consists the Excellency of the Sacraments of the New, if it be not in
respect of their natural and substantial properties? We were about to tell
you, namely, that Although these former Sacraments of both Testaments be but
Corporal food, and drink; yet have the Sacraments of the Gospel a threefold
Privilege above the other. The First is in respect of the Efficacy of the
Signification. Signs of the Old being Prophetical, and darkly promising
Christ's Body and Blood to come. But, Signs of the New are Historical,
poynting out, unto life, Christ already come, and crucified in his Body, and
his Blood shed. The Second, in respect of the Efficacy of Application, and
Exhibition of both these, arising from the former Ground. For Saint Paul said
more effectually, Christ, who dyed for me, and gave himself for me; than any
Israelite under the Law could say, Christ, who shall dye for me, and shall
give himself for me. The Third is the Excellency of Duration, for those
Signs as Shadows, had an end long since: Whereas the Evangelicall Paul did
intimate in his speech of the Eucharist, You show the Lord's death until his
coming again, 1 Cor. 11. Now then that you see what is, indeed, the
Betternesse between the figure and thing figured, may you not say it had been
better that your Disputers had forborne their Objection? From Typical
Scriptures we descend to Prophetical. *

CHAP. IV.
That the objected Prophetical Scriptures of the old Testament are by your
Disputers violently wrested, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice in the Mass.

THe first, Mal. 5. 1. is objected by your Cardinal in this manner: [From the
rising of the Sun to the going down of the same, my name shall be great
among the Gentiles, and in every place shall Sacrifice, and Oblation be offered
to my name.] This, says your Cardinal, See the Testimony following.
Is a notable Testimony for the Sacrifice of the Mass.

BE so good, as to set down the State of the Controversy your selves, Insigne
testimonium pro Sacrificio Missae, Mal. 5. 1. in his verbis [Ab ortu solis
usque ad occasum magnum est nomen meum in Gentibus, and in omni loco
sacrificatur and offertur nomini meo oblatio munda: quia magnum est nomen meum
in Gentibus, dicit Dominus.] Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. Tota controversia est,
An Malachias loquatur de Sacrificio proprie dicto, quale est in Ecclesia
Eucharistia, an vero de Sacrificio improprie dicto, quales sint lauds, and
Orationes, etc. Bellarm. Ibid. Argum. 1. Propheta utitur voce Minhhah, quod est
Sacrificium absolute, absque adjuncto, ut cum dicitur, Sacrificium laudis, etc.
Argum. 2. Vox [Munda] opponitur immundis oblationibus Iudaeorum, quae non
dicuntur immundae ex part offerentium tantum, quia opponit illis oblationem:
non enim Munda diceretur in omni loco, cum in pluribus sint mali Ministri.
Argum. 3. Dicitur [Non acciptiam munus a manibus vestris.] Hinc colligimus, non
solum mundam esse hanc nostram, sed and novam -- Argum, 4. ex antithesi.
Contemptus Hebraeorum erat in publicis Sacrificijs, non in privato cultu
tantum. Ergo gloria oblationum apud Christianos erit in publico Sacrificio.
Argum. 5. Opponit Malachias non omni populo, sed Sacerdotibus tantum veteris
Legis, non omnes Christianos, sed certos homines, qui Sacerdotibus succedunt.
Ergo non loquitur de spirituali, sed de Sacrificio proprie dicto.
The whole Controversy is, whether this Scripture spoke of a Sacrifice
properly so called, or of an Improper Sacrifice, such as are Prayers and
Thanksgiving, etc. So you. You contend for a Proper Sacrifice, and We deny
it: and now that we are to grapple together, we shall first charge you with
alleging a corrupt Translation, as the ground of your false Interpretation.


YOur Romish Vulgar Translation (which was decreed in the Council of Trent to
be the only Authentical, and which thereupon you are enjoined to use in all
your Disputations; and not this only, but bound also thereunto by an Oath in
the Bull of Pius Quartus, not to transgress that Decree) does deliver us this
Text [In every place is sacrificed and offered to my name a pure Oblation,
etc.] without any mention of the word Incense at all: whereas (which your
Cardinal Bellarm. In Hebraea, and Graeca Editione sic Legimus [Incensum
offertur nomini meo, and Sacrificium mundum.] Quo supra.
confesses) Both the Hebrew and Greek Text has it thus; [Incense is offered
in my name, and a pure offering, etc.] and that More plainly, says your
Septuaginta apertius. Valent. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. page 526.
Valenta. Which warranteth us to call your Vulgar Translation false, as we
shall now prove, and you perceive, A Lion is known by his claw, so your Vulgar
Translation may be discerned by this one Clause, wherein the word, Incense, is
omitted quite.

If ye will permit us, without being prejudicated by your Fathers of Trent, to
try the Cause by impartial Judges, which are the Ancient Fathers of Primitive
Times; especially now, when you yourselves are so urgent in pressing us with
multitudes of their Testimonies, for Defense of your Romish Sacrifice, Malachy:
Look then upon the Bellar. Vocem illam [Incensum] interpretatur Tertull.
Orationem, ut and ante eum Iren. lib. 4. cont. Haeres. cap. 33. Incensa autem

Marginalls, and you shall find mention of the word, Incense, (according to the
Hebrew and Greek Texts) in the very same objected Testimonies of Tertullian,
Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Augustine. Notwithstanding, we
should not be so vehement, in condemning your Romish Translation in this point,
if the matter, now in hand, did not challenge us thereunto: the word, Incense,
being sufficient in it self to satisfy all your Objections taken from the
Sentences of Fathers, and urged by virtue of the word, Sacrifice, and Oblation,
as will appear.

That the Text of Malachy does not imply a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist,
by the Expositions of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II.
TWo words we find in this Prophet, concerning the new Testament: One is,
Incense, in the Text now alleged; the other is the word, Levites. The first in
Chap. 1. verse. 3. [In every place there shall be an Offering of Incense, and a
Sacrifice, etc.] You All affirm of Prayers, Praises, and holy Actions, that
they are Spiritual, and no proper Sacrifices. But the Fathers, by you objected,
(to wit, Tertull. Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Augustine) do
See the preceding Marginalls.
Expound Incense to signify these Spiritual Duties, which are unproperly
called Incense. Therefore may we as justly conceive, that the word, Sacrifice,
used by them, and applied to the service of God in the New Testament, was meant
Improperly; and that so much the rather, because your Cardinal has no
Objection out of the Fathers for his advantage in the word, Sacrifice, which
he loses not by the word Incense, from point to point.

For to the first Objection we oppose, saying, The word Incense, is likewise
used without See in the Testimonies above cited, for it is called absolutely
Incense, and not Incense of Prayer, etc.
Addition. To the second, We accordingly say, Incense was meant also to be
Pure: for you will not imagine, that God would promise to his faithful Impure
things. To the third, It is as well said concerning Incense, as of Sacrifice
(against the Jews, verse 10.) I will not receive any offerings at your hands:
Isaiah 1. 13.
Incense is an abomination unto me. To the fourth, The same Godless Jews did
jointly contemn Gods worship made by Incense, as by Sacrifice, except you
shall think it credible, that the same men should be both devout and profane
in one prescribed Service of God. To the last, Malachy in the same Sentence
(and as it were with the same breath) equally takes exceptions to the Jewish
Priests, in both Sacrifice, and Incense. Therefore, as Incense, so accordingly
the word, Sacrifice, was used Improperly of the Fathers. Do you not now see
what reason your Cardinal had, to make choice of a corrupt Text, wanting the
word Incense? which he peradventure foresaw would prove as bitter as
Coloquintida in his Pottage.

The second word in Malachy is [Levite,] I will purge the sons of Levi; which
was spoken (as your Cardinal Bellar. Postquam dixerat Malachias [Offertur
nomini meo oblatio munda] Exponit ca. 3. a quibus offerenda sit munda oblatio:
Purgabit, inquit, F^lios Levi: ubi, per Filios Levi, non possunt intelligi
Levitae veteris Testamenti -- sed nostri Sacerdotes. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap.
10.. Quintum.
confesses) of the Ministers of the New Testament. Well then, did the Prophet
call the Ministry and Service of the New Testament, Pure Sacrifice? And did
he not in the like manner call Purged Levites? as also some of the Ancient
Augustine, Ambrose, Cyprian, Leo.
Fathers (you know) used to do: and as your Church, in degrading of Archbishop
Cranmer from his order of Mr. Fox Acts and Monuments page 2117. Levitico
ordine te privamus.
Deaconship once did. Therefore both alike were used Improperly, in imitation
of this Prophet, and also of that in Isa. 66.
Isaiah, I will send them Priests and Levites.

That the Text of the Prophet Malachy does confute the Romish Pretense of
Sacrifice, even by the objected Testimonies
PErmit you us, for brevity-sake, to contrive this Section into Ob. and Sol.
your Cardinals Objections, and our Solutions or Answers. I. Ob. Sacrifice is
called pure always, and in all places, Ergo, Christ's Body. Sol. And
Chrysostom (who is Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95. (objected) Malachias appellat
Thymiama ^urum, (...) pieces.
objected) terms Prayers, Pure Incense (meaning when, or wheresoever.) II.
Ob. The word, Sacrifice, is spoken of in Malachy, without an Adjunct, as to say
the Sacrifice of praise, etc. for these are improperly called Sacrifices, Ergo,
etc. Sol. Yet First, Tertul. Ob. by Bellarm. lib. 3. contr. Marcion. ex Psalm.
57. In Ecclesijs benedicite Dominum Deum, ut pariter co^curreret Malachiae
prophetia, In omni loco Sacrificium mundum: Gloriae silicet relatio, and
Benedictio, and Laus, and hymni. [Which words Bellarmine restrains to Prayers
and Praises only, in the Mass, whereas Tertullian speaks of Prayers in
general.] Again, Lib. 4. advers. Marc. a little after the beginning. Dicente
Malachia, Sacrificium mundu^, scilicet, simplex oration de conscientia pura.
[Where he expounds Pure Sacrifice to be Prayer.]
Tertullian (objected) expounded the same word, Sacrifice, to signify
Benedictions, and Praises. And Secondly, Eusebius. Demonst lib. 1. cap 6. [In omni
loco Incensum and Sacrificium, etc.] Quid aliud significat quam orationis
Incensum, and Sacrificium, quod [mundum] dicitur? est enim non per cruores, sed
per pias actiones summo D^o offerendum.
Eusebius (objected) calls this Pure Sacrifice, Pious Actions and Prayers.
Which your Cardinal could not Answer, but with a mavelous and miserable
Illusion. III. Ob. By the word, Bellar. Resp. Non quasi Oration sit ipsum
Incensum, seu Sacrificium, sed illud quod per Orationem, id est, per verba
Consecrationis perficitur. Solent enim Patres verba Consecrationis orationes,
seu mysticas preces interpretati. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. [First, fondly,
for the words of Consecration contain in them no term of Prayer: And
secondly, falsely, for the Fathers did not call these words Prayer. Both which
have been amply discussed.]
Sacrifice, were not meant Spiritual Sacrifices, etc. Sol. Yet Hieron.
(objected) Malach. 1. Vt sciant Iudaei carnalibus Victimis spitituales
successuras. Thymiama, hoc est, Orationes Sanctorum offerendas, Oblationem
mundam, ut est in ceremonijs Christianorum. Bellar. Licet per Incensum
intelligat orationem, tamen per Sacrificium intelligit Eucharistiam: dicit enim
offerri in Ceremonijs Christianorum. [Be it so, but the Question is, whether
the Action of the Eucharist be not called spiritual, that is (as is confessed)
an Improper Sacrifice.]
Hierome (objected) expressly names the Sacrifice, in Malachy, Spiritual.

To come to your Cardinals principal Reason. IV. Ob. The Jewish Sacrifices
were called Unclean, not in respect of the Offerers only, but of the
Offerings; intimating thereby, that this Offering in the new Testament can be
no less than the very Body of Christ. Sol. Irenaeus (objected) plainly
puts the difference to be made, by Malachy, between the Sacrifices, as they
were the Offerings of the wicked Jews, and the Sacrifices of godly Christians;
and he gives this Reason, because Irenaeus (ob.) advers. Haeres lib 4. cap.
34 speaking as well of Sacrifices in Iudaico populo, as in Ecclesia, says; Non
Sacrificia sanctificant hominem, sed Conscientia pura ejus, qui offert, etc.]
Then of Eleemosynae, Which the Apostle calls Hostiam acceptabilem* [Opportet
nos oblationem Deo facere in sententia pura. And then, Ecclesia offert
oblationem hanc Fabricatori puram, offerens ei cum gratiarum Action ex
creatura ejus. Iudaei autem non offerunt, quia manus eorum plenae sanguine, etc.
The Jews (says he) offered up their Oblations with wicked hearts, but the
Christians perform theirs with pure Consciences. And that the Jewish
Sacrifices were not rejected for themselves, but for the impiety of their
Sacrificers; your own Jesuit Ribera Ies. Ad loca Scripturae adducta respondere
Apostoli. Apud S. Clementem. lib. 6. Constable. Apost. C. 22. in hunc modum.
Recusabat Deus populi Sacrificia saepenumero in eum peccantis, atque
existimantis Sacrificijs ^um, and non p^enitentia placatum i^i. Idem docet
Iraeneus lib. 4. c. 33. In Hos. 6. number. 24.
Ribera confirms both by the Constitutions of Pope Clement, and also by this
Testimony of Irenaeus. A Truth so evident to your Divines of Collen, that they
presume Antididag. Colon. Tract. de Sacrif. Missae. De Consecratione. Quis
ignorant vetera Patrum Sacrificia, quae Christum sigurabant, vel ob id quod Deus
ea praecepisset, per se munda fuisse? Nihilominus tamen frequentius immunda
vocantur in Scripturis, non ratione sui, sed propter malam voluntatem
offerentium.
None to be ignorant, that the Sacrifices of the old Testament were all clean
and pure, because God has ordained them, and they became impure by the wicked
hearts of the Offerers. And Tertullian gives the same Observation for the
Reason, Tetull. li. 3. advers Ma^cion. Sacrificia rejecta, quia non secundum
Dei religionem celebranda, sua jam, non Dei secerant. page 160. And, Sacrifica
spiritualia accepta, which he names above, Cor contribulatum, laudem, etc.
Lib. adversus Iudaeos.
I will no more of [your] Sacrifice, and not of [my] Sacrifice.

But you will say, Some of the Fathers spoke directly of the Proper Sacrifice
of the new Testament. We answer, that as they apply it to the Eucharist, they
meant no proper Sacrifice, as the Subject, but only as the Object therein,
which was that of the Cross. In which respect Chrysostom. (objected) in Psalm.
95. Ex hostia prima mensa mystica coeleste Sacrificium, summeque venerandum.
Est aute^ in nobis varia differentia: Lex multas habet Hostias, Gratia nova
unam -- Vis scire Victimas, quas Ecclesia habet? -- quando fit Sacrificium
mundum and immaculatum? audi Scripturam Tibi palam exponentem hanc
differentiam. Et Sacrificium, quod antea dixi spirituale, illud mysticum donum,
in quo Apostolus Ephesians. 5. Christus tradidit se ipsum pro Nobis Deo Sacrificium.
Chrysostom (objected) calls it that Sacrifice, whereof Saint Paul writes,
saying, [Christ gave himself up a Sacrifice for his Church.] Ephesians. 5. Lastly,
Cyprian (objected) calls it the Cypr. (object:) ex ^ib. 1. cont. Iudaeos cap.
16. Novum Sacrificium, Sacrificium Laudis.
New Sacrifice of Praise: which is, you know, a Spiritual, and no Corporal or
Proper Sacrifice.

The second Prophetical Text (as is pretended) is Psalm. 72. 16. concerning a
[Handfull of Corn in the Top of the Mountains:] objected to prove a Sacrifice
in the Romish Mass; but yet as very
OF this Corn your Psalm 7^. juxta Heb. [Et erit pugillus frumenti in
summitatibus montium] vulg. Lat [Et erit fitmamentu^ in terra in summis
Montium.] Galatinus de Arcani^ Cath. Veritatis, li. 10. cap. 5. Hoc est, dicit
Chaldae a Translatio Rabbi Ionathae, Et erit sacrificium panis in summis
montium. -- Cum ergo ait, Erit placenta frumenti in terra, in capite montium,
vult dicere, quod placenta panis ^^et Sacrificium in capitibus Sacerdotum, qui
sunt Ecclesia. Haec ibi -- Nec mirum de sapientibus an iquis Judaeorum Messiam

Thesaur. Cath. lib. 6. Art. 4. page 679. He adds other Authors, to wit, P.
Galatinus, Claud. Sanctesius, and Genebrard. in hunc Psalm. Coccius ibid Art.
16. pa. 763.
Disputers Coccius, Duraeus, Sanctesius, Genebrard, out of Galatinus, and He
out of the Chaldee Translation, and other his supposed Jewish Rabbis, have
observed a Cake on the top of the Mountains. But what of this? This Cake,
forsooth, was by their Doctrine a Prophetical prediction of the Romish
Wafer-Cake, which is heaved up over the head of the Priest for a Sacrifice. And
this is called, by Master Brerely, Master Brerely in his Protestants Apol.
noting Duraeus the Jesuit to have urged the same out of Galatinus.
A most strong Argument, in behalf of the said Doctrine. * Yea, and your
Jesuit Suarez in 3. Thom. Disp. 74. 2. Adduci solent verba illa Psalmi 71, ut
in Hebr. erit Placenta -- qui Psalmus fine dubio de Messia scriptus est.
Suarez seems to like this Cake, for he also will needs have a lick at it.
* But we must tell you, that your Galatinus is too credulous, and that his
Rabbinicall Abstracts are no better than the Gibeonites old torn Shoes, and
moldy Bread, seeming to have come from far, even from old Rabbis, when as
they were invented and brought from their latter Rabbis and Glozers, as it
were from the next bordering Countries: because your Author Galatinus Rabbinish
prediction of that Cake) is branded, for such like his Conceits, with the
mark of a Vain man, by your judicious Senensis Biblioth. lib. 2..
Traditiones. Non possum satis mirari studium Petri Galatini, qui -- in eam
Vanitatem devenit, ut doceret opera Thalmudica in Latinum ver^i opo^^^re, and
public^ in Scholis Christianorum explica^i.
Senensis. And the Chaldee Paraphrase, which talks of your Sacrificed Cake,
is rejected, as being a Corrupt Puddle of Jewish Fables; and fabulous in this
very Point, by your great Roman Dictator Bellar. in Psalm. 71. ver. 16. Scio
quod Paulus Burgensis ex Paraphrasi Chaldaica adferat ad probandum hoc in loco
Sacrificium Missae: sed scio etiam qua^ multis fabulis Iudaicis Pharaphrasis
illa scateat, ideo piget ex lacunis Expositionu^ Iudaicarum haurire, etc.
Bellarmine.

Which we speak not, as being offended to hear any Rabbi calling that, which
is in the hand of your Priest, and above his head, A Cake, which in your Romish
Phrase is called, a Wafer-Cake: for if it be indeed and truly a Cake, then is
not it Accidents only, but has still in it the Substance of Bread. And so
farewell your Helena of Trent, called Transubstantiation. Now because the
Sacrifice can be no better than the matter thereof will permit it, it follows
that the Sacrifice is not Properly the Body of Christ, but the Element of
Bread. And thus your Authors (after their laborious kneading and moulding,
their greedy longing, and their sweetly chewing hereof) are at length in a
manner choked with their own Cake.

CHALLENGE,
A Bold Romanist of late, as it seems, not well disgesting this Cake, has in
his dispersed As I received it from a Right Honorable Person, the Lord C^^:
Papers divulged me in this manner: MY Lord of Durham says of the former
Reason, that it is called of Master Brerely a [Most So he. Flatly and sharply,
as you see, charging me with a palpable untruth, and for Trial referring
himself to the Book it self; and I Subscribe, saying, Sit Liber Iudex. The
Book is Master Brerely his Apology in his Treatise 1. Sect. 4. Subd. 12. Page
(as the Romish Seducer himself has truly quoted it) 156. where Master
Brereley his words (for I hope they are not flowne out of the Book since) are
expressly these: This therefore so plain foresaid Prediction, made by the
ancient Rabbis before Christ's time in behalf [MOST STRONG ARGVMENT] in
behalf of the said Doctrines. So he.

Therefore do not I know what to impute unto this Romanist, because of his
denial of these words, A most strong Argument, rather than the spirit of a
Strong Delusion, issuing from the worst kind of malice, whereof the Adage
speaks, Veritas Odium parit. Yet shall this piece of Falsehood be accounted
scarce a Venial Sin among you, being spoken to the disgrace of a Protestant,
and in Defense of a Romish Priest. The best is, that the Seducer seems to be
ashamed of the Absurdity of this your Rabbinish Objection, which he was so
loath to acknowledge.

A Second Vindication, against another Sinister Romish Detraction; showing that
the other Scriptures, which are said to be Prophetical, are not Iudicially
objected by your Cardinal. SECT. VI.
YOur Cardinal has Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 9. In 1. Reg. cap. 2.
Sacrificium successurum Aaronico, interpretatur Sacerdotio and Sacrificio
Christianorum. Prove. 9. Sapientia posuit hostias, miscuit Vinum, De Sacrificio
Domini. Isaiae 19. Aegyptij colent Deum in hostijs, id est, Gentiles vero Deo
Sacrificia offerent. Isaiae 66. Assumam ex eis Sacerdotes and Levitas; de
Sacerdotibus Christianis: and Iere. 33. De Sacerdotibus and Levitis. Dan. 8.
12. Vbi Antichristus tollet juge Sacrificium, de Antiocho, ut gerebat figuram
Antichristi, qui Apoc. 13. Kemnitius respond. Intelligi posse de Sacrificio
Spiritual, and praedicatione verbi, and administratione Sacramentorum. Sed
ista omnia vanissima sunt. Scriptura nusquam appellat Sacrificium absolute, and
praesertim in numero singulari, quod non est proprie dictum Sacrificium. Quare
Daniel cum vocat Judge Sacrificium, loquitur de vero and proprie dicto
Sacrificio.
collected diverse Texts of the Old Testament, which the Fathers apply to the
Eucharist Sacrifice, thereby concluding, that they judged the Encharist to be a
Proper Sacrifice. These places have been thought to an importunate Romanist
worthy the Answering, which I purposely passed by, as superfluous, and such as
were effectually enough satisfied in the Confutation of your other Objections,
made out of the Figure and Type of Melchisedeth, and Prophecy of Malachy.

Now our Task must be, to show the Injudiciousnesse of your Cardinal, in
urging such Testimonies of the Fathers, Proper Sacrifice; who considered not,
that most of such like Applications, used by the Fathers, as Proper
Interpretations, were no other than Allegorical Allusions, and Assimulations.
Wherein we durst Appeal to your Cardinal himself, who if he had thought
these kinds of Applications to be Argumentative, might have made five more
Chapters of the like Allusions. This our Answer may be exemplified and
illustrated by the like liberty and liberality of Speech used by the same
Fathers in their Witty and Elegant Allusions to Baptism, Lauretus Hieron.
Lauretus Sylva Allegoriarum Tit. Aqua. Cites ten Fathers. Aquae Marah, quae
per Lignum factae sunt dulces. Exodus 15. Baptismus. Aquae usque talos. Ezekiel.
47. Baptismus mundans (...). Aqua in pelvi. Iud. 6. Baptismi gratia. Aqua
contradictionis. Psalm. 80. Est Baptismus ijs, qui ficte accedunt. Aqua, in
quam missi sunt pulveres vituli, Exodus 32. Est Baptismus, ubi omne peccatum
conteritur. Potest etiam Aqua significare Baptismum, and Spiritualia dona
gratiae. [And he cites above 40. Texts in the old Testament.]
gives you diverse Instances from the testimonies of Ten Fathers, applying the
Water of Marah, Exodus 15. The Water which took men up to the Anckles, Ezekiel.
24. The Water in a Basin, Iud. 6. The Waters of Contradiction, Psalm. 80. The
Waters wherein the dust of the Golden Calfe was thrown, Exodus 32. Each one of
which Waters they apply unto Baptism. And, being not contented with these, he
refers you unto above Forty places more of the Old Testament, which may have
the like Relation to Baptism; none whereof can be properly called a Literal
Explication, but only an Allegorical Application of Scriptures.

The Second Argument of his Injudiciousnesse is discernable in this, that all
that is alleged proves no more than that which Protestants confess, to wit,
that the Eucharist may be called a Sacrifice, either Eucharisticall, or
Latreuticall, in a Spiritual Sense, as the Fathers do after expound themselves.

Thirdly, to come to that wherein your Cardinal is most peremptory, saying
that the [Iuge Sacrificium, that is, Continual Sacrifice] prophesied of,
should be taken away by Antichrist, cannot mean any Spiritual and improper
Sacrifice. Proper Sacrifice of the Mass. But we say that the Fathers
understood it of the proper Spiritual worship of Christians. Now whom would
you wish to be Moderator between us? We guess some Romish Doctor should be
the man; and above all, some one out of the School of the Jesuits; and of
these, such an one must be most fit, who is known to be of a more moderate
Temper than the most of them. Behold the man, even your Jesuit Pererius Ies.
in Dan. 12. Anti-Christus tollet Judge Sacrificium, vel, ut est Graece,
Endelechismum, quod vocabulum sonat Continuitatem, nimirum Divini cultus, qui
in Ecclesia Dei omni tempore exhibetur: sic enim interpretatur Hieronymus,
Theodoretus. Et hunc Dei continuum cultu^ appellavit Angelus Judge Sacrificium
-- QVANQVAM id nominis praecipue refersi potest ad sanctissimum Missae
Sacrificium -- and hoc r^te nominatur Sacrificium juge. Nam non uno duntaxat in
loco, nec bis tantum per singulos dies, mane and vesperi, ut illud Iudaicum,
sed in omni loco and omni tempore Deo offertur. Idem Lib. 9 in Dan. Cap. 8.
Gregorius tricesimo Moralium, Cap. 12. Omnia verba, de Antiocho, explicamus de
Anti-Christo -- Judge Sacrificium tollit, quia studium sanctae conversationis
Ecclesiae in eis quos caeperit, interrumpit.
Pererius, who coming to explain this [Iuge Sacrificium] Hierome, and
Theodoret, understood thereby the Divine worship of Christians, in general.
And that Pope Gregory expounds it of the Christian Conversation of Life,
which shall be interrupted by Antichrist. So he. But yet the same Jesuit,
perceiving that this reached not home to the Sacrifice of your Mass, straineth
courtesy with the Fathers, and without any their Authority, or rather against
it, comes in with his [QVANQVAM:] Notwithstanding (says he) this name of,
Continual Sacrifice, may be referred to the Sacrifice of the Mass, because
that is not as the Sacrifice of the Jews; in one place only, or at morn and
night, but continually in all places, and at all times. So he. Which any Jew
(if he heard it) would think were unadvisedly spoken, saying of their Jewish
Continual Sacrifice, that it Continued to be offered both in their Morning and
Evening worship; whereas the time of your Romish is prefixed but in the Morning
Service only, and therefore cannot be so justly called [Iuge] or Continual,
as the Jewish was; because nothing can be called [Iuge] in respect of Place,
but only in respect of Time. *.

CHAP. V.
Of our Second Examination of this Controversy, by the Judgment of Ancient
Fathers, showing
Our General Proposition. The ancient Fathers never called the Eucharist,
Properly, a Sacrifice: proved by many Demonstrations.
Subject of the Eucharist; some from the parity of like speeches of Fathers, as
well in other Sacraments, Acts, and Adjuncts, as in these which are belonging
to the Eucharist.

The first Demonstration,
THat Ancient Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice, even before
Consecration, we have it confessed asseverantly by your own Maldonat. Ob.
Irenaeum lib 4. cap. 32. and 34. Scribit Christianos Deo offerre primitias
creaturaru^ panem and vinum -- Dicebatur etiam sacrificare homo profanus, qui
Sacerdoti tradebat victimam, ut eam pro se sacrificaret: non quod illa traditio
esset Sacrificium. Ita locuti sunt etiam Christiani antiqui, ut constat ex
verbis Cypriani in Sermon. de Eleemos. Locuples matrona sine Sacrificio in
Dominicum venien^. Nec necesse est (ut Irenaeus loquitur) de proprio
Sacrificio, quia nefas est credere Ecclesiam obtulisse rem ullam corpoream and
terrestr^m Deo post abrogata omnia hujusmodi Sacrificia terrena. Maldon. loco
citato. Accipiendo Sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negari non debet,
panem and vinum aliquo modo in Missa offerri, and proinde pertinere ad rem
praesentem: nam cum ante Consecrationem dicimus [Suscipe, Sancte Pater, hanc
tuam immaculatam Hostiam] certe pronomen, Hanc, de monstrat ad sensum id quod
tunc manibus tenemus, id autem panis est. Et similes sunt in Liturgia non
paucae sententiae, quae panem offerri aperte sane demonstrant. Denique veteres
Patres passim idem tradunt. Iren. lib. 4. cap. 32. dicit Ecclesiam offerre
Sacrificium ex creaturis. Et Cyprian. lib. 2. Ep. 3. Christum obtulisse Calicem
vino and aqua mixtam. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Respondeo ut.
Jesuit, where he will have you furthermore to observe, that Bread and Wine,
before Consecration, is called an Immaculate Sacrifice, even in your Roman
Mass. And that the Primitive Fathers called Bread and Wine, Sacrifice, after
Consecration also, we have likewise proved in two full See above Chap. 3.
Sect. 2.
Sections: which your Cardinal is bound to acknowledge, who, to prove that
Melchisedech Sacrificed Bread and Wine, produced the Testimonies of Ambrose,
August. Chrysostom. Oecumenius, and Theophylact, to conclude them to have been
Figures of the Eucharist, which we desire you to carry still in mind, until
we

Hereupon we demand, whether you think that Bread and Wine, in the Eucharist,
can be called of Christians a Sacrifice Properly, either before, or after
Consecration? No (says one Valent. Ies. objicienti Melchisedechum obtulisse
panem and vinum tantum. Resp. Sacerdotium Christi secundum ordinem,
Melchisedech -- Etiam ratione rui oblatae, non quatenus oblatione illius
substantiae determinatae, scilicet panis and vini, exercebatur. Lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 4.
Jesuit) because it is not agreeable to our Priesthood. No (says a Bellarmin.
respondens quaestioni; An cum solus Panis mutatur, si propri^ sacrifica^etur?
Inquit, Id absurdissimum esset: tum haberet Ecclesia Sacrificium inanimum, and
vilius multo quam habuerint olim. Hebraei. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Sed haec.
Second) because it were most absurd that the Church of Christ should have a
livelesse Sacrifice, and consequently more vile than was the Jewish. No (says
a Nefas est, cr^dere Ecclesiam obtulisse rem ullam corpoream and terrestrem Deo
post abrogata omnia hujusmodi Sacrificia terrena. Maldonat. Lib. de 7. Sacram.
Tom. 1. de Eucharist. part. 3.. Primum Argumentum.
Third) because it were an heinous impiety now, after the abrogation of the
terrene Sacrifices of the (says a Salmeron. Communis sensus est omnium
Christianorum, non esse aliud Sacrificium quam Corpus and Sanguinem Christi --
At si panis esset Sacrificium, sequeretur, quod res inanimata sacrificaretur --
Et quod summa Lattia esset circa panem and vinum. Tom. 9. Tract. 12. Quinta.
Fourth) for it is the judgment of all Christians, that there is no Sacrifice
in Christian Religion, but the Body and Blood of Christ: because otherwise the
Act of Sacrificing thereof, being a Divine worship, should be exercised upon
Bread and Wine. So they. We would be glad to take the Apostle of Christ to be
our Guide, for our better security, he (as is likewise Bellarmin. Apostolus
declarat, non esse terrenum aliquid quod offert Christus, si esset super
terram, ex Heb. 8. 4. Et ostendit nunc meliores hostias offerr^ Lib. 1. de
Missa, cap. 6. sect;. Resp. quid. [See above Chap. 3. Sect. 2.]
confessed) teaches, that God now is not to be worshipped, by way of
Sacrifice, with any outward thing.

Oh that your Divines would exercise their quils in publishing Good speed in
all their Writings. Notwithstanding, upon consideration of the Premises, we
are enforced to complain of the Inconsionableness of your Cardinal, who, to
prove a proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, did (as you may remember) produce
the Testimonies of five Fathers, wherein that, which they called a Sacrifice,
they expressed to be Bread and Wine; which by the joint and consonant
Confession of the Cardinal himself, and other prime Jesuits of his own
society, cannot be held to be Proper Sacrifices, without Absurdity and Impiety.
And the like obliquity of Judgment you may find in your Rhemish Divines, in
Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. 19.
alleging the Testimonies of Irenaeus, for proof of the Sacrifice of your
Mass, which your Jesuit Maldonate has truly observed to have been spoken of
Bread Wine, even See above at (a.)
before Consecration.

One word more. By this you may perceive another proof of the Idiome of
Ancient Fathers, in Extending the word [Sacrifice] beyond it is literal sense:
which (beside the former) the last annexed Testimony of To these former, we
add another objected Testimony of Augustine, Lib. de side ad Pet. Diac. cap.
19. Null^tenus dubites unigenitum Dei filium obtulisse hostiam Deo pro nobis,
cui nunc cum Patre and Spiritu Sancto offerimus Sacrificium panis and vini, in
side and charitate, in Catholica Ecclesia per universum mundum.
Augustine confirms, showing, that now there is in this our Sacrifice no
other Subject but Bread and Wine. This may serve for the present, concerning
the true and proper Subject of the Eucharist, Bread and Wine. We in the next
place are to examine the pretended Subject, which your Church will have to be
the Body and Blood of Christ.

Our Second Demonstration, That the Ancient Fathers held not the Body and Blood
of Christ to be the proper Subject matter of the
HOw comes the Body and Blood of Christ to be a Proper Sacrifice in the
Eucharist? Your Cardinal will tell us, to wit, Bread and Wine are consecrated,
and by Consecration made the Body and Blood of Christ: so that now Bellarm.
lib. 1 de Missa, cap. 27.. His igitur -- In Missae Sacrificio requiritur ut res
profana sit sacra: sic hic, ubi panis convertitur in corpus Christi --.
Respondeo, etc. Non panis, sed quod expane factum proprie sacrificatur. [For
still the Question is that of Lombards; Quaeritur si quod gerit Sacerdos, sit
proprie sacrificium. Lombard. lib. 4. Did. 12. lit. G.
Not Bread (says he) but the Body of Christ is the thing sacrificed. This is
plain dealing, and as much as if he had said, If there be in the Eucharist no
Transubstantiation of the Bread into Christ's Body, by Consecration, then cannot
Christ's Body be a proper Sacrifice. But that there is no such
Transubstantiation, or Corporal Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, has
been proved to be the Judgment of Ancient Fathers, by many Demonstrations
thorow-out the third and fourth Books. A stronger Argument there needs not.

Our Third Demonstration is, Because the objected places of Antiquity, for
proof of a Representative Sacrifice, Properly so called, do not point out
anywhere the Body of Christ, as the proper Subject, but only as the Object of
the Sacrifice spoken of. SECT. III.
Our Distinction is this. These words, The Body and Blood of Christ, as they
are applied to the Eucharist, in the name of Sacrifice, may admit of a double
Acception; one is to take them Subjectively, as being the proper Material
Subject of this Sacrament; the other is to understand them Objectively, that
is, to account the Body and Blood of Christ, as they were the Sacrifice of
Christ upon the Cross, to be only the Object of a Christian Celebration,
according to the Direction and Institution of Christ, saying, Do this in
remembrance of me. Your Romish Church professes the Body and Blood to be the
proper Subject; We nay, but the proper Object of our Celebration. This
Distinction, well learned, will be unto our Reader as an Ariadne's thread, to
wind him out of the Labyrinth of all Obscurities, and seeming Repugnancies of
Ancient Fathers; out of all the confused Subtilties, and equivocall Resolutions
of your Romish Disputers; and out of the Perplexities, wherewith some
Protestants also may

The Demonstration it self, Because the Eucharist, being only Commemorative
and Representative, cannot be a Proper Sacrifice: answering the Romish
Objection taken from the Sacrifices under the Law. SECT. IV.
THat it cannot be called properly a Sacrifice, which is only for
Commemoration and Representation, is the Conclusion of your own Bellarm. Si
sola repraesentatio Sacrificij crucis, tum non potest dici oblatio in hunc
modum: Offero tibi Pater, etc. ac a Patribus Oblatio dicitur. Lib 1. de Missa,
cap. 15.. Quarto.
Cardinal; although it cannot be denied, but that Improperly it may be so
called, as well as you may call the Image of Christ crucified, the Crucifix.
But, to come to your Objection, your Rhemists A^notat. in Luke 22^ and Bellarm.
Finis erat Sacrificioru^ praecedentium repraesentare Sacrificium Crucis, ut
futurum, and sicut vetera Sacrificia non amittebant veram and propriam rationem
Sacrificij, ex eo quod essent repraesentativa: ita nec Sacrificum Eucharistiae,
amittit propriam Sacrificij ratione^, propter Commemorationem. Lib. 1. de
M^ssa. cap. 12.. Q^od vero.
Rhemish Divines and Romish Cardinal are very earnest and instant in proving,
that because the Jewish Sacrifices, being Representations of the Passion of
Christ, were notwithstanding True and proper Sacrifices: Therefore the Being
Representative can be no hindrance that the Eucharist should be a proper
Sacrifice. So they. But yet so, as if they had meant to say nothing to the
purpose, because the Jewish Sacrifices, albeit they were Representations of
Christ's Passion, yet were they not only Representations thereof, as the
Eucharist Sacrifices in themselves, and so ordained to be by God; first in
their matter, as Bulls, Sheep, Goats; next in their Sacrificing Act, which
was Destructive, as to be slain; and lastly, in their proper and peculiar end,
which was (as your Bellarm. Sacrificia illa Levitica non culpam. and poenam
aeternam, sed immunditiem legalem, and poenam temporalem expiabant. -- Patet ex
Dei promissione de remissione peccatorum; ex mensura Sacrificij majoris and
minoris pro majore and (...) delicto. Levit. 6. and 4, and 5. At pro peccatis
gravioribus, ut blasphemia, homicidio, etc. nulla videmus instituta Sacrificia.
Lib. 4. de poeaitent. cap. 15.. Respondeo. and. Ex his. Non quoad culpam and
poe^am Gehennae, nisi quatenus signa erant protestantia fidem in Christum, ut
docent communiter Theologi. Idem l. 2. de effect. Sacram. c. 17. Et omnia illa
erant Sacrificia vera, and signacula promissionis Christi venturi and morituri.
Idem lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 24.
Cardinal witnesses) For expiation of legal Pollutions, and remission of
temporal Punishments. Each one of these may satisfy your Objection: * And (as
your Vasquez in 3. Thom. Disp. 222. cap. 8. Discrimen inter Reprae sentationem
mortis Christi in hoc Sacramento, and in Sacrificijs antiquae legis est, quod
illa non erant ideo Sacrifica, quia morte^ Christi repraesentabant; sed quia
Immolatione Rei oblatae denotabant Deum, authorem vitae and mortis.
Vasquez will say) for The acknoledgment of Gods Soveraigntie *

The Confirmation of the former Demonstration out of the Fathers; first
Explaining of themselves.
SAint Ambrose setting forth two kind of Offerings of Christ, here on Earth,
and above in Heaven, he says that Ambr. Vmbra in Lege, imago in Evangelio,
veritas in coelestibus: ante agnus offerebatur, nunc Christ* offertur quasi
Homo, quasi recipiens passionem, and offert sese ipse quasi Sacerdos, ut
peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate, ubi apud Patrem pro
nobis quasi Advocatus intervenit. Lib. 1. de Offic. Cap. 48.
Christ here is offered as one suffering, and above he himself Offers
himself an Advocate with the Father for us. And this our offering of him he
calls but an Image; and that above he calls the Truth. Clearly showing
that we have, in our Offering, Christ's Body only as it is Crucified, which
is the Object of our Commemoration; But the same Body, as it is now the
personal subject of a present Time, and Place, they behold it in Heaven; even
the same Body, which was once offered on the Cross by his Passion, now offered
up by himself to God, by Presentation in Heaven; here in the Church only by
our Representation Sacramentally on earth.

Saint Augustine deals as plainly with us, where distinguishing three States
of Offerings up of Christ, he August. Hujus Sacrificij caro and sanguis ante
adventum Christi per victimas similitudinum promittebatur; in passione Domini
per ipsam Veritatem: post Ascensum per Sacramentu^ memoriae celebratur. Cont.
Faust. lib. 20. cap. 21. Tom. 6. No^ne semel immolatus est Christus, and tamen
in Sacramento quotidie immolatur? He adds, Nec tamen mentitur, qui dicit
Christum immolari: si enim Sacramenta non haberent similitudinem rerum ipsarum,
quas repraesentant, non essent Sacramenta. Ex qua similitudine nomina eorum
accipiunt. Aug. lib. Epist. 23. [See of this above Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5.
And yet again, more plainly in his 20 Book against Faust^^, cap. 21. it
follows;] Vt Baptismus dicitur sepulchru^; sic, Hoc est corpus meum.
says first, that under the Law Christ was promised In the Similitude of their
Sacrifices: meaning, his bloody death was prefigured by those bloody
Sacrifices. Secondly, in the offering at his Passion he was Delivered up in
Truth, or proper Sacrifice, this was on the Cross. And Thirdly, after his
Ascension, The memory of Him is celebrated by a Sacrament, or Sacramental
Representation. So he. For although the Sacrifices of the Jews were true
Sacrifices, yet were they not truly the Sacrificings of Christ. Note you this
Assertion. Again, speaking That Christ was once sacrificed (namely upon the
Cross) and is now daily sacrificed in the Sacrament; nor shall he lie (says
he) that says Christ is sacrificed. So he.

No, holy Augustine, shall he not lie, who says that Christ, as the personal
Subject of this Sacrament, is a Proper Sacrifice in the Literal Sense? (for,
whether Proper or Improper, are the two Seals of this Controversy.) Now
interpose your Catholic Resolution. Say first, why is it called a tell us; See
above Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 8. out of his Epist. 23. ad Bonifacium.
If Sacraments had not a similitude of things, which they represent, they were
no Sacraments, from which similitude they have their Appellation and name of
the things (to wit) The Sacrament of the Body of Christ is called his Body, as
Baptism is called a Burial. Be so good as to explain this by another, which
may illuminate every man, in the point of Sacrifice also, although otherwise
blinded with prejudice. Epist. 23. ad Bonifac. Paulo ante verba superiora,
nempe, Pascha appropinquante, saepe dicimus crastinam Domini passionem, cum
ille ante multos annos passus sit, nec omnino nisi semel ista passio facta sit,
nempe isto die: (dicimus) Christus resurrexit, cum ex quo resurrexit tot Anni
transierunt, cum nemo ita ^eptus sit qui nos ita Ioquentes arguat nos esse
mentitos -- ut dicatur ipse Dies, quia non est ipse, sed similis -- none semel
immolatus est Christus? etc.
As when the day of Christ's Passion (says he) being to morrow, or the day of
his Resurrection about to be the next day but one; we use to say of the
former, To morrow is Christ's Passio; and of So Saint Augustine.

Who now sees not, that as the Burial of Christ is not the Subject matter of
Baptism, but only the Representative Object thereof; and as Good Friday, and
Easter Day, are not properly the days of Christ his Passion, or Resurrection,
but Anniversarie, and Represensative, or Commemorative Resemblances of them: So
this Sacrifice is a Similitude of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, and
not materially the same. * Lastly hear Augustine again: Aug. lib. 1. Con.
advers. Leg. and Proph. cap. 18. Mors Christi unum and unicum verum Sacrificium.
The death of Christ (says he) is the only true Sacrifice. * We omit
Testimonies of other Fathers, which are dispersed in other Sections. Although
this one Explanation might satisfy, yet shall we adjoyne others, which may
satiate even the greediest Appetite in the Demonstrations following.

The fourth Demonstration, From the Fathers Explanation of their meaning, by a
kind of Correction.
ANcient Fathers in good number call that, which is represented in the
Eucharist, and which we are said to offer, The same Host, not many; the same
Oblation, no other; the same Sacrifice, and none but it: but they add by a
Figure (...), that is, a Correction of the excess of their speech, or rather
for Caution-sake, (lest their Readers might conceive of the same Sacrifice
herein as properly present) saying in this manner; We offer the same Sacrifice,
or rather the Remembrance thereof; alluding sometime expressly to the
Institution of Christ, [Do this in remembrance of me.] The Fathers are these,
viz. Chrysostom. ^^. Heb. 10. ^om. 17. pa. 1171. [Christus semper suo sanguine
intra^] Ipse Sacrificium, Sacerdos, and Hostia: si hoc non esset, multa
oportebat etiam Sacrificia offerri, saepius oportebat crucifigi. -- Eandem
ipsam Hostiam, qua^ Christus immolabat, offerimus, [(...):] vel potius
Recordationem ipsius, etc.
Chrysostom, Theophylact in Heb. 10. pa. 885. 886. Nunc and ipsi sine sanguine
immolamus? Ita quide^, Sed Christi tunc reminiscimur obitus: and una nobis est
immolatio, non multae, quandoquide^ and ille semel immolatus est. Eunde^ sempe^
offerimus, quin potius Oblationis illius memoriam facimus, perinde a^si esset
hoc tempore immolatus. Quocirca unum esse hoc nostru^ Sacrificium constar. --
Vnicum est and semel oblatum -- nam and unus est sanguis, and semel fusus.
Theophylact, Theod. in Heb cap. 8. Cum essecit ut alia Sacrificia non essent
necessaria, cur novi Testamenti Sacerdotes mysticam Liturg^^m seu Sacrificium
peragant? sed clarum est ijs, qui sunt in rebus divinis cruditi, nos non aliud
Sacrificium offerre, sed unius illius salutaris memoriam peragere -- Dixit
enim, Hoc facite in memoriam mei.
Theodoret, Ambros. in Hebr. ^0. Osterimus quidem, sed Recordationem salutaris
mortis ejus, and una haec Hostia, non multae.
Ambrose, Eusebius. Demonst. Evangelic. lib. 1 cap. 10. Sacrificamus and
incendimus, alias autem magni Sacrificij illius memoriam, (...).
Eusebius, and Primasius in Heb. cap. 10. Quod Deus etc. Offerunt quidem
S^cerdotes nost^i, sed ad recordationem mortis ejus -- sicut ipse dixit, Hoc
facite in Commemorationem mei. -- Vna hostia, non multae -- Corpus unum cum
illo, quod suscepit in utero virginali, non autem multa Corpora, nec nunc
quidem aliud magnum, aliud minus.
Primasius.

Your only Answer is, that their Exception, here used, was not to note that it
is not the same Body of Christ here Corporally present, which was offered upon
the Cross; but that it is not offered in the same manner by effusion of Blood,
as that was; which is indeed a Part, but not the whole Truth. For survey the
Marginalls, and then tell us! If that your Sacrifice were the same Body of
Christ Corporally present, why should Theophylact Bloody or Unbloody, but to
the person of Christ? saying, We offer the same Christ, who was once offered,
or rather a Memorial of his Oblation. And Theodoret applying it directly to
the thing, [Non aliud] We offer not another Sacrifice, but a memorial thereof.
Why Eusebius? We offer a Memorial in stead of a Sacrifice. Why Chrysostom?
The same Sacrifice or rather a Commemoration of it: every one directly
requiring that the Thing, which we offer, be the same crucified Bloody
Sacrifice of Christ's Death, (which S. Augustine but even now named The only
true Sacrifice of Christ, (in the former Section) but that they plainly
notifyed unto us, that they meant the same very Body, which was the Subject of
the Sacrifice on the Cross, to be the now proper Object of our Remembrance in
the Eucharist, but not the Subject therein.

Which agrees with that which in the former Section was said by Ambrose, Our
offering up of Christ in an Image; and Augustine his celebrating of this
Sacrament of Remembrance. Semblably, Hierome speaks of the Priest, who is said
to take the Person of Christ in this Sacrament, so that, He (says Hier. Tom.
5. lib. 13. Com. in Ezec. cap. 44. Qui offerat Deo Sacrificium, ita ut verus
Sacerdos sit, imo Imitator ejus, qui est Sacerdos secundum ordine^
Melchisedech. Idem Tom. 9. lib. 4. cap. 26. in Matthew. Sicut Melchisedech panem
and vinum offerens, ipse quoque veritate^ corporis and sanguinis sui
repraesentat.
Hierome) be a true Priest, or rather an Imitator of him. But a Priest, and an
Imitator, is not Identically the same that is represented. Master Brerely is
not Christ.

* Yea, and Saint Hierome will speak as directly of the Differences of the two
Sacrifices, as he does of the two Priests; for distinguishing between them,
Hier. in Levit. and extat in Decret. de Consec. did. 2. Can. De hac -- De hac
quidem hostia, quae in Christi commemorationem mirabiliter fit, edere licet: de
illa vero, quam Christus in ara crucis obtulit secundum se, nulli edere licet.
In this Sacrifice (says he) which is marveilously done in commemoration of
Christ, one may eat: but that which he offered of himself upon the Cross, no
man may eat. Where he notes two Sacrifices, One Here, and another on the
Cross: the first offered by Another, and the second by Himself. And he
separateth them (in respect of the Subject) as THIS, from THAT; which if they
were subjectively, really, and personally the same, then the Eating of the one
should be the Eating of the other, which S. Hierome denies: Of THIS one may
eat, (says he) but not of THAT. *

Lastly, The same (said See the former Marginalls at the letter (f.)
Primasius) in all places, which was born of the Virgin, and not now great, and
now less. So he. But have we not heard you number your many Hosts on one
Altar, at one Time? We offer not many, but the same, which must needs be the
same one, as Object; else show us where ever any Father denied but that upon
diverse Altars were diverse Breads; or that but, according to their outward
Dimensions, they were now greater, now less; which no way agrees with the
Body of Christ, as has been proved in discussing the Sea above B. 4. Chap ^^.
Sect. 5.
Canon of the Council of Nice.

The fifth Demonstration, Because the Body and Blood of Christ, as they are
pretended by the Romish Church to be in this Sacrament, cannot be the
Representative Sacrifice spoken of by Ancient Fathers; against your vain
Instance in a Stage Play, being the last refuge of your desperate Disputers
wherein their whole Defense
THat the Subject matter of this Sacrament (by you called the same Sacrifice,
which Christ offered up upon the Cross) ought to be Representative, and fit to
resemble the same Sacrifice of his Passion, is a matter unquestionable among
all. In which respect the Fathers have so often called it a Sacrifice of
Commemoration, Representation, and Remembrance; and that Body crucified, and
his Blood shed in that Sacrifice of his Passion, is a point as questionless:
which accords both to the words of Christ his Institution [Do this in
remembrance of me,] and to the Exposition of Saint Paul, to be a [shewing
forth of the Lords death until he come:] yea and is also consonant to the
last mentioned Doctrine of the Fathers, calling it A Sacrifice of Christ, or
rather a Remembrance thereof.

The only Question will be, how This, which you call The same Sacrifice,
meaning the Body of Christ, subjectively in the Body, as it was the Sacrifice
on the Cross? We yielding unto you a possibility, that one thing, in some
respects, may be a Representation of it self. Your Tridentine Fathers to this
purpose say, that Council. Trident. Christum reliquisse Sacrificium Ecclesiae
suae visibile, quo cruentum istud in Cruce peragendum repraesentaretur. Ses.
22. ca. 1.
Christ left this visible Sacrifice to his Church, whereby his Body sacrificed
on the Cross should be represented. So they. From whom (it may seem) your
Rhemists learned that Lesson, which they taught others, that Rhemists Annot. in
Luc. 22.
Christ's Body, once visibly sacrificed upon the Cross, In and By the self
same Body is immolated and Sacrificed under the shapes of Bread and Wine, and
is most perfectly thereby resembled: and therefore is most properly
Commemorative; being called the same Sacrifice by the Ancient Fathers. And
again, This nearly and lively resembles that. So they. But this we utterly
deny, because although a thing may in some sort be represented by it self, yet
(say we) there is no Representative quality of any Body and Blood of Christ
(as it is said by you to be in the Eucharist) of his Body and Blood sacrificed
upon the Cross. And upon the Truth or Untruth of this our Assertion depends
the gaining or losing of the whole Cause, concerning the Question of Sacrifice,
now controverted between Us.

Two of your Jesuits have undertaken to manifest your Representation (by a
more fit example than do your Rhemists) thus; Barradas Ies. En tibi stupendam
Dei adinventionem notam facimus. Animo concipiamus Regem aliquem post
reportatam de Hostibus Victoriam, etc. Sic Christi corpus veluti in scena
personatur, id est, speciebus panis and vini velatur, etc. Tom. 4. Concord.
Evang lib. 3. cap. 13.. Optimus. And Bellarmine.
Even as a King (say they) having got a victory, should represent himself,
after his war, in a Stage Play in fight, etc.

* Or as your Cardinal Peron is said to have fancied; As David might have
represented his own Combat with Goliath in a Theater. * So they, even in
earnest, which has been as earnestly, yet easily, confuted by us See above
Book. 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. there answered.] Corpus and sanguis Domini sub
specie panis and vini signa sunt corporis ejus passi, and sanguinis effusi,
etc. See above also in the same place, Chap. 3.
already; although, indeed, the Play deserves but laughter. And that so much
the rather, because the Representative part (as your Council of See hereafter,
Chap. 6. Sect. 1.
Trent has defined) is in your Mass a visible Sacrifice, whereby the Bloody
Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross might be represented, as you have heard. *
For here is no visibly-represented person, but the Priest; no
visily-represented, or Body, but the Bread Broken. But no more is the Bread
Christ's Body, than the Breaking thereof is his Crucifying; or yet the Priest,
Christ. *

CHALLENGE.
Displaying furthermore the Stollidity of this your only Romish Defense,
concerning an Unbloody Representative
ALl Christians, be they Protestants, or Romanists, whenever they allow of
the name of Sacrifice, whether in a large and common, or in a strict and proper
Sense, they evermore profess it to be the Representative and Commemorative of
the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross. But how it is Representative, is
become the maine hinge of the whole Controversy. Protestants hold and teach
this to Elements of Bread and Wine, and the use thereof in the Eucharist; and
the Body and Blood of Christ on the Cross. But you Romish maintain a
Representation of Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross by Analogy with his Body and
Blood, as it is in this Sacrament. The Analogy of Representation, held by
Protestants, is such as your own Doctors will grant to be true in every part
and point.

First, for the End of the Celebration of the Eucharist, it is confessed, that
Vasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 220. Vt finis Sacrificij veteris legis erat
repraesentare Sacrificium Crucis, ut futurum: sic finis est Sacrificij
Eucharistiae repraesentare Sacrificium Crucis, up praeteritum.
The end thereof is to represent the Sacrifice on the Cross. Secondly, Nor
will any of you deny, but the forms of Bread and Wine do Represent the Body
and Blood of Christ. Nor (thirdly) will you gainsay, that the Separation of
Bread from the Wine, in the Eucharist, does represent the Separation of
Christ's Body and Blood on the Cross. Which are the three Summarie Points of
Representation, held by Us, contrary to your professed Representation made (as
you have said) by Christ's Body and Blood, in the Eucharist, of the same his
Body and Blood separated on the Cross, as it were in a Stage Play. *

You therefore (except you will be Players, and not Disputers) must tell us,
where ever it was seen or heard of a King, as Conqueror, or yet of any other,
of what condition soever, acting himself, and that Visibly, Perfectly, and
Truly (as you have said) yea or else any way semblably Representing himself,
King, or party, was to all the Spectators altogether Invisible? If You can,
then show where this was Acted, whether it were not in Vtopia? And who was the
Actor, if not (...)? and of what Disposition the Spectators were, whether not
like the Man of Argos, who is said daily to have frequented the Theater and
Stage alone, void of all Actors, yet seeming to himself to see all Varieties
of Actions; occasioning him to laugh, and applaud at that which he saw
represented to himself only in his own fantastical Brain?

The Body and Blood in the Eucharist are visible, by the visible shapes of
Bread and Wine. Whereas it had been much better you had answered, indeed,
nothing at all, rather than not only to contradict that, which was said by
your Fathers of Trent, (decreeing the Representation to be made By the
Sacrifice on the Altar it self; and more expressly by your See above at (^)
Rhemists, In and by the same Body in the Eucharist:) but also to expose your
selves to the reproof of your Adversaries, and Scorn of any man of common
Sense; as if you Visible to any that will use his eyes, which he has
therefore locked close up in his Coffer, lest any man might see it.

* Besides, this your Romish Principle and Doctrine of Concomitancie is not
unknown unto you, which is, that notwithstanding whatsoever Consecration of
Bread severally from the Wine, yet the Body and Blood of Christ are continually
in the Eucharist, as Veseparably united together; his Blood being in the veins
of the same Body, as verily as it was before his Passion. Hence we argue, that
this Inseparation of Christ's Blood from his Body, which you believe to be in
this Sacrament, can no more possibly represent the Separation and Shedding of
Christ's Blood from his Body (which all Christians believe to have been in his
Sacrifice on the Cross) than Crookedness can resemble Straightness; or
Light, Darkness. Therefore is not the Romish Sacrifice of the Body and Blood
of Christ, Representative of his Body and Blood on the Cross, notwithstanding
Representation be the end of the Celebration of the Eucharist. *

The Sixth Demonstration Of the No-Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, because
diverse Epithets objected, as given by Fathers to this Sacrifice, are used also
by them where there is no Proper Sacrifice. SECT. VIII.
IT is objected by your Cardinal, that Ancient Fathers gave certain Epithets,
and Attributes to the Eucharist. I. Some calling it a Full and Pure; II. Some,
Terrible Sacrifice; III. Some termed it in the Plural number Sacrifices and
Victimes. His Argument (in the Margin) is this: If the Fathers had held the
Sacrifice of the Eucharist to be but only Representative, They would not have
called them in the Plural number Sacrifices. So he, Bellar. lib. 1. de Miss.
cap 15.. Quinto -- Patres ad nomen Sacrificij Epitheta saepe addunt, quae soli
vero Sacrificio convenient, and quae inepte dicerent de sola repraesentatione
Cyp. l. 2. Epist. 3. Plenum and verum Sacrificium. Chrysostom. Hom. ad Pop.
Antioch. et omnes Graeci, Passim terribile Sacrificium and horroris plenum.
Aug. lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20. Summum verumque Sacrificium. Eusebius. lib.
1. Demonst. Evang. cap. ult Sacrificium Deo plenum. [This last is not
undoubtedly spoken of the Eucharist.] Ibid.. Secondo. -- Si Patres putassent
Sacrificium Eucharistiae non esse Sacrificium nisi epraesentativum, nunquam
dixissent in numero multitudims offeri Deo Victimas, and Sacrificia.
concluding from each of these, that they meant Proper Sacrifice in the
Eucharist. We encounter all these four kind of Instances with like Epithets
given by the same August. de Civit Dei, lib. 10. cap. 6 Verum Sacrificium omne
opus bonum, ut Deo adhaereamus, factum. Tertull. In omni loco Sacrificium
mundum, gloriae scilicet and rogatio, benedicto, laus, hymni. Lib. 3. advers.
Marcionem. Rursus, Sacrificium mundum oration simplex de pura Conscientia Ibid.
lib. 4. paulo post initium. Justin. Dialog. cum Tryphon. Preces and Gratiarum
actiones, (...).
Fathers to other Things (in your own judgment) Improperly called Sacrifices;
as namely to Prayers, Praises, Giving Thanks, and Hymns, instiled True, Pure,
and Clean, and the only perfect Sacrifices, by Primitive Fathers. Secondly,
they are as zealous concerning the second Cyril. Apol. Lectio Scripturarum
terribilium. Testae Iewello, art. 17. Chrysostom. in 1. Corinthians Hom. 40 De
Baptismate paulo post initium, Post pronunciationem (...).
Point, in terming holy Scriptures Terrible; the Rules touching Baptism,
Terrible Words, and Horrible Canons; and the Christian, duly considering the
nature of Baptism, One compassed about with Horror and Astonishment. Whereof
more See Book 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 1.
hereafter. And indeed what is there, whereby we have any apprehension of Gods
Majesty, and Divine Attributes, which does not work a holy Dread in the hearts
of the Godly?

And the third Instance is as idle as any of the rest, because the holy Eusebius.
lib. 1. Demonst. Evang. cap. 10. Porro has rursus incorporeas and intelligentia
praeditas hostias prophetica nunciant oracula. Immola Deo Sacrificium laudis,
and Orationes sanctas, etc. Just. Martyr. Dialog. cum Triphon. page 269.
Suppicationes and gratiarum actiones solas esse charas Victimas Deo.
Fathers named Prayers, Giving of Thanks, and other holy Actions and
Commemorations themselves, Sacrifices and Hoasts, in the Plural number. And is
not there in the Eucharist Prayers, Hymns, and Thanksgivings? Nay, but know,
that inasmuch as the Fathers have called the Eucharist in the Plural number
Hoasts, and Sacrifices, it proves that they were not of your Romish Belief of
Concomitancie, to think (with you) Bread being changed into Christ's Body, and
Wine into his Blood, make but one Sacrifice; for there can be no Identity in
Plurality.

* A Vindication of the Truth of an Answer, concerning the objected Testimony
of Eusebius, against a Romish Seducer.
EVsebius is objected (in the Margin) as naming the Eucharist, Sacrificium Deo
plenum. My Answer there is, that Are not undoubtedly spoken of the Eucharist.
Which a Romish Seducer of late traduced, as untruly answered: but yet gives no
Reason of his Exception; but as blindly as bluntly tells me that my Answer
is False. But if I be mistaken, then has Eusebius himself seduced me, who,
before the same words, speaks of [Hostias incorporeas, and intelligentia
praeditas:] specifying the Sacrifice of a contrite heart, and Sacrifice of
Praise. And again immediately after; [At Sacrificium Deo spiritus contritus.]
Then, after this he adjoyneth [Memoriam magni illius Sacrificij;] The
Memorial of that great Sacrifice; Meaning, the Eucharisticall Commemoration of
the Sacrifice of the Cross, as any that looks not a-squint upon the place
will easily perceive. Besides, all the Sacrifices of the New Testament, by him
mentioned, he calls Incorporeall, and endued with Understanding. But you do
as truly grant the Eucharist to be a Corporal Substance, as you wickedly See
above Book 4. c. 9.. 2
say, that Christ's Body therein is Without Understanding.

See above in this 8. Sect.
Epithets, out of Ancient Fathers, against the said late Calumnious Romish
Seducer.
His words are these: Bellarmine lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 15. To prove that the
Fathers, when they called the Eucharist a Sacrifice, meant a Proper Sacrifice,
uses eight usual Epithets, which the Fathers in this Case give to the word
Sacrifice. My Treatise of the Mass, Book. 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8.
Lord of Durham undertakes to encounter him with the like, given to the word
Sacrifice, when they manifestly speak of improper Sacrifices. This he
undertakes, but performs nothing, for he allegeth no saying of any Father,
where any thing of this nature is called [Sacrificium Terribile, Plenum
Horroris, Sacrificium Summum, Sacrificium Verissimum, Sacrificium Singular,
Sacrificium Deo Plenum.] So he.

That which should have been performed by me, in this Treatise, was to show
that there were none of these Attributes, which Bellarmine collected out of the
Fathers, as proper to your Romish Sacrifice of the Mass, but have been as
effectually applied by Ancient Fathers unto Prayers, Praises, Baptism, and
other the like holy and pious Actions. Which the same your Bellarmine himself
confesses to be No proper Sacrifice. Notwithstanding have I lately been
Challenged by one, who says (as becomes an egregious Seducer) that I have
performed hereof nothing Nothing at all: Meaning, that none of the Epithets,
abovementioned by Bellarmine (out of the Fathers) were at any time attributed
by them to any other thing but to your Sacrifice of the Mass.

But what? Nothing at all? I. Not the Epithet [Terrible?] False. For I proved
that the Fathers called Baptism a Treatise of the Mass, Book 6. Chap. 2.
Sect. 1. 3.
Sacrifice, and inscribed it [ Ibid. Sect. 8.
Terible] II. Not the Epithet [Summum] that is, Chief? False. For the Father
See Book 6. Chap. 7. Sect. 2.
Pelusiota is alleged, naming a Pure mind and chaste Body the Best Sacrifice.
III. Not the Epithet [Truest?] False. For August. See Book 6. cha. 7. Sect. 2
Augustine not only enstiling Every pious work a True Sacrifice (and Vero
nihil verius, says the Philosopher) but also nothing that, Where God says, I
will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice; Mercy (says he) is a Sacrifice most
Excellent, and whereof the other are but Signs. IV. Not the Epithet [Deo
Plenum?] False. For it was proved effectually enough, in that the Preaching of
the word, which is called of the Apostle, The Power of God unto Salvation, is
termed of Chrysostom. See oak. 6. Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Bo
Chrysostom, a Pure and immortal Sacrifice; And what would you say to your
Divines Enchiridion Coloniens. fol. 107. Hic Ecclesia (quae Corpus Christi
mysticum est) se totam Deo consecrat, adeo ut Cyprianus tale Sacrificium,
verum, et plenum Sacrifi^um non dubitaverit appellare.
who will have you observe Cyprian naming the Church of Christ, as his
Mystical Body, consecrated to God, a pure and full Sacrifice?

Lastly, Not the last Epithet, which is [Singulare Sacrificium?] whereof your
Romish Seducer boastingly says as follows: [Singular Sacrificium, a Singular
Sacrifice] which is the most convincing Epithet of all the rest, proves the
Eucharist not only to be a Sacrifice, but also to be the only Sacrifice of
the Church; whereas there be many improper Sacrifices. This the Lord Bishop
passes over with Silence, and shuts out for a Wrangler. So he. Who might
think it happened well to himself, if he should be but only Shut out for a
Wrangler, and not called in Question for a false and presumptuous Traducer and
Seducer, for denying that to be performed at all, which I did discharge with an
Advantage, alleging that Ancient Father See Book 6 Chap. 7. Sect. 2.
Iustine Prayers, and Thanksgivings [(...): The perfect and only Sacrifices
well pleasing unto God.] Can there be any thing more Singular than that which
is Only? The voice of Saint Augustine is full as loud, for the Sacrifice of
Christ's Passion: The Death of Christ (says August. See (...), Chap. 5. and
Sect. 5.
he) is the only Sacrifice, which being the only true Sacrifice must
necessarily exclude the Host in your Mass from the property of a true
Sacrifice. If therefore this Epithet be an Argument most convincing above all
the rest, (as is here objected) then must it follow that Bellarmine thus

The Seventh Demonstration, Of No-Proper Sacrifice in the Euchrist: Because the
Principal Epithet, of Unbloody Sacrifice, used by the Fathers, and most
urgently objected by your Doctors, for proof of a Proper Sacrifice, does
evince
IT has been some pains unto us, to collect the objected Testimonies of
Fathers, for this Point, out of your diverse Writers, which you may peruse now
in the Margin with more ease, and presently perceive, both what makes not for
you, and what against you; but certainly, for you, just nothing at all. For
what can it help your cause, that the Celebration An unbloody Sacrifice, a
Reasonable and unbloody Service or Worship?

accepisti in odorem suavitatis. [And after follow the words of Consecration:
Sancto, qui in Sanctis, etc. -- Suscipe incorruptum Hymnum in sanctis and
incruentis Sacrificijs tuis.] --
Liturgies, (or if you will Missals) are objected, to prove that by Unbloody
Sacrifice, and Reasonable and unbloody Worship, is betokened the Sacrifice of
Christ's Body and Blood in the Mass; one of Basil, another of Chrysostom, and
(by some others) the Mass of Saint James of Jerusalem. In which Epithet of
Unbloody (say we) could not be signified Christ's Body. Our Reasons; because
(as the Margin shows) the word, Unbloody, has sometime Relation unto the
Bread and Wine (both unbloody) before Consecration, called in Saint James his
Liturgy, Gods gifts of the first fruit of the Ground: who also reckons
Hymns among Unbloody Sacrifices; (But Christ's Body is the fruit of the Womb)
or else sometime it is referred to the Acts of Celebration, in Supplication,
Thanksgiving, and Worship of God (all Unbloody) naming that A Reasonable and
Unbloody Service, which they had termed an Unbloody Sacrifice, as Lindan your
Parisian Doctor has truly Chrysostom also styled Spiritual (mark you)
(...), Service, or Worship. Was ever Christ called (...), who is himself
rather the Person to be worshipped?

Secondly, Reasonable, could this point out Christ's Body in the Sense of the
objected Fathers? Suffer Chrysostom to resolve us. Chrysostom. Hom. 11. Quid est
rationabile obsequium? quod per animam, quod secundum Spiritum offertur:
quicquid non indiget corpore; quicquid non indiget instrumentis, neque locis,
in quibus ipse quidem est Pontifex, ut mansuetudo, pationtia, etc. Sacrificium
laudis, justitiae, spiritus contribulati.
Reasonable Service, (says he) is that which is performed with the mind,
without Bodily help. * The which Athanasius attributes to Baptism: Athanas.
cont. Macedon. Dial. 1. de Baptismo. (...): (...) etc.
This (says he) is a Reasonable and living Worship; whereof the Apostle

Thirdly, The Unbloody Sacrifice is called Spiritual (as you hear) how shall
this be properly applied to the Body of Christ? You will say, not in it is
natural Essence, but in the manner of being Invisible, Impalpable, and the
like. But we demand; the same head of a man's Body, is it more Spiritual in
the dark than in the light?

Lastly, all these terms in these Liturgies of Unbloody Sacrifice, Reasonable
Service, and Spiritual, are spoken before Consecration, Body of Christ, even
in your own Faith, as yet can have no being in the Eucharist; and therefore
cannot be the Unbloody Sacrifice here meant by you. Will you have the full
substance of all these Reasons? The word, Unbloody, whether it point out Bread
and Wine, or the Act of outward Worship in this celebration, called a
Reasonable Service, and Spiritual Sacrifice, it must betoken a thing void of
Blood, which no Christian Professor dare attribute to the Body of Christ. We
proceed.

Eusebius says indeed, (...). Eusebius. Caesar. lib. 4. De Vita Constant. cap.
45. de Euchar. Alij sacras literas interpretantur: Alij (...), and mysticis
consecrationibus divinum numen placabant, and supplices preces pro communi pace
offerebant. Et Demonst. Lib. 1. Cap. 6. Sacrificium mundum.
We offer an Unbloody Sacrifice; but what he meant thereby, he does not
express, whether the Signs of Bread and Wine, which he elsewhere, with
others, (as you have heard) called Sacrifices: or whether, as Basil and
Chrysostom have done, he understood together the Public Service in
celebrating the Memory of Christ's Death. This then concludes not for an
Existence of the Body of Christ, as of the Unbloody Subject herein. But whereas
furthermore your may observe, that Eusebius (objected) calls Non per cruores,
sed per quas actiones summo Deo offerendas. After, there follows an Oration
of Constantine, Ad Sanctorum coetum. Tale Sacrificiu^ peragitur, vacuum
sanguine, and ab omni violentia. [As (...). Dadraeus Doctor Paris^ translateth
it.]
Godly Actions a pure Sacrifice, and opposes this against Bloody Sacrifices;
and Again, Demonst. Evang. li. 1. ca. 10 Has rursus [(...)] i. e. materiae
expertia Sacrificia, intellige^^^a praeditas hostias, Prophetica nuntiant
^racula? Immola Deo Sacrificium laudis -- Hymnos and sanct^^ Orationes
celebrantes, And again; (...). E^od. lib.
Holy Prayers [(...)] that is, Without Material Substance, as he did the
Celebration of the Sacrament [(...)] that is, Unbloody: And yet again of this
Sacrament; A Memorial, says he, instead of a Sacrifice. These show that
Eusebius meant a Sacrifice void of Blood; which neither the word of God will
permit us; nor your Council of Trent will suffer you to impute to the Body of
Christ, and therefore must needs wound your Roman Oblation of Body and Blood
to the very heart.

Nazianzen (objected) is as directly opposite to your Mass, as East is to
West, and will strike the matter dead, calling it Nazian. Invect. 1. advers,
Julian. ante med [(...)] i. e. Vt ab incruento Sacrificio manus elueret, per

The unbloody Sacrifice, whereby (says he) we Communicate with Christ.
Flatly differencing the unbloody Sacrifice, whereby, from Christ himself, with
whom the Faithful docommunicate in this Sacrament.

Ambrose (objected) prays to God, Ambr. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. Sacerdos
dicit, Ergo memores gloriosissimae ejus passions, offerim^us. Tibi immaculatam
hanc hostiam incruentani, and hunc panem sanctum, and hanc oblationem salutis
aeternae.

Mass, and which your Cardinal seeks to justify by Saint Ambrose. But this
he cannot do, except their meaning be both the same. Let then your Cardinal
but tell us the meaning of the Canon of your Mass, and you Ambrose. In our
Mass (says your Accipiendo sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negari non
(...) and (...) in Missa offerri, ac proinde, pertinere ad rem, quae
sacrificatur. Nam cum aute Constrationem dicimus [Suscipe, Pater, have
immacu^^tam Hostiam] certe Pronomen, Hanc, demonstrat ad sensum id quod manibus

[Because the Cardinal does often in this and other Chapters justify the
Roman term of Mass, by the (...) in Ambras^^]
Cardinal) it is said, Receive, holy Father, this immaculate Host; where the
Pronounce This (says he) does domonstrate Bread and Wine, because spoken
before Consecration. So he. And the Body and Blood of Christ (you know, are
not Bread and Wine. Let Athanasius put a Period to this Section, who says that
(...) Melchisedech dedit, Abrahamo vinum meracum addito panis [(...)] frusto --
hic typus fuit offerendi Sacrificium [(...)] incruentum, sanctam oblationem.
Hist. de Melchizedech. ad sinem. Tom. 2.
Melchisedech, in giving Bread and Wine, was the first Type of an unbloudy
Sacrifice. But Melahisedechs was Unbloody, negatively, having no Blood Body of
Christ; since his Resurrection, according to our Christian Belief.

CHALLENGE.
WHat a fair piece of service (do you think) have these Objectors done, for
the patronizing of your Roman Sacrifice, out of the Sentences of Ancient
Fathers? whilst they, alleging their words, citing their Books, and quoting
their Chapters, have so handled the matter, as if they had meant, by
prevaricating in their own Cause, to betray it: seeing that it is apparent,
that they have delivered unto us the worship, in stead of the thing worshipped,
out of the Council of Ephesus, Basil, Chrysostom, and Eusebius. Next by the
word, Unbloody, being spoken before Consecration (and therefore concerns not
the Unbloody Body of Christ) they have obtruded the thing, Distinguished from
Christ, in stead of Christ, in the Testimony of Nazianzen. But especially,
because in the most of the [Do but examine the places again, and you shall
find Basil to have spoken of Service before Consecration: Chrysest. Of Blood
and Wine, before Consecration: Eusebius in one place is interpreted (by your
own Doctor and Translator) to have spoken of a Sacrifice void of Blood;
Nazianzene speaks of something in the Eucharist, differing from Christ: to
whom you may join Athanasius.]
Sentences, the word Unbloody, must needs be taken negatively for want, or
absence of Blood: and so you may bid your Corporal Presence adieu. All which
may be strong Arguments unto us, both of the deplorable Consciences of your
Doctors, Christ's Body and Blood, come now to be discussed.

A Confirmation of the former Demonstration, from the use of the word,
Unbloody, in the objected Sentences; wherein the Fathers make mention of the
Body and Blood of Christ. SECT. X.
THis Objection seems to be of better moment than the former; but only
seems. Clemens Bishop of Rome, the first of that name, calls (indeed) the
Eucharisticall Celebration Clemens Romans Constable. lib. 6. cap. 23. Pro Sacrificio
cruento, Rationale and incruentum ac illud mysticum Sacrificium corporis and
sanguinis Christi, quod in symbolum mortis ejus celebratur. Et lib. 7. Co^^^.
cap. 26. Adhuc agimus tibi grarias, Pater noster, pro prer^oso corpore and
sanguine effuso, cujus haec Antitypa celebramus, ut mortem ejus denunciaremus,
per ipsum enim tibi gloria. Amen.
An unbloody Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ. In which sentence the
Unbloody Sacrifice is plainly distinguished from the Body and Blood, whereof it
is a Sacrifice, even as both the Act and Service of Commemoration have been
oftentimes above, and are hereafter called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, in
respect of the Object thereof, which is the Body and Blood of Cross. This is
manifest by two especial Reasons; the first, because that which he calls
Unbloody, he terms also a Reasonable Service.

Secondly, Clemens calls the same Unbloody Sacrifice the Sign and Type of
Christ's Body and Blood, thereby distinguishing them from that Body and Blood
whereof they are but Types. You will then ask, what is this Body and Blood,
whereof they are said to be Types? Yea marry, This being known will set all
straight. And Clemens tells you, that it is his Precious Body, and his Blood
shed, which (properly taken) all Christians profess to be Proper to his Body
crucified, and Blood shed on the Cross, for the proper Object of our Typical
Remembrance, as we have formerly See B. 2. Chapter 2. 4 and this B. 6. Chapter 1. 2.
proved, and you your selves have confessed already.

Cyril. Hierosol. Mystag. 5. Postquam consecimus [(...)] Aliquanto post,
Obsecramus Deum pro, etc. Et Christu^ [(...)] Ob. ^ Salmerone Ies. Tom. 9.
Tract. 30.
Cyril of Jerusalem does attend upon Pope Clemens, and in a sort treads in
his steps. The manner of our Celebrating the memory of Christ's death, he
calls a Spiritual Sacrifice, and an Unbloody worship; wherein, against the
Jewish Sacrifice, he opposes Spiritual against Corporal, as he does
Unbloody Bloody. But, by Spiritual, he meant that which wants a Body.
Therefore, by Unbloody, he meant that which was properly void of Blood. So
far was Cyril from signifying thereby the Unbloody Body of Christ, as the
Subject matter in the Eucharist. As for the Body and Blood of Christ it self,
which he calls Propitiation, Cyril expounds himself to mean (for so he
names it) Christ slain for our sins, which still we say, and you cannot
deny, is only the Object of our whole Spiritual service of Remembrance and
Commemoration. Both these former Witnesses have delivered their Testimonies, as
Prayer, whereunto whether You or Protestants may more justly say Amen, judge
you. Cyril Patriarch of Alexandria accordingly See below Sect. 15
acknowledges a Sacrifice Unbloody, Spiritual, and Mental.

The eighth Demonstration Of the no-Proper Sacrifice of the Mass; Because the
Ancient Fathers called the Eucharist a Bloody Sacrifice, which all you will
confess to be Improperly spoken.
TAke but unto you your own Allegations (set down in the Sa^mer. Tom. 9.

Margin) of the Sentences of Antiquity, and you shall find how the Ancient
Fathers doubted not to say that Christ suffers, is slain, slays himself,
suffers often in this Sacrament: and that His Passion and Bloody Sacrifice is
offered herein. * And again; As often as Christ is offered on the Altar, so
often is he slain and eaten of the faithful. Do you mark (...) so eaten, as
he is slain, but only so, as slain; which no living man will say, can be
spoken Properly of Christ's Body, after his Resurrection. * These are Sayings of
the highest Accent, as you see, and of no fewer nor meaner Fathers than these,
Alexander, Chrysostom, Cyprian, Hierome, Cyril of Jerusalem, Hesychius,
Pascasins, and Eusebius Emissenus. * Unto this holy Assembly Gregory Nyssen
joyneth himself, who, although last in place, yet will appear to be as
forward in sense as the foremost. He speaking of the Body of Christ, as it was
a Sacrifice eaten of his Disciples in his last Supper, held the Crucified Body
of Christ to have Greg. Nyssen. Orat. 1. de Resurrect. Christi. Pro ineffabili
arcanoque, and qui ab hominibus cerni nequit, Sacrificij modo sua dispositione
and administratione praeoccupat impetum violentum, ac sese oblatione^ ac
victimam offert pro nobis Sacerdos simul and agnus Dei, qui tollit peccatum
mundi. Quando hoc accidit? Cum corpus suum ad comedendum, and sanguinem
bibendum praebuit. Cuilibet enim hoc perspicuum est, quod ore vesci homo non
potest, nisi comestionem mactatio praecesserit. Qui igitur dedit Discipulis
suis corpus suum ad comedendum, aperte demonstrat jam perfectam agni
immolationem. Non enim ad edendum idoneum esset corpus animatum.
It was even then eaten as a perfect Sacrifice of Christ. But how? to wit,
says he, as slain. His Reason; for a Body having life (says he) cannot be
fit to be eaten. So he. Than which nothing can make more against your Eating
of Christ's Body, as Corporally Present; or yet against a Proper Sacrifice
therein. *

What think you of such Sayings? Can Christ be said properly to be Dead in
this Sacrament? Quis unquam Catholicus dixit Christum rursus mori? Ribera. Ies.
Com. in Heb. 10. number. 25.
Never any Catholic said so (says your Jesuit Ribera.) What then could be
the Alan would teach you, and he would have you Observandum est, Christum licet
modo impassibili existat in Sacramento, tamen dici a Patribus mortalem,
imomortuum and passum in Sacramento, eatenus quidem, quatenus ox modo
Consecrationis, ipsaque vi significationis Sacramentalis mors, and passio
Domini commemorantus atque repraesentantur. Alan. Card. lib. 2. de Euch. cap.
38. sub finem.
Observe what he says: Christ is said by the Fathers to suffer (says he)
and to dye in this Sacrament only so far as his Death and Passion is
commemorated and represented herein. And so speaks also your Roman Glossa de
Consecrat. Did. ^. Quid fit. Hoc est, ejus Mors repraesentatur.
Gloss.

What now hinders but that whenever we hear the same Fathers affirming
that the same Body and Blood of Christ are Sacrificed in the Eucharist, we
understand them in the same impropriety of Speech, that they meant only
Representatively? Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 29.. Respondeo si, etc. Si
Catholici dicerent in Sacrificio Missae vere Christum mori, argumentum Calvini
haberet aliquid virum; sed cum dicunt omnes eum non mori, nisi in Sacramento,
and signo repraesentante mortem ejus, quam uliquando obij^, tantum abest, ut
Missa obl^^eret Christi mortem, ut potius efficiat ut nunquam obliteretur.
If Catholics should say that Christ does truly dye in this Sacrament, this
Argument might be of some force: but they say he dies not, but in Sacrament
and Sign representing. So he; which yet alas is too little a crevase for so
great a Doctor to creep out at. First, because there is as well a Figurative,
as there is a Literal Truth; for, If I should say of Easter day (said See
above Chap. 5. Sect. 5.
Augustine) it is the day of Christ's Resurrection, I should not lie, and yet
it is but the Anniversarie day, betokening the other. When Christ said of one
part of this Sacrament, [This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood] he spoke
by a double Figure, said your Jesuit Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 4.
Salmeron, yet truly.

Secondly Christ, who is Truth it self, in saying of Bread, This is my Body,
or Flesh, spoke a Truth, as you all profess; and was it not likewise a Truth,
when he called his Flesh Bread? yea, and also Ioh. 6.
The true Bread.

Thirdly, the Fathers, as they said that Christ is Dead, and suffers (as you
now object) in this Sacrament in a Mystery: so have they also said of his
Body, in respect of the Eucharist, Ambrose, Aug. above, Chap. 5. Sect. 5.
Image, in a Sacrament, or Mystery; according to that their general
Qualification, saying, It is the same Sacrifice which Christ offered, or Above,
Chap. 5. Sect. 6.
rather a Remembrance thereof.

And Lastly, the Fathers, who named Baptism a Sacrifice as well as the
Eucharist, doubted not to stretch Baptism up to as high a note as they have
done the Eucharist, saying, Chrysostom. in Epist. ad Heb. Hom. 16. Baptismus est
passio Christi.
Baptism is the Passion of Christ: and Ambros. de Poenitent. lib. 2. cap. 1.
In Baptismo crucifigimus in nobis filium Dei.
In Baptism we crucify Christ. To signify, that the Body of Christ is the
Represented Object, and not the Representative Subject of this

An Elucidation of the Premises, by a Similitude of a Stage Play, manifesting
how the same Improper Sacrifice might furthermore have been called both Bloody
and Unbloody, by Ancient Fathers. SECT. XII.
A Similitude, for explanation-sake, would be had; give Stage Play, for
manifesting a Truth, as well as Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. and Book 6. Chap. 5.
Sect. 7.
you have done another from thence, for palliating a Falsehood. You may
recognize with us that Tragical end of the Emperor Mauritius, by the command
of one Phoca^, (once his Slave) that Grand Patron of the Popedom, by
Privileging the Church of Rome, to be the Head of all Churches, as diverse of
your own Historians do relate. But to the Point. By the commandment of this
Phocas (as you See Baron. Anno 602. etc.
know) were slain two of Mauritius his Sons, three Daughters, and his Wife;
and all these before his own Mauritius himself was also murdered.

Were now this doleful Spectacle acted on a Stage, might not any Spectator say
(at the horrid sight thereof) This is a Bloody Tragedy, namely, in respect of
the Object represented herein? And might he not also say as truly, This is an
Unbloody Tragedy? to wit, in respect of the Representative Subject, Action,
and Commemoration it self, seeing that there is not here shed any one drop of
man's Blood? And from the same Evidence it will be easy to perceive, that the
Greek Fathers used to term the Eucharist [(...)] and the Latins Tremendum,
that is, a Terrible and Dreadful Sacrifice, (namely) for the Semblance-sake,
and Analogy it has with Christ's Death: even as one would call the Act,
representing the cruel Butchering of the Emperor Mauritius, an Horrible and
Lamentable Spectacle. This is a clear Glass, wherein any may discern the
open visage of Truth, from the feigned Vizard of Error.

The ninth Demonstration, Because Ancient Fathers likewise called the Sacrament
of Baptism a Sacrifice, for the Representation-sake which it has of Christ's
Death; which is Argumentum a paribus. SECT. XIII.
We shall not urge the Antecedent of this Argument, taken from Baptism,
before that we have made known the force of the Consequence thereof. First
one of your Cardinals thus; Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. Si Patres
existimarunt Eucharistiam solum esse Sacramentum, and non etiam Sacrificium,
nulla esset causa cur aliter loquerentur de Eucharistia, quam de Baptismo.
Nusquam autem Patres Baptismum vocant Sacrificium, nec dicunt Baptizare esse
Sacrificare, vel immolare. Quo modo igitur possibile est Patres in modo
loquendi nobiscum, in sententia cum Adversarijs convenisse?. Hic igitur. Rursus
Baptismus est Sacramentum Repraesentationis mortis Christi, Romans 6. Et tamen
nulli veterum Baptismum Sacrificium Deo oblatum unquam appellaverunt: non
igitur sola repraesentatio causa esse potuit, cur actio Coenae Sacrificium
appellaretur. Ibid.. Tert. bapt.
If the Fathers had held the Eucharist to be only a Sacrament, and not also a
Sacrifice, there had been no cause why they should not have called Baptism a
Sacrifice, it being a Representation of Christ's death: But the Fathers do no
where call Baptism a Sacrifice. So he. Another Cardinal thus, Card. Alan.
Patres abusos esse nomine Sacrificij -- quis possit cum Haereticis vel tenuiter
suspicari, cum hoc solum eo nomine appellent, nec alteri fete Sacramento unquam
tribuunt? Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14.
Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spoke abusively, in calling the
Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the only Sacrament, which they call a
Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned Jesuit with you, who would
be loath to come behind any in vehemency and boldness, thus; Suarez Ies. In
multis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium incruentum -- Solum est observandum,
propter Haereticos, qui hoc etiam ad metaphoram detorquent nomen, Sacrificium.
Sanctos Patres nunquam vocasse Ministerium Baptismi, aut alterius Sacramenti
nomine Sacrificij, cum tamen Sacrificium Metaphorice sumptum in eo conveniet.
Cum ergo Eucharistiam simpliciter and absolutissime Sacrificium vocant, signum
est eos proprie de Sacrificio loqui. Tom. 3. D^sp 74. Sect. 2. page 952.
Ancient Fathers never called Baptism or the Ministry thereof a Sacrifice;
albeit they might have so called it Metaphorically: which we note (says he)
because of the Heretics, who pervert the speeches of the Fathers, as if they
had called the Eucharist a Sacrifice Metaphorically, and Improperly. So they,
to omit M. Fisher, for one.
Others. Now then if there be any sap or sense in these your Objectors, it is
as much as if they had reasoned against us thus; If you Heretics (for so they
call Protestants) could show that the Ancient Fathers did any where name the
Sacrament of Baptism a Sacrifice, which we confess to be only but a
Representation of Christ's death, then should we need no other Reason to
persuade us that the Fathers called the Sacrament of the Eucharist a Sacrifice
also, Improperly, only because it represents the Body and Blood of Christ
sacrificed on the Cross. Thus for the Consequence confessed by your own
chiefest Advocates.

The Assumption lies upon us to prove, to wit, that the Fathers Baptism a
Sacrifice, even from the words of the Apostle, Hebr. 10. 20. where, speaking of
Baptism, he says; To them that sin voluntarily, there remains no
Sacrifice for sin. Saint Augustine testifyeth of the Doctors of the Church
Catholic, before his time, that Hebr. 10. 26. [Voluntarie peccantibus non
relinqu^^ur Sacrificium pro peccato.] Qui dili, (...) pertractant hunc locum
Apostoli, intelligunt de Holocausio Dominicae passionis, quod eo tempore offert
quisque pro peccatis suis, quo ejusdem passionis fide baptizatus. Vt sit
sensus, [Non relinquitur Sacrificium pro peccatis] hoc est, non potest denuo
baptizando purgari. August. Tom. 4. Expos. ad Romans Col. 1185, 1186, 1187.
They, who more diligently handled this Text, understood it of the Sacrifice of
Christ's Passion, which every one then offers, when he is baptized into the
faith of Christ. So that holy Father, who is a Witness without all Exception;
yet if, peradventure, we should need any testimony our of your own Schools,
the witness of your Canus Milchior Canus. Quaeris quid Causae plerisque
Antiquorum fuerit, ut Baptismum Hostiam appellaverint, ideoque dixerint non
superesse Hostiam pro peccato? (Heb. 10.) quia Baptismus repeti non potest --
Et quia per Baptismum applicatur nobis Hostia crucis. Hinc illi Baptisma
translatitie hostiam nuncuparunt. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. page 424.
That most of the Fathers, by Sacrifice, in this place understood Baptism,
which they so called Metaphorically, because by it the Sacrifice of the Cross
is applied unto us. So he. Is not this enough for the understanding of the
Dialect, and of the speech of Ancient Fathers; both in calling Baptism a
Sacrifice, and of the Reason thereof, to wit, for Representation and
Application-sake only; and Consequently, that the Body and Blood of Christ are
not the representing Subject, but the represented Object of his Sacrifice? What
better satisfaction can the greatest Adversary desire, than

The tenth Demonstration, Because the Fathers called the Eucharist a Sacrifice,
in respect of diverse such Acts as are excluded by the Romish Doctors out
THe Acts excluded by your Cardinal out of the number of Proper Sacrifices,
are Bellarmin. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Sed omissa. -- Omne Sacrificium est
Oblatio, sed non omnis Oblatio Sacrificium, hoc fit cum (...) oblata consumitur.

such as is the Offerings of Bread and Wine by the People, before it be
Consecrated. Next Bellarm. Opera virtutum non sunt proprie dicta Sacrificia.

cap. 3. Resp. Martyrum.
All works of Virtue are unproperly called Sacrifices. All works which
consist in Action, being transient, as Bowing, singing of Psalms, or the sole
Commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Cross: together with all such Acts
performed to God, which otherwise are yielded to man, as the Gesture of
Uncovering the head in Gods Service, Bowing the knee, and all outward signs of
Reverence, yea and all inward and invisible Acts of man in his will and
understanding. All these spiritual Acts Sacrifices. But that all these kind
of Acts, so far forth as they are exercised in the holy worship of God, are
called Sacrifices by the Ancient Fathers, can never be denied by any that ever
was acquainted with their Writings.

Now our Demonstration is this, that most of these Acts, which are here
confessed to be Improper Sacrifices, being used in the Celebration of the
Supper of our Lord, occasioned the Fathers to call the Eucharist it self a
Sacrifice; and therefore they meant thereby no Proper Sacrifice. As first (by
your Cassand. Liturg. cap. 22. Ordo celebrandi Missam, secundum Romanos,
celebrante Pontifice, extractus ex varijs libellis -- Ibid. cap. 27. Populus
dat Eleemosynas suas, id est, Panem and vinum, tam masculi quam foeminae. Ibid.

Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spoke abusively, in calling the
Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the only Sacrament, which they call a
Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned Jesuit with you, who would
be loath to come behind any in vehemency and boldness, thus; Suarez Ies. In
multis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium incruentum -- Solum est observandum,
propter Haereticos, qt Isidorus, dictum quasi sacrum factum, quia prece mystica

Confession) that the Fathers called The Oblations of Bread and Wine, made by
the People before Consecration, Sacrifices; the Alms, and Collections for the
poor, Sacrifices; Our Praises and Thanksgiving to God (whereof the Eucharist
has it is name) Sacrifice: and that many other Circumstantiall Acts are called
Sacrifices, even the Sole Act of our Commemoration, as will appear in our last
Examination concerning the Doctrine of Protestants. * But yet some of you
(among others your Pamelius) are so greedy of a Sacrifice in the Mass, that
they will force Tertullian to speak for it, even where (as is confessed

Our Eleventh Demonstration, Because the Relatives of Sacrifice, which are
Altar and Priest, Objected as Properly taken, are used Improperly of Ancient
Fathers. SECT. XV.
Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice, are Relatives, and have mutual and unseparable
Dependence one of each other. So he, and truly. But you ought to take with you
a necessary Caution, observed by the same Bellarm. -- Sunt Relata, ita ut
Sacrificium proprie dictum Sacerdotio proprie dicto; and Sacrificio improprie
dicto improprie dictum sacerdotium respondeant. Lib. 1. de Missa, ca. 2..

Cardinal, that An unproper Sacrifice cannot infer a proper Priesthood: nor
an unproper Priesthood a proper Sacrifice, etc. otherwise, your Jesuit can
tell you of a Maldonat. Ies. Serpens aeneus suit Sacrificium commemorativum

Sacrifice without an Altar, and your Abulens. in Ios. 22. Altar hoc non
fuerat ad Sacrificium offerendum. Quaest. 9.
Bishop can point you out an Altar without a Sacrifice. Wherefore to take one
of these improperly, and the other properly, were as wild Sophistry, It was
not so from the Beginning? Hereunto we claim but your own common
Confessions, viz, Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17. Neque. -- Neque obstat
quod Ministri Ecclesiastici non dicebantur Sacerdotes, aut utebantur nominibus
templi, sacrificij. Altaris, and similib, quia tempore Apostoloru^ vigebat
Sacerdotium Iudaicum, ideo abstinebant abijsdem vocibus, ne viderentur eosdem
illos ritus innovare.
That the Apostles did willingly abstain from the words of Sacrifice,
[Sacerdos,] and Altar. So your Cardinal, and Eodem modo Durantus de Ritibus,
lib. 1. cap. 1. number. 7.
Durantus, the great Advocates for your Roman Mass: whereby they have
condemned not only other your Romish Disputers, who See above Cha. 3. Sect. 8.
have sought a Proof of a Proper Sacrifice in your Mass from the word Altar,
used by the Apostle Paul, Heb. 13. but also themselves, Luke, Act. 3. [(...)]
See above Chap. 2. Sect. 1.
concluded a Proper Sacrifice. As if the Apostles had both abstained and not
abstained from the words of Priest and Sacrifice. * And again your Jesuit
Lorinus; Lorin. Ies. in Act. 14. 22. de Sacerdote. Ab hoc abstinet novum
Testamentum, ut magis proprio antiqui legis Sacrificij, vel Idolorum, concedo.
The New Testament (says he) abstained from the word [ Graece, (...).
Sacerdos] as from that which is more Proper to the Old Testament. So he.
Wherefore this and the English word, Priest, having a different Relation, one
to a Sacrificing Minister (which is proper to the Old Testament) the other as
it is derived from Graece (...).
Presbyter,] in the New Testament, which is Senior, and has no Relation to any
Sacrificing Function: It must follow, that your Disputers seeking to urge the
Signification of a Sacrificing Office, proper to the Old Testament, for Proof
of a Sacrificing Act, proper to the New, perform as fond and fruitless a
labor, as is the patching of old Vestments with new pieces, whereby the rent
is made worse. *

But the Apostles did indeed forbear such terms in their speeches, concerning
Christian worship, whereof these your forenamed Disputers can give us a Reason,
See the former Testimony at (d.)
Lest that (say they) the Jewish Priesthood being as yet in force, Christians
might seem, by using Jewish Terms, to innovate Jewish Rites. Which is enough
to show, that you are persuaded they abstained from the use of these words for
some Reason. Yet that this could not be the Reason, you may be sufficiently
instructed in the word, Baptism, this being as fully Jewish, as was either the
word Priest, Altar, or Temple: and yet used of the Apostle without danger of
Innovation of the Jewish manner of Baptismes. Altar, Priest, Sacrifices, to be
essential parts of Christian Religion, they neither would nor ought to have
concealed the words and names, lest thereby they might have seemed to have
abhorred the proper Characters of our Christian Profession.

We descend to the Fathers. It is not unknown unto you, how the Fathers
delighted themselves, in all their Treatises, with Jewish Ceremonial Terms,
only by Allegorical Allusions, as they did with the word Synagogue, applying
it to Arc, to the Church; Holocaust, to Mortification; Levite, to Deacons;
Incense, to Prayers and Praises; and the word Pascha to the day of the
Resurrection of Christ. But if any should say, that these Fathers used any of
these words in a proper Signification, he should wrong both the common sense
of these Fathers, and his own Conscience. It were superfluous to urge many
Instances, where one will serve. The word, Altar, applied to the Table of the
Lord (which anciently stood in the Eusebius. Hist. lib. 10. cap. 4. Ex Orat.
Danegyr. Paulino Tyriorum Episcopo dedicata, qui Basilicam ibi construxit.
Sanctuario hoc modo absoluto and perfecto, sellisque quibusdam in, altissimo

they used to do in August. quaest. super Exodus lib. 2. cap. 9. Altar est

applying the name, Altar, to Gods People, and to a Christian man's Faith and
Heart.

* All this notwithstanding, you are not to think that we do hereby oppugn
the Appellation of Priest and Altar, or yet the now Situation thereof in our
Church, for use as Convenient, and for order more Decent; but only the of this
Truth, if you will be pleased to observe that Christ, in the time of the first
Institution and Celebration of this Sacrament, propounded it, in the place
where he, with his Disciples, gave it unto them to be Eaten and Drunken; then
tell us where it was ever known, that any Altar was ordained for Eating and
Drinking? In Gods Book we find, Levit. 9. that the Priests themselves were
not permitted to eat their Oblation On, but, Besides the Altar. Neither may
you think it any Derogation to this Sacrament, that the place, whereon it is
Celebrated, is not called an Altar of the Lord, seeing the Spirit of God, by
his Apostle, The Supper of the Lord, and the Vessel prepared for the Liquid,
The Cup of the Lord; so did he name the place whereon it was set, The Table of
the Lord, and the Contemners thereof, Guilty of the Body and Blood of the
Lord; and thereupon did denounce the Vengeance and Plague, which fell upon
profane Communicants, The Judgment of the Lord: and all these in one Chapter,
1. Cor. 11. The like Difference may be discerned between your manner of
Reverence, in Bowing toward the Altar for Adoration of the Eucharist only:
and ours in Bowing as well when there is no Eucharist on the Table, as when
there is, which is not to the Table of the Lord, but to the Lord of the Table,
to testify the Communion of all the Faithful Communicants thereat; even as
the People of God did, in Adoring him before the Arc his Footstool, Psalm. 99.
5. and 1. Chron. 28. 2. as Daniels Bowing at Prayer in Chaldea, looking toward
the Temple of Jerusalem, where the Temple of Gods Worship was, Dan. 6. 10. And
as David would be known to have done, saying, Psalm. 5. 7. I will Worship
toward thy holy Temple:

Gregory Nazianzen, for his soundness of Judgment Surnamed the Divine,
comparing this Inferior Altar, and Sacrifice on earth, with the Body of Christ
seated in Heaven, faith that the Sacrifices, which he offers in his
Contemplation at the Altar in Heaven, are Nazian. orat. 28. -- Esto, ego pellor
ab. Altari in Ecclesia: at novi aliud Altar mentis and contemplationis in
coelo, ibi adstabo, and Deo offeram Sacrificia, quae sunt tanto acceptiora,
quam ea quae offerimus ad Altar, quanto pretiosior est veritas quam umbra.
More acceptable than the Sacrifices, which are offered at the Altar Below, as
much as Truth is more excellent than the Shadow. So he. Therefore (say we)
the Sacrifice Body and Blood are subjectively in Heaven, but objectively here
in the Eucharist; here Representative only, as in a Shadow, but in Heaven
presentatively, in his Bodily presence. So vainly your Disputers hitherto
(whilst that we required Materials) have objected against us bare words,
phrases, and very shadows.

Lastly, Cyril of Alexandria Cyril. Alexand. cont. Julian. lib. 9 (Julian. Ob.)
Iudaei sacrificant, -- vos autem invento novo Sacrificio -- quare non
sacrificatis? -- illud commune nobiscum habent, etiam Templa, Altaria, etc.
(Resp. Cyril multo post,) Vitae honestas, and ad meliora propensio est
Sacrificium fragrantissimum -- Et Paulus hortatur nos exhibere corpora nostra
Sacrificium sanctum, rationalem cultum nostrum Deo. -- Igitur etsi Iudaei
sacrificarent, ut in umbris praecepta implerent, nos tamen lata via euntes, ad
id quod rectum est veniemus, nempe spiritualem and immortalem cultum
proficientes. (Julian.) Mosi dicitur, septem diebus azymis vescemini: vobis
parum est abstulisse. (Cyril. Resp.) Impletur Lex a nobis in azymis, maxim
fide justificatis in Spiritu, mentalemque cultum praeponentibus tali modo. --
Vnde scribit D. Paulus, ut diem agamus in azymis sinceritatis and veritatis.
(Rursus, Julian. ibid. lib. 10) Offerre Sacra in Altari, and sacrificare

mentalia: nam illi ex sanguine offerebant boves, and oves, -- Et ex fructibus

pro nobis Christus A^nus verus.
made an Answer to the Objections, then published by Julian the Apostate,
against the Truth of Christian Religion. By this conflict between these two
wits, as it were by the clashing of a Stone and Steel together, such a flash
of lightning will appear, as may sufficiently illuminate every Reader, for the
understanding of the Judgment of Antiquity throughout the whole Cause,
concerning Bodily Sacrifice.

The Apostate objecteth (See the Margin) as an Exception against Christians,
that they are not Circumcised, that they use no Azymes, nor keep the Passover
of the Jews: albeit, Cain, Abel, and Abraham before the Law, and the
Israelites under the Law, and Heathenish Grecians always without that Law,
offered Sacrifices unto God. But they (says Julian, writing of Christians)
erect no Altars unto God, offer no such Sacrifices as were of old, nor invent
any new, but say that Christ was once offered for them. This Objection (you
see) is pertinent to our Cause in hand, and as consonant will the Answer of the
holy Patriarch Cyril be; who to the other points held it Satisfaction enough to
say (see again the Marginalls) That we Christians have the spiritual
Circumcision of the heart: That we observe the spiritual Azymes of Syncerity
and Truth: And as for the Passover, Christ our Passover was offered up,
namely upon the Cross (for so is it answerable to the words objected by
Julian.) And to the Objection of not erecting Altars, Cyril says not a word.

But what for the point of Sacrifice? Hearken, (we pray you) Although (says
he) the Jews Sacrificed to fulfill Gods Precepts in shadows, yet we doing
that which is right (meaning the Truth opposite to Shadows) perform a
spiritual, and mental worship, as namely, Honesty, and an holy Conversation.
And again, The Jews offered in Sacrifice Bulls and Sheep, first fruits of the
Earth, Cakes, and Frankincense: but we offer that which is spiritual, to wit,
Faith, Hope, Charity, and Praises; because an unbodily Sacrifice is fit for
God. And yet again, We Sacrifice to God spiritually, and mentally, the
perfumes of virtues. This is the sum of Saint Cyril his Answer, void of all
mention of any Offering of the Body of Christ, as either Corporally present in
the Eucharist to be Sacrificed by the Priest, or yet of any Corporal thereof
(by eating) with the Bodies of Communicants; no nor any intimation of any
Proper Sacrifice professed by Christians.

Here will be no place for your Answer, to tell us that the Question was of
Bloody, and not of Unbloody Sacrifices: No, for Cyril in his Answer handles as
well the unbloody Sacrifice of Cain, as the Bloody Oblation of Abel; and
expresses as fully the unbloody Sacrifice of Cakes and Frankincense, as he
does the Bloody of Sheep, and Oxen.

Nevertheless, we should confute our selves, for objecting Mystery of the
Sacrament of Baptism, or of the Eucharist, either to infidels or
Catechumenists, and therefore this silence of Cyril, in not so much as
mentioning the Sacrifice of the Mass, might seem to have been purposely
done, to conceal it from Julian, the Patron of Heathenish worship. So indeed
we should have thought, but that then Julian and Cyril both would as readily
confute us; Julian, because he himself had been more than a Catechumenist in
the Church of Christ, even (as namely Gregory Nazianzene witnesses) once Greg.
Nazian. Orat. 3. advers. Julian. (De Gallo et Iuliano) Quinetiam in Clerum
seipsos ascripserunt, ut divinos quoque libros plebi lectitarent: non minus id
sibi amplum and honorificum existimantes quam aliud quidvis, etc.
A Reader of Scriptures to the people, not thinking it any Derogation unto him
so to do; therefore was he not ignorant of the (then) Christian Doctrine,
concerning the Eucharist. And (which is a point as observable) when he
objecteth against Christians want of Sacrifices, by and by, as if Christians
had nothing to say for themselves, but that Christ gave up himself once; he
expresses this their Answer, as that which he held not to be sufficient. And
Cyril also would control us, who in his whole Answer (opposing Spiritual to
Corporal) defends no Sacrifice at all among Spiritual and Mental; as for
Example, Godly Conversation, Faith, Hope, Charity, Praises, etc. All which are
See Chap. 5. Sect. 14
excluded out of your Definition of Proper Sacrifice.

The Case then is plain. If that the now Romish Doctrine of a Proper Bodily
Sacrifice of Christ's Body, offered up in the hands of the Priest, by an
Elevation, and after in Consummating the same by eating it with his Mouth,
which you call a Sacrificing Act, had been Catholic learning in that Age,
then assuredly could neither Julian have challenged No Sacrifice, nor Cyril
have defended them, by confessing indeed No Sacrifice among Christians, but
only Spiritual and Mental. * And undoubtedly if Material Altars (properly
so called) had been in use in Christianity at that time, the holy Fathers
would not have then concealed this, especially when as the want of Altars was
objected against them, as a note of Origin. cont. Celsum. lib. 7. Ob. Celsi.

CHAP. VI.
Our third Examination, which concerns your Profession of the Romish Mass,
by your Romish Principles.
The State of the Question.
WEll have you discerned of the twofold acception of a Proper Sacrifice, which
(as Bellarm. Sacrificium Missae accipitur proprie pro^re, quae sacrificatur:
and etiam accipitur proprie pro action sacrificandi. Lib. 1. de Missa, Cap.
27.. Resp. ut.
you say) Is sometime taken for the thing sacrificed, and also for the proper
sacrificing Act. So your Cardinal: and indeed, both these are necessary in a
Proper Sacrifice, yet neither of these can possibly be found in your pretended
Sacrifice of your Romish Mass.

That the Thing, pretended to be Sacrificed, is not Properly
THe things, which your Romish Belief professes to be Sacrificed in your
Mass, is the Body and Blood of Christ, corporally extant therein, as the
proper Subject thereof. But that there is no Corporal Existence of Christ's
Body in the Eucharist, was the Conclusion of our second, third, and fourth
Books. And that the same Body and Blood of Christ is not the Sacrifice, used
in your Mass, is our Conclusion throughout this whole Book. Of both which you
may have a Synopsis and general view in the last Book. Thus of the thing
Sacrificed, now that which follows, concerning your Romish Sacrificing Act,
is a Point briefly expedited by two Propositions.

I. That no Act, now used in the Roman Mass, can truly be called a proper
Sacrificing Act: proved by
Whatsoever Sacrificing Act your Advocates have held, as Proper to a
Sacrifice; and assumed, as belonging to the Sacrifice of your Mass, have each
one been See above Chap. 1. Sect. 5.
Confuted by Doctors of your own, Church of singular estimation; and rejected
as utterly insufficient to prove any Proper Sacrificing Act in the Institution
of Christ: to wit, not Elevation, not Fraction, not Oblation, not Consecration,
and lastly, not Consumption of the Eucharist by the mouth of the Priest. Non
licet actum agere, said one, and Non libet, say we. But now are we to
discuss such Properties, as are yet awanting in your Romish Execution.

II. That that, which is properly a Sacrificing Act, is wanting
THree Properties are required of you, as necessary to a properly Sacrificing
Act, the first is, that the Action be exercised upon a thing Council. Trid.
Christus tradebat visibile Sacramentum sub specie panis and vini. Sess. 22. et
Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27.. Secundo.
Visible. Secondly, that the thing sacrificed be of Septimo, ritu mystico
consecratur: nam debet res illa, quae Deo offertur, ex profana fieri sacra.
Idem significat Sacrificare, quod sacrum facere. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa,

the Old Law, all which suffered Destruction; things living by slaughter, things

etc. So you in Thesi, we descend to the Hypothesis.

But before we enter into this Disquisition, we shall desire you to take unto
you the spirits of reasonable men, whilst we Properly Visible, which is not
Visible in it self. But the Body of Christ, which you call the thing
sacrificed, is not Visible in it self, but only (as your Council of Conc.
Trid. and Bellarm above cited,. 3. at (a.)
Trent has taught) In the form of Bread; and then, how invisible it is, only
blind men can be ignorant. Nor will we think All, among you, to be so
blind, seeing that we hear one (and that a Jesuit) acknowledging his
eyesight, and plainly, without Parables, saying, that Salmeron. Christus
cruentus, and incruentus, non differunt, sed quod ille visibilis, hic
invisibills. Tom 9 Tract. 29. Iam de.
Christ in the Eucharist is invisible. So he. Therefore the first Property of
a proper Sacrificing Subject is wanting in your Roman Mass.

Secondly, we will not judge any of you so blasphemous, as to say, that the
Body of Christ, by your Consecration, is of a Profane thing made sacred, which
we are sure your ancient Romish School did deny; which concluded that
Aquinas. Benedictio sacerdotalis fertur super terminu^ a quo, non super
terminum ad quem, i. e. super corpus Christi. In 1. Cor. 10.
It is not Christ that is made sacred, by benediction of the Priest, but that
which the Priest first takes in his hands to bless. And so your Act of
Consecration, by defect of the second property; is no proper Sacrificing Act of
the Body and Blood of

Thirdly, it will be as incredible even in your own Judgments, that the Body
of Christ should be properly Destroyed. We say, in your own Judgments, who
therefore are constrained to say, Bellar. Corpus Christi per consecrationem
accepit formam cibi, and ad comestionem and destructionem ordinatur: and licet
nullam laesionem patiatur in se, neque amittit suum esse natural, sed amittit.
Sacramentale Esse, and proinde desinit esse realiter in Altari, and desinit
esse cibus sensibilis. Lib. 1. de Missa. Cap. 27.. Tertio.
that The Body of Christ indeed suffers not herein any natural Destruction,
but only Sacramental, that is, Metaphorical. Ergo, your Romish Mass is
destitute of the proper Sacrificing Act of Destruction. And again, whereas the
word, Immolation, is taken of Lombardus cum quaeritat, quid Sacerdos gerit, sit
dicendum Sacrificium aut Immolatio, accipit nomen Immolationis pro occisione:
respondet autem rectissime, Christum semel tantum immolatum, id est, occisum
fuisse, non autem immolari, id est, occidi in Sacramento and repraesentatione.
Bellorm. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 15. Rursus paulo superius. Ad hanc. -- Cruenta
Immolatio semel tantum vere and proprie facta est, nunc autem non proprie, sed
p^r Repraesentationem. Lib. 4. Did. 12.. Post haec.
Lombard for being Slain, or suffering by Death; It was most truly said by him
(says your that Christ is not properly immolated, meaning not slain, but
only in Representation.

Well then, the State of the Question, as your Cardinal himself has set it
down, is (seeing that every Proper Sacrifice requires a Proper Destruction,
and, if it be a living Sacrifice, a Destruction by death) Whether Christ be
properly Sacrificed, or no. Mark, we pray you, your Cardinal's Resolution.
His bloody Sacrifice was but once truly and properly done, but now it is not
properly done, but by Representation. O Spirit of Contradiction! For, that
which is but once only properly properly offered; and that which is a Bloody
Oblation, by your own learning cannot be Unbloody.

And as great an Intoxication is to be seen in your Disputers, in respect of
the other part of the Sacrament touching the Cup: For your Cardinal Alan
defends a Real Destruction in this manner; Alanus de Eucharist. lib. 2 cap.
13. In carnis and sanguinis separatione (unde proprie in animalibus mactatio)
consistit vis hujus mysterij, ut in eo solo cernatur divinae mortis
repraesentatio -- sequitur Christum esse praesentem, modo immolatio -- quod
sunditur in remissione peccatorum: ergo per modum Victimae praesens est, imo
Christus hic praesens induit eum modum, quem habuit ut se offerens in
Sacrificio Crucis. (Aliquanto post haec.) Propter concomitantiam, de qua
superius diximus, in seipso non moritur.
In creatures living (says he) the thing sacrificed must be slain, and in
this slaying by the separation of blood from the Body does consist all force
and virtue of this Mystery, because Christ is herein, after the manner of
Sacrifice, taking upon him the manner of Sacrificing, which he had in offering
himself upon the Cross, by separation of his Blood. So he. All which does
infer a Real and Proper separation and effusion of Blood; yet immediately
after stands he to the Defense of Concomitancie, which teaches an Union of
Body and Blood together, in as full a manner as it was in Christ his most
perfect estate. But Blood Separated, and United, are as (...) contrary as can
be. How much better would it beseem you to confess plainly and truly with
your Costerus, that Costerus Christian. Institut. lib. 1. cap. 10. Christus in
cruce solus seipsum obtulit per vera^ sanguinis effusionem and mortem: hic per
Sacerdotem, tanquam ministrum, se offert sine Sanguinis effusione and morte,
sed per utr^usque repraesentationem.
Christ is not offered herewith effusion of Blood, but by a representation
thereof. Thus still we see your own Doctors come in your most controverted

CHALLENGE.
A Syllogism will quit the Business; as for Example.

Every proper Sacrifice is properly Visible, of Profane is made Sacred, and
properly suffers Destruction. (This is your own Proposition in each part.)

But the Body of Christ, in the Eucharist, is neither properly nor properly of
Profane made Sacred, nor suffers any proper Destruction. (This is also your
own Assumption.)

Therefore the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, is not a proper Sacrifice,
nor properly Sacrificed. This (except men have lost their brains) must needs
be every man's Conclusion. And that so much the rather, because it cannot be
sufficient, that Christ's Body be present in the Eucharist, to make it a
Sacrifice, without some Sacrificing Act. A Sheep is no Sacrifice whilst it
remains in the Fold, nor can every Action Destructive Act: for the Sheep does
not become therefore a Sacrifice, because it is shorn, nor yet can any
Destructive Act be held Sacrificing, which is not prescribed by Divine
Authority; which only cun ordain a Sacrifice, as has been confessed. But no
such divine ordinance has hitherto been proved.

Is it not then a miserable case which you are in, to suffer your selves to be
deceived by such Mountebankes, who pretend to direct men's Consciences in the
Mysteries of Christian Faith, and particularly concerning this high point of
Proper Sacrifice? Visible, not Visible, Consecrated, not Consecrated,
Destroyed, and not Destroyed, with Blood separated, and not separated from the
Body; and each one spoken of the same Body of Christ. Our last point concerning
a proper Sacrifice follows.

CHAP. VII.
Our Fourth Examination is of the Doctrine of PROTESTANTS, in the point of
Sacrifice.
IN discussion whereof, we are to consider first the Acts, which are incident
unto the Celebration of this Sacrament: and then the Object thereof, which is
Body of Christ, as it was Sacrificed upon the Cross. In respect of the Acts
we say,

I. That Spiritual Sacrifices, albeit Improper, are in one respect more true,
and do far excel all merely Corporal Sacrifices, according to Scripture.
SECT. I.
WHen Christ called himself the True Vine, the True light, the True Bread; in
respect of the Natural Vine, Light, and Bread; He taught us to distinguish
between a Truth of Excellency, and a Truth of Propriety, by their different
Effects. That which has the natural property of Bread (although Manna)
preserves but the temporal life, for John 6. See above Book 5. Sect. 6.
They ate Manna, and dyed: but the Bread of Excellency, which is Christ's Body,
preserves to Ibid.
Immortality. It is a good Observation, which your Canus has, that Canus. Quia
per Sacrificia legis externae res quaedam spirituales potiores praesignabantur,
has omnino res, Sacrificia, holocausta, hostias sacrae literae appellant: ut
mactationes brutorum animalium figurae erant mortificationis. Loc. Theolog.
lib. 12. cap. 12.. In secundo.
Many spiritual things are called Sacrifices, in Scriptur, because they were
prefigured by the outward bodily Sacrifices of the Lamb: as the killing of
Beasts were signs of mortification, which is a killing of sin. So he. And
the thing Archetypally prefigured (you know) is always held more excellent
than the figure thereof.

First, the Sacrifice of Contrition, Psalm. 51. 17. The Sacrifice of God is a
Contrite heart. Secondly, of Righteousness, Psalm. 4. 5. Offer the Sacrifice
of Righteousness. And Romans 12. 1. by Mortification and Vivification, Present
your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your
reasonable Service. Thirdly, the Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise, Hosea 14. 2.
We will render the Calves of our lips. Fourthly, of Almes-workes, Heb. 13. 16.
With such Sacrifices God is well pleased. Fifthly, Sacrifice the fruit of
Preaching, Romans 15. 16. That I ministering the Gospel, that the offering up of
the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Ghost. Sixthly,
the Sacrifice of Martyrdom, Phil. 2. 17. Yea, and if I be offered up upon the
Sacrifice and Service of your faith, etc. Next we say,

II. That all these Spiritual Acts, although Improperly called Sacrifices, yet
are they more excellent than all merely Corporal and Proper Sacrifices; in
the Judgment of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II.
Upon this Contemplation Ancient Fathers have breathed out many divine
Ejaculations, for the expressing of the excellent Prerogatives of Spiritual
Sacrifices, in respect of Corporal. Of the Sacrifice of Contritition, thus:
Non terrenis, sed spiritualibus est Deo litandum. Tertull. adversus Iudaeos.
Gods wrath is to be appeased with Spiritual Sacrifices. And Erant tum
Sacrificia pro delicto, quae nunc sunt Sacrificia poenitentiae de delicto.
Ambros. lib. 3. Epist. 28.
They were then Sacrifices for sin, which are now Sacrifices of Repentance
for sin. And Spiritus contribulatus. -- Ostendit Deus, se velle Sacrificium,
non trucidati pecoris, sed contriti pectoris. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. 20. cap.
5.
God shows he will not have the Sacrifice of a slain beast, but of a
contrite breast. Of the Sacrifice of Righteousness, thus; Mundo moriens, ipse
est Sacrificium. Idem.
He that dies to the world, is for himself a Sacrifice. And Tunc corpora pro
corporibus; nunc non corpora, sed vitia corporis perimenda. Arnob. cont. Gentes.
Then were Creatures slain to cleanse men's Bodies: but now are men to mortify
their vices: (...) -- (...), etc. Isid. Pelus. lib. 3. Epist. 75.
Every one And Illi offerebant oves and boves: nos tam crasso praeterito
Sacrificio subtle offerimus, virtutes omnigenas: Sacrificium enim minime
carnale, secundum naturam incorpoream, decet Deum. Ambros. [The same which he
has translated word for word out of Cyril. Alex. cont. Julian. See above,
toward the end of Chap. 5.]
They offered those gross Bodies of sheep: but we the more subtle and pure
of virtues, because unbloody things best agree with God. And Chrysostom. in Genesis
Hom. 60. (...).
This is a new and admirable Sacrifice. And Pelusiota. lib. 3. Ep. 75. (...).
The best Sacrifice is to have a pure Mind and a chaste Body.

Of the Spiritual Sacrifice of Prayer and Praises unto God, thus; Preces and
Gratiarum actiones factae Deo, (...). Justin. Dial. cum Tryphone Iudaeo. And
another upon that Psalm. 68. of David [Canticum laudis plus placet Deo quam
novella] observes in the Hebrew an elegant Allusion, as if it had been said,
Deo magis placet Schir, quam Schior, id est, Canticum, quam vitulus. Bellar.
ibid.
These are most perfect and only Sacrifices acceptable to God. Of Preaching
the Word of God, thus; Gladio verbi mactans vltia. Hier and rursus in Psalm. 26.
Hostia jubilationis, hostia praedicationis.
We slay vices with the sword of the Word. And of The Function Evangelicall,
Chrysostom. in Psalm. 95. Munus Evangelicum Sacrificium mundum and immaculatum.
It is a pure Sacrifice, and immaculate. And Sacrificium praedicationis omnibus
aromatibus praestantius. Aug.
A Sacrifice sweeter than all Spices. Of Almesworkes, thus; (...) dicunt, vel
quod ea Deus prae Sacrificijs placere sibi testatur: haec sancta vestis aromata
Sactorum est. Chrysostom.
These God testifies to be more pleasant unto him, than all the Sacrifices.
And Vbi scriptum est, [Misericordiam magis volo quam Sacrificium] nihil aliud
quam Sacrificiu^ Sacrificio praelatum intelligi opportet: quoniam quod ab
hominibus appellatur Sacrificium, signum est very Sacrificij. Aug. lib. 10. de
Civit. cap. 5.
This is a true Sacrifice, whereof the other Sacrifices are but Signs. Of
Martyrdom, thus; Nos templum Dei sumus omnes, cor nostrum altar Dei, cruentas
victimas caedimus, quando usque ad sanguinem pro veritate certamus. Aug. ibid.
cap. 4.
We are Gods Temple, our hearts his Altars: we then offer up our bloody
Sacrifice, when we contend for the Truth with our Blood. In brief, Verum
Sacrificium est omne opus quod agitur, ut Deo in sancta societate haereamus:
relatumque ad illum sinem, ut beati esse possimus, Idem. lib. 10. de Civit.
cap. ^.
Every good work done, to the end that we may enjoy God, is a true Sacrifice.
* Your Cardinal Bellarmine lighting on this Sentence, wherein Saint Augustine
defines a Sacrifice to be every good work wrought, that we may in an holy
Society adhere unto God: Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2.. Vnum. -- Sanctus
Aug. lib. 10. de Civit. Dei, cap. 6. Sic definit Sacrificium: Sacrificium
(inquit) est opus omne quod agitur, ut sancta societate inhaereatur Deo,
relatum ad illum sinem, ut beati esse possimus. Respondeo, Vocat Opus tale
Sacrificium verum, ratione dignitatis and effectus, quod sit praestantius: non
ratione formae and essentiae Sacrificij proprie dicti.
This Saint Augustine spoke (says your Cardinal) not properly, according to
the essence of a Sacrifice, but in respect of the dignity and effects of every
such work. So he. * Hitherto of our Proposition, by the Determination of holy
Fathers. In the next place we say, for the Assumption,

III. That Protestants profess, in their Celebration, diverse Sacrifices of
chief Excellency. SECT. III.
Corporal and Spiritual Sacrifices are by you distinguished, calling the
first, Proper, and the other Improper; but the Spiritual excels by infinite
Degrees, as you have heard. In which kind Protestants, in their Celebration,
profess four sorts of Sacrifices. For proof hereof, we may instance in our
Church of In the English Liturgia.
England, most happily reformed and established. First, the Sacrifice of
Mortification in Act, and of Martyrdom in Vow, saying, [Wee offer unto thee, O
Lord, our selves, our souls, and bodies, to be an holy, lively, and reasonable
Sacrifice unto thee.] Next, a Sacrifice Eucharisticall, saying, [Wee desire thy
fatherly goodness mercifully to accept of our Sacrifice of Praise And why may
we not, with the Scripture, call this a Sacrifice? seeing that your Bishop
Iansenius held it for an Argument of proving Christ to have offered a
Sacrifice, even Iansen. Christu^ in coena Sacrificium obtuli^^e, primu^ quidem
satis est significatum, cum dicitur Gratias egisse: Gratiarum enim actio est
quoddam Sacrificium, a qua Christi action Sacramentum corporis and sanguinis
Domini nomen illud ab initio Ecclesia accepit. Concord. cap. 131.
Because he gave Thanks: giving of Thanks being a kind of Sacrifice. So he.
Thirdly, a Sacrifice Latreuticall, that is, of Divine worship, saying, [And
although we be unworthy to offer up any Sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to
accept of our bounden duty and service, etc.] This performance of our Bounden
Service is that, which See above Chap. 3. Sect. 5
Ancient Fathers called an Unbloody Sacrifice.

Nor is our Church of England alone in this Profession: this Truth we refer
unto the Report of your Bellarm. Melancthon Eucharistiam Sacrificium esse vult,
-- and Calvinus non solum (...) esse vult, sed etiam (...) and (...). Lib. 1.
de Missa, cap. 2.. Ac primum, and. Expendamus.

Immolationem, and Sacrificium, quia est commemoratio and repraesentatio very

Canus, by whom you may understand the agreement between them, whom you name
Lutherans, in their Augustane Confession, and of Calvin; by acknowledging not
some one Act, but the whole work of this Celebration (according to the
Institution of Christ) both in Communication, Commemoration, and Representation
of his Death, with Praise and Thanksgiving, to be a Sacrifice Eucharisticall:
And also (to use the words of Calvin) Latreuticall, and Sebasticall, that is, a
Sacrifice of Worship and Veneration; which every Christian may and must
profess, who has either eyes in his head, or faith Remembrance of his
absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption, being the Service of all Services that
we can perform to God. Now wherein, and in what respect we may furthermore
be said to offer to God a Sacrifice propitiatory, improperly, will after
appear, when we consider Christ's Body as the Object herein.

That Protestants in their Commemoration offer up the same Body and Blood of
Christ, which was Sacrificed on the Cross,
NOw we are come to the last, most true, and necessary Point, which is the
Body and Blood, as the Object of our Commemoration. Still, still do you urge
the Sayings of Fathers, where they affirm that we offer unto God The same
Body and Blood of Christ, on this Altar, even the same which was sacrificed on
the Cross; which therefore you interpret as being the same subject matter of
our Commemoration, As is a King acting himself upon a Stage, as has been See
above Chap. 5. Sect. 7.
shown.

We as instantly, and more truly, proclaim that we offer (Commemoratively)
the same, undoubtedly the very same Body and Blood of Christ his All-sufficient
Sacrifice on the Cross, although not as the Subject of his Proper Sacrifice,
but yet as the only adequate Object of our Commemoration; (as the Emperor
Mauritius is said to be represented in a Stage Play) wherein Do this in
remembrance of me, namely, of the same [Mee;] meaning Christ, as crucified on
the Cross, as the Apostle commenteth, saying, Hereby you show the Lords Death
till he come, even the Same Body, as the Same Death; whereunto bear all the
Fathers witness, throughout this Treatise. We say again, for your better
Observation, the Same Body, as the Same Death: but it cannot be the Same Death,
but objectively only. Ergo, can it not be the Same Body, but only
Objectively. Whereby it will be easy for us to discern the subject Sacrifice
of Christ from ours, his being the Real Sacrifice on the Cross, ours only
the Sacramental Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof.

* For your better satisfaction, We exhibit unto you the ancient Practice of
your Romish Church, in the Service of the Mass, celebrated every Saturday in
the Passion-weeke; wherein (as your Bellar. Recog. Librorum de Missa. Feria
sexta majoris hebdomadae non celebratur Missae sacrificium: qua^vis in illa
Action dicat Sacerdos, [Orate, Fratres, ut et meum et vestru^ Sacrificium
etc.] Et paulo ante; [Sic fiat Sacrificium nostru^ in conspectu tuo, ut placeat
Tibi, Domine Deus.] In his duobus lotis vox, Sacrificiu^, non videtur proprie
accipienda, sed largo modo pro tota ista Action. Et quod in ista feria Missa
non proprie celebretur, legimus in Ordine Romano antiquissimo. etc.
Cardinal does certify you and us) the Priest, in your Missall, Prays twice
to God to receive [His Sacrifice:] whole Action thereof being called a
Sacrifice. So he, even as directly for our purpose, as we could wish; hereby
justifying our Calling the Whole Celebration of the Eucharist (albeit Properly
a Sacrament only) a Sacrifice, in a Large and qualified Sense, according to
the Practice of ancient Fathers; as we have proved throughout the whole Sixth
Book, by Eleven Demonstrations.*

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Second Principal part of this Controversy, which concerns the
Romish Sacrifice, is as it is called Properly Propitiatory.
THis part is divided into an 1. Explication of that which you call
Propitiatory. 2. Application thereof, for Remission of Sins.


The State of the Question of Propitiatory, what it is. SECT. I.
THe whole Difference stands upon this, whether the subject matter of our
Representation in the hands of the Priest Properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice, or
no. Now Propitiatory is either that which pacifieth the wrath of God, and
pleases him by it is own virtue and efficacy, which (as all confess) is
only the Sacrifice of Christ in his own self; or else a thing is said to be
Propitiatory and pleasing to God, by God's Gracious acceptance and indulgence.
The Romish profess the Sacrifice of their Mass to be such, in the proper
Virtue of that which the Priest handles. For the Tridentine Faith, concerning
your Propitiatory Sacrifice, is this, viz. Synod. Trid. Sacrificium vere
propitiatorium -- Hujus oblatione placatur Deus, gratiam and donum poenitentiae
concedens dimittit peccata, una enim eademque hostia est, idem nam offerens
Sacerdotum ministerio, qui seipsum in cruce obtulit. Sess. 22. cap. 2.
It is that whereby God being pacified does pardon sins.

And least that there might be any ambiguity, how it does pacify God, whether
by his gracious Acceptance, or the Efficacy of offering, your general Roman
Chatechisme, authorized both by your Council of Trent, and the then Pope Pius
the fifth, for the direction of your whole Church, instructs you all,
concerning your Sacrifice of the Mass, that Catechis. Romans (Jussu Conc.
Trident. and Pij Quinti Pont. editus.) Vt Sacrificium est, non solum merendi,
sed and satisfaciendi quoque efficaciam habet. De Euch. number. 55. Oserius Ies.
Conc. Tom. 4. de Missae Sacrificio, in Psalm. 4. [Sacrificare Sacrificium.]
Vnicum hoc Sacrificiu^ est Sacrificium laudis, gratiarum actionis, expiatorium
and satisfactorium pro peccatis, and impetratorium pro vivis and defunctis Ita
tradit Conc. Trid.
As it is a Sacrifice, it has an Efficacy and Virtue, not only of merit, but
also of satisfaction. So they, as truly setting down the true nature of a
Propitiatory Sacrifice, as they do falsely assume and apply it unto the
Sacrifice of your Mass; which Protestants abhor Propitiatory (Improperly) by
God's Complacencie and favorable acceptance, wherewith he vouchsafes to
admit of the holy Actions and Affections of his faithful.

Trial of all this is to be made by Scriptures, and Fathers, by your own
Romish Principles, and by the Doctrine of Protestants. In the Interim, be it
known that our Church of England in her 31. Article, says of your
Propitiatory Sacrifice of A Blasphemous Fable, and Dangerous Deceit.

That the Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice has no foundation in the Institution
of Christ. SECT. II.
YOur only Objection is, that Christ, in the words of his first Institution,
said, Take, this is the New Testament in my Blood, shed for you and for many,
for the Remission of sins. Hear your Cardinal, Bellarm. Secundum Argumentu^
sumitur ex his verbis Institutionis, quae apertissime docent, Christum
obtulisse in coena pro peccatis Apostolorum Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2.. Secundum.
These words do most evidently teach, that Christ now in his Supper offered up
his Blood for the sins of his Apostles. So he. But if this his Exposition of
Christ's word's be most evident, alas! what a number of other blind Guides, of
great estimation among you, has your Church favored, pampered; privileged,
and authorized, who could see nothing in the words of Christ, but the flat
contrary* (namely) that they were Spoken in the Present Tense (Tropically) For
the Future, not that it was then shed, but that it was to be shed on the Cross
immediately after; among whom have See above. Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
been reckoned Gregory de Valentia, Salmeron, Barradas, Vasquez, and Suarez,
five prime Jesuits, your Bishop Iansenius, yea and the Author of your Vulgar
Translation, and the Authorizers thereof.

And that you may the better discern, how hard the foreheads heads of your
Cardinal, of your Rhemists, of Master Brerely, and of such others are, who
have made that Objection, you have been likewise advertised, that in the very
tenor of your own Romish Mass it self, the word is expressly [ In the (...)
place.
Effundetur] It shall be shed: We say in the Tenor of your Romish Mass,
published by the Authority of Pope Pius the fifth, repeated by every one of your
selves, (you being Romish Priests) and accordingly believed of all the
Professors of your Romish Religion. Which Interpretation was furthermore
confirmed by See above, 1. Sect. 3.
Fathers, and by Scripture (in the places objected) and by a Christ his Blood
was not Really shed in his last Supper. This is that which we had to oppose
unto that your Cardinals Most evident Argument, as Sunshine to Moone-light.

That many things are said to pacify and please God, which are not properly
Propitiatory, by their own Virtue, according to criptures and your own
Confessions. SECT. III.
IN Scripture, our Mortification of the flesh is called a Sacrifice
well-pleasing to God. Romans 12. 1. Alms, Works of Charity, are likewise called
Sacrifices, wherewith God is delighted, Heb. 13. 16. Comforting, and cherishing
the Ministers of God, is called A Sacrifice acceptable, and well-pleasing to
God, Phil. 4. 18. So the Scripture.

And that spiritual Sacrifices are more pleasing unto God, than all the
Hecatombs of Corporals could be, is a Confession, which we will take from the
quill of Valentia the Jesuit, saying that Valent. Omnes actiones rectae recte
propitiare Deum aliqua ratione censeri debent. Lib. 2 de Missa, cap. 5. Idem.
Peculiari ratione Precibus propitiandi vis in Scriptura tribuitur, quatenus
beneficia divina ex misericordia Dei, per illas impetramus. Ibid.
All right and just Actions may be said, in some sort, to be Propitiatory, and
to pacify God. As likewise of Prayer; Scripture (says he) attributes a
Propitiatory force unto Prayers, so far forth as we obtain many Blessings
of God, through his mercy, by them. So he. Which confirms our former
Distinction of Propitiatory, by the merciful Acceptance of God, distinct from
your Propitiatory, which is of meritorious Satisfaction by its own virtue:
which mere man must let alone for ever. Thus of our Examination from
Scripture.

The Doctrine of Ancient Fathers, concerning a Propitiatory Sacrifice. SECT. IV.
ALbeit our Premises in the former part of this Controversy touching
Sacrifice, and proving both by Scripture and ancient Fathers, that the
Eucharist is not properly a Sacrifice, might give a Supersedeas to all your
further contending by their Authority, for Defense of a Sacrifice properly
Propitiatory; because that which is not properly a Sacrifice, can no more be a
Sacrifice properly Propitiatory, than that which is not properly a stone can be
properly called a Mil-stone: Notwithstanding, we would be loath to be indebted
unto you for an Answer to your objected Fathers, in this Point also. The
Objections, which you use and urge, are of two kinds: some, wherein Body and
Blood of Christ at all; and the other sort such, wherein they both are named
and expressed.

CHAP. IX.
That the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers might
See above, Chap. 8. Sect. 3.
Valentia says, that Every right Act is in a sort Propitiatory. Secondly, as
it is a godly Act, whereby we do affiance our soul to God, Every good work,
(as August. See above, Cha. 5. Sect. 8.
Augustine says) which is done that we may adhere unto God, is a True
Sacrifice. Thirdly, as it is an Act serving peculiarly to Gods worship, for
Religiousnesse is that (said Chrysostom. ibid.
Chrysostom) wherewith God testifies himself to be well pleased. Fourthly as
it is an Act of Commemoration and Representation of that only properly
Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, we must grant to your
Cardinal, that Commemoration alone has not any Propitious Efficacy in it
self: But yet by the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ, resembled thereby, God
vouchsafes to be Propitious unto us; in which respect Origin. in Levit. Hom.
13. Si redeas ad illum quem Deus proposuit Propitiatorem per fide^, and si
respicias ad illa^ commemorationem, de qua dicit Dominus, Hoc facite in
commemorationem mei; ista est sola commemoratio, quae propitium facit hominibus
Deum.
Origin exhorting Christians to resort unto Christ, whom God has made a
Propitiation through faith in his Blood, and also to reflect upon the
Commemoration which was commanded by Christ, saying, Do this in remembrance of
me: This (says Origin) is the only Commemoration which makes God propitious.

If any would say, how then shall we not make Commemoration to be Propitiatory
in it self? We answer, as a man holding in his hand a precious Jewel, which
is enclosed in a Ring of gold, and putting it on his finger to preserve him
from a Convulsion, the Preservative Virtue is not attributed to the Ring, but
to the Jewel; and yet we say, the Ring is the only means to us, which makes
the finger capable of that Virtue. So say we, Christ his own Sacrifice, which
was the only precious Subject matter of our Redemption, is made now, by
Remembering, the Object of our Commemoration and Application of it, for our
Remission and Justification.

Nor is Origin alone in this, but all they (who were See Chap. 5. Sect. 11.
many) whom you have heard saying that Christ's Death and Passion, yea his
Bloody Body is offered herein. Your own Jesuit Salmeron is witness unto us
(for the Council of Ephesus, Eusebius, and Saint Augustine) that Salmeron. Ies.

hac hostia expiari peccata, quod cruentu^ memoret Sacrificium. Hanc dicendi
rationem sequitur Council. Ephesians. in Ep. ad Nestorem, Eusebius. in Demonst. Evang.
lib. 1. cap. 10. August. in Psalm. 75.
They declared us to have expiation of our sins by this Sacrifice, because
the bloody Sacrifice of Christ is remembered and commemorated herein.

That we say nothing of our Supplications and Prayers, by Propitiation, we
obtain pardon and Remission of sins (whether for Quick and Dead, belongs
not to this Dispute, because whether so or so, they are but Supplicatious
still) together with many other saving Blessings from God. Nor of the Act of
Thanksgiving, (from which this Sacrament is called the Eucharist) because this
is the destinate end of our Celebration, and therefore of all our spiritual
Sacrifices most acceptable unto God, for which cause See above Chap. 5. Sect. 8
Iustine Martyr called it, by the way of Excellency, The only grateful
Sacrifices. Lastly, in respect of our Application it self, whereof in the next
Section.

That the Ancient Fathers called it a Propitiatory Sacrifice Objectively, for
the Application of the Properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Cross, made by
the faithful in Celebration of the Memory thereof. SECT. II.
WHen it was asked, why the Ancient Fathers called Baptism a Sacrifice, it was
answered, See above Chap. 5. Sect. 13. at the Letter (c).
Because the Sacrifice of Christ's Death was applied unto us thereby. Yet that
Death, truly and only properly Propitious, is but only objectively offered in
Baptism. The same may be said of the Eucharist, whereof your own great
Schoole-man, and Bishop Canus. Satis est ut vere and proprie sit Sacrificium,
quod mois Christi ita nunc ad peccati remissione^ applicetur, ac si nunc ipse
Christus moreretur, id quod Scriptorum veterum testimonijs co^firmatur. --
August. Semel immolatus in seipso Christus, and tamen quotidie immolatur in
Sacramento. Paschasius: Quotidie Christus mystice pro nobis immolatur, and
passio ejus in mysterio traditur. Et Cyrillus in Conc. Ephesians. Athanas. ad
Antioch. Theophyl. in Hebr. cap. 10. Greg. demu^ Nazian. (ut caeteros omittam)
hanc incruentam Immolationem vocant. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12.. Illud. page
422.
Canus says, that It is sufficient that the Eucharist be called a proper and
true Sacrifice, because the Death of Christ is applied thereby, as if he were
now dead. Mark, As if he were now dead, which can be but Objectively only,
and which (as you all know) is not your Priestly Sacrifice.

As for the Ancient Fathers, who in their objected Testimonies talked of Christ
Cyril. Mystag. 5. Christum mactatum offerimus, ut Deum propitiu^ reddamus. Ob.
per Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. Greg. Nyssen. orat. 1. de Resur. and
Theoph. in Matthew. Dicunt inactationem esse in hac oblatione, etc.
Suffering, being slain, and dying in the Eucharist; We Protestants subscribe
to their Judgments Christ's Death, the proper work of our Propitiation, is the
only Object of our Remembrance and Faith: which sayings of the Fathers (says
your Salmeron. Quod benign interpretandum -- nimirum, mactationem antiquam
Christi in cruce inveniri, non novam and realem ab ea distinctam. Si in coena
mactatus erat, quomodo ad nonam horam diei usque sequentis vixit? absurda haec
sunt, and aliena a veritate. Tom. 9. Tract. 31.. Quarto.
Jesuit) must be understood Sacramentally, to signify the real slaughter of
Christ offered by him upon the Cross. So he. Which again proves our
Conclusion, that they understood a Propitiatory Sacrifice only objectively in
the Eucharist. We will end with the objected Testimony of Ambrose, thus,
Ambros. Hic imago, veritas in coelestibus, nunc Christus offertur, sed offertur
quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem. Offert se ipse, quasi Sacerdos, ut
peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate ubi apud Patrem. Lib.
1. de offic. cap. 48.
Here is an Image offered [Quasi, that is] as it were a man, as it were
suffering a Passion, offering himself as it were a Priest, that he may forgive
our sins. And of his now being See above, Cha. 3. Sect. 8. at the letter (c).
elsewhere he says, The truth is in Heaven, there is He in truth with the
Father. So he. Whereby is confuted your Conclusion of a Subjective Body of
Christ present herein, from [Quasi homo offertur:] for this any one may
perceive to be but a Quasi Argument for a Corporal presence, and to make fully
for our Distinction and Defense thereby. Enough of the Judgment of Antiquity.
Our third Examination follows.

CHAP. X.
Of the pretended Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice, confuted
THe first is the Imperfection of the Sacrificer. The next, the no- proper
Destruction of the thing sacrificed. The third, the Vnbloodinesse of the same.
And the last, the but- finite Virtue and value, which you attribute unto it.

I. Confutation, from the confessed Imperfection of the Sacrifice. SECT. I.
FIrst the Reason, why you account your Propitiatory Sacrifice to be but of
finite Virtue, is Bellar. Ratio 2. Quare Sacrificium Crucis sit tanti valoris,
hoc autem siniti, sumitur ex part offerentis: nam Sacrificio Crucis ipse
osterens est fillus Dei per se 3 at in Sacrificio Missae est ipse offerens per
Ministrum. -- Illa actio immediate producta a divino supposito, ipsa ab humano.
Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4.
Because it is not immediately offered up by Christ himself, as that was of
the Cross, but by his Minister. And the Reason of this, you say, is, Salmeron.
Ies. Modo Christus in Eucharistia persona^ induit rei oblatae: and quamvis
Christus offerat per Sacerdotes, ut Administros ejus, tamen virtus and causa
universalis pro ratione causae secundariae operatur. Sacerdos igitur ejus
nomine induit personam offerentis. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. page 266. de Missis
privatis.
Because the Universal Cause works according to the limitation of the second
Causes. So you. Understanding, by Sacrifice, not the Object of your
Remembrance, which is the Body of Christ, as crucified; but the Subject matter,
in the hand of the Priest. From whence this Consequence must issue, whether you
will or no, (namely) that Perfection of the Sacrifice being a necessary
property of a true Propitiatory Virtue and efficacy, in prevailing with God
for man, it is impossible for any of your Priests (because All are imperfect)
to offer up Properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice unto God.

None may hereupon oppose unto us the Propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law,
because they also were twice imperfect; once in respect of the Sacrificer, who
was but a mere man: and secondly, in respect of the matter of Sacrifice it
self, which was some unreasonable beast, and had no Virtue of Propitiation in
it self, for remission either of guilt, or of the eternal punishment of
sin, as has been See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 4.
Confessed; and therefore not Properly Propitiatory, but Figuratively; only as
Types of the Sacrifice of Christ.

II. Confutation, from the Romish Definition of a
SEcondly, in your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. See above, Chap. 6. Sect.
3.
Romish definition, it is required that the Thing propitiatorily sacrificed
suffer a Real Destruction, (so that it cease to be in the substance thereof)
and a Bodily Consumption. Notwithstanding you are absolutely free from the
Blasphemy, to say that Christ his Body does in the Eucharist Real Destruction.
Ergo, say we, by your own Principle there cannot be herein a Sacrifice
properly Propitiatory.

III. Confutation, from the Apostles Position, against the Vnbloodinesse
thereof. SECT. III.
THe Apostles Position is this, that Without the shedding of Blood there is no
Remission, Heb. 9. 22. Your Romish Assumption is; The Sacrifice of the Romish
Mass is unbloody. Our Conclusion necessarily follows, which is this; Ergo,
say we, your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be properly Propitiatory. Your Cardinal,
in Answering first that the Loquitur Apostolus de Sacrificijs veteris Legis, --
Potest etiam absolute and genetatim ^ccipi, quod quotiescunque fit remissio;
fit sangumis effusio: sed non nisi virture effusionis sive nunc facta, sive
post futura. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 25.. Ad illud.
Apostle spoke this of the Sacrifice of the Old Law only, stands twice
convicted of a foul Tergiversarion; first, by the Apostles Explication of
himself, who although he spoke from the observation of the Old Testament,
Heb. 9. 22. yet does he apply it to the state of the New Testament, in the same
Chapter, verse. 13, 14. But much more by his own Conscience, who having spent
some Chapters, in proving that the Sacrifices of the Law were Types of the
Sacrifice in the Mass, does now deny that this Proposition of [No Remission of
sins without sheedding of Blood] is to be applied to the Eucharist. He is
glad therefore Maldonate, who finding no security in the former Refuge,
betaketh himself to another, saying that Si accommodemus ad Evangelium,
dicendum est, peccata nunc remitti, non propter praesentem effusionem, sed per
prae eritam. Maldon. Ies. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tract. de Euch. immediate ante
exitum. Tom. 1.
Remission of sins is not now for any present effusion of Blood, but for that
effusion which had been. Which Answer (if we may so interpret it) is a plain
Prevarication. The Reason may be this; because there was never Bloody Sacrifice
(Christ on the Cross excepted, which only was of infinite virtue, as well to
times past, as to come) but it was always actually by the Effusion of Blood at
the time of Sacrificing. These kinds of so ordinary Doublings and Turnings,
which your Disputers use, as men in a maze, do plainly Demonstrate either their
irresolute Judgments, or else their

We have not done yet, but give you further to understand, that as you could
find no proper Sacrificing Act, to make your Mass properly a Sacrifice, so
neither can ye show any propitiating Act, to make it properly a Sacrifice
propitiatory. This we prove out of your Council of Colen, which Si respicimus
corpus Christi, quod continetur in Euch. quis negat esse propitiatorium, non
ratione oblationis, quam Sacerdos facit, sed ratione Oblationis factae in
cruce? Conc. provinc. Colon. de Missa. fol. 105. And a little after, Non
propitiatorium, ratione Sacrificij, quod est situm in action Sacerdoris, seu
Mislae communica^tum, aut Ecclesiae: sed ratione Sacrificij, quod in cruce
oblatum.
Concludes, that your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be called Propitiatory, in
respect of any Act of Oblation of the Priest, or accommodation of the
Communicants, or yet of the Church: but only of the Oblation once made by
Christ himself on the Cross. Which oblation how absent it is, who sees not,
that is present with himself? Thus were those Divines driven to an Objective
Act of Oblation.

IV. Confutation, from the Romish Disvaluation of that which they call Christ's
Sacrifice. SECT. IV.
THe last is in respect of the value, for Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross you
do Christianly esteem to have been of Mi^um non est, si cum Christus
infinitus extitit, ejus hostia suit infiniti meriti and satisfactionis.
Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. page 265, 266.
Infinite merit and satisfaction, because it was offered by himself, Erat
infiniti valoris: nec enim aliter potui^ compensari injuria Deo facta. Ribera
Ies. in Heb. 10. number. 19.
He could not have made satisfaction to an Infinite and Divine Majesty. So
you. But of the Sacrifice of the Mass, what* The common opinion of our Church
(says your Valor Sacrificij Missae est ^initus. Haec est communis sententia
Theologorum: in quo distinguitur a Sacrificio Crucis -- quod infinitae virtutis
erat, and nunquam rep^titur. Bellarm. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4.. Quarta Prop.
[And yet it is known that Cardinal C^^jetane, Canus, and Scotus were of a
contrary opinion:] To this last Testimony of Bellarm^^e add also Salmeron.
Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33.. Tertio.
Cardinal) is that it is but of finite value. So he. Notwithstanding it be
impossible for any thing of finite virtue to have power in it self of
remission of an infinite guilt against an infinite Majesty.

CHALLENGE.
A More palpable betraying therefore of a Cause there cannot be, than (as you
have hitherto done) by defending Positions repugnant to your own Definition,
and by obtruding Iannes and Iambres, in stead of Moses; in Art, Sophistry for
Logike; in Commerce, (...), that is, adulterate Coin for current; and in
warlike stratagems, instead of a natural, a Trojane Horse. Oh what a misery it
is to reason with such unreasonable (to speak mildly) men! Thus much of your
Romish Sacrifice, according to your own Explanations thereof.

CHAP. XI.
Of the Romish Application of their Sacrifice. The State of the Question.
Eucharist was ordained of Christ, for the Application of remission of sins
Sacramentally to all Communicants, is the profession of all Protestants. That
the Sacrifice of Christ's Cross is therein offered up Objectively, by
Commemoration and Supplication, for all Conditions of men, has an universal
Consent among them, without Exception. But that any substantial Body, as
Subjectively contained in the Mass, can be the Sacrifice of applying the
merits of Christ for remission of sins, (which is your Conc. Trid. Vt
visibile Sacrificium -- quo cr^enti Sacrificij virtus in remissionem peccatorum
applicaretur. Sess. 22. cap. 1.
Tridentine faith) has been hitherto impugned and infringed thorowout

I. That the Church of Rome is not yet resolved of the Extent of the Virtue of
her Sacrifice of the Mass, for remission of sins or Punishment.
NEver can there be any true Application of the Passion of Christ for remission
of sins (say we) which is not absolute, but only partial. Your Jesuit
Ribera. Ies. Quoniam quotidie peccamus, quotidie virtutem passionis Christi
participamus, quod Conc. Trid. docuit, quo cruentum illud, semel in cruce
peragendum, repraesentaretur, atque saluta^is ejus virtus in remissionem
peccatorum ^orum, quae quotidre a nobis committuntur, applica^etur. Et h^c
Catholicis quidem hominibus manifestissimum est, Haeretici negare non possunt,
quoniam Scripturae v^rbis apertissime comptobatur de virtute passionis, ad
omnia peccata tollenda, Romans 3. and 5. [Apoc. 1 1. Ioh. 2. Com. in Heb. 1. 10.
number. 16.
Ribera seems to come on roundly toward us, and friendly to join hands with
us in this point of Application of an absolute Remiss^on of sins, pretending
that this was decreed in the Council of Trent, as indeed it seems to have
been, and that from the Authority of Protestant^ (whom he is pleased to grace
with the name of See the last Testimony.
Heretics) do not deny this manifest Truth. So he. Do you mark? a Truth, a
manifest Truth, a Truth said to be confirmed by your last Council, and a Truth
consented unto by the Heretics, as being a manifest Truth.

Who would not now look for a Truth universally professed in your Church
without all exception? But behold (even since that Council of Trent) your
greatly approved Melchior Canus steppeth forth with a peremptory Contradiction,
saying, that to hold Opinio prima. Omnes culpas mortales, and omnia peccata
(post Baptismum commissa) per Sacrificium Altaris -- sic vult Catharinus --
Haec opinio non vera, nisi omnes Theologi fallantur. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12.
page 432. 433.
All mortal sins to be remitted by the Application of the Sacrifice in the
Mass, is false, except all Divines be deceived. So he, speaking of the
Divines of the Romish Church. And so may every Papist receive as much remission
of his sins by holy Water sprinkled at the Church door, as he can by the
Sacrifice at your Mass.

Your Jesuit Valentia notes, among you, another sort of Doctors,
Masse-Application serves only for Valent. Ies. Itaque sunt, qui censeant hoc
Sacrificium valere tantum ad relaxationem poenarum, quarum culpa prius
condonata ^uit. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 5.. Itaque sunt. page 542. Remittuntur
ve^alia. Costerus Christian. Institut. lib. 1. cap. 8.
Remission of such temporal punishment, the guilt whereof was formerly
pardoned. So he.

CHALLENGE.
IF any shall but recollect the Contradictions of your own Andabatae, who
first blind-folding themselves fell a slashing one another, not knowing whom
they hitt; therefore we leave them in their broiles, and our selves will
consult with Antiquity.

That the Ancient Fathers never taught any Application of Christ's Passion, but
that which is for a Plenary
Cardinal Alan. Card. Pro^ijs peccatis, pro quibus Christus mortuus est. Lib.
2. de Eucharist. cap. 35. [Wherein he brings the Testimonies of Chrysostom.

ver^ nunquam invenio hujus Sacrificij usum a Patribus ad pauciora restringi
peccata, quam ipsa immolatio crucis. Ibid. page 626.
Alan has put into our hands a consent of some Fathers, for proof of an
Application for remission of all sins, for which Christ died. The Fathers
whom he produces, are these, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Cyprian, and Origin.
If these will not suffice, you may take unto you these Calix -- sive

iniquitates. Cyprian. de Coena Domini. Vt cum Deo acceptum fuerit peccata

other, Julius Pope of Rome, Iustine Martyr, Augustine, Cyril, and Basil. Do
you require any more? What needs it? seeing that the same Cardinal further
says, There is found no Father to the contrary. Thus much of the Application,
which is to be made by this Sacrament; the next is, For whom.

That the Romish Use of a singular Application of the Sacrifice of the Mass to
Non-Communicants, because of their present Attendance, is repugnant to the
Doctrine of Antiquity.
THe Greek and Latin Churches anciently made up the whole Catholic Church.
The Greek pronounced an (...), that is, Be-gone, to all Non-Communicants: the
Latin Church also ordained, that the Deacon should Proclaim all
Not-Communicants to Depart. From which Custom afterward the Mass had it is
Original; namely from the words, [Ite, missa est] as See above Book 1. Chap.
^. Sect. ^. ^.
has been confessed. But now the Case is so altered, that if any
Non-Communicant, being present shall in Devotion apply himself to your Romish
Mass, your Canon Missae (De Applicatione) -- and omnium Circumstantium, quorum
tibi fides cognita est, and nota devotio, pro quibus Tibi offerimus etc.
Canon of the Mass provideth that Application of your Sacrifice be made unto
him for Remission of sins. And that, as your Jesuit teaches, Hinc. Suarez
Ies. Quia oblatio hujus Sacrificij est fructuosa ex opere operato: ergo rationi
consentaneum est, ut omnes, qui ad illum vere concurrunt, vel per proprium
actum, seu concursum moralem, participent hujusmodi fructum talis oblationis.
In 3. Thom. qu. 83. Art. 1. Disp. 79.. ^.
The Fruit of the Sacrifice [Ex opere operato] redoundeth unto him; and not
this only, but also to be Costerus Christian. Institut. lib. 1. cap* 8* de

confessed by your selves) never admitted to that part of the Mass, which you
call a Sacrifice, any but such as were prepared to Communicate, by receiving
the Sacrament, but shut all others out of Doors; which, we say, they neither
would nor could lawfully have done, if they had been of your now Romish Faith,
to believe that it is a Sacrifice Propitiatory Sacrifice of Expiation among the
Jews, under the Law, all persons had liberty to partake thereof. We think
that this Argument sticks fast in the Bowels of this Cause.

That the Romish Church lesseneth the due estimation of Christ's Passion, in
her Applying of it to others, for the increasing of falsly-devised and unjust
Gain, in behalf of the Priest; without all warrant of Antiquity. SECT. IV.
HItherto we have expected some Reasons, which might Christ's Passion, in the
Application thereof for Remission either of sins or punishments. And now at
length your Jesuit Salmeron comes to resolve us, saying, Salmeron Ies. Si hoc
esset infiniti valoris, and celebrata esset Missa pro redemptione omniu^
animarum, quae in expiatorio carcere contiuentur, totum evacuaret Purgatorium:
quod non est credendum, quia frustra tot Missae pr^o uno defuncto
celebrarentur. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pa. 268. De Missis privatis.
If the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood were of infinite value, then one
Mass being said for all the souls in the Dungeon of Purgatory would evacuate
and empty the whole place, and then should it be in vain to say many Masses
for one soul. So he. We may not so far digress, as to enter into this
Controversy of Purgatory, because we are to finish that which we have now in
hand. Purgatory-fire, has occasioned this Heterodoxe and graceles Doctrine of
disannulling the infinite efficacy of Christ's Blood: which is so utterly
forlorn of all Approbation from Antiquity, that your Disputers have not
alleged so much as one Iota, out of any Father, for warrant thereof.

Next, in the Sacrifice of your Mass, there is (say Valent. Ies. Quaedam
portio remissionis competit Sacerdoti ministranti, quaedam ei, cui Sacerdos
vult peculiari intention applicare -- Quae intentio non tantum valet pro
pluribus, ac si pro uno solo celebretur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. ult.. Ac
primum. Et Alan. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. Vt qui Sacrificium pro Petro o^^eit,
ratione stipendij. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 79.. 9. page 1021.
you) a Portion thereof appropriated to the Priest alone, which is a power to
apply, by his Memento, the same Sacrifice to whom Memento upon any one, to whom
he shall be pleased to intend it, upon Condition to receive money therefore:
insomuch, that It will be more availeable for that one, than if it were
extended to many. So you. Very well, but by what Law came your Priests to this
peculiar power of dispensing a Portion for their own advantage? Cardinal
Alan. In certarum personarum Causis certam Sacrificij aestimationem, ^c fructus
quantitatem desinire, non tam certa loquimur, quia ad ista particularia nec
Scripturae, nec Patres quicquam conferunt. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. page 635.
Alan (your Advocate) is ready to answer for you, and we are attentive to
hear what he says; There is not either any Scripture (says he) or Father
showing any such thing, for such a manner of esteeming the fruit of Christ's
Sacrifice.

In the third place, whiles we are in this speculation, we hear one of you
putting this Case. If the Priest shall receive a stipend of Peter, upon
Condition that he shall apply his Memento and Intention upon the soul of
John, departed this life, and he notwithstanding does apply it unto the good
of the soul of Paul, whether now the Priests Memento should work for the good
of the soul of John, according to the Priests Obligation upon the Condition
made with Peter, or else for the good of the soul of Paul, according to the
Priests immediate Intention. Here, although some of you stand for the justice
of the Inquiri potest, an tenetur Sacerdos ex justitia applicare Sacrificium
Petro, ratione ab eo accepti stipen^ij; nihilominus applicat Paulo: vel cum
jubetur offerre Sacrificium pro tali Defuncto, offert pro se. Quidam dicunt
Sacrificium operari in hujusmodi casibus non secundum voluntatem Ministri, sed
secundum obligationem, qua tenetur pro hoc vel illo offerre. Ali^ volunt
obligationem tenere -- Sed operatur secundum intentionem Ministri, quatenus est
Christi Minister. Suarez. quo supra. [But your Cardinal,] Sed injuste facere.
Alan. quo supra, cap. 35. page 640.
Priests Obligation, yet some others Resolution is, that the Priests intention
(albeit unjust) must stand for good. We have done.

CHALLENGE.
Whereas it is now evident, that your Romish Mass serves so well for your no
small gain, by appropriating of a Priestly portion to be dispensed for some
one or other soul for money, as it were the Cooks fee, and that but only for
the pains of a Spiritual intention; yea, though it be to the Injury of the
Purchaser: It can be no marvel, that we hear so often, magnifying of the
Roman Mass, as ever Demetrius, and his fellow Craft-mates made for Diana, the
Goddess of the Ephesians.

It remains, that we deliver unto you a Synopsis of the Abominations of your
Romish Sacrifice, which we have reserved to be discovered in the eighth Book.
We hasten to the last Examination, which is of Pro^estants.

CHAP. XII.

See above Chap. (...).
Distinction of a double kind of Propitiousnesse; one of Complacencie, and
Acceptance, and the other of Merit, and Equivulencie; and join hereunto your
own definition of Propitiousnesse by way of gracious acceptance, when you
confess that Every religious Act, whereby man in devotion adhereth entirely
unto God, in acknowledgement of his Soveraigntie, mercy, and bounty, is
propitious unto God. Now then, Protestants celebrating the Eucharist with Faith
in the Son of God, and offering up to God the Commemoration of his death, and
man's Redemption thereby (a work far exceeding in worth the Creation, if it
so were, of a thousand Thousand worlds) and thereby pouring out their whole
spirit of Thankfulness unto God (in which respect this Sacrament has obtained
a more singular name than any other, to be called Eucharistia, that is, A
Giving of Thanks, and that most worthily, forasmuch as the end and efficacy
of Christ's Passion is no less than our Redemption from the eternal [Do
this,] It is not possible, but that their whole complementall Act of
Celebration must needs be through Gods favor Propitious, and well-pleasing in
his sight. Take unto you our last Proposition, concerning the second kind of
Propitiousnesse.

That the Protestants may more truly be said to offer to God a meritoriously
Propitiatory Sacrifice for Remission of Sin, than the Romish do. SECT. II.
BEfore we resolve any thing, we are willing to hear your Cardinals
Determination. The Death of Christ (says Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 3.
Mors Christi est Sacrificium prop ie dictum, and perfectissimum.
he) is a proper, and most perfect Sacrifice. So he, most Christianly: But
after noting the Profession of Protestants, to hold that the same Most perfect
Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross is the only proper Sacrifice of Christian
Religion, he denies this, because (says Bellarm. Ibid. cap. 20.. Probatur.
-- Sublato Sacrificio Missae, nullum restat in Ecclesia Sacrificium proprie
dictum. Nam si ullum esset, id esset Sacrificium (...), illud enim unum*
Adversarij assignant unicum esse Christianae religionis Sacrificium. At hoc
commune omnibus veris Religionibus, sed semel poractum mane^, quoad essectum,
and virtutem.
he) This is common to all true Religions, and being but once done, cease to
be any more, but only in the virtue and efficacy thereof. And all this he
does for establishing of another properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Romish
Mass, by the hands of the Priest.

But we, believing that That Sacrifice of Christ's death was but once offered
as (according to our other distinction) the only subjective, meritorious, and
properly- Propitiatory Sacrifice, therefore it cease to be so any more; but
yet is still objectively perpetual in the Church of God, as the object of our
Remembrance of his Death, Representatively and Commemoratively, both in our
Acts of Celebration, and in our Prayers and Praises offered up to God, in the
true apprehension of the Efficacy and Virtue thereof. In which respect (as
Christian Belief professes) Christ is called Apoc. 5. 12.
The Lamb slain from the beginning of the world: so is he the same still,
and ever will be until the end thereof; for which cause our Celebration is
called of the Apostle A showing of the Lords Death till he come. So that as by
the Bodily Eye, beholding the John 3.
Serpent on a pole in the Wilderness, they that were stung with the Fiery
Serpents were healed; even so All, who by Faith, the Eye of the soul, behold
the Son of God lift upon the Cross, shall not perish, but have everlasting
life.

But what is that Propitiousnesse of the Sacrifice of Christ's Body (will you
say) which you Protestants will be said to offer more truly to God, than that
we Romanists do, and wherein does the difference consist? Be you as willing to
hear as to ask, and then know, that first although the whole Act of our
Celebration, in Commemoration of Christ's Death, as proceeding Sacrifice
propitious, as other holy Acts of Devotion, only by Gods Complacencie and
Acceptance; Yet the object of our Commemoration being the Death and Passion of
Christ, in his Body and Blood, is to us, by the efficacy thereof, a truly and
properly propitiatory Sacrifice, and Satisfaction, for a perfect Remission of
all sins. Thus concerning Protestants. As for you, if we consider your own
outward Acts of Celebration, (wherein in Ten Circumstances we ^inde Ten
Transgressions of the Institution of Christ, and therefore provocatory to stir
up Gods displeasure) we think not that it can be Propitiatory Gods Acceptance.

Next, when we dive into the mystery of your Mass, to seek out the subject
matter of your Sacrifice in the hands of your Priest, which according to the
faith of your Church is called a Proper propitiatory Sacrifice in it self; it
has been found (besides our Proofs from Scriptures, and your own
Principles) by See a Sy^opsis hereof, Book 8.
Ten Demonstrations out of Ancient Fathers to be Sacramental Bread and Wine,
and not the Body and Blood of Christ. Wherefore the Subject of your Sacrifice
can be no more properly Satisfactorily) in it self Propitiatory, than
substantial Bread can be Christ.

Lastly, in examining the End of the Propitiation by the Mass, We perceive
your Doctors in suspense among themselves, whether you be capable of
Propitiation for Remission of sins, or else of Temporal Punishments due to
such Sinners; or if of Sins, whether of Mortal sins, or else of Venial
sins only: to wit, such as you think may be washed away by your own
Holy-water-sprinckle. Mark now, we pray you, these three: First, what you
offer, namely not Christ, but his Sacrament. Secondly, by what Acts of
Celebration, to wit, most whereof are not Acts of Obedience, but of
Transgression. Thirdly, to what End, viz, not for a Faithful, but for a
doubtful; not for an absolute, but for a partial Remission, and that also you
know not whether of sins, or of punishments: and then must you necessarily
acknowledge the happiness of our Protestants profession, concerning the
Celebration of the Eucharist, in comparison of your Romish.

A Vindication of certain Testimonies, alleged in the II. III. IV. and V.
Books of the preceding Treatise; against the Unjust Imputations of one
(whosoever). Popishly inspired: To the greater Disadvantage of the Romish
Cause, wherein he has so much labored.
THese kind of Vindications ought not to seem unnecessary Etiamsi gratiae
causa nihil facis, omnia tamen grata sunt quae facis. Only I wish these his
Exceptions had come in due time to my hands, (before the fifth, and part of the
sixth Book had been reprinted, in this second Epiphanius being altered in this
second Page 121.
Edition) We will take the rest in due order.

The first Passage concerns a Testimony of S. EPIPHANIVS. Alleged in the
Edit. 1. page 92.
Page 120. of this second Edition.


His OB. Bellarmine cannot be guilty of that falsity which you impute unto him,
of adding to Epiphanius, and making him say: This is to be believed, although
it be repugnant to our Senses: for these words [Although they be repugnant to
our Senses] he allegeth not as the words of Epiphanius, because he has them
in a different Character.

ANSW. It will be sufficient to set down the words of Bellarmine his own,
thus; ETIAM ADDIT, (Epiph.) ID ESS^ CREDENDVM, LICET SENSVS REPVGNENT; that is,
HE (speaking Epiphanius) ALSO ADDS, THAT IT IS TO BE BELIEVED, ALTHOUGH IT
BE REPVGNANT TO OUR SENSES. How then can it be denied that Bellarmine delivered
those words, REPVGNANT TO OUR SENSES, as the words of Epiphanius, hearing
Bellarmine himself affirming that they were ADDED by Epiphanius? If I had
denied this, I would have given my Objector leave to say, I had been out of my
Senses.

The Second Passage. Book. 2. Edit. 1. page 95.
Page 129. TERTVLLIAN.
OB. I. THe words of Tertullian are these; [Christum corporis sui figuram panis
dedisse;] you, instead of [Panis] have Panem, for your Advantage, contrary to
the faith of that Edition which you follow of Laur. de la Bar, page 180.

ANSVV. A sore Taxation, which pincheth upon my Fidelity; I shall then give a
summarie Answer, after that I have received my full Charge.

O^. II. Bellar. lib. 2. de Enchar. cap. 7. argues against Protestants for the
words of Tertullian thus; [Those words, says he, do not signify that Christ
gave a Sign of his Body, and not his Body it self.] otherwise he would not
have said that Christ [Corporis sui figuram panis dedisse.] How then should it
have been, I pray you? OB. III. It should have been [Panis,] or rather
[Pani,] as Pamelius (upon that place) has it.

ANSVV. So then the Objector has chosen Pamelius, a learned Commentator, upon
the same words of Tertullian, and Romishly professed, for his Arbitrator; and I
shall not gainsay his own choice. Pamelius therefore in the very Edit. Paris.
1580.
Edition and

By which words of Pamelius we have gained four Advantages. I. A
Justification of the sense of the Accusative [PANEM,] as Pamelius shows. II.
A Condemnation of the Objector his Falsehood, who said that Pamelius had it
[PANI.] III. A Consutation of Bellarmine, who, because the word was Sign of
his Body, but the Body it self; whereas Tertullian (says Pamelius) used the
Genitive-case, PANIS, instead of the Accusative, PANEM; how? MORE SVO; that is,
AS TERTVLLIAN, USED To Do: which plainly shows that Bellarmine was either
ignorant of the style of Tertullian, or rather (if he knew it) guilty of
Dissimulation herein, namely, More suo. The Last is a Manifestation of an
egregious fondness in them Both, by insisting upon Tertullian's style so
rigidly, in the Genitive-case, which in English must needs stand thus: Christ
to have given a Sign of his own Body of Bread; which is plainly a Nonsense,
as any may perceive; so that I may well conclude, o felix error! of changing
the word, PANIS, into PANEM; although it were but by chance, and only to make
true Latin, according to ordinary Construction. By occasion whereof, so much
Ignorance and Perverseness of the Adversary has been displayed.

The Third Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 107.
page 151. CARD. BELLARMINE.
IT was affirmed that the first Imposition that Bellarmine could find of the
Doctrine of Transubstantiation, as a matter of Faith, was about the year 1073.
by Pope Gregory the Seventh.

OB. Bellarmine said that he would prove against Scotus, that the Fathers
taught the same Doctrine.

ANSVV. Were his proof as faisible, as I hold it Impossible,
Transubstantiation, as an Article of Faith, upon men's Consciences, not to have
been before that forenamed Pope Gregory the Seventh. The Contrary whereof
neither he, nor any for him, can show out of any Ancient Father. The Advantage
he gives us, is the bewraying of his own Precipitancie.

The Fourth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 113.
Page 162. N. CABASILAS.
THe Greek Archbishop Cabasilas has told us, that the Latins of the Romish
Church would not endure the Greeks to call the Eucharist, after the Romish
Consecration, Bread.

The OB. Roman Catholics do commonly allow that it be called Bread, after
Consecration.

ANSVV. I proved from Cabasilas, that they will not endure it: he tells me,
without any proof at all, they do. But if he should eat no bread, until he
could find in Romish writers the Commonly naming of the Eucharist Bread, after
their felo de se. After this the Objector tells me (which I had taught him
before in the first Book) that Cabasilas and the Greeks hold that the words
of Christ's Institution, to wit [HOC EST CORPUS MEVM] are not words of
Consecration, and therefore called the Romish Eucharist Bread; and Con^ludeth,

OB. Therefore does not Cabasila's Testimony avail you.

ANSW. It proves as much as I there assumed to prove: That the Romish would
not allow their Eucharist to be called Bread after their Consecration. Our
Advantage is to observe

The Fifth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 125.
page 177.IRENAEVS.
OB. I. YOu translate it [Even as] to make it a Similitude.

ANSW. When I was but a Boy, I then learned to translate SICVT, SIC (which are
the words of Irenaeus) EVEN As, So.

OB. II. But the Similitude is only for the Change, and not for the manner of
the Change.

ANSW. Can there be a Change with a SICVT, EVEN As, without a manner of
Similitude of Change?

One Advantage herein may be this our further Observation, that Irenaeus, as
he said of the BREAD Consecrated, that it is NO MORE A COMMON THING, BUT
CHANGED INTO AN EVCHARIST (a Sacrament:) says likewise of the other part of
the Similitude, that THE BODIES OF THE COMMVNICANTS ARE INCORRVPTIBLE IN HOPE
OF RESVRRECTION: meaning, that they are therefore not to be esteemed of in the

Our other Advantage will be, to learn the language of the Fathers, as here of
Irenaeus, calling the Bodies of the Faithful INCORRVPTIBLE; even here in this
life, but meaning, because of the hope of their future Resurrection, when they
shall be changed indeed, yet not in Substance, but only in Qualities, from
Incorruptibility and Baseness. Even as he meant of the change of this
Sacrament, consisting of an Earthly, and an Heavenly part; the Earthly being
the Bread Natural; and the Heavenly being the same Sacramental, as betokening
and signifying

The Sixth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 124.
page 178. S. AMBROSE.
OB. I. IN citing of Ambrose, you join both his Sentences in one.

ANSW. Which is no more Advantage to my Cause, than if I should give this
Objector two Sixpences for one Shilling.

OB. II. You add [Even as] to make it a Similitude.

ANSW. This needed not to have been added, because Ambrose

OB. III. Bat your Translation is this [Things changed, remain what they were
before:] whereas they should have been rendered verbatim, thus: That those
things, which were, be still, and changed into another thing.

ANSW. I call for an Oedipus to unriddle this, to say that there is a
differencet sense between THE THINGS THAT WERE BE STILL; AND THEY BE STILL
THAT WHICH THEY WERE BEFORE, ALTHOUGH CHANGED INTO ANOTHER THING.

The Seventh Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 134.
page 190 S. AMBROSE.
OB. ETiam, A word of great Asseveration, omitted.

ANSW. What needed any more Asseveration than the words set down, IPSA NATVRA
MVTATVR, which I understand to be as asseverantly spoken, as if he had sworn
them.

OB. II. You say that Ambrose interprets his naming of Bread, Christ's Body;
by saying afterward, Corpus Christi Significatur, which is long after.

ANSW. It is in the same Chapter, and not long after neither. But this man is
as good an Objector as he is an Observer; who does not know that which is
common to all Writers, that what the Author has spoken somewhat more obscurely
before, he

OB. III. But Ambrose said elsewhere [Panis dicitur, sed Corpus appellatur;] It
is said to be Bread, but it is called the Body of Christ. So says he here,
Before Consecration it is named Bread, but after Consecration the Body of
Christ is signified; here [Significatur] is the same with [Nuncupatur;]
Signified is the same with named, or called.

ANSW. NAMED AND CALLED are only Appellations of the outward words, whereas
[SIGNIFICATA] always import the sense of the same words, whether spoken or
read; so that I shall need, for Confutation, no more but to appeal unto the
Objector himself to distinguish the office of his cares and eyes, whereby

A further Advantage upon this occasion may be had first from another
Allegation, of the Objector himself, out of Saint Ambrose lib. 5. de
Sacrament. cap. 4. Dixi ante verba Christi panis dicitur; post deprompta
Christi verba, non panis dicitur, sed corpus appellatur. We hear that Saint
Ambrose proves, that that, which is called the Body of Christ, was before
Consecration that which was called Bread: so that [Hoc] in Christ's speech,
must Bread, which marreth and dasheth your Romi^h and literal Exposition of
Christ's words (the foundation of all your other errors, concerning Corporal
Presence:) to note in Saint Ambrose his Judgment, that [Hoc] in Christ's
speech betokened Bread, which, in the universal Judgment of all Romish
Doctors, cannot be attributed to Christ's Body in a literal sense. And
Secondly to recognize the Art of Bellarmine (See Book. 2. page 125.) in his
misalleging the same words of Ambrose, thus; [Post Consecrationem corpus
Christi est,] instead of [CORPVS CHRISTI SIGNIFICATVR.] If that there were no
more force

The Eighth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 135.
page 191. S. CYPRIAN.
OB. [NOn effigy sed] is not set down in the Latin sentence of Cyprian, and
[Caro Factus est] is left out in the English: both of purpose, as will be
thought.

ANSW. Neither, I dare swear, on purpose, because both of them are alleged:
the first [NON EFFIGY, SED] translated in the English, and [CARO FACTVS EST]
expressed in the Latin. Our Advantage now is this, to call to our Readers
Remembrance, that he must interpret these words of Cyprian by that his other
Saying; namely, that Things signifying are called by the same names, by which
things signified are called.

The Ninth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 135.
page 191. M. BRERELY.
CYprian said: Things Indifferent change their nature after they be commanded.

OB. He meant not simply, but after a sort, as the Testimonies show, which he
alleged.

ANSW. He meant as simply as any Protestant can do, saying a little before the
words, A thing of Indifferency, being determinated by the Church, if it be
violated, is a sin. What is, if this be not a Change of the Nature, to become
(by reason of the Churches Decree) of a thing Indifferent and not sinful, a
thing sinful, and therefore not Indifferent.

The Tenth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 136.
page 194.IVSTINE MARTYR.
OB. YOu make Iustine say, that he called the Eucharist therefore no common
Bread, because it was [(...),] that is, Sanctified meat.

ANSW. And that, I say, millions of Popish Doctors, at the first hearing, would
swear, to wit, that the Church of Rome accounts the matter of the Eucharist,
COMMON BREAD, and WINE, before it be Consecrated.

Our Advantage is, that the Objector has brought an whole house, the Church of
Rome it self (which you call the house of God) upon his head, by this
Exception.

The Eleventh Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 136.
page 195. S. CYRIL. of HIERVSALEM.
OB. BEllarmine is taxed of Inconsionableness for concluding out of Cyril
that the Sacrament is not to be judged by sense; when as the words of Cyril, in
the same place, are expressly saying, [It is the Body of Christ; although thy
sense tell thee not so, yet let thy faith confirm thee, etc.]

ANSW. I have taxed him most justly, not for any mistaking of the words of
Cyril, but for wresting and abusing his meaning, Bellarmine believing it was so
said of Cyril, as absolutely denying that there can be any trial of the
natural Substance of Bread, after Consecration, by the verdict of any of man's
senses; whereas Cyril spoke only of the Sacramental nature thereof. This was
evidently proved out of Cyril, who affirming Sacred Oil to be no more Bare
Oil, after Consecration, as he said of the Eucharist, It was no more mere
Wine after it be Consecrated; thereby taught us to judge of both alike. Even as
we may say, upon the same reason, that the water of Baptism is, during the
use thereof, no mere Water. But why? even because it is Sacramental; and that
accordingly we are not to believe our Senses, when we are in Contemplation of
this Sacrament, to think it now to be mere Water, but believe it to be of
another nature: else our natural eyes and senses shall Bellarmine, for
inferring from such speeches an absolute denying of the trial, by sense, of
the natural part of the Sacrament, because he might have been instructed* By
the Sea Book 2. cap. 1. Sect. 7.
Council of Nice, of the meaning of such speeches of the Fathers; that
Council saying as much of Baptism, thus, Baptism is not to be considered
with the eyes of our Bodies, but of our Minds. All which is to abstract the
thoughts of Christian

This also has occasioned another Advantage against your Roman Faith, by
observing in the same place of Cyril another Sentence concerning this
Sacrament: Celestial Bread (says he) sanctifying both Body and Soul. But
how both? it follows, [(...):] As the Bread is congruous to the Body, so is
the word (meaning Christ in his Body) convenient for the soul. What other can
be meant Bread to the nutriment of the Body, and Sanctification thereof, in
hope of Resurrection to life, as the Fathers have Commented.

The Twelfth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 132.
page 298. S. CHRYSOSTOM.
OB. Chrysostom is said to be placed in the front of the host of Bellarmines
Fathers, whereas Bellarmine in his Catalogue of Fathers De Euchar. lib. 2.
cites twenty Fathers before him.

ANSW. If Bellarmine have had other Treatises, in his Controversies against K.
JAMES of blessed memory, wherein Chrysostom was made the Champion, was this
fondness in me to say as I have said, and not rather rashness in this
Objector, in thus gainsaying?

OB. II. But you have furthermore omitted the words of Chrysostom, which in
English should be these [Although these things exceed our sense and reason, yet
let us hold them without doubting.]

ANSW. He tells me what was omitted, looking directly upon that, but forgot
to acknowledge what was expressed out of Chrysostom, looking askew and asquint
at it. My Translation out of Chrysostom delivered his words, in the first
part, thus; [ALTHOVGH THE SPEECH OF CHRIST MAY (...) STRANGE TO SENSE AND
REASON:) which is (...) to that which is omitted; Christ's speech exceeds our
sense and reason. Chrysostom, [YET LET US BELIEVE HIS WORDS;] Fully equivalent
with those which were omitted, [YET LET US RECEIVE CHRIST'S WORDS WITHOUT
DOVBTING;] except the Papists will think us to be of their degenerate Faith,
Of Believing with doubting. Where you may perceive that your Objector
considered not how easy it had been for me (by not omitting some words) to
have been superfluous.

The Thirteenth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 140.
page 199. SIXTVS SENENSIS.
OB. IT is alleged out of Senensis, that he makes Chrysostom to have been
the most frequent in Hyperbolizing of all the Fathers; But Senensis only
says, that Chrysostom did [Interdum] use Hyperbole's.

ANSW. And I say, Aliquando [seu, INTERDVM] dormitat Homerus: Esto igitur,
[INTERDVM:] Although I made it good in the same Section, that he often
Hyperbolized, yea even in this very point of the Eucharist.

OB. II. Elsewhere Senensis, you say, gives us a caution against Chrysostom's

ANSW. It is certain that Senensis does there most especially and by name note
Chrysostom to Hyperbolize, and his Caution being general, to take heed of his
Hyperbole's, may be justly applied as well to this, as to that point, there
specified in Senensis, according to the Law of Schools; where General rules
are applyable to other examples, besides that which is in the Author specified
and adjoined to the same Rule. But this man had rather cavil inordinately, by
the example of Romish Adversaries, than to be regulated by any rule of reason
and moderation.

OB. III. Behold you mention Bellarmine, saying that our senses are not
deceived in their proper sensible objects; But you forbear to show the many
Limitations which he gives.

ANSW. I never held it seasonable to show a man any thing when he would not see
it; otherwise the Objector, who has sought into every corner of all my
Sayings, with purpose to traduce them, could not but have found the same
Limitations of Bellarmine punctually set down. Book. 3. cap. 3. Sect. 7.

The Fourteenth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 141.
page 200. S. CHRYSOSTOM.
OB. TO the words of Chrysostom, [As in Baptism, Regeneration, the thing
Intelligible, is given by water, the thing Sensible] you add these words, [The
Substance of Water remaining] which are not in the Text; whereof your Lordship
is conscious, and therefore most unsufferable.

ANSW. I must first say, mala men's, malus animus; or as it is As you muse, so
you use: else would not this Objector have accused me to be Conscious of this,
whereas any might have thought, that the words should have been (if the
Printer had not mistaken) in a different Character, to distinguish them from
the words of Chrysostom; because, in the Margin, he was directed to another
place, where the full Text of Chrysostom was perfectly alleged, without that
Addition now objected.

ANSW. II. Yet there is no reasonable man, pondering the words of Chrysostom,
but must justify the Addition of Chrysostom (there) speaking of the Water of
Baptism. For is there any one of sound brains, that will deny the Water of
Baptism, after Consecration, to remain in Substance the same? Besides there
has been produced another Testimony, as out of Chrysostom, that Bread, even
in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, after Consecration, remains in Substance
the same. These should the Objector have ruminated upon, before he laid down
this Accusation, but that he found they were not

The Fifteenth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 14^.
page 201. EVSEBIVS EMISSENVS.
OB. YOu refer us to Master Brerely his Liturgy, Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2.
in the Margin, curtailing the words which should make for Transubstantiation;
and making him argue from these words, [Post verba Christi, est Corpus
Christi:] And putting upon him so weak an Argument, when as he does there but
only mention the name of Eusebius, referring us to a fuller Sentence, which
he cites out of Eusebius

ANSW. If the Objector had been so courteous as to have looked back to Master
Brerely's Allegation of the said Testimony of Eusebius, some few leaves before,
page 160. as he was curious for (Contention-sake) to urge the words following
in some pages after, which he says are omitted, and concern
Transubstantiation, he might have found that Allegation of Master Brerely as I
delivered it, Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2. [SVBSTANTIA PANIS POST VERBA CHRISTI
EST CORPUS CHRISTI.] As for the words following, which corcerne Conversion of
Bread, it was beyond the scope which I had then in hand, which concerned only
the Enunciative Speeches of Christ (namely of calling Bread his Body) and not
the manner of Change thereof; which point notwithstanding is afterward handled
at full in the same Section.

Our Advantage from this man's Cavillation is this: That he calls this manner
of Arguing out of the Sentences of the Fathers, Bread after Consecration is the
Body of Christ: Ergo, it is meant to be really and Substantially Christ's Body,
as it was in the Rome, who have held their Arguments taken from the words of
Christ, after his taking Bread saying [THIS IS MY BODY] to be the foundation of
all their Arguments, for proof of Transubstantiation.

ANSW. II. Yet I was much to blame, I confess, in not Answering at all to the
objected Testimony of that so bastardly a Book of Homilies, attributed to
Eusebius, which the Romish Doctors Eusebius. whose name it bears: Some
affirming, that the Author was Faustus the Frenchman; Some Caesarius; Some
Eucherius. And as for the Book it self, they have likewise put upon it the
brands of two great Heresies, Arianisme and Pelagianisme. Which taxation and
hallucination of our Adversaries may be to themselves, without our Answer,
their own Satisfaction, not to think it worthy of Answering.

The Sixteenth Passage. Book. 3. Edit. 1. page 143.
page 202. GREG. NYSSEN.
A Summary Answer to this Objection, out of the Testimony of Gregory Nyssen.
Although Bellarmine does not produce the words of Nyssen, yet does he direct
his Reader to Nyssens Treatise of Manna, where the Sentence is, which is
alleged by others. Nor can he be excusable, in that, having read the Testimony
now objected, he did not thereby perceive that the Fathers Sacramental
speeches are not to be taken in the rigidity of the words. Our Advantage upon
this occasion is, that, Bellarmine, out Greg. Nyssen, it has caused us to
light upon and to examine this which follows, urged by your Cardinal, for
Transubstantiation; where speaking of the [Bread which came down from heaven,
and was prepared for us without seed, without tilling, without man's work: Th^s
(says Nyssen) is signified in this Mystery, nor is this an uncorporeall and
unbodily thing: for how can a thing uncorporeall and without a Body, be food
unto a Body; But that thing which is not uncorporeall, is altogether a Body]
Now let us but try the Romish Faith by this Lydian Stone, and we shall find
it to be merely counterfeit and base. For ask any of the Romish Disputers,
what it is, which in this Sacrament is known to nourish, whether man or mouse?
And they answer us that the Accidents of Bread, void of the substance of Bread,
is that which is Nutritive. But Greg. Nyssen says just the ^lat Contrary,
[NOTHING CAN NOVRISH A BODY BUT THAT WHICH Transubstantiation.

The Seventeenth Passage. Book. 4. Edit. 1. page 149.
page 212. TERTVLLIAN.
OB. I. THe word [Bread] is added.

Tertullian himself, whose former words are, Christ distributed [PANEM,
BREAD,] to his Disciples, faciens [ILLVM, that is, making IT, his BODY, THAT
IS, A FIGVRE of his BODY.] There is no Schoole-boy, that knows his Grammar,
which will not say that the Relative, IT, must be referred to the Antecedent,
BREAD. And of this, IT, do depend all the words following.

OB. II. The words of Tertullian being these [Christ said* This is my Body,
that is, a figure of my Body:] you put in, [IS,] saying That is, It [IS] a
figure of my Body, which will be complained of.

This is a Tavern, THAT IS, A Sign of a Tavern, and not mean that it [IS A
SIGNE] of a Tavern?

OB. III. Your Adversaries will complain of this, seeing they are persuaded
that this is not spoken of a figure actually present, but perfectly past.

Adversaries, who in their greatest subtilties bewray their extremest
^o^tishnesse, in complaining of my [IS] in the Present-^ense, and in requiring
the sense of the time perfectly past; as if Tertullia^ had said thus, Christ
said this is my Body, [THAT IS, IT WAS] a figure of my Body. Here have we just
reason to reflect upon this Objector with that Saying, Risum teneatis amici?
Yet the Objector (lest we might think him not to Insanire cum ratione)
yields this Reason, why it should be meant of the time passed, before the
coming of Christ.

OB. IV. Because of the words immediately following, [Figura autem non fuisset,
nisi esset veritatis corpus:] show that the word, [Figure,] was not taken
representatively, but Typically.

ANSW. When Tertullian spoke only narratively, by repeating the words of
Christ, he must needs speak in the tense and time when Christ uttered them,
when he said [IT IS MY BODY, THAT IS, IS A FIGVRE OF MY BODY,] But after
speaking Enunciatively, with the Relation from his own time [It had not been
a figure] namely, when Christ called it his Body, [except, etc.] The Argument
of Tertullian, taken from those words of Christ, stands thus: Christ in the
Sacrament gave a figure of his Body; But a figure is not a figure of a figure,
therefore Christ gave a figure of a True Body. Let us consult again with
Tertullians words of Exposition, [IT HAD NOT BEEN A FIGVRE, EXCEPT THERE HAD
BEEN THE TRVTH OF HIS BODY:] But Tertullian, I hope, will put this Objector to
his Non putabam, or Had I wist.

Our Advantages occasioned by this Accusation are great, and diverse: One is to
discern more clearly the then-Catholike Doctrine in the days of Tertullian.
Next to observe the stupid insatuation of our Romish Adversaries. The Last will
be to display an Heresy in the Article of the Church of Rome, that Tertullian,
in the Marcionites, to teach that Christ had no true, but a Fantastical Body,
notwithstanding all the Demonstrances of sense, Eating, Weeping, Sleeping,
Bleeding; and of the Apostles feeling him: How shall not the Romish Doctrine of
a No-Existence of Bread in the Eucharist, notwithstanding the Contradiction of
Smelling, Seeing, Feeling, and Tasting it, be a welcome Patronage and Skonce to
the former Heresy Verity of Christ's Body?


CHAP. I.
We have hitherto passed through many dangerous and pernicious Gulfes of Romish
Doctrines, which our instant haste will not suffer us to look back upon, by
any repetition Asphaltites, or Mare mortuum, even the Dead Sea of Romish
Idolatry; whereinto all their Superstitious and Sacrilegious Doctrines do
empty themselves: which, how detestable it is, we had rather prove, than
prejudge.

The State of the Question, concerning Adoration of the Sacrament
IN the thirteenth Session of your Council of Trent, we find a Decree
commanding thus, Council. Trid. Cultum Latriae; qui vero Deo debetur, in
veneratione huic Sacramento exhibeant. Sess. 13. cap. 5.
Let the same divine honor, that is due to the true God, be given to this
Sacrament. After this warning Piece, they shoot off a great Si quis dixerit in
hoc Sacramento unigenitum Dei filiu^ cultu Latriae non esse adorandum, Anathema
sit. Ibid. Can. 6.
Canon of Anathemae, and Curse against every one that shall not herein worship
Christ (namely, as corporally present) with Divine honor. That is to say,
Suarez Ies. Adoratione Latriae absoluta, and perfecta, qua per se adoratur
Christus -- Non solum Christu^ sub speciebus, sed totum visibile Sacramentum
unico Latriae cultu, quia est unum constans ex Christo and speciebus -- sicut

disjuncta est a Christo. In 3. Tho. q. 79. Disput. 65.. 1. and 2.
To adore with an absolute divine worship the whole visible Sacrament of
Christ, in the forms of Bread and Wine, as your Jesuit expounds it; A
worship (says he) far exceeding that, which is to be given to the Crucifix.

But what do they, whom you call Sacramentaries, judge of this kind of
worship, can you tell? Bellarm. Omnes Idololatriam appellant hujusmodi
adorationem. Lib. 4. de Eucharist. cap. 29.. Porro.
All of them (says your Cardinal) call it Idolatry. But they, whom you call
Lutherans, are they not of the same Judgment? say, Gregor. Valent. Lutherani
nos Idololatras vocant, seu (ut ipsi nugari solent) Artolatras. Lib. 1. de
Idololat. cap. 3.. Sed.
They call us (because of this worship) Artolaters, that is, Bread-worshippers
and Idolaters, says your Jesuit. As for our Church of England, She
accordingly says, that The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not reserved,
carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.

Our Method must now be to treat first of Christ's Institution, or Mass; next
of the Profession of Ancient Fathers; then of your Romish Mass in it self;
and lastly we shall return again to our own home, to demonstrate the happy
Security, which our Church has in her manner of worship. So that these
contradictory Propositions, This Sacrament is to be adored with divine worship,
and, Is not to be adored with divine worship, being the two different scales of
this Controversy, the one will preponderate

Of the Institution of Christ; showing that there was therein
NO outward Adoration of the Sacrament was practiced of the Disciples of Christ
(say we) at the Institution thereof, which you confess with us; and take upon
you to give a reason thereof, to wit, that Caster Ies. Nec opus erat ut genu
slexo significationem novam honoris darent, sumentes corpus dominicum, quia
eundem habebant praesentem, and corpus suum porrigentem, quem mente semper
colebant. Enchir. de Euch. Tit. Adoratio, Answering this Objection: Apostoli in
ultima coena hoc Sacramentum non adorabant.
There was no need that the Apostles should use any outward signification of
honor to the Sacrament, because they had then Christ present and visible
before them So your Jesuit, which contradicts your own Objection, of
therefore adoring Christ in receiving the Sacrament, because then he See
hereafter Chap. 7. Sect. 2.
Comes under the roof of your mouths; for the nearer our approach is to any
Majesty, the greater uses to be our outward humiliation. But well; no Practice
of outward Adoration by the Apostles at that time can appear, much
Deuteronomie, in the Old Testament, to fetch his only defense out of these
words of God, Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 29. Scriptum est Deuteronomy. 6. Dominu^
tuum adobis, etc.. His praemissis.
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God; (supposing that the Bread which is
worshipped is indeed the Son of God:) which is, as it were, mere Canting
being the basest kind of Reasoning that can be, and is therefore called of
Logicians, A begging of the point in Question.

Institution of Christ in all points necessary, and essential thereunto, and
knowing that the Apostle promised to deliver 1 Cor 11.
Whatsoever he had received of the Lord, concerning this Sacrament (which you
hold to be the principal part of your Romish Religion) we are persuaded that
h^e in expressing the other Commands of Christ, touching Consecration,
Administration, and Communication of this Sacrament, never taught that your
Article of divine Adoration, whereof he gave not so much as the least
intimation. The Apostolical times fail you. We shall try if the next, called
the

CHAP. II.
Of the Doctrine of Antiquity, concerning the Adoration of the Eucharist.
THe Judgment of Antiquity is objected by you, and the same is opposed by us
against you. Let both be put to the Trial; First, by answering of your
Objections out of the Fathers against us: and then by opposing their direct
Testimonies against you. Your Objections are partly Verbal, and partly
Practical; the Verbal are of three kinds, two whereof are specified in the
next Proposition.

That neither the objected manner of Invitation to come with Fear, nor of
Association of Angels, spoken of by the Fathers, imply any Divine Adoration of
the Eucharist. SECT. II.
OVt of Chrysostom. in Homaed Cor. 24. Cum horrore accedamus ad Deum. Ob.
Harding, etc. Item Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 22. Citatis locis quibusda^
Chrysostomi, ad haec Adversarij neque respondent, neque respondere possint:
Sienim Angeli ad altar astant capitibus inclinatis, and cu^ horrore ac tremore
vix audent intueri, propter splendore^ inde emicantem, quis negare potest aliud
ibi esse quam panem? Et si angeli adorant, quis homines reprehendere potest si

jacentem, and peccata mundi tolentem deprecantes: ubi apertissime dicit vocari

suscipiunt.
Chrysostom is objected his Exhortation, that Christians in their approach to
this Sacrament, Do come with horror, fear, and reverence. Next, is their
talking of the Angels, being present at this Celebration, holding down their
heads, and not daring to behold the excellency of the splendour, etc. and to
deprecate the Lamb lying on the Altar. These seem to your Cardinal to be
such invincible Testimonies, to prove the Adoration of Christ as Corporally
present, that he is bold to say, They never hitherto were answered, nor yet
possibly can be. So he; Chrysostomes words in a literal sense; whom
notwithstanding your own See above B. 3. Cha 4. Sect ^. in the Challenge.
Senensis has made to be the most Hyperbolizing Preacher of all the Fathers:
and therefore has given unto all Divines a special Caution against his
Rhetoric, in the point of this Sacrament, lest we understand him literally.
Of which kinds you may have some Instances out of the very places objected,
where Chrysostom. Orat. in Philogon. (...). Idem paulo superius.
Chrysostom says indeed, That we see that Lamb lying on the Altar. And said
he not also, even in the same Oration, We see here Christ lying in the
Manger, wrapped in his clouts; a dreadful and admirable spectacle? So he. But
Cratch or Clothes? or can you talk of Christ's lying on this Altar, who teach,
that as he is in this Sacrament, he has no local Site, Posture, or Position
at all? It is also true of the Angels, he said [(...)] they stand in dread,
and the sight is fearful. And he says no less of the Festival day of
Christ's Nativity, that It is most venerable, and terrible, and the very
Metropolis of all others. Yet does not this argue any Corporal Presence of
Christ, in respect of the day. This Answer, taken from Chrysostom, may
satisfy for Chrysostom.

We grant furthermore to your Bellar. lib 2 de Missa, (...). 15. Quinto --
Omnes Graeci Patres passim vocant terribile Sacrificium, and horroris plenum.
Cardinal, That all the Greek Fathers call the Eucharist terrible, and full
of dread. But what? As therefore implying a Corporal presence of Christ, and
Divine Adoration thereupon? This is your Cardinals scope; but to prove him an
ill marke-man, take unto you an answer from your selves, See above, Book 5.

from Ancient Fathers, who, together with the Eucharist, have See above B. 6.

Chrysostom himself.

As for your objected assistance of Angels, at the Celebration Prayers of the
Faithful, and Baptism will plead for the same honor: your Durandus granting
of the first, that Durand Angeli ad^uur semper nobis orantibus. Lib. 7. cap. 12.
The Angels of God are present with us in our Prayers; and for the second,
Divine Nazianzen teaches that (...) (...). Orat. 40 de Baptismo
The Angels are present at Baptism, and do magnify (or honor) it with their
presence, and observance: notwithstanding none of you ever defended either
Corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament of Baptism, or yet any Adoration
of the consecrated Element of Water therein. If these two may not serve take
unto you this Saying of Augustine, August. de meritis and de (...) Christum
portantur.
They (says he) with fear are brought unto Christ their Physician, that is
(for so he expounds himself) unto the Sacrament of eternal Salvation.
Which one Saying of so Orthodox a Father does instru^ us how to interpret all
your objected Testimonies; to wit, that Whosoever come to the receiving of the
Sacrament of Christ, they ought to come with fear, as if they were in the
presence of Christ. And thus is your unanswerable Objection answered, so that
this your Cable rope being untwisted is become no better

That the most earnestly-objected Phrase [(...)] and Adoration, used of the
Fathers, does not necessarily infer any Divine Worship of the Eucharist.
SECT. III.
We find not your Disputers more pressing and urgent in any Argument, than in
objecting the word, Reverence, Honor, and especially Adoration, for proof
that Divine Honor Eucharist, as to Christ himself, whenever they find the
use of that Phrase applied by Antiquity unto this Sacrament. Our answer is
first in general; That the words Reverence, Honor, and Adoration, simply in
themselves, without the Adjunct and Additament, Divine, cannot conclude the
Divine worship proper to God. To this purpose we desire you not to hearken
unto us, but to hear your selves speak. Mr. Brerely. Pontificales vestes, and
calices coeperunt esse honorandi, Sacramenti causa. Liturg. Tract. 2.. 8. Subd.
2.
The Pontifical Vestments, Chalices (and the like) are to be honored, say
you, but how? with divine honor? you will nor say it; nor will you hold our
ancient Bid worthy of Divine worship, albeit you entitle him Venerable, in a
Religious respect. Yea (under the degree of Divine worship) we our selves
yield as much to the Eucharist, as August. Epist. 164. Baptismum Christi ubique
veneramur.
Augustine did to Baptism, when he said, We reverence Baptism wheresoever.

Accordingly of the word, Adoration, your Cardinal and other Jesuits are bold
to say, that Ribera Ies. in Apoc. 19. Item Viegas Ies. in eundem locum. Nec nos
moveat verbum hoc [Adorare] cum vulgatum sit hoc creaturis tribui, ut Loath cum
vidisset Angelos surrexit, and adoravit eos pronus in terram. 3. Reg. 1.

Johannes adoravit Angelum laeta nunciantem; Cur Angelus recusavit? Gregor. Hom.
8. in Evan. Angelos ante adventura Christi adoraton, post assumptam humanitatem
adorationem recusasse. Eodem modo Glossa, Hugo, Rupertus, and alij nonnulli,
etc. So Suarez Tom. 1. Disp. 54. and Bellarm. Hieronymus non ignorabat
Adorationis multa genera, and aliam soli Deo, aliam rebus deberi sacris. Apol.
c. 1. Primu^. [And hereckoneth Adoration of Relics, Tombs of Martyrs, etc.]
It is sometimes used also in Scriptures for an honor common to Creatures, as
to Angels, to Kings, to Martyrs, and to their Tombs. And although Adoration.
Among the Latin Fathers, one, who knew the propriety of that Language as well
as any, viz. Tertullian, saying, Adoro plenitudinem Scripturarum. Adversus
Hermog. post medium. page 350.
I adore the plenitude of Scriptures; and Gregory Nazianzene, among the Greek,
for his excellency in divine knowledge, Greg. Nazian. (...) Orat. 40.
surnamed the Divine (and therefore may not be thought to apply words belonging
to Divine worship preposterously or improperly) instructed the party baptized
to say thus to the Devil, Fall down [(...)] and worship me. Thus much in
General.

Let us proceed, You to your particular Objections, and We to our Answers. I.
Ob. Ambrose says, that Ambros. lib. 3. de Spirit. sanct. cap. 12. tractans
illum locum Psalm. 98. [Adorate Scabellum pedum ejus.] Per Scabellum terra
intelligitur, per tertam autem caro Christi, quam hodie quoque in mysterijs
adoramus: and quam Apostoli in Domino Jesus adoraverunt. Ob. 1. per Bellarm.
Apol. cap. 8. page 107. Hic locus nullam admittit solutionem. Item lib. 2. de
Euchar. cap. 14.
We adore in these mysteries the flesh of Christ, as the footstool of his
Deity. You call this an Argument infallible: nay (say we) but false, because
Ambrose does not say, that we adore the Sacrament, (which is the point in
Question) but that in our mystical Celebration of the memory of Christ his
Passion, we are to adore his Humanity, namely as it is hypostatically united
to the person of his Godhead, which all Christians profess as well Ob.
August. in Psalm. 98. Nemo illam earnem manducat, nisi prius adoraverit. Ob.
Bellarm. Alius locus insignis. Lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 24.. Alius.
None (says Augustine) does eat the flesh of Christ before he adore it. A
Testimony which seems to you Notable: but which we judge to be indeed not
able at all to prove the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament, even in the
Judgment of Saint Augustine, who has everywhere distinguished between the
Sacrament and Christ's Flesh, as between Bread and Christ's Body, as has been
often demonstrated. His meaning therefore is no more but this, that whosoever
shall communicate of this Sacrament, the Symboll of Christ must first be a true
Christian, believing Christ is not only man, but God also, and adore him
accordingly with Divine honor, as well before and without the Sacrament, as at
the receiving thereof. Even as (...) (...) Edit. Paris. 1027.
(...), speaking of Baptism, says that The Catechumenists do adore the Father
and the Son, but they are not perfect before they are baptized in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. So Athanasius. Consider
the words well, the Catechumenists are said not to be perfect, before they are
baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whom they adore.
Therefore did they first adore the Persons, in whose names they were baptized:
except some will feign a Christian Catechumenist Baptism before he believe
and profess that he believes; which is the Adoration of the Blessed Trinity.
And is there any of your Priests so unchristian, as not to adore Christ, before
he come to the Communion? A plain Case.

* Notwithstanding, were it that the Adoration, above objected out of Saint
Augustine, should refer to the time of the Celebration of the Eucharist; yet
will he not admit of any other Veneration therein, then what may be held as
well in the Sacrament of Baptism; he requring that in August. de doctrine
Christia lib. 3. cap. 8. (...) intelligit, non hoc veneratur quod videtur and
transit, sed illud portius, quo (...) cuncta referenda suit -- Paulo post;
Sicut est (...) Sacramentum and celibratio Corporis Christi, quae un^squisque
cum percipit quo referantur imbutus agnoscit, ut ea non cornali servitute, sed
spirituali (...) liberate ven^^etur. -- Vt (...) and sign (...) significatis
(...).
Veneration be not applied to the Sacrament it self, but to the things
signified thereby. Which Doctrine of Saint Augustine may serve for an (...) as
against all other Idolatrous infections, so against your Objection, taken from
the false conceits of Pagans; as if they had approved of the false Adoration
used by Christians, thinking that they had adored the Sacrament, as they
themselves See above Book 5. Chap. 6. Sect. 3.
adored Ceres and Bacchus. But those godly Christians (you know) did not adore
the Bread and Wine: Therefore could not this be applyable to the matter in
Controversy. *

Augustine, by you, are like Bellerophons Letters, to confute you; for lest
Saint Augustines Reader might mis-construe the meaning of Christ's words, by
perverting them to a Corporal and Orall eating of his Flesh, August. in (...)
98. Non hoc corpus quod videris munducaturi estis -- spiritual ter intellectum

Saint Augustine adds (bringing Christ speaking to the Jews, concerning the
eating of his ^lesh) You are not to eat this flesh, which you see: he says
not, You are not to see the flesh which you shall eat, (which is your Romish
Iugling:) But thus, You are not to eat the flesh which you see, namely that,
which then was visible when Christ was in the Augustine may satisfy for the
present, until another shall be delivered from him absolutely See (...) Chap.
4. Sect. 2.
confuting your Tridentine Faith of the Divine worship of the Host, to prove it
Idolatrous.

* II. Ob. Ambrose furthermore requires, that the Communicant come with Fear,
and a mind knowing that Dr. Heskins in his Parlium Book 3. Chap. 57 out of
Ambrose. Devoto animi and cum timore accedendum ad Communionem docet, ut sciat
men's reverentiam debere ei, ad cujus corpus ^umendum accedit.
he owes reverence to him, whose Body he comes to receive. Which words
your Doctor calls Plain terms. Sol. And so indeed they are, for proof of
an Adoration to Christ, who is spiritually received in our receiving this
Sacrament: ^ut not to the Sacrament it self, as unto the very person of
Christ. Yea, and the same Reverence we also profess to be likewise due unto
Christ, even in the hearing of his holy word. *

III. Ob. Theodoret seems unto you to come off roundly, saying that Theod.
Dial. 2. Signa mystica post sanctificationem manent in priore substantia,
figura, and forma, sicut prius: Intelliguntur autem ea, quae facta sunt, and
creduntur: [(...)] adorantur. Ob: Bellarm. lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 27. Sed
apertissime -- As^^^t praesentiam Domini in Eucharistia, quia panis consecratus
est vere id quod intelligitur, creditur and adoratur.
Symbols and Signs are believed and adored, whereby he most evidently
teaches the presence of Christ's flesh Adoration here, as most evidently
noting a Divine worship of the Sacrament, seeing that he has before confessed
the same word, Adore, to be used of the Fathers, sometimes for worship
communicable to Angels, and Saints, and to their Tombs? yea, and when as also
Theodoret (which proves your Cardinals Objection lucklesse) does expressly say,
that The substance of Bread remains, meaning absolutely the substance of
Bread (as has been See this discussed to the full. Book 3.
copiously proved) whereunto no Divine worship can be lawfully given, not only
in the Faith of all other Catholic Fathers; but even in the belief of the
Roman Church at this day? And although the Symbols, and Signs (as you fancy)
were mere Accidents, yet dare not you your selves say that they are to be
properly adored with Divine Worship.

Hitherto have we insisted upon the words objected out of the Fathers, by you,
with more eagerness, than either with good

CHAP. III.
That no objected Act out of the Fathers, for proof of an Invocation by Divine
Adoration of the Eucharist, is conscionably alleged; not the first, which is
their prescribed Concealment of this Mystery.
ACts insisted upon by you, for proof of Adoration; are these; The Fathers
injoyning a Concealment of this Mystery from some others: their Elevation of
the Host after Consecration: their Cautelousnesse in administering it, without
letting any part thereof fall to the ground: their Bodily Gesture in token of
Humiliation; and their pretended Invocating on it. We acknowledge (that we
Mystery should be kept secret from all persons, who were not initiated by
Baptism, and incorporated thereby into the visible Church of Christ, were they
Infidels or Catechumenists (that is) unbaptized Christians. Upon this our
Confession, as the Base, hearken what a discant your Doctors can chant, saying
as follows; Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. ciiat Augustine Sermon. 10. de
verbis Apostol. viz. Quod corpus dixit escam, and sanguinem potum, Sacramentum
fidelium agnoscunt fideles -- Be hanc phrasin [norunt fideles] habet in locis
infinitis: at profecto non est fidelibus tantum notum, quod corpus Christi fide
percipiatur. Idem. Objicit Claudius de Sanctes ante lib. de Liturgijs patrum.
Rursus Bellar qui sup. cap. 15. At certe nulla reddi potest causa, cur
Eucharistiam ne videri quidem permitterent Infidelibus, vel etiam Catechumenis,
si nihil est nisi signum.
The Fathers said of this mystery of the Eucharist that only [Fideles norunt]
the Faithful know it: and therefore we must be persuaded they understood
Corporal Presence of Christ herein; and consequently a Divine Adoration due
unto it. Master Brerely swells big, in amplifying this Objection; take a
brief of the whole. The Fathers professing to write more circumspectly of this
Sacrament, so as not daring to explain it, as Theodoret, Origin, Augustine,
Chrysostom; this were causlesse, if the Fathers had thought Christ's words
figurative: nor had it been more necessary in this than in Baptism, had the
Fathers acknowledged no other presence in this, than in Baptism, etc. So he;
and so also your Irish Mr. M^llon in his Reply, page 221.
Jesuit.

Well then, by your own judgment, if it may be found that Circumspection in
the manner of uttering, and Cautelousnesse in concealing the Sacrament of
Baptism from Infidels and Catechumenists; then must you confess that this
your Argument makes no more for proof of a Corporal Presence in the
Eucharist, as you would have it, than in Baptism, where you confess it is no.
And now behold the Fathers are as precise in concealing the Mystery of
Baptism, from all persons unbaptized, even in as express terms as was spoken
of in the Eucharist; Chrysostom saying, (against such Persons) Chrysostom. in
Gal. 4. Non natura, sed Dei promissio Sacramentum fecit: sic renascentia nostra
natura quidem nulla est, caeterum verbum Dei, (...).
The faithful know this. And again, entering into a discourse of Baptism, he
prefaceth saying; And again in 1. Cor. Hom. 40. about to entreat of the words
of S. Paul, [Quid facientij, qui baptizantur pro mortuis? [(...) * And yet
again, in Ioh. 85. Hom. 33. joining that Contemplation of Baptism and of the
Eucharist together, he says; (...). id est, Initiati. *
I would indeed speak this plainly, but I dare not, because of them that are
not initiated, or Baptized.

* Basil also, speaking of the Rites of Baptism, says that Basil. de Spir.
Sanct. Cap. 27. Consecrare oleum unctionis, hominem ter mergi, renuntiare
Satanae, and reliqua etiam in Baptismo, unde habemus? nonne ex antiqua
traditione? nonne ex doctrina, quam Patres in silentio, quod curiosos and
otiosos submovet, servarunt?
The Ancient Fathers (before his time) left them in silence; and preserved them
from curious and idle men. * And Dionysius, the supposed Areopagite, Dionys.
Hierar. cap. 2. (...).
Let none that is not a perfect Christian be admitted to the sight of the
signs of Baptism: even as the Council Con^. Arau^^^n. 1. Catechumeni non
sunt ad Baptismum admittendi. Can. 19.
Arausicanum also decreed. Which Cautions Corporal Presence of Christ in
Baptism, and consequently an Adoration of Christ in the same Sacrament, you
your selves (we know) would but hiss at him, in detestation of his
Consequence, as judging it Idolatrous.

But do you ask, why then the Fathers did teach Christians not to speak of
these Mysteries in the hearing of the Catechumenists? Saint Augustine himself
(whom your Cardinal has Corporal Presence) will resolve us, and witness
against him, telling him, not that the reason was the sublimity of the matter,
as though they could not apprehend it, but because Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. (...) in
Ioh. Quid si eis fidelium Sacramenta non producuntur, non ideo fit, quod ea
far non possent, sed ut ab (...) tanto ardentius concupiscantur, quanto
honorabilius eis occultantur. [Speaking of the Catechumenists.]
The more honorably the Sacraments are concealed (speaking in general) the
more ardently they would be coveted and desired. As for their not revealing
them unto Infidels, the reason is evident; Infidelity is a mocker, and they
meant to preserve Christ's Sacrament from contempt. Thus your most specious
Objection serves for nothing more than to prove your Disputers to be
wonderfully precipitant in their Arguing.

That the objected Elevation, or lifting up of the Host, and preserving of it
from falling, are no Arguments of Divine Adoration. SECT. II.
SEcondly, the Elevation of the Host over the head of the Priest is your
ordinary Objection, for proof of a Divine Adoration; although you have Suarez.
See above Book 6. Chapter 1. Sect. 5. at (a.)
confessed, that this was not of prime Antiquity. But supposing Elevation to
have been so ancient, yet was it not to the end it should be adored, no more
than was the Book of the Gospel, in the Roman Church, when it was (according
to the Rite then Durant. de Ritib. lib. ^. cap. 23 number. 7 In ordine Romano
Diaconus osculans Evangelium, levat in manus codscem, and partem ejus in dextro
humero ponens, vadit ad Ambonem.
Lift up by the hands of the Deacon, and carried on his right shoulder. What
else will you say of the Priests elevation? you would persuade (in the Idem de
Ritibus l. 2. cap. 40. in Psalm 71. In capite montium: hoc est (ait Rabbi
Jonathan) Sacrificium in capitibus Sacerdotum. Durand. Rational. lib. 4. cap.
42 number. 54. Elevatu^. ut populus congreslus consecrationem factam esse, and
Christum super Altar venisse reverenter prosternatur in terram, and illum ore
adoret. Et Durant. quo supr. Adorationis ergo Eucharistiam in altum attolli,
Durandus and Ivo asserunt, Probabile est.
Margin) by some, that the Priest lifting the Host over his head, was
prophesied of by the Psalmist; And, that the Rite of holding the Host up was
chiefly, that the people knowing it to be now consecrated, should understand
that Christ is on the Altar, whom they are to adore by falling down on the
ground. Whereof albeit some of you speak more confidently, yet the most
principal searcher into Antiquity dare say no more, than only This is
probable.

Rabbinish interpretation can be no good ground to rest upon, which See above,
B. 3.
has bin rejected by Bellarmine, as being idle and frivolous. 2. That the
Ceremony of Elevation (as has See above, B. 6. Chap. 4. Sect. 5.
been confessed) was neither instituted by Christ, nor yet always in use in
Christ's Church. 3. That the same Elevation, albeit used after Consecration,
does not so much as Probably prove it was for Adoration-sake, because it was
as well in use in your lifting up of the Host before Consecration; as your
objected Missals published by Claudius Sanctes a Parisian Doctor, before
Consecration, in the Missal of S. James, Attollens: In the Mass of Basil.
Exaltans panem.
Missals of Saint James, and Basil do manifest. Lastly, Elevation was practiced
after Consecration, the objected Authors confute your Assertion, for in
Chrysostom (if we should grant unto you the whole Liturgy to be his, which
the best learned Grecians at this day do (...), etc.
deny) it is read, After Consecration in the Mass of Chrysostom. Modicum
attollens Sacerdos, dicit Sancta sanctis.
That the Priest did take a portion out of the dish, and held it up but a
little: this is not lifting it over the head, or very high, as your reason for
Adoration would require. And in your objected S. In Dionys. Areoprelating the

the break-necke of your whole Defense.

the Elevation of the Chalice for the same end? whereof it is confessed by your
own Ritualist, that Barthol. Gavant. Com. in Rubr. Missae. Tunc se erigens

The elevation of the Chalice, that the people might adore it, was not
commanded until after the days of Thomas Aquinas. So he; and that (you know)
was a thousand and some hundredth of years after Christ his Institution of this
Sacrament. It were strange, if the Romish Faith had then been, that the Blood
of Christ, being Corporally in the Sacrament, and Consequently adored of the
people, that the Primitive Church should not have used an Elevation of the Cup,
for better Accommodation-sake, as well as your new Romish Church has ordained
so many Ages since. Not to tell you of the Church under Prester-Iohn, which (as
is Cassand. in Liturg. cap. 11. Sacerdos sublevet, Id ipsum quoque facit in
Calice, sed non elevat.
confessed) used no Elevation. *

Your third Objection is the diligent Caution given by Ancient Fathers, to take
heed Tertull. in lib. de Corona milit. Calicis aut panis aliquid in terram

conse^rated Bread and Wine falling to the ground should be left to the
Sacrificer, and the rest remaining should be burnt with fire unto ashes. So
great a Reverence was then prescribed. Ibid. Tract. 2. Sect 8. Subd 4. * Bell.

patimur. *
Lest that any Crum should fall to the ground, and if any little part thereof
should fall, it should be left to the Priest, and the Remainder of the
Sacrament after the Mass (say you) should be burnt to ashes, and the ashes
laid up. So you. Pharaoh his Butler and Baker, we are sure, would have been
loath to miscarry in spilling, or letting fall any part of their carriage, when
they were to present their service unto their King; much more carefully ought
every Christian, in executing his sacred Function, to observe the Laws of
Decorum. Mark we, by the way, Master Brerely durst not call the part falling
any thing but a Part, not A part of Christ's Body, that were Impious, not a
part of Accidents, that were absurd: what means the childish Fabling little
part a part of Bread, as your objected Dionysius spoke? And when all is said,
we hear no proof of Divine Adoration of the Host. But we leave you to take
your Answer from your Salmeron, who has told you that See above, B. 1. Chap 3.
Sect. 10. in Answer to the second pretense.
Casual spilling of the Cup is no sin.

* Howbeit, we ask you, whether it were a Venial sin in your Cardinal, to
allege the words of Tertullian, as spoken of the Bread and Wine in the
Eucharist, which, by the judgment of your own Gabriel Epis^. Albisp. lib. 2.
Observat. 35. in lib. Tert. ad uxorem [Calicis and panis nostrialiquid in
terram decuti anxie patimur.] Pameliusin eum locum. Quod addit (inquit) panis
nostri, facit ad distinctionem Bucharistiae Sacramenti, in quo non calix and
panis communis proponu^tur. And the Bishop himself; Tertul. laudat aetatis
suae morem, quo aegre ferebant si casu communis panis and vini aliquid in
terram exciderit.
Authors were spoken of Common and ordinary Bread and Wine? It were well that
this kind of oversight both in Cardinal Bellarmine and Master Brerely were not
in them a fault Common and ordinary. Howsoever we could tell you, that if the
hazard were so great, as your Objections imply, namely, that any subject matter
of Adoration had been believed to be in it, than was the holy Bishop Exuperius
(whom notwithstanding Saint Hierome commends) much blameable for Hier. ad
Rustic. cap. 4. commending the Bp. Exuperius. Nihil de illo dicimus, qui corpus
in canistro, and sanguinem portabat in vitro.
Carrying it in a Glass. And much more condemnable should that godly Pope
Zephyrinus have been De Consec. D. 1. C. Vasa. -- Zepherinus Episcopus patenis
vitrcis Missas celebrare constituit.
Who ordained that the Mass should be celebrated in Chalices of Glass; which
the more brittle they were, the more solidly they confirm unto us this Truth,
that Antiquity harbored not your belief of a Corporal Presence of Christ in
this Sacrament. *

Only we must again insist in the former Observation, to wit, the frequent
speeches of the Fathers, telling ^s of Crumbs, Fragments, little parts of this
Sacrament; and of Burning them into ashes, after the Celebration ended. Now
answer us, in good sadness; was it ever heard of, we say not of ancient
Fathers, but of any professing Christianity, were the Catholics or Heretics,
who would not have judged it most execrible for any to say, or think that A
crum, or little part of Christ's Body falls? or that by a dash of the Cup,
the Blood of our Lord is spilt or that the Primitive Remainder of the
Sacrament, Burned their Savior? Yet these must they both have thought, and
said, if (as you speak of Eating, Swallowing, feeding Corporally on Christ's
Body) the Body of Christ were the proper Subject of these accidental Events.

That the Objection taken from any Gesture, used in the days of Antiquity,
does not prove a Divine Adoration of the Eucharist.
GEsture is one of the points, which you object, as more observable than the
former, but how? because Chrysostom will have the Communicant take it with
Chrysostom: in Liturg Postea similiter Sacerdos sumit sanctum panem, inclinato
capite ante sacram mensam orans.
Inclining his head down before the holy Table. Cyril, by Cyril. Hieros.
Mystag. 5. Accede. ad calicem sanguinis illius pronus [(...).]
Bowing after the manner of Adoring. You will be still like your selves,
insisting upon H^terogenies, and Arguments which conclude not ad idem. For
first, the Examples objected speak not of Bowing down to the Sacrament, but
of our Bowing down our heads to the ground, in signification of our
Unworthiness; which may be done in Adoring Christ [Sursum corda] that is,
Listing up our hearts to Christ above. And this may become every Christian to
use, and may be done without Divine Adoration of the thing before us.

Nay, and that no Gesture, either Standing, Sitting, or Kneeling, is necessary
for such an Adoration, your greatest. Advocate does show out of Antiquity, and
affirms this as a Point (as Espencaeus. Nec disputatio super Adorandi gestu,
cum de Adorationis substantia inter omnes semper convenerit, ac etiamnum
convenit, stantes aut sedentes, proni aut supini, erecti aut geniculati,

Adoratio non tam in externo cultu, quam intimo mentis affectu cernitur. Lib. 2.
de Adorat cap. 16. initio.
he says) agreed on by all; adding that Divine Adoration consists not in the
outward Gesture, but in the Intention of the mind. For, indeed, there is no one
kind of outward Gesture, which (as you have confessed) Rubric of The Latin
is, Inclinantes Altari: but since I find it in the Greek (before
Consecration) (...); and so thrice the like. After Consecration; (...) [Behinde
the Table bowing down his head.] And again (...).
Chrysostomes Liturgy, that the Ministers did use to Incline their Bodies to
the holy Table, yet none can be so simple to think that they did yield Divine
honor unto the Table. Nay, your own great Master of Ceremonies Durant Peracta

Sacerdos, humilitatem Christi significat. -- Sacerdos reflexus ad Altar, cum
paratur Consecratio. Lib. 2. de Ritib. cap. 25.
Durantus has observed the like Bewing down of the Priest in the preparation
of this Sacrament, even Before Consecration; and one of your Jesuits
witnesses that the (objected) Vasquez. Ies. Graec^ Ecclesia ante
Consecrationem reverenter adorat, etia^ si non sit ibi Christus. De Adorat.
lib. 2. c. 11. [Falsly commenting that this was Divine honor, and just.]
Greek Church at this day does Reverently adore, before Consecration of the
Bread and Wine, albeit Christ be not therein. And lest you may think your
Posture of Kneeling to be absolutely necessary, we refer you, for your
ample satisfaction, to your own learned French Bishop Gabriel Episc. Albisp.
Observat. sacr. lib. 1. Observe. 12.
professedly discussing this Point.

This being known, how can you in any credibility conclude, as you have done,
a Corporal presence of Christ in this Sacrament after Consecration, from a
Reverence which has been yielded to the same Sacrament, before it was
consecrated? In which consideration your Disputers stand so much the more
condemnable, because, whereas they show some Examples of a Bodily Inclining to
the Sacrament, done before Consecration, yet after Consecration they have not
produced any one.

But what news now? We blush, in your behalf, to repeat the Instance which
you have out of your Legends, of a Mr. Brerely Liturg. Tract. 2.. 9. Subd. 3.
[Out of Bellarm. and Bellar. out of Antoninus.] -- When (not unlike to the
reproof which God miraculously gave to Balaam by the speech of an Ass) a
bruit-beast for our instruction did prostrate himself in reverence before the
blessed Sacrament.
Brute Beast prostrating it self before the Host, and doing Reverence unto it.
We would have concealed this, but that you seem to glory as being for your
Instruction, like to the reproof given miraculously to Balaam by his Ass.
Well might this Legend have become that latter time of darkness, wherein it
was first hatched, but not these clear days, wherein your mysteries of
Delusions have been so often revealed, and when all Christians almost in all
Countries have taken knowledge of an BANKS HIS HORSE; according to his Masters
own Relation.
Horse taught by Art to kneel to any person at his Masters command; and once
in France, when, by the Suggestion and Instigation of Romish Priests, his
Master was called into question for Sorcerie, he for kneel before a Crucifix,
and thereby freed himself from suspicion of Diabolical familiarity, according
to the Principles of their own superstition. And for any one to conclude this
to have bin Gods miraculous work in that Horse, (as the other was in that Ass)
would seem to be the reason of an unreasonable man; because all Miracles
always exceed all power both of Art, and Nature; else were they no Miracles at
all. Thus to your fourth Objection from outward Acts, we pass on to Examples.

That no Example of Invocation, objected out of Antiquity, can
YOur Instances are Three; the principal in Gorgonia, the Sister of Gregory
Nazianzen, in whose Oration, at her Funeral, we find that Greg. Nazian. Orat.
11 de Gorgonia. Soror Gorgonia adversa corporis valetudine laborabat -- eratque
prodigiosum morbi genus, quod nec medicorum art, nec parentum lachrymis, nec
publicis precibus sanari potuit: desperatis omnibus alijs auxilijs intempesta
nocte captata ad Altar cum side procumbit, eumque qui super isto honoratur
ingenti clamore invocans, cum caput suu^ part cum clamore Altari admovisset,
and deinde hoc pharmaco (i.e. Lachrymarum, ut exponit Elias Cretensis)
perfudisset, and si quid uspiam [(...)] Antityporu^ preciosi Corporis and
Sanguinis manu recondrderat, ad lachrymis admiscursset (o rem admirandam!)
statim se morbo liberatam sentit.
She having been troubled with a prodigious disease, after that neither the Art
of Physic, nor tears of her Parents, nor the public Prayers of the Church
could procure her any health, went and cast her self down at the Altar,
Invocating Christ, who is honored on the Altar, saying that she would not
remove her head from the Altar, until she had received her health: when (Oh
admiable event!) she was presently freed from her d^sease. This is the Story
set down by Gregory Nazian^en. Hence your Cardinal concludes, that Gorgonia
invocated the Sacrament, as being the very Body and Blood of Christ, and
calls this An hot and and so indeed it may be named, yet only in respect of
them, whose consciences are scorched, or stung with their own guiltiness of
in forcing and injuring the Story, as will now appear.

For first, why should we think that she invocated the Sacrament? Because
(says your Bellar. Procumbens ante Altar cora^ venerabili Sacramento -- Quid
autem super altar colatur, dubium esse non potest, cum nihil ibi ponatur nisi
Panis and Vinum, mutanda in corpus and sanguinem Christi -- Petium Martyre^
valde ussit pupugitque hic locus. Lib. 2. de Euch cap 14
Cardinal) she prostrated her self at the Altar, before the Sacrament; which
words [Before the Sacrament] are of his own coining, and no part of the Story.
His next reason; Because she is said to have invocated him, who is honored on
the Altar. As though every Christian praying at the Table of the Lord, to
Christ, may not be justly said to Invocate him, who is used to be Honored by
the Priest, celebrating the memory of Christ thereon. Nay, and were it granted,
that the Sacramental Symbols had been then on the Altar, yet would it not
follow, that she invocated the Sacrament, as betokening a Corporal presence of
Christ (as your Disputers have fancied) no more than if the said godly woman
upon the same occasion presenting her self at the sacred Font, wherein she had
been baptized, could be thought to have invocated the water therein; because
she was invocated him, who is honored in the Administration of Baptism. And
furthermore it is certain, that the Remainders of the Sacrament in those days
were kept in their Pastophorium, a See above, Book 4. Chap. 1. Sect. 10. As
further also appears in the Liturgy of pope Clement; Accipiant Diacont
reliquias, and portent in Pastophoria (Doubtless from the Altar to a place
remote.) Test pamelio Tom 1 Missal. Patrion Latin. page 118.
place severed from the Altar, especially at this time of her being there,
which was in the Night, as the Story speaks.

O! but she was cured of her disease at the Altar. And so were other miraculous
Cures wrought also at the Font of See above, Book 4. Chap. ^ Sect. 5.
Baptism. But, for a Conclusion, we shall willingly admit of Gregory Nazianzen
to be Vmpier between us. He, in relating the Story, says of the Sacrament of
the Eucharist; (...) Orat. 11. quo supra.
If she at the time of her invocating had laid up any part of the Antitypes
(or Symbols) of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, that she mingled with
her tears. So he, calling the consecrated Sacrament Antitypes, or Signs of
Christ's Body: thereby signifying, that the Sacrament is not the Body and Blood
of Christ, as has been Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6.
proved unto you at large out of Nazianzen, and other Greek Fathers, Whereas
if indeed he had meant that the Body and Blood of Christ had been there
corporally present, as that which was Invocated; then now (if ever) it had
concerned this holy Father to have expressly delivered his supposition thus,
viz. If she had at that time of her Invocating laid up any whit of the precious
Body and Blood of Christ. We say of the Body and Blood of Christ, and not (as
he said) of the Antitypes, or Signs of his Body and Blood. Thus is your hot
and stinging Reason become chilly, cold, and altogether dronish.

Your second Instance is in Dionysius the Areopagite, who writing of the
Sacrament Bellar. Dionys. Areop. Hier. cap. 3. part. 3. O divinissimum and
sacrosanctum Sacramentum, obducta tibi significancium signorum operimenta
aperi, etc. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 3. Item ipsum invocat Sacramentum, and petit
ab ipso, quae a solo Deo recte peti possunt. And, Durant. de Rit ib. lib. 2.
cap. 11. And indeed who not?
said, O must divine Sacrament, reveal union us the mystery of thy signs,
etc. which in the ears of your Disputers ringeth a flat Invocation of the
Sacrament: * And that Mallon. Ies. in his Reply.
Nothing could be said more plainly. * Contrariwise we confidently affirm,
that your Teachers have taken a figure Prosopopoeia for Invocation; like men
who take Moonshine for Daylight, as we shall manifest by Examples,
Confessions, yea and the very Instance of Dionysius himself.

Prosopopoeia then is a figure, when one calls upon that which has no sense,
as if it had sense; as when in Scripture the Prophet Hear o Heavens, and
hearken o Earth, Isa. 1. In like manner, among the Ancient Fathers, one called
upon his own Church Anastasia, whence he was to depart, and saying thus,
Nazian. Orat. 32. (...).
Oh Anastasia, which have restored our Doctrine, when it was despised! Others
of the Element of Baptism, thus: Oh water that has washed our Savior, and
deserved to be a Sacrament! or thus, Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. cap. 22. O aqua,
tu aspersum sanguine (Christum) lavisti, Sacramentum Christi esse meruisti, etc.
Oh water which once purged the world, yea (as another) and naming it Optat.
lib. 6. cont. Parme^. O aqua, quae and purum feceras orbe^, and terra^ lavisti.
Greg. Nyssen. Divinu^ lavacrum, See above, Book 3. C. 3.. 13.
A Divine Lavacre, etc. Nay, you your selves can sing, and chant it to the
Cross, O salve Crux, spes unica! auge piis justitia^, etc. Est Prosopopoeia.
Vasquez. Ies. lib. 2. de Adorat. Disp. 9. cap. 4. page 445.
Oh Cross our only hope, etc. and in expounding the same, allow no more than a
Prosopopoeia and figurative speech, lest that otherwise your Invocation may be
judged Idolatrous. And whereas in another Romish Anthem it is sung of the
Eucharist, Oh holy Feast! This Saying (says another O sacrum co^vivium! quod
omni Sacramento convenit. Tolet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 2. cap. 15. page
366.
Jesuit) agrees to every Sacrament. Thus have you heard both from Fathers,
and from your selves the like Tenor of Invocation; Oh Church! Oh Water! Oh
Cross! Oh Feast! nothing differing from Dionysius his Oh Divine Sacrament! yet
each one without any proper Invocation at all.

And that you may further understand, that this Dionysius his OH! is as in
voice, so in sense the same which we judge it to be, Dionysius, than was his
Greek Scholiast Pachymeres? who has given his Judgment of this very speech
directly, saying that Pachym. in locum Dionys. (...). Ex Orat. 42.
It was spoken as of a thing having life, and that fitly, as did Nazianzen,
says he; O great and holy Pascha, etc. And how should this be otherwise?
seeing Dionysius, at the writing hereof, was not in any Church or place, where
the Eucharist was celebrated, but privately contemplating in his mind upon this
holy Mystery. The due consideration of these your former so frivolous, and so
false Objections provokes us to cry out, saying, Oh Sophistry, Sophistry! when
will thou cease to delude the souls of men? In which manner of speech,
notwithstanding, we do not Invocate, but rather detest, and abominate your
Romish Sophistry. And lest any of you should stumble upon the Attribute, which
Dionysius gives to the Eucharist, in calling it a Divine Sacrament, as if it
should imply a Corporal Presence therein, read Corporal Existence of Christ,
we are sure: for there he equally names the place of Celebration, See above
Book 3. Chap. 3. Sect 13.
Divine Altar; the Sacramental Signs, Divine Symbols; the Minister, Divine
Priest; the Communicants, Divine People; yea and (which may muzzle every
Opponent) the matter of this Sacrament, Divine Bread.

In the third place is objected this saying of Basil; When the Bread is shown,
what holy Father has left in writing the words of Invocation? Thus that
Father, whence your Father Bellarmine Basi^i de Spir. sanct. cap. 2^ [Verba
Invocationis, cum ostenditur, quis Sanctorum in scripto nobis reliquit?] Hunc
habemus morem veteris Ecclesiae, ut post consecratione^ ostenderetur populo
Eucharistia, quod nunc fieri videmus, and conceptis verbis invocaretur. Ob.
Bellar. lib. 2 de Euch. cap. 25. Alterum. And Durant. de Ritib. lib 2. cap. 11.
Plane ab ipsis Ecclesiae incunabilis post Consecrationem Eucharistiam in altum
tollere, Dionys. and Basil. de Spiritu Sancto, cap. 27, etc.
Hence know we the Custom of the ancient Church, namely, that the Eucharist is
shown to the people after Consecration. And that Then (as we see now done
among us) it was Invocated upon, even plainly after Consecration, says your
Durantus also, and indeed almost who not? But do you first, if you please,
admire the wit of your Cardinal in so framing his Consequence, and after abhor
his will to deceive you, when you have done: for he applies the words, spoken
by Basil of an Invocation before Cons^cration, (when as yet, by your own
Doctrine, Christ is not present) as spoken of an Invocation of the Eucharist
after Consecration; for Corporal Presence of Christ therein, and the Divine
Adoration thereof, as will most evidently appear. For first it is not unknown
to you, that the Greek Church differs from your Roman in the form of
Consecration at this day, they consecrating in words of prayer, and Invocation,
and you in the repetition of Christ's words [This is my Body] wherein there is
Broved above, Book 1. Chapter 2. Sect. 3. in the Challenge.
no Invocation at all. And Basil was of the Greek Church. Secondly, your
Archiep. Caesariens. seu Christoph. de Capite fontium, Tractat. var. Sacerdos
invocando Deum pane^ consecravit: Hanc alij, ut Tertull. Iren. Justin.
Gratiarum actione^ hujusmodi Invocationem seu benedictionem vocant. page 34.
Alicubi Theodoret Basil. Cyril. Hierosol. Iren. Damascen. Theoph. Alex. vocant
Eucharistiae formam (...). Invocationem. Ibid. page 33. And he allegeth your
Lindanus for a Suffragator in this point.
Archbishop of Caesarea, for proof that Invocation by prayers was a form of
Consecration used primitively in the Greek Church, cites the two most ancient
Fathers, Tertullian and Irenaeus; and of the Greek he allegeth Iustine, Cyril,
Damascen, Theophilus Alex. yea, and (by your leave) Basil himself too: and
that Basil was an Orthodoxe Greek Father you will not deny.

Thirdly, therefore (to come home unto you) we shall be directed by the
Objected words of Basil himself, appealing herein to your own consciences.
For your Lindanus was, in the estimation of your Church, the strongest Champion
in his time for your Roman Cause; he, to prove that the form of Consecratio,
of the Eucharist stands not in any prescribed words in the Gospel, but in
words of Invocation by prayer (as See Book 1. Chap. 2.
has been confirmed by a Torrent of Ancient Fathers) says, Paulus non
tradidit forma^ Consecrationis, quod Basilius ita illustrat, ut sano capiti
nihil ad haec sit ullo modo requirendum amplius, cap. 42. de Spir. sancto;
Verba, dum ostenditur panis (inquit) and poculum benedictionis, quis Sanctoru^
nobis reliquit? Lindan. Panop. lib. 4. cap. 41.
That the same is illustrated by these words of Basil, saying, What Father has
left unto us i^ writing the words of Invocation, when the Bread is shown unto
us? adding, That no man of sound Brains can require any more, for the clearing
of the point concerning^th form of Consecration. So then, Invocation was an
Invocation by Prayer unto God, for the Consecration of the Bread let before
them, Invocation of Adoration unto the Eucharist, as already consecrated; which
your Cardinal unconscionably (we will not say, unlearnedly) has enforced.

Look upon the Text again, for your better satisfaction; It speaks expressly
of an Invocation, when Bread is shown: but you deny that Bread is Invocated
upon, until after Consecration. And Basils demanding [What Father before us
has left in writing the words of Invocation?] is, in true and genuine sense,
as if he had expressly said, what Father before us has left in writing Greek
Missals do ratify unto us. For, in the Liturgy ascribed to Saint Liturg. Iac.
[Sancte Domine, etc.]
James the Apostle, the Consecration is by Invocating and praying thus, Holy
Lord who dwell in holiest etc. The Liturgy of Liturg. Chrysostom. [Adhuc
offerimus -- mitte Spiritum, etc.]
Chrys^stome Invocateth by praying; We beseech thee, O Lord, to send thy
Spirit upon these Gifts prepared before us, etc. The Liturgy under the name of
Liturg. Basil. [Respice Domine.]
Basil consecrateth by this Invocation, when the Priest lifts up the Bread,
Look down, O Lord Jesus our God, from thy holy habitation, and vouchsafe, etc.
All these therefore were according to the Example of Christ) Invocations, that
is, Prayers of Consecrating the Sacrament; and therefore could not be
Invocations of Adoration of the same Sacrament. * Which Invocation, in
Consecrating by Prayer, Cyril. Hiero. sol. Mystag. Catech. 3. (...).
Cyril calls an Invocation of the holy Trinity. * And as for any express or
prescribed form or prayer to be used of All, well might Basil say, Who has
set it down in writing? that is, It was never delivered either in Scripture,
or in the Books of any Author of former Antiquity; and this Decret. part. 1.
cap. 11. Ecclesiasticorum. Aug. ex Basilio; Quae scripta nobis, quibus verbis
sit Consecratio, commendavit?
Books of Augustine, out of Basil, saying that No writing has delivered in
what words the form of Consecration was made.

Now then, guess you what was in the brains of your Disputers, in objecting
this Testimony of Basil, contrary to the evident Sense; and accordingly judge
of the weakness of your Cause, which has no better supports than such fond,
false, and ridiculous Objections to rely upon. Such as is also that your (...)
Bellar. lib 2. de Euch. cap 8.. Alt^rum.
Cardinal his objecting the words of (...), concerning the receiving of this
Sacrament, saying, Lord I am not worthy thou should come under the roose of
my mouth: which has been confuted, as unworthy the Sea above B. 5. Chap 5.
Sect. 6.
mention in this case.

If you would have some Examples of Adoring Christ with Divine worship, in the
Mystery of the Eucharist, by celebrating the manner of his death, (as Hierome
may be said to have adored at Jerusalem, Christ in his Cratch; or as every
Christian does Baptism) we could store you with multitudes: but of Adoring
the Eucharist, with a proper Invocation of Christ himself, we have not as yet
received from you any one.

* A Vindication of the Testimonies of Dionysius, Pachymeres, and Nazianzen,
against the late vain Calumniations of a Romish Seducer. SECT. V.
IN the former Section was objected the Testimony of Dionysius, saying of the
Eucharist [o Divine Sacrament!] as if it had been spoken to the Sacrament, by
invocating of it; and implying therein a Divine Adoration, because of that
Corporal presence of Christ under the Formers of Bread and Wine. The
Insufficiency of this Consequence was manifested (besides diverse other
Instances) by the Testimony of Pachym^res your Greek Expositour of Dionysius,
referring us to Nazianzen his like words, when he said [o great and holy
Pascha.]

A late Romish Seducer (to omit his verbal wranglings, which are now removed
in this second Edition) falls foul upon me in an invective Conclusion,
saying [So we see that Bellarmine, Dionysius, Pachymeres, and Nazianzen all
agree: and that only my Lord of Durham has dealt injuriously with them all.]
So he. Even so, as it became an egregious Seducer to say, as will now appear.
The parties, which are said to be injured, are no less than four; Bellarmine
the Objector of Dionysius, Dionysius the Author Pachymeres the Expositor of the
same Dionysius, referring us to the like Saying in Nazianzen, and lastly
Nazianzen himself; unto whose sentence we were so referred. Whose words are
these [o great and holy Pascha:] which words, said I, were spoken to the Feast
of Easter, and not to the Eucharist, and consequently not to Christ as
Corporally present therein. Nay (says the Seducer) by [Pascha] was not meant
the Feast of Easter, but the Eucharist, and that by [o great and holy Pascha]
Nazianzen declares his Invocation of Christ therein. So he. As soon then as
we shall understand the words of Nazianzen aright, we shall easily discern
the Exposition of Pachymeres, and by him the meaning of Dionysius, and
consequently the mere Sophistry (as I called it) of your Cardinal Bellarmine.

The words of Nazianzen, truly translated, are these; [But o Pascha, the great
and holy, the purification of the world, for I will speak unto thee as to
that, which, as it were, has Life.] The last words, [(...)] will assoile the
whole doubt, which Metaphorical Similitude, thus; [As to that, which, as it
were, has Life:] thereby implying, that it is in it self without Life, as
both your Billius the Translator of Nazianzen, and Nicetas his Commentator and
Expositor; and lastly, Nazianzen himself will manifest. I. Billius (being he
whom the Romish Seducer himself has attested, and whom we now assume for our
Proctor) translateth Nazianzen's words thus; [ Billius in Orat. 42. Nazianz.
To enim quasi vita praeditum alloquar. For I will speak unto thee, even as
having Life: or, to that, which, as it were, has Life:] [Quasi] one who, as it
were, has Life? Secondly Nicetas, Metropolitan of Heraclea, is a professed
and privileged Expositor of Nazianzen, him we desire to be our Advocate in
this Cause. [ Nicetas in locum ipsum Nazianz. [O Pascha magnum and sacrum
Pascha, etc.] Haec verba Nazianzeni ad Festum ipsum perinde ac vita praeditum
refert.
These words of Nazianzen [o great Pascha, I say, o sacred Pascha] Nazianzen
(says he) refers unto the Feast it self, as if it were endued with Life.]
So he. Do you not see how the words [(...)] that is [As it were having Life]
compelled this learned Bishop to expound the words of Nazianzen as meant
properly [The Feast it selfe] called in Greek and Latin Pascha, and by us
Pace or Easter, and not to the Eucharist? which was that my Conclusion, against
which the Romish Seducer has revelled, and thereupon in a manner reviled me, to
make me a Falsificator like himself.

Lastly Nazianzen is he, whom we reserve for our Patron in this Cause. The
subject matter of the whole Oration of Nazianzen, now mentioned, is (as all
know that have read it) the Celebration of the Great and holy Feast of Easter,
of the which Feast, some few lines after his entrance into his [Pascha of the
Lord, Pascha, and (in honor of the Trinity) I say the third time Pascha. This
is the Feast of Feasts, and Celebrity of Celebrities;] expressly speaking not of
Christ the Lord, nor of the Eucharist, but of that which he calls The Feast
of Feasts: namely, that, which he as expressly named The Pascha of the Lord:
which words in the beginning of Nazianzen's Oration most harmoniously accord
unto his words now controverted in the end of the same Oration with Ecchoing as
it were to the Former says [o great and holy Pascha] namely, in respect of the
same Pascha, the Feast of Feasts, and Celebritie of Celebrities.

But this Romish Seducer, never considering these Premises, peremptorily
posteth on, objecting only the words of Nazianzen immediately following, which
unto a Cursory Reader, might seem to make, for him, some show of Confutation;
for thus he proceeds: [o word of God, and Light, and Life, and Wisdom, and
Power, for I am delighted with all thy names, etc.] Which words we confess are
spoken of Christ, and not of the Feast, whereupon your Seducer concludes, that
the former words [o Pascha] refer likewise to Christ. Which his Erroneous
conceit has been long since confuted by the forenamed Bishop Nicetas,
expressly affirming of these words that They were spoken of the Sea above a^ [12]
Feast, and these last words [o Word of God and Light, etc.] are spoken indeed
to Christ the spiritual Pascha. But how? by Invocation? no: but by Acclamation
(says he) nothing being more Familiar to Orators, Apostrophe's, by Transition
from the Sign to the Thing signified: as here, from the Sign, which was
Christ's day of Resurrection, to the Contemplation of the person risen again.

Notwithstanding, were it that this had been an Invocation of Christ, yet
except it had been an Invocation of him, as he was then in the Eucharist, it
makes nothing at all for Bellarmines Conclusion, which was thus, Ergo Christ
is corporally is this Sacrament, and to be Divinely adored therein.

By all which you may clearly discern the true meaning of Dionysius from his
Expositor Pachymeres. II. The Judgment of Pachymeres, by his Reference to the
Sentence of Gregory Nazianzen. III. The exact Understanding of Gregory
Nazianzen, by the Commentary of the Bishop Nicetas. And IV. the truth of that
Commentary by the Tenor of Nazianzen's Oration it self, as you have heard;
and consequently that there is still just Cause for us to exclaim both against
the Sophistry of your Bellarmine, and rashness and impotencie, if not
impudency rather,

CHAP. IV.
That the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament is thrice Repugnant to the
Judgment of Antiquity. First by their Silence. SECT. I.
YOu are not to require of us, that we produce the express Sentences of
ancient Fathers, condemning the Ascribing of Divine honor to the Sacrament,
seeing that this Romish Doctrine was neither in Opinion nor Practice in their
times. It ought to satisfy you, that your own most zealous, indefatigable,
subtle, and skillful Miners, digging and searching into all the Volumes of
Antiquity, which Divine honor, as due to this Sacrament, either in express
words, or practice; insomuch that you are enforced to obtrude only such
Sentences, and Acts, which equally extend to the honoring of the Sacrament of
Baptism, and other sacred things, whereunto (even according to your own
Romish Profession) Divine honor cannot be attributed without gross Idolatry:
and nevertheless have your Disputers not spared to call such their Objections
Clear Arguments, piercing, and unsoluble.

We therefore make bold hereupon to knock at the Consistory door of the
Conscience of every man, endued with any small glimpse of Reason, and to
entreat him, for Christ's sake, whose Cause it is, to judge between Rome and
Us, after he has heard the case, which stands thus; Divine Adoration of the
Host is held to be, in the Romish Profession, the principal practicke part of
Christian Religion.

Next, the ancient Fathers of the Church were the faithful Registers of
Catholic Truth, in all necessary points of Christian Faith, and Divine
worship. They in their Writings manifoldly instructed their Readers by
Exhortations, Admonitions, Persuasions, and Precepts how they are to demean
themselves in the receiving of this Sacrament; not omitting any Act, whereby to
set forth the true Dignity, and Reverence belonging unto it; many of the same
Holy Fathers sealing that their Christian profession with their Blood. It is
now referred to the Judgment of every man, whether it can fall within his
capacity to think it Credible, that those Fathers, if they had been of the
now Romish Faith, would not have expressly delivered, concerning the due Worship
of this Sacrament, this one word consisting but of two syllables [viz. Divine]
for direction to all Posterity, to adore the Sacrament with Divine honor, even
as it is taught in the Church of Rome at this day: and to have confirmed the
same by some Practice, not of one or other private man or woman, but by their
public form of Prayer, Invocation in their solemn Masses; or else to
confess, that Antiquity never fancied any Divine Adoration of the Eucharist.

Yet two words more. You press the point of the Invocation of the Sacrament
more urgently and vehemently than any other: and we indeed believe that the
ancient Fathers (if they had held, according to the now Roman Church, a
Corporal presence of Christ) would never have celebrated any Mass, without an
express Invocation of the Sacrament, as in your now-Romane Mass, we find it
done, saying, O Lamb of God, etc. or some other like form. Yet know (now)
that your own learned Pamelius has published two large Tomes of all the
Masses in the Latin Church, from Pope Clemens down to Pope Gregory
(containing the compass of six hundred years) we say, Latin Missals above
forty in number; in all which, upon our once reading, we presume to say that
there is not one such tenor of Invocation at all. This our first Reason, taken
from so universal a silence of ancient Fathers, in a case of so necessary a
moment, may be (we think) satisfactory in it self to any man of ordinary
Reason. Our second Objection

That the Ancient Fathers gain-sayd the Corporal presence of Christ in this
Sacrament, and the Adoration thereof, by their Preface, in their presenting the
Host, saying, [Lift up your Hearts.] SECT. II.
[Lift up your Hearts,] and the People to answer, [Wee lift them up unto the
Lord.] This [Sursum Corda] Calvin Calvin. Instit. lib. 2. c. 17.. 36. Nec alia
cau^a in antiqua Ecclesia fuisse institutum, ut ante mysteriotum celebratione^
diceretur, [Sursum corda.]
has objected against you; and your Cardinal confessing that this Preface In
omnibus Liturgiis Graecis Iacobi, Basilij, Chrysostom. et omnibus Latinis habetur
id, quod etiam hoc tempore nos facimus. Bellar lib. 1. de Euch. ca. 14..

was in use in all Liturgies of Antiquity, as well Greek as Latin, and
continued in the Church of Rome unto this day; Then answers, that Respondeo

a rebus terrenis and curis hujus vitae, ad Deum and res aeternas. Non
respondetur, Habemus ad firmamentum, sed [Habemus ad Dominum.] Et certe qui
Christum quaerebant in praesepi, in templo, in sepulchro, Sursum corda
habebant, quia illum quaerebant, qui est super omnia, Deus benedictus in
secula. -- Et fieri potest ut qui terram intuetur, cor deor um -- Sic qui in
Eucharistia Christum quaerunt and venerantur, cor sursum habent, si de ipso
Christo, non de negotiis hujus vitae interim cogitent. Bellarm. Ibid.
He that seeks Christ in the Eucharist, and worshippeth him, if he think
of Christ, and not of the Cares of earthly things, he has his heart above. So
he. As though the word [Above] meant, as the Subject, the person of Christ in
the Eucharist, and not his place of residence in the highest Heavens; contrary
to the word in the Greek Liturg. Graec. [(...).]
Liturgies, which is [(...)] Above, wherein the Church alludeth to that [(...)]
of the Apostle, Coloss. 3. 1. Seek the things that are above, where Christ is
at the right hand of God, as your own Monet ergo Sacerdos populum [Sursum] i.
e. super seipsum elevare corda ad Dominum, juxta exhortationem Apostoli, Col.
3. Quae sursum sunt quaerite, non quae super terram. Durand. Ration. lib. 4.
cap. 33.
Durandus, the Expositor of the Romish Mass, does acknowledge. Saint Augustine
Aug. in Psalm. 148. [Laudate Dominum in excelsis.] Primo de coelo dicit, postea
de terris: laudatur enim Deus, qui fecit coelum and terram. Nos adhuc in imo
sumus, sed cum cogitamus quomodo illic laudetur Deus, cor ibi habeamus: and non
sine causa audimus [Sursum corda.]
It is not without Cause, that it is said, Lift up your hearts; He shows the
Cause to be, that we, who are here at the Bottom, might (according to that of
the Psalmist) Praise God in the highest.

This, one would think, is plain enough, but that is much more, which we
have already proved out of the Fathers, by their Antithesis, and Opposition
between the Altar on Earth, and the other in Heaven; where we have heard See
above, Book 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8. etc.
Chrysostom distinguishing them that fasten their thoughts upon this Below,
from Them that seek Christ in Heaven, as he does Choughs Eagles. Ambrose, as
they that behold the Image, from them that contemplate upon the Truth. Ibid.
Nazianzen, as they that look upon the Signs, from them that see the Things;
and to contemplate upon the Better Altar in Heaven. And the Council of Book 4.
Chap. 11. Sect. 4.
Nice, as they that stoop down, from them that look up aloft. And we may
not forget the Observation which Book 5. Chap. 5. Sect. ^.
Athanasius made of Christ, in his discourse of Eating his Flesh, and drinking
his Blood; purposely making mention of his Ascension into Heaven, thereby to
draw their thoughts from earthly Imaginations, and to consider him as being in
Heaven; as did Aug. See above B. 5. Chapter 3. Sect. 1.
Augustine.

Cyril of Jerusalem is a Father whom you have often solicited to speak for
your Cause in other Cases, but all in vain; shall we hearken to him in this?
He interpreting these words [Lift up your Hearts,] will not have it only to
signify a sequestring of your thoughts from earthly Cares to spiritual and
heavenly (which you say was the meaning of the Council of Nice, as if that
Lifting up their Hearts had been only an exercising of their thoughts upon
that in the hands of the Priest, or on the Altar beneath;) No, but he says
that it is Cyril. Hier. Catech. Mystag. 5. Ob hanc causam clamat Sacerdos
[(...)] quia oportet sursum habere cor, (...), and non ad terrena negotia
deprimere. Paulo post, 19. (...)
To have our hearts in heaven with God the lover of mankind: even as did also
Saint Aug. in Psalm. 85. Certe recte admonet ut Sursum corda habeant: audiant
igitur and faciant, levent ad coelum quod male est in terrati^i enim non
putrescit cor, si levetur ad Deum. Test Pamel. Tom. 1. Missal. in Missa Aug.
(...). page 527.
Augustine interpret this Admonition to be A lifting up of hearts to heaven.
Whom as you have See above, B. 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8.
heard leaving our Eucharisticall Sacrifice on this Altar, so would he have us
to seek for our Priest in heaven: namely, as Origin more expressly said, Not on
earth, but in heaven: accordingly Oecumenius, placing the Host and Sacrifice
where Christ's Invisible Temple is, even in heaven. * Agreeable to this are the
words of Hierome, whom notwithstanding your own Dr. Heskins Parliam. Book 2.
Chapter 53. out of Hier. Epist ad Hebdib. qu. 2.
Doctor has objected as a Patron, for defense of your Romish Mass; Hier ad
Hebdib cap. 2. Ascendamus igitur cum Domino ad coenaculum magnum, stratum, and
accip^amus ab eo sursum Cal^cem Novi Testamenti: Ibique cum eo Pascha
celebrantes, inebriemur ab eo Vino sobrietatis.
Let us ascend with our Lord into the great Chamber prepared and made clean;
and let us receive of him the Cup of the new Testament: and there keeping the
Passover with him, let us be made drunk with the wine of Sobriety. All, as
plain as plainness it self. *

Will you suffer one, whom the world knows to have been as excellently versed
in Antiquity as any other, to determine this Point? He will come home unto
you; Tempore veters Ecclesiae Romanae populus non cursitabat ad videndum id
quod Sacerdos ostendit, sed prostratis humi corporibus, animis in coelum
erectis, gratias agebant Redemptori. Eras. lib. de amab. Eccles. Concord.
In the time of the ancient Church of Rome (says he) the people did not run
hither and thither to behold that which the Priest does show, but prostrating
their Bodies on the ground, they lift up their minds to heaven, giving thanks
to their Redeemer. So he. Thus may we justly appeal, as in all other Causes
of moment, so in this, from this degenerate Church of Rome, to the sincere
Church of Rome, in the Primitive times; like as one is reported to have
Appealed from Caesar sleeping to Caesar waking. Our difference then can be no
other than was that between Mary and Stephen, noted by Ambrose, Ambros. in
Luc. cap. 24. Maria, quae quaerebat Christum in terra, ^angere non potuit:
Stephanus tetigit, qui quaesivit in coelo.
Mary, because she sought to touch Christ on earth, could not; but Stephen
touched him, who sought him in heaven. A third Argument follows.


ALl Divine Adoration of a mere Creature is Idolatry; hereunto accord these
sayings of Aug Tom. 2 Epist. 44. ad Maxim. Christianis Catholicis nihil ut
numen adoratur, quod conditum est a Deo. Ide^ Tom. 8. in Psalm. 98. Timeo
terram adorare, ne me damnet qui fecit coelum and terram. Nazianz. Orat 31.
(...).
Antiquity: No Catholic Christian does worship, as a Divine Power, that which
is created of God. Or thus, I fear to worship earth, lest he condemn me,
who created both Heaven and earth. Or thus, If I should worship a Creature, I
could not be named a Christian. It were a tedious superfluity, in a matter so
universally confessed by your selves, and all Christians, to use Witnesses
unnecessarily. We add the Assumption. But the Romish Adoration of the
Sacrament is an attributing of Divine Honor to a mere Creature, the
Consecrated Bread. For that it is still Bread, you shall find to have been the
Doctrine of Primitive Fathers, if you shall but have the patience to stay
until we deliver unto you a See Book 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Synopsis of their Catholic Judgment herein; after that we have duly
examined your Romish Doctrine by your own Principles, which is the next point.

CHAP. V.
An Examination of the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament
The State of the Question.
IDolatry, by the Distinction of your Jesuits, is either Material, or
Formal. The Material you call that, when the Worshipper adoreth something in
stead of God, in a wrong persuasion that it is God; otherwise you judge the
Worship to be a Formal Idolatry. Now because many of your seduced Romanists
are persuaded that your Romish worship, in your Mass, cannot be subject either
to Material or Formal Idolatry, it concerns us in Conscience, both for the
honor of God, and safety of all that fear God, to prove Both. We begin at
that which you confess to be a Material Idolatry.

That the Romish Adoration of the Host, in the hand of the Priest, is
necessarily a Material Idolatry, by reason of many hundred
IT is a point unquestionable among you, that if the thing, in the hand of the
Priest, be not duly Consecrated, then the Matter Adored is but a mere
Creature; and your Adoration must needs be, at the least, a Material Idolatry.
The Seven defects, set down in your Roman Missal. Romans page 31. Vbi debita
materia deficit, non conficitur Sacramentum. -- Si non sit panis triticeus, vel
si alioqui corruptus. Et page 32. Si Vinum sit factum acetum, vel penitus
putidum, vel de uvis acerbis and non maturis expressum, vel admixtum aquae, ut
sit corruptum, non conficitur Sacramentum.
Missall, and by your Dico, species consecratae perfect misceri possunt cum
liquore specie distincto, and tum non manet sub eis sanguis Christi. Ita
Thomas. Test Suar. Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 67 Sect. 4. Dico. Et Durand. Si plus
apponatur Aquae quam Vini, erit irritum Sacramentum. Lib. 4. cap. 42.
Jesuit, are these; First, If the Bread be not of Wheat; or secondly, Be
corrupt; or thirdly, the Wine be turned Vinegar; or fourthly, of sour; or
fifthly, unripe Grapes; or sixthly, be stinking, or imperfectly mixed with any
liquor of any other kind, the Consecration is void: so that neither Body or
Blood of Christ can be there present; seventhly, yea, and if there be more
Water than Wine. So you. All which Defects how easily they may happen, beyond
the understanding of every Consecrating Priest, let Bakers and Vintners judge.

That there are Six other Missal. Roman in Can. Miss^e. Sex modis contingere
potest formae variatio (nun^rum) per Additionem, detractionem, alicujus vocis
mutationem, vel si una pon^tur loco alterius, corruptionem vocis alicujus,

dictionum variatione, ac deinde per interruptionem, ut pronunciando una^ partem
formae, ac quicscendo per aliquod spacium, vel loquendo aliquid impertinens.
Minima variatio destruit integritatem substantialem, si pereat sensus. Bellarm.
lib. 1. de Sacrament. in Genesis cap. 21.. Secunda Prop. -- Sacramenta rata non
sunt, si dum conferuntur unum tantum verbum, quod ad substantiam pertinet,
omittatur: imo si unius syllabae omissio sensum verborum mutaverit, aut
corruperit, collatum Sacramentum non valet: ut si Sacerdos dixerit, Hoc est Cor
meum, pro [Corpus meum.] Azor. Ies. Institut. Moral. Tom. 1. lib. 5. cap. 28.
Animadvert. -- [Hoc est, etc.] Si quis diminueret aliquid, aut immutaret de
forma Co^secrationis, vel aliquid addat, quod significationem mutaret, non
consiceret Sacramentum. Missal. Romans page 33. Haec sunt necessaria necessitate

Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis. Item Alan. de Sacram. in Genesis cap.
21.
confessed Defects, incident to either Element in the Eucharist, which may
hinder the Consecration; and necessarily infer an Idolatrous Adoration,
AS thus; If the Priest fail in Pronunciation of these words, [Hoc est corpus
meum:] or in these, Hic est calix sanguinis mei: novi, and aeterni Testamenti:
mysterium fide^^ qui pro vobis, and pro multis effundetur in remissionem
peccatorum. Which your Roman Missall and Doctors say may happen, in either of
Addition; or secondly, by Omission; thirdly, by Mutation and Change of any one
Syllable, which may alter the sense of the speech; fourthly, by Interruption of
voice, and by too long pausing in uttering of the words; fifthly, by Corruption
of any word; sixthly, by some Interposition of words between, which are
impertinent. Each one of these faults, (say you) concerning either Element,
does so disannull the Consecration, that The thing adored is still but Bread
and Wine, and therefore the worship thereof must be a Material Idolatry. So
you.

Priest (that we may use your own Examples) to say, Hoc est Cor meum; or, Hoc
est Cor-pus; or, Meum corpus est; or, Hic erit Calix; or, as the Tale goes of
a Priest, who (having many Hosts before him to be consecrated, lest he might
err in his Grammar, in using the singular number for the plural) Consecrated
in these words, Agrippa. Sicut narratur de Sacrificulo, sive verum, sive fabula
sit, qui cum plures haberet Hostias, ne Grammaticam omitteret, in haec verba
consecravit, Haec sunt corpora mea. De vanit. Scient. cap. 3.
Haec sunt corpora mea; These are my Bodies: we say for the possibility of
these and the like Lapses (beside this last from the want of wit) the manifold
infirmities of man's speech, either upon Amazement, or Temulencie, or Temerity
and Negligence,

That there are Four other confessed kind of Defects, in respect of the
Priests Intention, whereby the Consecration being hindered, the Romish Adoration
must needs be materially Idolatrous. SECT. III.
AS for Example, first, Bellarm. Si Sacerdos fingit se consecrare, cum non
consecrat, Christus abest. -- Nisi intentio Ministri fit ^altem virtualis,
animo faciendi quod facit Ecclesia, non est Consecratio. De Sacram. in Genesis
cap. 27. Si quis non intendit conficere, nisi delusorie aliquid agere. Missal.
Romans Page 33. -- Vel ex oblivione, cum hostia aliqua lateat, cum non intendit
consecrare nisi quas videt. Vel si habens coram se vndecim hostias, and
intendat consecrare december, non determinans quas december intendit, non consecrat,
quia requiritur Intentio. Missal. Ibid.
If the Priest in Consecrating (says your Cardinal) have no intention to
consecrate at all; or (to speak from your Romish Missal it self) secondly, If
his virtuall Intention in Consecrating be not to do as the Church does; or
thirdly, If he should consecrate but in mockery; or fourthly, He having more
Hosts before him than he is aware of; if he intend to consecrate fewer than
there are before him; and yet not knowing which of them all to omit. Of the
Easiness of all these Defects, the possibility of retchlesnesse, of
infidelity, of mockery, and of obliviousnesse in some Priests may sufficiently
prognosticate; each of which infers a confessed Material Idolatry.

That there are Six other Defects able to frustrate the Consecration, by
reason of the person of the Priest himself, as being Incompetent for want of
due Baptism. SECT. IV.
FOr first you have a Decret. li. 13. tit. 43. cap. 3. Vehiens ad gradum
Sacerdotij comperit tande^ quod non sit baptizatus, rite fecimus ipsum
baptizari.
Case of one being a Priest, who had not been baptized; and next concerning
Defects of Baptism, you resolve (as before of pronunciation of the form of
the Eucharist) Bellarm. Vel una litera. De Sacram. in Genesis cap. 25.. Secunda
Prop. -- Haec sunt necessaria necessitate Sacramenti, ut nimirum non peccet
Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis: ut in Baptismo si quis dicat,
Baptizo te in nomine Matris, etc. Alan. Card de Sacra^. in Genesis cap. 21. And
Azorius, See above, Sect. 2. lit. (c)
that if in pronunciation of the words of Baptism [Baptizo te in nomine
Patris, Filij, and Spiritus Sancti] the Minister (whether man, or woman) shall
vary one word, which may corrupt the true sense of the words, although but in
one Syllable, or Letter, be it either by adding, removing, changing, or by any
of the six Defects, (already spoken of) as in saying, Ego te baptizo in nomine
Patriae, etc. or the like, then the whole Consecration is of no effect. The
possibility of women's erring in their ministry of Baptism, Cardinal Pole may
seem to teach in that his Article, whereby it is inquired, M. Fox his Acts and
Monum. page 1969.
Whether Parsons, Vicars, and Curates be diligent in teaching women to baptize
Children after the manner of the Church.

Take with you another Case, supposed by your selves, the Cosmus Philiarch. de
offic. Sacerd. Tom. 1. lib. 1. cap. 14. Potest dari casus, sicut audivi datum
esse, quod filius alicujus nobilis sit a levatrice baptizatus aqua ^osacca,
quia est filius nobilis, etc.
Author delivers it at length, the brief is this: The woman baptizeth an
Infant, because it is the Child of a noble man, in Rosewater, the Baptism is
void; the Child is afterward ordained a Bishop, and he is after that sent by
the Pope into diverse parts of the world, and by him innumerable Priests are
ordained; after the death of the Bishop, the case is made known, but who they
were that had been ordained cannot possibly be known, whose Ordinations are
all invalid, and their Ministry and Consecrations of no effect. What remedy
now in this Case? None (says the Author) at all, except there be a Privilege
in the Pope to constitute all them Priests, who had been so irregularly
ordained, only by his word, Dicendo, sint Saderdotes, saying, Be they all
Priests. So he, who notwithstanding had rather think the Case could not
possibly happen, than to trust to this Remedy. How-ever it might be in this
one, the possibility of the other Six Defects neither man nor woman can deny,
every one concluding a Material Idolatry.

That there are manifold confessed possible Defects; disabling the person of
the Priest to Consecrate, in respect of his undue Ordination; whereby is
occasioned a Material Idolatry. SECT. V.
YOu have furthermore See (as before) so also in the next Sect. at the letter
(a).
confessed, that, for want of due Ordination of the Priest, the Sacrament
remains in his Bread, and Wine; as if he be an Intruder, and not ordained at
all: or else of the form of Ordination, viz. [Accipe potestatem offerendi
Sacrificium: Et Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quorum peccataremiseris, remissa,
etc.] As if it has been corrupted, by missing so much as one Syllable, or
Letter, by Addition, Detraction, or any of the Six Errors before rehearsed; as
Accipe Spiritu Sancto, for Spiritum Sanctum; or, Accipe potestatem ferendi
Sacrificium, for Offerendi, or the like; * to the Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euchar.
cap. 16.. At -- Semper in Ecclesia pro indubitato habitum est, ita necessariam
esse ordinationem Sacerdotalem, ad Eucharistiam conficiendam, ut sine eo
confici nullo modo possit. Et lib. 1. de Sacrom. in Genesis cap. 21. Verba
Sacramentorum determinata sunt, ut non liceat quicquid immutare, etc.
Altering of the Sense of the Speech. *

That there are many hundred confessed Defects, which may nullify the
Consecration, to make the Romish Adoration Idolatrous, in respect of
Insufficiencies, which might be incident unto the Prae-ordainers of that
Priest, whosoever he be, that now Consecrateth; for causing a Material
Idolatry. SECT. VI.
IF the Si deficit ordo Sacerdotalis in consiciente, non conficitur
Sacramentum. Missal. Roman. page 31.
Bishop that ordained this Priest, which now consecrateth, were not a true
Priest himself, truly ordained, or duly baptized; or else the next Bishop
before him, or yet any one in the same line of Ordainers, until you come to
Saint Peter, for the space (now) of a thousand six hundred years, whereof your
Jesuit says; Multae sunt causae propter quas potest accidere, ut Christus non
sit praesens: ut si Sacerdos non sit Baptizatus, vel non fit rite ordinatus,
quod pendet ex multis aliis Causis, quibus fere in infinitum progredi possumus;
ut ex part materiae saepe accidit defectus. Suarez. Ies. in. Thom. quaest. 79.
Art. 8. Disp. 65.. 2.
The Defect of Ordination is seen in many Cases, wherein, Progredi possumus
fere in Infinitum (that is) we may proceed almost infinitely. So he. Thinking
belike that if we should in this number of years allow unto every Bishop
Bishop upward to Saint Peter, the number of them all would amount to fourscore
Bishops; among whom if any one were an Intruder, or Vnordained, then this
Priest fails in his Priesthood. Now of these kinds your Plena sunt illa

Historians afford us Examples of your Popes, some dissolving the Ordinations
of their Predecessors, even to the cutting off of one Platina in vita Steph. 6.
de Formoso; Abscissis duobus dextrae illius digitis, potissimum eis, quibus

One, who consecrated an huge number of Non diu est quod Episcopus, adhuc in

nostro Sum Controv. Tract. 3. qu. 25.
Priests, Whose Ordinations were all void, albeit they had exercised their
functions of Consecrating, in the Mass, for ten or twelve years space. *

Yet is not this all, for unto these are to be added the other Defects, to wit,
want of Baptism, whether for want of due Intention, being three; or undue
Pronunciation, being six; or the Errors either of Intention, or Pronunciation
in Ordination, all which make eighteen: and these being multiplied by
fourscore (which is the number of Bishop-ordainers from this Bishop to Saint
Peter) the total, we suppose, will at the least amount unto a Thousand
possible Defects, each one whereof, if it happen, does quite frustrate and
annull the Consecration of this Priest, whosoever he be, that now says Mass;
and leaves to the people nothing but the Substance of the Creatures of Bread
and Wine to be Adored, in stead of Christ Jesus, the Son of God. And yet in
this Sum are not reckoned the foresaid Defects concerning the Matter, or
Form of Consecration, or of the Priests Intention therein, or else of his
possible Intrusion into this Function of Consecrating of this one Priest, now
supposed to be ordained; every Defect being of force in it self to infer
necessarily a Material Idolatry in your Romish Mass.

Now rather than you shall call these our Instances odious, or malicious, you
must accuse your own Romish Church, because we have alleged no Testimony, but
out of your own publke Romish Missall, Cardinals, Jesuits, and other Authors
Divine Adoration, not to be trisled withal. Therefore now, if ever, show your
selves conscionable Divines, by freeing your Romish Mass from a Formal
Idolatry in these forenamed Respects, concerning your confessed Material
Idolatry; and do it by some grounds of Truth, or else abandon your Profession,
as most damnably Idolatrous.

CHAP. VI.
That the Romish Masse-worship is a Formal Idolatry, notwithstanding any
Pretense that by your Romish Doctors has been made to the Contrary.

Upon this occasion, oh! how your Summists, Theologues, and Casuists do
bestirre themselves, for the vindicating of your Church from the guilt of
Formal Idolatry? The Brief of your Defense is this: Bellar. Vbi deest vera
Consecratio, nullum est periculum in eo, qui bona side Sacrame^tum adorat,
adoratio enim potissimum ex intention pendet: quare sicut is, qui panem non
consecratum injuria assiceret, putans consecratum esse, gravissime peccasset in
Christum: sicetiam contra qui panem eundem adorat, quod certo credat non este
panem, sed Christu^, is proprie and formaliter Christum adorat, non panem. Lib.

Although (say they, in the Margin) there be no true Consecration, by reason of
diverse As for Example; He that gives an Alms to a Rich man, being probably
persuaded that he is not rich, the Act proceeds from a pious Intention. And,
As it was no Sin in Jacob to lie with Leah, because he thought her to be his
wife; so in this case it is no formal Idolatry to worship Bread, being Morally
persuaded that it is Christ. Thus they.

Your Pretenses herein are three; Moral Certainty, Good Intent, and (at least)
Habitual Condition. But alas! all this is but Sowing Fig Leaves together,
which will never be able to cover your foul shame of gross Idolatry. To begin
first with that which you call Moral Certainty.

That the Pretense of Moral Certainty of worshipping of Bread, instead of
Christ, cannot free the Romish Church from Formal Idolatry. SECT. II.
Our Confutation is grounded upon diverse impregnable Jealousy of God in his
worship; the second from the Faith required in a true worshipper; the third
from the nature of an Oath; and the last from the Uncertainty of that, which
you call Moral Certainty.

First then, although Moral and Conjecturall persuasions might excuse men's
Actions in diverse Cases, yet in an Object of Divine Worship it is utterly
condemnable, even because of the Jealousy of the Almighty, who expresses
himself to be a Jealous God, Exodus 20. signifying, as [Ego sum Deus tuus
fortis zelotes, Exodus 20. 5.] Dicitur Deus Zelotes, id est, zelum tenens: zelus
autem est amor privatus, nolens habere consortium in amato. Et sic viri
dicuntur habere zelum de uxoribus suis, quia volunt quod uxores suae solos
illos ament, and solis illis copulentur. Sic etiam Deus volebat quod Idaei eam
solum colerent, and eum ut Deum cognoscerent: and quando alius coleretur ut
Deus, dolebat, tanquam si vir videat uxorem suam amantem alium virum. Et sicut
cum mulier alteri quam viro suo copulatur, fornicari dicitur: ita qui alterum
quam verum Deum colebat, fornicari dicebatur in Scriptura cum Dijs alienis.
Abulens. in Exodus 20. page 273 col. 2.
you know, that He will not endure any consort in his worship; his Motto being
this, I am, and there is no Other. Even as in the Case of mortal Majesty, when
as a subject, building upon a Moral Certainty only, shall question the Title
and Right of his Sovereign established in his Throne, he becomes guilty of
High Treason.

Secondly, all Divine Worship must be performed with a Divine Faith, which is
an Infallible persuasion of the Godhead of that which we honor as God, as it
is written: He that comes to God, must believe that God is, Heb. 11. 6. and
again, You must ask in Faith, nothing doubting, Iac. 1. because this is the
nature of Faith, as the Apostle describes it; Faith is the Hypostasis of
things not seen. Heb. 11. That is, (to take your Graeci optime interpretantur
Hypostasin per substantiam, quia fides essicit ut ea, quae credit, non minus
certa habeamus, quam si subsisterent. Ribera Ies. Com. in Heb. 11. page 514.
own Faith ^aketh those things, which are believed, no less certain than if
they did subsist: whereby we are taught both the nature and necessity of
Faith in Divine Worship. But Moral and Conjecturall Certainty is not an
Hypostasis, which implies an Infallibility of Truth, but an Hypothesis, and
supposition of that which may be otherwise, and has in it nothing but
Uncertainty at all; of which more Chap. 9. Sect. 4.
hereafter.

Thirdly, God himself commands his People by his Prophet, saying, Thou shall
worship me, and (in Septuagiots.
Greek, (...)) shall swear by my Name. Swearing then is an Adoration, by God,
which he dare not swear is God: But your Romish Professors, in your Mass,
Invocate this Sacrament thus, Sacerdos inclinatus Sacramento, junctis manibus,
and ter pectus percutiens, dicit, Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere
nobis. Et rursus, Agnus Dei, etc. Missal. Romans page 24. Rursus. Inclinato
capite versus Sacramentum, dicit intelligibili voce, Da nobis pacem: Et rursus
secret, Domine Jesus Christ, etc. Missal. Romans ibid
O Lamb of God, which take away the Sins of the world, have mercy upon us.
And what Romish Professor is there who swears not By the Mass (meaning the
Consecrated Host) as by Christ himself? Notwithstanding, no one of your Romish
Priests (by reason of the manifold Defects incident thereunto, as you have
heard) durst ever swear that this, which is now Consecrated Altar, is not
substantially Bread, or that it is the Body of Christ. It must therefore
follow, that your Adoration having no better Certainty, than (as you have
confessed) to adore it with an [If it be Christ,] is a faithless profanation
of the name of the Son of God, and of his Worship. This Point, concerning Faith
in every Worshipper, will be confessed Thorow-out the 7. Chapter.
afterward.

In the last place (that we may ruinate the very foundation of your Excuse)
your Pretense of Moral Certainty comes to one giving an Alms to a poor man,
who peradventure has no need: and of Jacobs lying ignorantly with her that was
not his wife. These, say we, are Cases far different from this which we
have in hand, because Gods Almoner (you know) is not bound to enquire of a man,
whom he sees to appear to be miserable and poor, whether he be a
Counterfeit or no; for Charity is not suspicious, says the Apostle Saint Paul.
Jacob, indeed, was bound to know only his own wife, but if he had had any
probable or Moral Cause of doubt, would that holy Patriarch (think you) have
been so deluded, or overreached a second, and a third time, to defile his
body by an unchaste Bed? But the Causes of your Doubtings are see forth and
numbered by threes, Sixes, Twenties, Hundreds, until you come to a Thousand,
and (as your Jesuit has said) Almost infinite Defects. For indeed if there be
(as appears) a Thousand hazards in every Mass of any one Priest, then in two
Priests, as many more, and so forward; so that if one should hear in his time
the Masses of Ten, and Twenty Priests, what multitudes of Thousands of Defects
would the reckoning make? But we need say no more, than has already been
confessed of Almost infinite, and (consequently) as many Doubts of an
Idolatrous worship; wherein there cannot be so much Moral Certainty, as that,
in any one generation of men from Christ's time, each one of that offspring
has been chastely borne, whereunto what Christian is there that dare be sworn?

CHALLENGE.
COnsider (we beseech you, for Gods Cause, for we are now in the Cause of
God) whether our God, who will be known to be transcendently Jealous of his
own Honor, would ever ordain such a worship of a Sacrament, whereby men must
needs be still more obnoxious to that, which you call a Material Idolatry, by
many hundredfold, than possibly any can be to any material Parricide, or
material Murder, or material Adultery, or any other heinous and material
Transgression, that can be named under the Sun. Thus much of your first
Pretense, for this present, until we come to receive the Sea Chap. 7.
thorowout.
Confessions of

That the Second Romish Pretense, which is of a Good Intent, cannot free your
Adoration of the Host from Formal Idolatry. SECT. III.
LEt us hear your Cardinal; Bellar. Sicut is, qui panem non consecratum
injuria afficeret, etc. See above, Sect. 1. (a).
Honor (says he) depends upon the Intention, so that as he, who should
contemptuously abuse the unconsecrated Bread, thinking it to be Consecrated,
should grievously offend Christ; contrariwise he, who certainly believing the
Bread to be Christ's Body, shall Adore the same, does principally and formally
Adore Christ, and not the Bread. So he, even with the same Sophistry, from
only such a seeming Contrariety, wherewith you use to plead for Merits: (to
wit) if evil works deserve damnation, then good works deserve eternal life.
But will you be pleased to hear the same Cardinal speak in earnest, from the
Principles of true Logike? M^la intentio vittat opus: sed perpera^ inde
colligitur opera mala ex intention bona justificari. Nam opus bonum nascitur
ex integra causa, malum autem ex quovis defectu oriti potest. Bellar. de amiss.
Great. lib. 2. cap. 4.. P^^mum enim.
Although an evil Intention does (...) and corruptiun Act otherwise good, yet
it follows not that a good Intent should justisie an evil Act, because no
Act is good, except all the Causes thereof be good; but any Act is evil upon
any one Defect. So he; which his Conclusion is held as universally true in all
Schools, whether Christian, or Heathen, as any point of Morality can be.
Wherefore it follows not, that because a man does something Adoration of
Christ: as all Heathenish Idolatry, in worshipping stocks and stones, in an
opinion of adoring the true God, do witness to the world, as your own Chap.
7, and 8.
Confessions will confirm.

* It may not seem a thing superfluous to apply to our former Answer the
Testimony of your Jesuit Lessius, judging it Incredibile videtur, Deum tanti
aestimare amorem, quo eum amo, quanti peccatum, quo eum offendo: quis enim eum,
qui Principi facit injuriam, vel ejus legem violavit, ita ut mereatur mortem,
dicat satisfacere ex aequo, si illum amet, and doleat de suo facto, and
promittat emendationem? quis dicat ex natura rei tanti debere aestimare dolorem
illum ex amore profectu^, quanti injuriam, and legis violationem? nec jure
posse Principem injuriam retinere, and pro meritis punire? hoc ipso enim quod
quis meritus est amittere vicam and bona sua omnia, etiamsi millies amet,
millies doleat, and emendationem promittat, censebitur ullo modo aequivalens
offerre, quod mereatur condonationem; multo minus possit homo compensationem
Deo reddere. Lessius Ies. Opusc. lib. 13. de Justice. cap. 27.
A thing incredible, for God to equal man's love unto (says he) that a man
injuring his Prince, and violating his Laws so, as to deserve death, shall
equally satisfy it, after he shall be sorry for his offense, and love him,
and promise amendment? will any affirm, if the nature of the thing be duly
considered, that the Prince is bound to be as well pleased with the grief of
that man, for his offense, proceeding from love, as he was offended at the
injury, and that he ought not to punish him? nay, but the man has deserved
to lose both Land and Life, although he be a thousand times sorry for his
offense: much less possible is it for man to return an equal Compensation
unto God. So he, which shows sufficiently that there is a Disproportion of
Contraries, in their diverse respects. *

CHALLENGE.
DO you not perceive what a patched Cloak of Sophistry Good Intent, in your
Adoration, to cover the filthiness thereof, if it might be? and how by another
Position he rent the same in pieces, when he had done? Again, you stand thus
far, furthermore, condemnable in your selves in this Point, whilst as you
seek to free your Adoration from Idolatry, by Pretense of a Good Intent; and
notwithstanding hold a Good Intention not to be sufficient thereunto, except it
be qualified and formed with an Habitual Condition, which is your Third and
last Pretense; as fond and false as either of the former, whereof hereafter.

That the Third Romish Pretense of an Habitual Condition, in the Worshipper,
excuses him not from formal Idolatry; proved first by Scripture. SECT. IV.
Habitual Condition you have interpreted to stand thus; See above Sect. 1. at
the letter (a) ad finem.
If he that chances to worship only Bread be in that Act so disposed in
himself, that he would not worship the same Bread, as Christ, if he knew it
were but Bread, and not Christ; and by this you teach, that the Act (which you
call a Material Idolatry) is made not only excusable, but (your Ibid.
own words) honest and commendable also. So you. What execrable Doctrine is
this that we hear? which cannot be justifiable except you will justify the
Murderers of the members of Christ; and of Christ himself? First, of the
members of Saul, afterward Paul, breathing out threatenings, and slanders
against them, Act. 9. 1. and persecuting the Church, 1. Cor. 15. and Galath. 1.
and drawing both men and women to death, Act. 22. 4. And all this, not
maliciously, but (as you hear himself say) Ignorantly, 1. Tim. 1. 13. and
with a good Conscience, Act. 23. 1. and in zeal, Phil. 3. 6. A fairer
expression of a Good Intent, in a wicked practice, cannot be, than this was:
and as much may be said for his Habitual Condition, namely, that if he had
then (as afterward) known Christ to have been the Lord of life, and those
murdered Christians, to have been his mystical Members, he would rather
have exposed himself to Martyrdom, than to have martyred those Saints of God.
This Consequence directly appears, first by his Answer, in his miraculous
Conversion, saying, Acts 9. 5.
Who are thou, Lord? next by his detestation of his Fact, 1. Cor. 15 9.
I am unworthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church, etc.
then by his Acknowledgement of Gods especial mercy, 2. Tim. 1. 13.
But God had mercy on me. Afterward by his Labor for winning souls to the
Faith: I have labored more abundantly than they all. And lastly, in that he
was one of those Actors, of whom Christ himself foretold, saying, Ioh. 16. 2.
They shall draw you before Judgment seats, and when they shall persecute you,
they will think that they do God good service. Which also plainly argues,
that their and his persuasion of so doing proceeded from a Moral Certainty,
Good Intent, and Habitual Condition.

From these Members let us ascend to our Head, Christ the Lord of Glory; what
think you of the Jews? of whom Saint Peter said, You have murdered the
Prince of life. Act. 3. 15. But did they this Voluntarily, and knowingly, as
understanding him to have been the Redeemer of the world, and indeed the
Prince of life? they did not, for the same Apostle testifyeth in their behalf,
saying, I know you did it ignorantly, as did also your Rulers. Act. 3. 17. If
this be not sufficient, hear the voice of the person that was slain, Christ
himself, who did so far acquit them, saying, They know not what they do.
Luke 23. 24. Ignorantly then, in a Conjecturall Certainty, but yet with Good
Intent; of whom Saint Paul witnesses in these words, I bear them witness,
that they have the Zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. Romans 10. But
what for Habitual Condition? were they not bent in their own minds (if they
had understood what Christ was) to have abhorred that so heinous a guilt of the
death of the Son of God? questionless, for so says the Apostle: If they had
known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. 1. Cor. 2. 8. We
conclude, seeing these Jews, notwithstanding their Moral Certainty, (being
seduced by their Priests) or else their Good Intent of doing God good service
therein; or yet their Habitual Condition, not to have crucified Christ, if
they had truly known him, were nevertheless by Saint Peter condemned, yea and
of themselves, as Formal and verily Murderers of Christ; then (o you Romish
worshippers of the Host) must it necessarily follow, that in your Masses you
are equally all Formally Idolaters, notwithstanding any of the same three
Pretenses to the contrary.

Wherefore, as Solomon speaks of an Adulterous woman; Prove. 30. 20.
She eats, and wipeth her mouth, saying, I have done no wickedness; so may
we say of Idolatrous Worshippers, and their mouth-wipes? or as Anodyna, and
stupifying Medicines, which take away the Sense of the diseased person, but do
not cure the disease? So do you delude miserable people with false Pretenses,
lest they, discerning the grosnesse and ouglinesse of your Idolatry, might
abhor that worship, and abandon your Romish worshippers.

That the former Romish Pretenses have no warrant
THe number of Ancient Fathers, whose works are yet extant (who lived within
Six or Seven hundred years after Christ) are recorded to have been about 200.
out of whose monuments of Christian learning your chiefest Disputers could
never hitherto produce anyone that justified your Romish worship, by so much as
in distinguishing of Material and Formal Idolatry; nor yet by qualifying any
Idolatry under pretense of either Moral Certainty, or Good Intent, or yet
Habitual Condition; and therefore must we judge that they never gave Assent
to this your Sorcery. For we may not be so injurious to the memory of so many,
so famously learned, and Catholic Doctors of the Church of Christ, that they
could not; or of persons so holy, and zealous of Gods honor, and of men's
Salvation, that they would not satisfy men's Consciences, to free them out of
thus many and miserable perplexities, wherewith your now Adoration of the Host
is so Confessed above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. by your Jesuit Suarez.
Almost infinitely entangled.

CHAP. VII.
That the Romish Adoration, notwithstanding your former Pretenses, is Formally
Idolatrous; proved by four
The first is your Definition of Idolatry. SECT. I.
DIvine honor (says your Jesuit Honor est testimonium excellentiae, quod
continetur verbo vel facto, quae de excellentia alicujus convenientem
existimationem illi gignit. Sic honor divinus est quicquid verborum aut
officiorum omnino acco^modatum est ad gignendam existimationem hujusmodi, quae
in divinam majestatem proprie conveniat. Hoc duplici modo, I. ut opus sit

excitare, quae in divinam majestatem conveniat, licet honor iste alioqui
indifferens sit. Gregor. Valent. lib. 2. de Idol. cap. 3.
Valentia) is a Testimony of excellency, whether in word or outward office,
that a man does perform, whereby he does So that Idolatry is an Error in the
understanding (says your Jesuit Est Idololatria divini cultus erga falsum
Deum exhibitio: colere enim pro Deo eum, qui non est Deus, aut ipsum laudando,
aut ei aliquo modo prosternendo, Idololattare est. -- Idololatria (quae est
falsa Adoratio) non est nisi error in intellectu, quo dignum honor judicamus
Deum falsum, cui Idololatra se prosternit. Tolet. Ies. Instit. Sacerd. lib. 4.
cap. 24.. Est igitur.
Tolet) in yielding divine worship to that which is not God, whether by
praising, invocating, sacrificing, or prostrating our selves to that which is
not God. In a word, Idolatry comprehends all religious superstition (says
your Jesuit Idololatria comprehendit omnem superstiosam religionem, qua
quaelibet res colitur pro Deo. Lorinus Ies. in Acts 17. 16.
Lornus) in worshipping of any thing as God, which is not God. So they, most
Theologically and truly.

CHALLENGE.
NOw apply you these points of your Definition unto your Host, in the hand of
the Priest, which by your own Confessions may possibly be, and by our proofs
cannot possibly but be (after Consecration) Bread still, whereunto
notwithstanding he prostrateth himself, swears, by, and invocateth upon, as
being in it self the person of Christ; the Priest himself saying, Nos

invocamus, and quasi divinum quoddam adoramus, and quasi vivum quiddam

of formal Idolatry, by pretense of Ignorance, and error of true knowledge of
the thing falsely adored, seeing that Idolatry (as you your selves have also
defined) is an Error and Ignorance in the judgment of the Worshipper? This

fall into Idolatry. And the person communicating Orally (as you say) the Body

CHALLENGE.
We suppose that there is not any of your own Romish Sect, albeit most
superstitious, who would worship Divine Worship either the Signs, or the
Appearance of flesh, or the Priest, whiles the Sacrament is in his mouth,
without at least a Moral Persuasion, viz. that he may so do; nor without a
Good intent, viz. that it is well done; nor without habitual Condition, viz.
not to do so, if he knew they were but Signs, Appearance of flesh, or he
merely a Priest. If therefore there be any Idolatry, in adoring any of these
things with Christ, then certainly much rather (which is your Case) is it
Idolatry to worship with Divine honor, Bread, it being without Christ.

Marginals) you shall find that the Common opinion of your Church directs you
to think, that your Church cannot err in this Function, and that all
Christians are bound to believe the same; but how? upon a Moral and
Conjecturall persuasion only? No, upon a Divine and infallible Certitude, and
why? Because (say they) if one Saint may be doubted of, then might also the
Canonization of others be called into Question, so that it would be dangerous
to worship any Saint, lest that we should worship a dead and a rotten, instead
of a lively member of Christ: which were an Error pernicious, seeing that every
lie, figment, and falsehood in religious worship must needs be abominable unto
God. So your Archbishop, with others. You will ask, what, makes all this to
the question in hand? give* us leave to tell you.


THe same Archbishop Catharinus Catharin ibid. quo supr^ Ob. Doctrina haec
suadetur exemplis hostiae non consecratae, quam Sacerdos exhibet adorandam, ubi
^ulla Idololatria, quia sides Ecclesiae non ad has aut illas specie^ panis

fuerit rite benedictum. Putas tu quod minus potest errare Ecclesia in
adoratione hostiae no^ consecratae, quam in cultu Sancti? p. 132. 133. Resp
Catharin. Petrus de Palude asserit, nullo modo esse dandam Hostiam simplicem
pro consecrata, quod esset Idololatria: quoniam cum ministratur, etiam adoranda
proponitur. Et Hier. Ferrar. cui quidam objectabat, quod Hostia, per quam
jurabat, non erat consecrata; Cui respondet, si ita suisset, fecisset populum
Idololatrare, atque ideo tanto magis provocaret in seiram Dei -- Audi, in
hostia consecrata a^oratur Christus ut Deus, non simpliciter, sed ut existens
sub his speciebus. Cum igitur ibi non existat Christus, sed creatura pro
Christo invenitur, cui exhibetur Latria, atque ideo Idololatria est.
Idololatrae enim etiam hac errant ratione, qui coelum (puta) aut aliquid aliud
adorabunt, putantes se ibi adorare Deum, quem animam Mundi dicebant, juxta
Varronis Theologiam. Non igitur excusantur ab Idololatria, quod arbitrarentur
se unum Deum colere, sicut vere erat unus Deus: sed quod illum ibi adorabant,
ubi non erat eo modo, quo esse existimabant. Ibid. page 134. 135.
deduceth a necessity of an infallible assurance of the Canonization of every
Saint, from the Infallibility which ought to be had, concerning the
Consecration of the Eucharist, Thus; If the Worshipper may be deceived in
adoring the Host, by mistaking Bread for the Body of Christ, then should it be
Idolatry (says he) as well as in the Heathen, who adored Heaven instead of
God. So he. Do you mark? as well Idolatry, as that of the Heathen; whom
neither Moral Certainty, nor Good Intent, or Habitual Condition could ever
free from a formal Idolatry. Our Argument, from your own Confessions, will be
this.

Whosoever may be mistaken, in adoring Bread instead of Christ's Body, may
therein be held as Formal an Idolater as any Heathen. (This is your Bishops
Proposition.) The Assumption. But any man among you may manifoldly be deceived,
in taking Bread for Christ's Body. (Which has been your general Confession.)
Our Conclusion must be; Therefore any of you, in adoring Bread for Christ, in
this Sacrament, may be a Formal Idolater.

IV. That the Romish Worship is proved to be a Formal Idolatry, by the
Consequence used from the Consecration of your Popes. SECT. IV.

prove that all men are bound to believe the new Pope, whenever he is
Consecrated, to be the true Pope, Moral or Humane Assurance, but with a Divine
and infallible Faith; as were the Jews bound to believe Christ Jesus, at his
coming, to be the true Messiah: that is (says he) with a Faith that cannot
possibly be deceived. We have nothing to do with your Jesuits Position in this
place, concerning the Infallibillity of Belief of the Creation, and Election
of your Popes, which we have elsewhere proved to be a See the Grand Romish
Imposture, etc.
Gross Imposture. But we are to argue from his Supposition, as for Example.

CHALLENGE.

grounded his Assertion of an Infallible faith due to be had, touching the
Creation of your Popes, upon a Supposition; and his Conclusion upon the like
infallible Belief, which men ought to have, concerning the Consecration of the
Eucharist, wherein (says he) if there should be any Uncertainty, so that our
Faith should depend upon the Intention of the Priest, in like manner might every
one doubt, whether he may adore the Sacrament, as being not truly consecrated;
as also make doubt of the Priest himself, as being not rightly ordained. So
he; who therefore in all these requires a Faith infallible. All these
forecited Confessions of your own Divines, as first concerning your
Definition of Idolatry; next in the point of Co-adoration of the Creature
together with the Creator; thirdly, in your Belief of the Canonization of
Saints; and lastly, in the Creation of the Pope, which are but humane
Institutions, do enforce much more a necessity of Infallibility, in every
Adoration instituted by God.

Now among all the Schisms of Anti-Popes, sometimes of Vrbane) to be the true
Pope, and yield to him all Fealty and Obedience, for I do this to a Good
Intent, in a Moral Certainty, that he is truly elected Pope; and in an
habitual Condition, not to acknowledge him, if I knew him not to be Pope,
wherein if I err, it is but a Material Disloyalty; would not the Pope,
notwithstanding all these Pretenses, judge this man to be Formally an
Anti-Papist, and pierce him with his Thunderbolt of Anathema, as Popes have
often dealt with Cardinals, Princes, and Emperors in like Case? yet what is
this Glowormes slimy shine to the glory of Divine Majesty?


YOur Jesuit, in his Book of Spectacles, made in Confutation of a Judicious
and Religious Knight, among many other of his Paradoxes and Absur^ities (as if
concerning our present Question he had meant to excel himself, in the same
kind) after his most diligent search into every Corner, Spectacles of his own
making, yet could spy no other, than that poor little Crevise, specifyed in
his words following: If Christ (says he) be not there, (in the Sacrament
after Consecration) we are in danger to worship him, where he is not; and if
he be there, then are you in danger, in not worshipping him, where he is. How
then are you Protestants more safe than we? So your Jesuit. But most
Sophistically. In Answer whereunto, the Protestants can say no less, than that
this Objection is Fallacious, Impious, and Impudent. The notable Sophistry
whereof appears in this; because of an Extreme Disparity Worshipping by a
Conjecturall Supposition, as, [I adore thee o Christ, if thou be here,] and the
Protestants Resolution of [not adoring with Divine honour] at all, that, which
you your selves do not infallibly believe to be God. For that there ought to be
no performance of Divine worship, where there can be any danger of Idolatry, as
is both proved by your own Confessions, and illustrated by your own
Similitudes.

Your Confessions stand thus. I. Although there should be a possibility of
Existence of the Body of Christ with the Bread; See above, Chapter 7. Sect. 2.
yet not to adore it, for fear of Idolatry. Item, Although Christ be in the
mouth of the Communicant, See in the same place.
yet not to adore it there, for fear of Idolatry. Item, Although it be
possible Christ is there at all, See ibid. Sect. 3. and 4. in the Challenge.
yet not to adore absolutely, because of the Possibility, that one may be
deceived. Next, do but also Recognize your own Similitude of See above, Chap.
6 ^.
Jacob lying with Leah, instead of Rachel: and, that you may make a more joint
Application, suppose that both these Sisters had been presented before Jacob,
masked and unknown; would your Jesuit judge it to be a like security and
safety in Jacob, to have taken either of them to his bed, because it was
posible he might have made choice of his own wife, as it had been to have
abstained from admitting of either at that time, lest he might have made
choice of not his own wife?

We have furthermore in the title of this Section called this an Impious
Answer and Evasion; which we are to prove from the Resolution, which Christ
gave in his Answer Samaria, when she boasted of the worship of the Samaritanes,
and preferred it before the Religion of the Jews, a Religion which was then
approved and professed by Christ himself: You Samaritanes (says Christ)
worship you know not what; But we (Jews) know what we worship, Ioh. 4. 22.
where, our Lord, who is Truth and Life, determines the Cause it self, namely,
that if the Case so stand, in point of Gods worship, The worshipping of not
knowing what, is damnable; and only, the worshipping of knowing what, is
justifiable. And this was always Catholic Samaritan kind of [Worshipping you
know not what.] Wherein your worshippers fail most blindly both for matter,
for manner, and for sense; as may be proved by the Ignorance of your
worshippers; both concerning the Objects, Language, and Ceremonies of their
worship.

Nor could this objection be made by this Jesuit, without some tincture of
Impudency, forasmuch as he, by a seeming Case of Indifferency, seeks to
excuse his Romish Sect from [Danger of not adoring Christ where he is,] when
as notwithstanding, he, with all his Accomplices, would condemn Protestants for
arrant Heretics and Contemners of Christ in [not adoring him (according to the
Romish Religion) where (peradventure) he is.] And this they do against all
warrant of Antiquity; or else show us, if you can, when ever any, that had the
Title of a Father in the Church of Christ, allowed of any thing to be adored,
with Divine Worship, without an Infallible persuasion of the Deity thereof. Not
to repeat the above specified Confessions of your

CHAP. VIII.
Of the Romish manner of Adoration, in Comparison with the Heathen.
That the Romish Adoration, by your former Pretenses, justifies the vilest
kind of Idolatry among
THere is a double kind of Worship, the one is Direct, and terminate, which
pitcheth immediately upon the Creature, without Relation to the Creator, whereof
your Cardinal Alan has resolved, saying; Dicimus ad plenam resolutionem, cum
cultus terminatur ad ipsas creaturas, Idololatriam esse injustam. Alan. de
Sacram. in Genesis cap. 23.
The terminating and fixing of Divine Honor upon any Creature, is a notorious
Idolatry. The second kind is Relative Honor, having Relation to Christ;
whereof your Cardinal Bellarmine has Latria est cultus Deo proprius, nec per
se deferendus imagini, ratione Relationis. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. ca. 24..
Tertio. -- Hic cultus, si exhibetur imagini propter se, est vera Idololatria.
Ib.. Dicet. -- Si idem cultus exhibetur imagini propter aliud, ut aeque colatur
creatura atque Deus, certe est Idololatria: nam Idololatria est non solum cum
adoratur Idolu^, relicto Deo, sed etiam cum adoratur simul cum Deo. Ibid.
Praeterea. -- Imagini non convenit cultus internus verus Latriae, nec externus
proprius, qualis est Sacrificium. Ibid.. Quarta. -- Qui colebant Imaginem
Christi divinis honoribus, inter Haereticos numerantur ab Epiphanio, Augustino,
and Damasceno. Atque isti cum Christum colerent, sine dubio imaginem ejus
propter ipsum colebant: non igitur Imagines licet divinis honoribus colere,
i.e. cultu latriae, etiamsi quis dicat, id esse facere propter Deum, vel
Christum, non propter imagines. Ibid.. Sexta ratio. Haec Bellarminus.
When [Latria] or divine worship is given to an Image, because of the Relation
it has to Christ, this is Idolatry, although it be given for Christ, or God,
whether it be internal, or else external, as Sacrifice. So he. This we say,
first to put you in mind of Sunt been multi, qui imagines colunt, non ut signa,
-- sed magis eis sidunt quam Christo. Polydor. Virgil. Invent lib. 6 cap. 13.
Very many of your Romish People, who adore Images Idolatrously; which although
you would cloak, yet the Complaints and outcries of your own Romish

Authors will not suffer it to be concealed, One of them saying, that this your
worship is more manifest than can be denied; even immediately and terminately
given by your people to the thing Heathenish, in an high Degree. And also note
infinite numbers of your Worshippers, who adore Idolatrously, in the same manner
of Relation, that which is here condemned by your Cardinal.

But to the point, your own Jesuits Fuerunt ex Ethnicis, qui simulachra
adorabant, quia ea animata esse credebant divinis spiritibus. Greg. Valent.

report that some Heathen Idolaters did worship Idols, believing that They were
inspired with a Divine Spirit; next that they had sour kind of persuasions
for this their Belief, to wit, the Instructions of their Paganish Priests, the
Example of the whole world in their times, the power of Devils, speaking in the
Images; and lastly, an humane shape, which was presented unto them:
nevertheless so, that they sometimes honored not the things themselves, but
the Spirit which they thought them possessed withal. Will you permit us to
compare this with that which you have called but your See above.
Material Idolatry? To this end, we are to try whether Romish, which might
not as truly excuse and warrant that Heathenish Worship; which notwithstanding
no Christian will deny to have been most Formally, and properly Idolatrous.

Your Moral, and Conjecturall Certainty would be compared in the first place.
This the Heathens might pretend by the Reasons, by you already confessed, to
wit, the Prescriptions of their Priests, their Idols speaking, and the Example
of almost the whole vast world adoring them. Secondly, you please your selves
with your Good Intent, that, in worshipping the Bread, adore Christ; and the
Pagans (which also the whole world of Idolaters professed of themselves, and
you your selves have confessed of them) in their most Formal Idolatry, were
persuaded they worshipped a True God. Thirdly, you rely upon an Habitual
Condition, namely, that although the thing which you adore, be Bread, yet your
inward Resolution is not to give Divine Honor unto it, if you knew it were but
Bread, and not Christ. But inquire you now into your own Bibles, and you shall
find that the Heathen were not inferior unto you in this Modification also;
for in the History of Bell and the Dragon it is read, that the King of Babel,
and other Babylonians worshipped Bell with Divine honor, thinking it to live,
until such time as Daniel had discovered it to be but an Idol: and no sooner
had the King perceived the Delusion, but presently he commanded it should be
demolished. The Case then is plain. He, and they, who abhorred, and uterly
destroyed that Idol, as soon as they knew it not to be God, were therefore,
before that, habitually in their hearts resolved not to honor it, if they
could have been persuaded it had not been a God. In such just Equipage do
these your Romish, and those See above, Chapter 7 Sect 2. at (a).
If in the worship of this Sacrament (says he) we may be deceived, in
mistaking Bread, instead of Christ; then is this worship as merely Idolatrous,
as was that of the Heathen. So he. Which shows your Cause and theirs, in
these Respects, to be all one. We proceed a step further.

That the Romish Worship of that, which may possibly be Bread, may seem to be
in one respect worse than almost the worst of the Pagans. SECT. II.
ALthough the very Title of this Section may seem unto you fully odious, yet
let Truth (in what apparel soever it Costerus is a Jesuit much privileged by
your Church, who doubted not to affirm, that Talis error est, quo in orb
terrarum nunquam vel visus, vel auditus fuit -- tolerabilior enim est error
eorum, qui pro Deo colunt statuam auream, aut alterius materiae imaginem,
quomodo Gentiles suos Deos venerabantur, vel pannum rubrum in hastam elevatum,
quod narratur de Lappis, vel viva animalia, ut quondam Aegyptij; quam eorum qui
frustum panis. Coster. Ies. Enchirid* de Sacram. Eucharist. cap. 8.. Decimo.
If Christ be not in this Sacrament, but Bread only, the Error (says he) is
more intolerable than was the Error of the Heathen, in worshipping either a
golden Statue, or a Red Clout. So he. What reason he had to speak so broad
Language, we refer to your Inquisitors, to question him for it. But what
Cause we have for the confirming our Title of this Section, we shall not
forbear to impart unto you. It is the profession of your Church to Adore that
which may be Bread in the Eucharist with Divine Worship, notwithstanding
whatsoever Uncertainty of the presence of Christ therein, by reason of (as your
Jesuit Suarez See above. Chap. ^. Sect. 6.
speaks) almost infinite Defects, which may possibly happen to cause the same.
Contrariwise the Heathen Idolaters, touching the things which they worshipped,
See in the former Section at (d).
Credebant (said your Jesuit) They believed them certainly to have been Gods.
For although some Heathen would sometime make some doubt of a [(...)] or,
[(...)] what, or who the God was, whom they did adore, as they that said, Sive
tu Deus es, sive tu Dea es; Whether thou be God or Goddess; And the Athenians
had an Act. 27. 23.
Altar (...), To an unknown God, yet hardly shall you ever find Whether it
were a God, which they worshipped as God; those of Calecute, and such like
Devilish Nations excepted, who are said knowingly to have Adored Devils, but
(as some people sometime do homage to Tyrannous Usurpers, knowing them not to
be their lawful Sovereigns) only Ne noceant, for fear of hurt.

So abominable is your Masse-worship, being both contrary to express
Scripture, which exacteth of every man Heb. 11. ^.
That comes to God, that he must believe, what? [(...)] If he be? no, but
[(...)] That he is God; and also against the light of Pagans. For although you
do but seem to symbolize with them in that one part of Idolatry, thus
described by the Prophet; Esaias 44. 15 etc
He takes wood, burns it, makes Bread, and of a part thereof makes a God,
and falling down before it, prays, Deliver me, for thou art my God: (Like
as is the taking a lump of Dough, baking it, and with part of it to feed our
Bodies, of another part to make a God, worship it, and invocate upon it,
according to your own vulgar Rimes: Non est Panis, sed est Deus, Homo
liberator meus: fit cibus ex pane, caro Deus ex elemento: Qui me creavit sine
me, creatur mediante me;) yet notwithstanding do you far excede them, by
adoring only in an Habitual Condition, If the thing be God, which you
worship; Therefore shall they be your Judges.

CHAP. IX.
Our Examination of the Reverence professed by Protestants, and the Security
of their Profession therein; First, defining and distinguishing the Properties
of Reverence. SECT. I.
REverence is a due Respect had unto things or persons, according to the good
qualities that are in them. This is either inward, or outward. The inward is
that our Estimation of them, according to their Conditions and Properties: the
outward is our open Expression of our said Estimation, whether by words or
Acts. First of the inward Estimation, whether Natural, Politic, Religious,
or Divine. Children (for Example honor their Parents, Wives their Husbands,
Husbands their Wives, Subjects their Sovereigns, People their Pastors; And
all, above all, to honor God. Our outward Manifestation of these, be it either
in word, or deed, or Gesture, is to be discerned and distinguished by the
Inward, as the honor to Parents to be called Natural; of Subjects to
Governors, Politic; of People to their Pastors, Religious; of All to God,
Divine, which is transcendently Religious, and Spiritual. And the Outward is
common to each Degree; three only outward Acts excepted, Sacrificing, Vowing
unto, and Swearing by: Homages appropriated to the Majesty of God; Sacrifice
to betoken his Sovereignty; Vowing to testify his Providence; and Swearing for
the acknowledging of his Wisdom in discerning, Justice in condemning, and
Omnipotency in revenging all Perjury, be it never so secret.

That the Reverence used by Protestants, in receiving this Sacrament, is
Christianly Religious. SECT. II.
THeir Inward, is their religious Estimation of this Sacrament, Symbols and
Signs of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, a Memorial of his death,
which is the price of man's Redemption, and to the Faithful a Token of their
spiritual Union with all the Members of Christ; and by the incorporation of
them, in their flesh, a Pledge of their Resurrection unto life.

Secondly, their outward Application, for testifying their inward estimation,
consists not essentially in any one peculiar Gesture in it self, as you will
Conc. Carth. 6. Can. 20. Quoniam sunt quidam, qui die Dominico slectunt genua
in diebus Pentecostes: placuit sanctae and magnae Synodo cunctos -- stantes
Deum orare debere. Durant. de Ritib. lib. 3. cap. 2. number. 21. Hoc ipsum diebus
quinquaginta a Pascha usque ad Pentecosten observari consuetum veteres Patres
testantur. Ratio ex Ambrosio Sermon. 21. de Pentecoste, quia Resurrectionem
Domini celebremus: and ut Hieron. Proem. in Epist. ad Ephesians. Non ^lectimus
genua, non cu^vamur in terra, sed cum Domino surgentes ad alta sustollimus.
confess from Antiquity, whether it be in Standing, Bowing, Kneeling, or the
like; even because Uncovering, Bowing, and Kneeling, are outward behaviors
communicable to other persons besides God, according to their Natural, Moral,
Politic, and Religious respects. Howbeit, any of these outward Gestures, which
carry in them a greater respect of Reverence, may be enjoined by the Church
(whereunto obedience is due) according to the just occasions inducing
thereunto. And where there is no such necessary occasion, there the public
observation of the Rites of Communicating, commanded by Christ in his first
Institution, performed (namely) by Supplications, and Praises, is a plain
Reverence; and more especially that Invitation, used in most Churches
Christian, of the Priest to the People, Lift up your hearts; and their
answerable Conclamation, We lift them up unto the Lord.

It will be objected by Some, who pretend to have some Patronage from Calvin,
that Kneeling at the receiving of the Communion is Unlawful. Every such One is
to be entreated to be better acquainted with Calvin, where, speaking of the
Reverence of kneeling, he says, Calvin. Institut. lib. 4.. 37. Iam vero
longius prolapsi sunt (viz. Papistae) ritus enim excogitarunt prorsus
extran^os, in hoc, ut signum divinis honoribus afficiant. At Christo (inquiunt)
hanc venerationem deferimus. Primum si in coena hoc fieret, dicerem eam esse
adorationem legitimam, quae non in signo residet, sed ad Christu^ in coelo
sedentem dirigitur.
It is lawful, if it be directed not to the Sign, but to Christ himself in
Heaven; which is the resolute English Church, in the use of this Gesture. * And
the use of Bowing toward the Lords Table has in it no other nature or meaning
than Daniel his Kneeling with his face toward Jerusalem and the Temple. For as
this was a Testification of his joynt-Society, in that religious worship, which
had been exercised in the Temple and Altar thereof at Jerusalem: so ours is a
Symbol of our union in profession with them, who do faithfully Communicate at
the Table of the Lord. * But to return unto you, who think it no Reverence,
which is not given by Divine Adoration of this Sacrament, we ask, Do not you
use the Sacrament of Baptism Reverently? you do, yet do you not adore the
water with that [(...)] which you yield unto the Eucharist. All this
notwithstanding, Calvin his estimation of this Sacrament seems but profane
to many of you: but the Reason is, you would rather condemn him, than judge
him, lest that his Doctrine, if it come to examination, might condemn you. For
albeit he abhor your Divine Adoration of the Host, yet does he also Calvin.

condemn every Profane man, who shall partake thereof in the state of
Impenitencie, To be guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ. Your next Question
will be, after this our Discovery of the manifold Perplexities, wherein you, by
your Romish Doctrine, are so miserably plunged, how Protestants can avoid, in
many of them, the like Intanglements.

That Protestants, in their Profession and Practice, stand secure from the
first two Romish Perplexities, in respect of Preparation of the Elements, and
undue Pronunciation of the words of Consecration.
Our Church commands that the best Bread and Wine be provided for this best
of Banquets, the Supper of our Lord; yet does it believe, that Christ the
Ordainer thereof will not deprive the souls of his guests of their desired
spiritual Blessings, for the negligence of his steward, in being defective to
Bread and Wine. As for Pronunciation, you know, Protestants make their
Celebration in a tongue known unto all the people communicating, and in a loud
voice, according to the universal Practice of the Church of Christ in
primitive times, as See above, Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. 7.
has been confessed. So that the Peoples ears may be their own witnesses,
whether the words of Consecration, either by Prayer, or together with the form
of Repetition of the words of Institution, be truly delivered: which freeth
them from your Romish Consecrated, by his muttering of the words in an
unaudible voice.

The Protestants Security, in respect of the third Romish Perplexity, of
Adoring in a Moral Certainty. SECT. IV.
Our Profession is to adore Christ with an infallible faith, and not with a
conjecturall Credulity, or Probability, as we are taught by the holy
Scripture, the Canonical foundation Faith to be an Heb. 11. 1.
Evidence of things not seen; namely, a more infallible apprehension of the
mind, than any perception of sight can be; a faith required of every one,
which shall approach in supplication to God: Heb. 11. 6.

this) that this Perplexity, and doubt, whether the Priest has a Due intention
in consecrating, works to the tormenting of men's Consciences, injury to Gods
exceeding bounty and goodness, contrary to the Judgment of Antiquity, and in
special, against that of Saint Augustine; Saepe mihi ignota est Conscientia

saying of the Apostle, Phil. 1. 18.
If the word be preached, whether of envy, and vain glory, or of good will, I
rejoice, and will rejoice; which proves that the evil Intention of the
Messenger cannot impeach the Benefit of the message of Salvation, and embassage
of God. Now there is the like Reason of the word visible (which is the
Sacrament) as there is of the Audible. Take unto you a Similitude, in the
marginall Testimony of your Jesuit Salmeron, of a Notary public making a
true Instrument, according to the Intention of the Scribe, but by the will of
the Ordainer, and willingness and consent of the Receiver.

Our fifth Security from your Romish Perplexity, touching Ordination. SECT.
VI.
TO pass over matters not controverted between us, whether Intruder, and no
consecrated Minister, whether this his Defect do so nullify his Consecration
of the Eucharist, that it becomes altogether unprofitable to the devout
Communicant. Your Church in this case sends you to inquire after the
Godfathers, Godmothers, Priest, or Midwife that baptizeth, to know whether he
have been rightly baptized; and this not satisfying, she will have you seek
forth the Bishop, by whom he was ordained, and so to the Odainer of that
Bishop, and so to speere further, and further, until you come to Saint Peter,
to see whether each of these were rightly consecrated a Priest, and then to
search into so many Church-bookes, to know the Baptism of each one, without
which the Act of this Priest now consecrating is frustrate, Ad modum
Recipientis: as you have heard in the Example of preaching the word of God,
were it by Judas, or if you will a transformed Devil, yet the seed being Gods,
it may be fruitful, (whatsoever the Seed-man be) if the ground that receives
it be capable. Therefore here might we take occasion to compare the Ordination
Romish and English; and to

Our last Security from the Romish Perplexity of Habitual Condition. SECT.
VII.
Habitual or virtuall Condition (as it is conceived by your Professors)
stands thus; I adore this which is in the hands of the Priest, as Christ, if
it be Christ; being otherwise not ^illing so to do, if it be not Christ. What
my Masters, Iffs, and Ands in divine worship? These can be no better in your
Church than leakes in a ship, threatening a certain perishing, if they be not
stopped; which hitherto none of your best Artificers were ever able to do.

For as touching your profane Lecturer Suarez. Ies. Simpliciter adorandus est
Christus in Eucharistia, and aliud exigere ex iis esset superstitiosum, and
vanis scrupulis, and superstitionibus expositu^: neque enim est consentaneum
ibi trepidare, ubi non est vel probabilis ratio timendi, sed potius periculum
ne dubitatione devotio animi minuatur. Tom. 3. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65. Sect.
2.
Suarez, laboring to persuade you to Adore Christ in the Eucharist simply,
without all scrupulizing, saying, It is not fit to fear where no fear is;
When as he himself (as you have heard) has told us that there are possibly
incident See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. at (a).
Almost Infinite Defects, and consequently as many Causes of doubting, which
may disannull the *whole Act of Consecration: * Every Moral Certainty (as
your other Lessius Ies. Opusc. Tract. de Praescien condit. cap. 21.. Sed
contra. -- Moralis certitudo non est absoluta, sed secundum quid, qualis nimium
per conjecturas possit haberi ex signis, cum quibus non necessario conjungitur
veritas rei signatae.
Jesuit, and you all confess) being but conjecturall. * Therefore there
needs none other Confutation, than this, of his own shameless
Contradiction, which (as you may see) is palpably gross. So impossible it is
for any of you to allay the detestable stench of plain Idolatry. Certainly,
if S. Augustine had heard that a Worship of Latria (which he everywhere
teaches to be proper to God) were performed to Bread and Wine, as the matter
of Divine Adoration, he neither would, nor could have said, in defense
thereof, as he did of the Celebration of the Eucharist in his own time, viz.
Aug. contr. Faust. Manich. lib. 20 cap. 21. Nos a Cerere and Libero Paganorum
Diis long absumus.
We are far from your Paganish worshipping of Ceres and Bacchus.

But as for us Protestants, we profess no Divine worship of God, but with a
Divine, that is, an Infallible Faith, that * it is God, whom we worship; who
will not be worshipped, but in spirit and truth. What furthermore we have to
say against your Romish Mass, will be discovered in the Book following.




CHAP. I.
Of the peremptory Superstitiousnesse of the Romish
MAny words shall not need for this first point. Superstition is described by
the Apostle in this one word, Coloss. 2.
(...), that is, Man's will worship; as it is opposite to the worship revealed
by the will of God. What the will of Christ is, concerning the Celebration
Sacrament of his Body, and Blood, we have learned by his last Will and
Testament, expressly charging his Church, and saying, [Do THIS:] pointing out
thereby such proper Acts, which concerned either the Administering, or the
Participating of the same holy Sacrament. But now comes in Man's will worship,
ordained in the Church of Rome; as flatly contradictory to the same Command of
Christ, by Ten notorious Transgressions, as if it had been in direct Terms
countermanded thus, [Do not This,] (as has been Book 1. thorowout.
proved:) notwithstanding the former direct Injunction of Christ, or
conformable Observation of the holy Apostles, or Consent, and Custom of the
Church Catholic; and that without respect had to the due Honor of God, in his
worship; or Comfort, and Edification of his People.

And then is Superstition most bewitching, when it is disguized under the
feigned vizard of false Pretenses (which have bin many) devised by the new
Church of Rome, in an opinion of her own wisdom, to the befooling and
vilifying of the Ancient Catholic Church of Christ: which never esteemed the
same Reasons Precept, and Ordinance of Christ.

But that, which excedeth all height of Superstition, is, when upon the
will worship of man are stamped counterfeit Seals of forged Miracles, as if
they had been authorized by the immediate hand of God; whereof your
Legendaries have obtruded upon their Readers Book 4. Ca. 2, (...).
Thirteen Examples, to wit, of Fictitious Apparitions of visible Flesh, and
Blood of Christ, in the Eucharist: which makes your Superstition Blasphemous,
as if God Falsehood; a Sin abhorred by holy Job, saying to his Adversaries; Job

You are Forgers of Lies: will you speak deceitfully for God? And furthermore

discovered in the first Book; we shall insist only in your Churches Doctrine

large.

A New Instance, for proof of Romish Sacrilegiousnesse, in the Prayer set
down in the Liturgy of their Mass. SECT. III.
IN your Missall, after Consecration, it is prayed thus: Missal. Romans Offerimus
Majestati tuae, Domine, immaculatam Hostiam sanctum panem vitae aeternae, and
Calicem salutis perpetuae -- supra quae propitio vultu respicere digneris,
sicut dignatus es munera justi pueri tui Abel. And in the next place. Iube haec
perferri per manus sancti Angeli in sublime Altar tuum coeleste.
We offer unto thy Majesty, O Lord, this immaculate Host, this holy Bread of
eternal life, this Cup of everlasting salvation, upon which vouchsafe to look
with a propitious and favorable Countenance, as thou did accept the gifts of
thy holy servant Abel, and command these to be carried up into thy celestial
Altar, etc. So the Canon of your Mass. Some Protestants, in their zeal to the
glory of Christ, impute unto you hereupon a Sacrilegious Profaneness, whilst
you believing That Host, and That Cup to be the very Body, and Blood of Christ,
and a Propitiatory Sacrifice in it self, yet do so pray God to be propitious
unto it, and to accept it, as he did the Sacrifice of Abel; yielding thereby
no more estimation to Christ, than to a vile sheep, Abel.

At the hearing of this, your Cardinal (See the Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa,
cap. 24. Facilis est responsio: Non petimus pro Christi reconciliatione apud
Patrem, sed pro nostra infirmitate: etsi enim oblatio consecrata ex part rei,

Margin) 1. Prefaceth, 2. Answers, 3. Illustrateth, 4. Reasons. First of
his Preface. The Answer (says he) is easy. As if that Objection, which
seems to us a huge logg in your way, were so little an obstacle, that any
might skip over it. But have you never seen men, in trusting too much to their
nimblenesse, to overreach themselves in their leap, stumble, fall, and break
their limbs?

Semblably he in his Answer (which is the second point) The meaning of our
Church (says he) is not to pray for Christ's reconciliation, who was always
well pleasing to God, but in respect of the infirmity of the Priest and people,
that the offering may be accepted from them. So he. But whatsoever the meaning
of the Priest in his praying is, sure we are this cannot be the meaning of the
Prayer; for the matter prayed for is set down to be Holy Bread of life, and
Cup of Salvation, which you interpret to be Substantially the Body and Blood of
Christ in the Sacrament; and the tenor of prayer expressly is, [Vpon which
Lord look propitiously;] we say, upon which, not upon whom; which point

Thirdly therefore he illustrateth. The Comparison (says he) is not
absolutely between the Sacrifice of Abel, and of Christ, but in respect of the
faitb and devotion of the Priest, and people, that they with like faith may
offer, as Abel did. But this piece of Answer is that, which is called in
Music Discantas contra punctum; for the prayer is directly: [Looke down
propitiously upon these, as thou did upon the gifts of Abel.] The Comparison
then is distinctly between the Gifts, and not between the Givers. Yea but not
absolutely so meant (says he:) be it so, yet if it be so meant but in part,
that Christ, who is Propitiation it self, shall be prayed for to be
propitiously, and favorably looked upon by God, the prayer is Sacrilegious in
an high degree.

Fourthly his Reason. It is known (says he) that the Sacrifices of Sheep
and Oxen had nothing in themselves, whereby to pacify, or please God, the
Scripture saying, that Abel offered a better Sacrifice than Cain. And again,
God had respect to Abel, and to his Gifts. So he. Which is the very Reason
that persuades Protestants to call that your Prayer most Sacrilegious, because
whereas the Gifts of Abel were but Sheep, etc. you, notwithstanding, compare
them with the offering up of Christ, saying, [As thou did the Gifts of Abel.]
For although it be true, that the Gift of Abel was accepted for the Faith of
the Giver, and not the Giver for his Gift; yet if you shall apply this to the
Gift (in your Opinion) being Christ, and your Givers but simply men, (whom you
have called Priest, and People) it must follow that Christ is accepted for the
Faith of the Priest, and People; and not the Priest and People for Christ,
which makes your Prayer far more abominably Sacrilegious. And not much less
is that which follows, praying God to command his Angel to carry (if the Gift
be He) Christ into heaven; contrary to the Article of our Catholic Faith,
which teaches us to believe his perpetual Residence in heaven, at the right
hand of the Father. He answers: Bellarm. sup. And so Doctor Heskins (out of
Hugo de sancto victore) in his Parliament of Christ, Book 3. Chap. 395.
It is not meant, that God would command his Angel to carry Christ's Body, but
our prayers and desires, by the intercession of the Angel unto God for us. So
he. Which is as truly a false Gloss, as the former; for, in the Tenor of
your Mass, the Subject of your prayer is [Holy Bread of life, and Cup of
salvation.] The prayer is plainly thus; Upon which, O Lord, look propitiously:
and immediately after, Command [These] to be carried by thy Angel. Mark,
[These] viz. That Bread of life, and Cup of salvation; even that, which you
call, The Body, and Blood of Christ, as Corporally Present: which makes your
prayer to be Sacrilegious still, and your Expositors (that we may so say)
miserably

That the former Romish Prayer, as it was Ancient, does in the (then) true
meaning thereof condemn the now Romish Church of the former Sacrilegious
Innovation. SECT. IV.
FOr to think that it should be prayed, that God would be propitious to
Christ, were an Execrable opinion, even in the Judgment of our Adversaries
themselves; who for avoydance thereof have obtruded an Exposition, as far
differing This from That, or Christ from the Priest, as you have heard. But
whither will he now? Your Cardinal tells you, that the words of your Romish
Canon are ancient, such as are found in the Bellarm. l. 2. de Missa, cap. 24.
Super quae propitio, etc. habentur apud Ambrosium post consecrationem Lib 4. de
Sacram. cap. 6. Rursus Bellar. ibid. Haec verba posita sunt post consecrationem
apud Ambrosium lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. in Liturgijs Iacobi, Clementis,
Basilij, Chrysostomi.
Missals of Saint James, of Clement Pope of Rome, of Basil, of Chrysostom, and
of Ambrose. You will hold it requisite that we consult with these Liturgies,
set out by your selves, for the better understanding of the Tenor of your
Romish Mass. The Principal Quaere will be, whether Antiquity in her
Liturgies, by praying to God for a propitious Acceptance, and admittance into
his Celestial Altar, meant (as your Cardinal answered) Propitiousnesse
toward Priest, and People, in respect of their Faith, and devotion; and not
toward the Things offered distinctly in themselves?

In the pretended Liturgy of Liturgia Iacobi ante Conjecrationem. Diaconus.
Oremus pro sanctificatis tremendis donis -- ut Dominus acceptis eis in
super-coeleste spirituale Altar suum in odorem suavitatis mittat nobis divinam
gratiam. Tum Sacerdos. Deus, ac Pater Domini Dei, and Servatoris -- qui tibi
oblata munera frugum oblationes accepisti in odorem suavitatis -- sanctifica
animas nostras. Post Sacerdos censecrans, verba Consecrationis adhibet: Sancte
qui in sanctis requiescis -- suscipe hymnum incorruptum in sanctis and
incruentis Sacrificijs tuis.
Saint James (before Consecration) the prayer to God is, To accept the Gifts
unto his celestial Altar; even the Gifts, which he called The fruits of the
earth. And then after, for the Parties, as well Priest, as People, To sanctify
their souls.

In the Liturgy of Liturgia Bafilij ante Consecrationem. Pontifex -- Suscipe
nos, ut simus digni offerre rationabile illud absque sanguine Sacrificium --
and vide super servitutem nostram: ut suscepisti munera Abel, sic ex manibus
nostris suscipe ista ex benignitate tua. Et rursus Diac. Pro oblatis,
sanctificatis, and honorificentissimis muneribus Deum postulemus, ut qui
accepit ea in sancto and supercoelesti Altari suo, in odorem suavitatis,
emittat gratiam and spiritum nobis, etc. Post, sequitur Consecratio. Pontifex:
Respice Domine Jesus. Et post Consecrationem; Gratias agimus.
Basil (before Consecration) it is prayed to God, that he Receiving the Gifts
into his celestial Altar, (concerning the Parties) send his Grace, and Spirit
upon them.

And no less plainly Pope Clement. Constitut. lib. 8. cap. 16. called,
Constitutio Iacobi, apud Binium. Tu, qui Abelis Sacrificium suscepisti -- And
after, Pro omnibus tibi gloria, etc. cap. 17. Benign aspicere digneris super
haec dona proposita in conspectu tuo -- and complaceas tibi in eis, in honorem
Christi, and mittas spiritum super hoc Sacrificium, testem passionum ejus -- ut
ostendas hunc panem corpus ejus, etc. Post Consecrationem, cap. 19. Etiam
rogemus Deum, per Christum suum, pro munere oblato Domino, ut Deus, qui bonus
est, suscipiat illud per Mediatorem Christum in coeleste Altar suum in odorem
suavitatis pro hac Ecclesia, etc.
Clemens, teaching (before Consecration) to pray God, who received the Gifts of
Abel graciously, to behold these Gifts propounded to the honor of his Son
Christ; expressly differencing this Sacrifice, done in honor of Christ, from
Christ himself, who is honored thereby. And, after Consecration, to Beseech
God through Christ to accept the Gift offered to him, and to take it into his
Celestial Altar: where the prayer to God is not to accept of Christ, but of
the Gift for Christ's sake, and to the honor of Christ, in whom God is
Propitious unto us: we say again, the Gift for Christ, and not Christ for the
Gift, (what can be more plain against all Corporal Presence of Christ in the
Sacrament?) and to receive it into his Celestial Altar, but how? by
intercession of Angels? No, but expressly thus: By Christ the Mediator.

In the Liturgy of Missa Chrysostomi ante Consecrationem. Adhuc offerimus tibi
rationabile, and incruentu^ hoc obsequium. Deposcimus ut mittas Spiritum
sanctum super nos, et super apposita munera Sequitur Consecratio. Fac Panem
istum preciosum Corpus, etc. Post Consecrationem. Adhuc offerimus tibi
rationabile hoc obsequium pro fideliter do^mientibus, etc. Post. Dominum
deprecemur, ut qui suscepit ea in sancto et coelesti Altari suo, mittat nobis
proprerea gratiam, et donu^ Spiritus sancti.
Chrysostom (before Consecration) God is prayed unto, and supplicated thus:
We beseech thee to send

Even as Ambros. de Sacram lib 4. cap. 6. post Consecrationem. Offerimus tibi
hunc Papem sanctum, et Calicem, et perimus ut hanc Oblatione^ suscipias in
sublimi Altari tuo per manus Angelorum, sicut accipere dignatus es munera pueri
tui Abel, etc.
Ambrose explaineth his Supplication (after Consecration) for God, To accept
this Oblation, namely that, which he called Holy Bread, and Cup.

If therefore these former Forms may interpret your Roman Liturgy, as it was
Ancient, the prayer therein to God, desiring him to be Propitious, must have
relation to the things above specified called Holy Bread of life, and Cup of
Salvation, as distinguished from Priest, and People. Wherefore your Roman
Missals being so Ancient in this one point, in praying God Propitious to that,
which is called the Bread of life eternal, and Cup of everlasting salvation;
lest it might carry a Sacrilegious Sense, to wit, that the Body of Christ is
here the proper Subject of the Eucharist, and consequently to need a
Propitiation to God, by virtue of men's prayers (thereby greatly derogating from
the meritorious Satisfaction of Christ:) you ought to reduce this your Roman
Canon to the Orthodox meaning of Ancient Liturgies above mentioned; and to
understand it Sacramentally only, (namely) our Objective Representation,
Commemoration, and Application thereof Act of Celebration.

To the former vast heap of Sacrilegious Positions, and Practices, we may
add your other many vile, and impious Book 5. thorowout.
Indignities offered to the all-glorious Son of God, in making his sacred
Body, in your own opinions, obnoxious to the Imprisoning in Boxes, Tearing
with men's Teeth, Devouring, Vomiting it by the Communicants, and the
Transmittance into your guts, yea and into the parts inferior, together with
the Eating, and Feeding thereupon by Dogs, Mice, Worms; and (which
transcendeth, if it may be, all your other Absurdities) to be deprived of all
natural power of Motion, Sense, and Understanding. O Abominable! Abominable!

many Evidences from Antiquity. SECT. V.

Interpretation of the Article [HOC] by denying it to have Relation to Bread;

the very womb.

Insomuch that sometimes they expressly Ibid.
interpret it thus; Christ's Body, and Blood, that is, (say they) The Bread, and
Wine. Item, He gave the name of the Sign to the thing signified. Item, Bread
the Sign of his Body. And lastly, Bread is called Christ's Body, because it
signifies his Body.

and not God. They have distinguished the Godhead of Christ from his Manhood;
and they have proved the Holy Ghost to be God, and no Creature by the Body
whole in every part, in whatsoever space; or place; by judging it Impossible,
and also concluding Christ his Ascension into Heaven to argue his Absence from
Earth; all which have Ibid. Chap. 7. Sect 6. and Book 5. (...).
been discussed from point to point.

Our Fourth General Argument is, that whereas your Corporal Presence must
needs infer Corporal Eating thereof by the Communicants, notwithstanding you
have heard the contrary Sentences of Ancient Fathers, against Book 5.
thorowout.
Tearing, and Swallowing of Christ's Body, and Bodily Egestion. Next concerning
the Eaters, that only the Godly faithful are partakers thereof; insomuch that
even the Godly under the old Testament did eat the same. Then, of the
Remainders of the Consecrated Hosts, that they were Book. 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 10.
Earen (by the ordinance of the Schoole-boyes, and sometimes Burnt in the fire.
Besides they called them Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 11. and Book 7. Chap. 3. Sect.
2.
Bits, and Fragments of Bread broken (after Consecration) and diminished. And
lastly, in respect of the End of Eating. Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 11.
They held the thing present to be a pledge of Christ's Body absent: and also
Book 5. Chap. 9. Sect. 2.
allowed such a Touch of his Body by Faith that whosoever so touches him is
Sanctified. Which Observations, concerning our Fourth General Argument, do
minister unto us five particular Reasons, which make our Defense to be
Impreinable.

Fifthly, forasmuch as you teach the Subject matter of the Eucharist Body of
Christ, as a proper Sacrifice propitiatory; we, upon due inquisition into the
doctrine of Antiquity, have Book 6. Chapter 3. Sect. 2. thorowout, and elsewhere.
found the Ancient Fathers I. Nothing that, which they called Sacrifice herein,
to be Bread, and Wine, saying thereupon that Melchisedech, in that his Bread
and Wine, offered the Body and Blood of Christ. II. Such a Subject, which being
taken in great Quantity does B 3. Chap. 13 Sect. 10
nourish and satiate man's Bodily Nature. III. Such, as needs prayer to God,
that it may be In this Book 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Acceptable to God, as was the Sacrifice of Abels sheep. IV. So naming it an
Unbloody Sacrifice, as meaning thereby Book 6. thorowout, more especially
Chap. 5. Sect. 9, and 10.
void of Blood, which cannot agreed to the Body of Christ now risen from death.
V. So qualifying their other Exuberances, and Excess of speech (wherein they
named it The same Sacrifice of Christ once offered) by an (...) correcting it
thus; Book 6. Cha. 5. Sect. 6.
A Sacrifice, or rather a Memorial thereof. VI. By placing the Sacrifice of
Christ his Body, as now Presentative only in Heaven, and the thing offered, on
Earth but a Sign. VII. In all your objected Testimonies, for proof of the
same Body of Christ in the Eucharist, which suffered on the Cross, they
understood the same as the Book 6. Cha. 5. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
Object of our Remembrance, and not as the Subject of Offering, which make up
so many Arguments more. VIII. By paralle^ing In this Book, Chap. 2. Sect. 2,
and 3.
Baptism with the Eucharist, in like tenor of speech, from point to point.
IX. By praying God to be Above in this Book, Chap. 1. Sect. 3.
Propitious to that which is offered.

Sixthly, upon the same Doctrine of Corporal Presence you have erected and
fastened the roof of all your Building, which is, Divine Adoration of the Host:
yet notwithstanding have you not been able, by the Testimonies of any ancient
Father, to free your selves from Formal Idolatry, by any of your Book 7.
thorowout.
Pretenses (devised for your excuse) either of Good Intent, Moral Certainty,
or of Habitual Condition: especially seeing that the Fathers, by that their
universal Invitation, [Lift up your hearts] abstracted still the thoughts of
the Communicants from contemplating of any Subject present here Below, that
they might be drawn to the meditation of the Body of Christ, as it is in
Heaven.

Lastly, in your own Romish Mass, praying (after Consecration) God to be
propitious to the things offered, as to Abels Sacrifice, which was but a
sacrificed Sheep.

Compute all these Particulars, and you shall find about sixteen Arguments,
to prove you to be absolutely Idolaters. We having thus reveiled these Three
Principal, and Fundamental Abominations, do now proceed to their Concomitants
and Consequences, which are Mixtures of Heresy in many, Overture of Perjury in
some, and Obstinacy in all. We begin at the last.

CHAP. II.
Of the exceeding Obstinacy of the Romish Disputers, made palpable by their
own Contradictions; and of the Defense thereof, as being Contradictory in it
self. SECT. I.
ALl your Disputers show themselves in nothing more zealous, than in
maintenance of your Romish Mass, which they contend for by objecting
Scriptures, Fathers, and Reasons: notwithstanding their Expositions of
Scriptures, their Inferences out of the Fathers, their devised Reasons, and
almost all their Confutations are confuted, rejected, and contradicted by their
own fellows, as the Sections thorowout this whole Tractate do plainly
demonstrate. We cannot therefore otherwise judge, Prejudice is the chief
Director, so Obstinacy is the greatest Supporter of your Cause.

How much more when the Defense it self is found to consist upon mere
Contradictories, whereof you may take a Taste out of your Doctrine of Corporal
Presence, and of a proper Sacrifice. In the first, by obtruding on men's
Consciences a Belief (upon due Consequence) of a Body of Christ Borne, and not
Borne of the Virgin Mary; One, and not one; Finite, and not Finite; Divisible,
and not Divisible; Perfect, and not Perfect; and also Glorious, and not
Glorious, as has been Book 4. thorowout.
proved in each point.

II. In a point of properly Sacrificing of Christ's Body, your Music stands
upon the same kind of Discords, of See Book 6. thorowout.
Teaching a Body Broken, and not Broken; a matter visible, and not visible; of
Blood shed, and not shed; and of a suffering Destruction, and not suffering
Destruction. Evident Arguments of Obstinacy one would think, and yet behold a
plainer, if it may be.

One Example, instead of many, of a stupendous Obstinacy, in urging the
Judgment of Antiquity, for Defense of your Romish Mass, in the chiefect parts
thereof; proved by instancing only in their like Sayings concerning Baptism.
SECT. II.
Book 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 13.
remember) extremely urgent, and important with Protestants to show, if they
could, the like Phrases of the Fathers in Baptism, as were used of them
concerning the Eucharist, in the question of Sacrifice: as if the just
paralleling of these Two might be a Satisfaction unto themselves, concerning
that one point. We are to deal more liberally with them, and whereas they
assume unto themselves the suffrages of Antiquity; 1. For a Literal Exposition
of Christ's words [This is my Body:] 2. For a Change of Bread, by
Transubstantiation into his Body: 3. For a Corporal Presence of the same Body
in the Sacrament: 4. For a Bodily Union with our Bodies: 5. For a Proper
Sacrifice of the Eucharist: And lastly, for a Divine Adoration thereof; we
answer them from the Fathers, in their like Sayings concerning Baptism,
throughout every particular.

A Synopsis of the Speeches of Ancient Fathers, objected throughout this whole
Treatise, for proof of a Corporal Presence of Christ's Body in the Eucharist;
and assoyled and satisfied by the Parallels and like Equivalent Sayings of the

CHALLENGE.
SO many Testimonies of Fathers, so mainly insisted upon by your Doctors, for
warrant of such Erroneous, Superstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Romish
Doctrines, and each one not Baptism; what greater Evidence can any desire to
be made of a wilful Obstinacy (that we say not madness) than this of your
Disputers appears to be? but how much more, if we should point at the other
manifold Instances, which we have prosecuted at large throughout this whole
Volume, wherein their Inconsionableness has been manifested in all passages
to the Conscience of every indifferent Reader. Yet were this their Guilt not so
heinous, if such their Obstinacy were not infected with some contagion of
Perjury.

A Synopsis of manifold Overtures of Perjuries, in Defense of the Romish Mass.
SECT. IV.
EVery Perjury presupposes an Oath; which you have in the Bulla Pii Quarti
super forma Iuramenti -- Profiteor omnia declarata in Concilio Tridentino: and
hanc esse sidem veram Catholicam, extra quam nemo salvus esse potest.
Bull of Pope Pius the Fourth, imposed upon every Ecclesiasticke, subject to
the Sea of Rome, for the ratifying of the Belief of the many new Romish
Articles contained therein, as True, Catholic, and without which none can be
saved. The due proof that the same Oath, almost in each new Article, makes
the Swearer obnoxious to Perjury, is a Subject which would require a full
Treatise; for the which we are not altogether unprovided. But we are to
confine our selves to the Observations promised in our former Discourse, in
four special points.

I. Overture of Perjury is in Swearing unto that, which is called The Vulgar
Latin Translation. THis is decreed in the Council of Synod. Trid. Sess. 4.
Decretum de Editione statuit, ut haec Vulgata editio, quae tot saeculorum usu
approbata in Ecclesia, in publicis lectionibus, disputationibus, and
expositionibus pro Authentica habeatur, ut nemo illam rejicere quovis praetextu
audeat -- statuit and decrevit ut haec vetus Editio quam emendatissime
imprimatur.
Trent to be Authentical, and not to be rejected upon any Pretense whatsoever.
Whereunto (together with all other Decrees, and Declarations of the same
Council) you are sworn by the form of Oath set down in the foresaid Bull of
the Pope. The same Vulgar Translation, professed by you to be Authentical, and
that (as you Sacrobos. Defens. Decreti Trid. part 2. cap. 4. Quando in hac
Disputatione Authenticam dicimus versionem, nihil aliud volumus, quam eam esse
omnino conformem suo fonti, sive fidelem esse, ac synceram, etc. Possevin.
Biblioth. part. 2. lib. 12. cap. 16. Sane Authenticam pro re certae ^idei pon^

hoc in loco quam conformem esse Originali.
Consonant unto the Original, the Hebrew, and Greek Texts, has
notwithstanding been rejected by your Book 6. Cap. 1. Sect 2.
Cardinal, and the Greek Translation urged for proof of a Proper Sacrifice.
Even as it has been frequently excepted against by other learned Doctors in
your Church, after the Council of Trent, noting Errors therein not only by
fault of Print, but also such as happened by the Negligence, or Ignorance of the
Author thereof, as is Azorius Moral. Tom. 1. lib. 8. cap. 3.. Quarto. etc.
Quaeritur an Vulgata in reliquis extra fidem and mores (in quibus pro certo
habendum, Eam omni vacare errore,) errorem aliquem contineat. Inter Catholicos
dubitatum est, quibusdam asserentibus eam esse a Concilio approbatam, tanquam
immunem ab omni errore in fide and moribus, non tamen ab aliis, and proinde
aliqua in ea esse vitia: item aliqua, quae significantius, proptius, verius,
and melius verti potuerint: aliqua esse in contrarium and alienum sensum
conversa, idque probant testimonio Catholicorum virorum, quipost Concilium
Tridentinum scripserant, viz. Vega, lib. 15. cap. 9. super Conc. Trid. Senensis
lib. 8. ad finem. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 13. Andradius Payva Dese^
Trid. lib 4 Lindanus de optimo genesis interp. lib. 3. cap. 10. etc. Hi omnes
fatentur aliquos esse errores non solum vitio Scriptorum, sed etiam incuria and
negligentia ipsius Interpretis.
confessed; notwithstanding that Inhibition in that Decree, viz. Not to reject
it upon any pretense whatsoever. Who, to free themselves from Perjury, make
this Comment upon it, that this restraint of Not rejecting it is only in
matter of Faith, and good manners. Which is also your Bellar. lib 2 de verbo
Dei, cap. 12. Ecclesia tantum hanc versionem appellavit, non ita tamen ut
asseruerit nullos Librarioru^ errores in ea reperiti, sed certos nos reddere
voluit, in iis praesertim quae ad fidem and mores pertinent, nulla esse in hac
versione Interpretum errata. Eodem modo Sacrobos^ Defens. fid. Trid and
Salmeron. Tom. 1. Prolegom. 3.
Cardinal his Evasion; but is no better than a lurking hole, and so seems it
to be to your two Jesuits Azorius quo supra. Mihi vero verior videtur eorum
esse sententia, qui opinantur vulgata^ Editionem non solum in rebus fidei, and
moru^, sed in caeteris quoque omnibus omni errore carere: quia licet aliquando
aliqua significantius, proprius, ac latius reddi potuerit; non tamen verius,
aut simpliciter certius.
Azorius, and Greg. Valent. Analys lib. 8. c. 4.. Etenim, etc. Quod autem
Ecclesia addit: Ne ullus illa^ quovis praetextu audeat rejicere, id profecto
evidenti argumento est, in omnibus omnino locis, and quod attinet ad omnes
scripturae sententias esse hanc ut Authenticam (i. e. Conformem Scripturae
Originali) a Concilio approbatam. Secus enim praetextus aliquis superesset,
quo, non obstante hac definitione Concilii, posset aliquando ea Editio in
Disputationibus rejici, nempe si diceretur in hoc certe aut in illo loco, non
esse hujus Authorem Editionis Spiritus Sancti mentem assequutum -- In omnibus
igitur locis vult Concilium Eam haberi pro Authentica, exceptis erroribus
Typographorum -- (Vt Iudic. cap. 11. pro, altera Matre, lectum fuisse adultera
Matre, ut quidam objiciunt) -- Nam Concilium probavit veterem been Typis
impressam -- Post.. Porro. Nullo modo audiendi sunt ii, qui, post Concilium
Tridentinum, contendunt, Editionem Vulgatam aliquibus in locis, quod ad ipsam
sententiam attinet, emendari, Quin potius Graeci, and Hebraici Codices,
siquidem dissideant a nostra, sunt per eam corrigendi.
Valentia, who think that Oath to be violated, if the Vulgar Latin be
rejected at all, as less true than the Originals. And your Spanish Inquisitors
finding, in one of your Romish Doctors, the Rule of Hierome, Augustine urged,
which is, that no Translation Latin, or other be further allowed than as it
agrees with the Originals, they fair and cleanly wipe it out, saying that
Index Expurgatorius Hispanicus, ad nomen Martinz -- Quamvis haec, quae
Hieronymus, and Augustinus docuerunt, vera sunt, tamen post Concilii Tridentini
Decretum, non licet Vulgatae Latinae Testimonia quovis praetextu rejicere,
prout in ipsius Concilii Decreto constitutum est. fol. 145.
Although that, which Hierome and Augustine taught, be true; yet now since the
Council of Trent it is not lawful to reject the same Translation upon any
pretense whatsoever. * Accordingly your Jesuit Lorinus (in a matter concerning
neither faith nor manners) Lorinus Ies. Comment. in Lib. Sap. ca. 12. Versq. 6..
Vatablus. -- Non licet nobis discrepantem expositionem ab Editione nostra
Vulgata jam correcta sequi.
It is not lawful for us (says he) to follow an Exposition differing from
the Vulgar Edition, which is now corrected. * So they. And so far unsatisfied
are your Doctors,

We are furthermore not destiture of matter for a large Confutation (first) of
your assuming Saint Hierome as the Author of your Vulgar Latin Translation; to
manifest that it is no more the Translation of Hierome, or yet of any one
Author, than the diverse habits of a man's Body, from head to foot, can be called
the work of one singular workman.

Secondly, concerning the Authority thereof, you profess it to be Authentical
(that is, as you have defined) Conformable to the Original Hebrew and Greek:
although it may be as easily Ancient Vulgar, which had continued (as the Decree
speaks) from diverse ages, than the Ship of Theseus, which after some Ages had
been so thoroughly battered and pierced, that at last the keele and bottom
thereof did only remain, which could be called the Same. But passing by all
further Dispute, we shall refer you to the judgment of the Patrones of the
former Rule (so insolently contemned by the Spanish Inquisitors, as you have
heard) by one Instance, which may be sufficient in it self for trial of the
Case now in hand.

The Text of Scripture is Ephesians. 1. 14. in the Latin Translation (even in
that, which is set forth by Pope Clem. Octavus -- In perpetuam rei memoriam --
Textus accuratissime mendis purgatus.
Clement, as The most accurate Edition) thus: Ephesians. 1. 14. Lat. Vulg. Spiritu
signati promissionis, quae est pignus haereditatis. Graece, (...): in quem
locum Hieronym. Pignus Latinus interpres pro Arrhabone posuit: Arrhabo futurae
emptionis quasi quoddam testimonium, and obligamentum datur: Pignus vero pro
mutua pecunia ponitur, and cum illa reddita fuerit, reddenti debitum pignus a
Creditore. Aug. Sermon. de visione Dei, Tom. 10. page 1687. Accipis Codicem ab
amico, cui das pignus, cum reddideris quod accopisti, illc, cui reddis,
habebit, tu pignus accipies, non enim habebit ambas res: sed quando pretium
paras dare pro ea re, quam tenes bonae fidei contractu, de ipso pretio das
aliquid, and exit Arrha, non pignus, quod sit complendum, non quod sit
auferendum. Sed si Deus charitatem dat, tanquam pignus per spiritum suum, cum
eam rem ipsam reddiderit, qua promissa pignus dedit, auferendum est a nobis
Pignus? Absit! Sed quod dedit, hoc implebit: ideo melius Arrha, quam pignus --
hoc enim implebitur, cum Arrha data est.
You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Pledge of your
inheritance. But in the Greek it is: You are sealed with the spirit of
promise, which is the Earnest of your inheritance. The Question is, whether of
these is to be preferred; and Hierome, and Augustine are ready to resolve
Pledge, and one of them giving an Absit! against this Sense of it. The Reason
of both is, because he that gives a Pledge takes it again, when the Thing,
for which it was pledged, is received. But he that gives an Earnest, will
have it continue with him, to whom it was given. And so God assuring his
Chosen, by his Spirit, does for their greater Confidence give it as an Earnest,
and not as a Pledge. So they. Thereby advancing Gods gracious love, toward man,
and man's faith in Gods love. Here will be no corner of Pretense, that this
being an Error of Print, and not of Doctrine, may be rejected This is a sound
Reason, being delivered to the Print, was returned from the Press thus; This
is a fond Reason.) But between Pignus, and Arrhabo, there is no more Symphonie
than between an Horse, and a Saddle. Nor will it avayle you to say that the
Original Greek was corrupted, for it is the same Greek word, which Hierome
himself (who as you know used the perfectest Greek Text) does here avow to

II. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers is in swearing to the Romish
Expositions of Scripture. THe Tenor of the Oath, in this respect, is: Bulla
eadem. Sacram Scripturam admitto juxta eum sensum, quem Tenuit, and Tenet Matter
Ecclesia -- extra quam nemo salvus, etc.
I admit the sacred Scriptures in that Sense, which the Mother Church has
held, and does hold. By [Mother Church] understanding the Church of Rome, as
without which there is no salvation; which is expressed in the same Oath, as
another Article therein, and which elsewhere we have proved to be a GRAND
IMPOSTVRE, in a full Tractate, from the Doctrine of the Apostles, of General
Councels, of several Catholic Churches, and from such Primitive Fathers,
whose memories are at this day registered in the Romish Calender of Saints. How
then can the Oath for this point be taken without danger of Perjury? But to
come to the Article, concerning the Expositions of Scriptures According to the
sense of the Church of Rome, which would thereby be thought to Hold no Sense of
Scripture now, which she had not Held in more Ancient Times. We, for Trial
hereof, shall for this present seek after no other Instances, than such as in
this Treatise have been discussed, and for brevity-sake single, out of many,
but only Three; A first is in that Scripture, Ioh. 6. Except you eat the
flesh of the Son of man, you cannot have life.

The word [Except] was extended unto Infants in the days of Pope Innocent the
First, continuing (as has been Book 1. Chapter 2. Sect. ^1.
confessed) six hundred years together, when the Church of Rome thereupon Held
it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist. Contrarily the now Roman
Church Holds it Inexpedient to administer the Eucharist unto Infants, as you
have heard.

Secondly, Luke 22. Take, Eat, etc. Your Church of Rome, in the days of Pope
Nicholas, in a Council at Rome, Held, that by Eat, was meant an Book 3. Chap.
5. Sect. 1.
Eating, by Tearing the Body of Christ sensually with men's teeth, in a Literal
sense. Which your now Roman Church (if we may believe your Jesuits) does not
Hold, as has appeared.

Thirdly the Tenor of the Institution of Christ, concerning the Cup, was Held
in the days of Pope Book 1. Chapter 3. Sect. 7.
Gelasius to be peremptory, for the administration thereof, to prove that the
Eucharist ought to be administered in both kinds to all Communicants, and
judging the dismembring of them a Grand Sacrilege, as you have heard: whereas
now your Romish Church Holds Cup from all, but only Consecrating Priests.
Upon these (omitting other Scriptures, which you your selves may observe at
your best leisure) we conclude. You therefore in taking that Oath, swearing to
admit all Interpretations of Scripture, both which the Church of Rome once
Held, and now Holds; the Proverb must needs be verified upon you, viz. You
hold a Woolfe by the ear: which howsoever you Hold, you are sure to be
Oath-bit, either in Holding TENVIT, by TENET, or in Holding TENET, by TENVIT.

Hear your Oath. Bulla ead. Nec Scripturam ullam, nisi juxta unanimem
Consensum Patrum interpretabor.
Neither will I ever interpret any Scripture, but according to the unanimous
consent of Fathers. Here the word [Fathers] cannot betoken Bishops and Fathers
assembled in a Council, where the major part of voices conclude the less; for
Council never writ Commentaries upon Scriptures, but from Scriptures collect
their Conclusions. And although the word [Vnanimous] does literally signify
the universal Consent (which would infer an Impossibility, because that all
Fathers have not expounded any one Scripture, and very few (All) yet that you
may know we press not too violently upon you, we shall be content to take
this word Morally, with this Diminution, For the most part; and hereupon make
bold to aver, that your Iuror by this Oath is sworn to a flat Valent. Ies.
Anal. lib. 8. cap. 8. Patet nobis via urgendi unum aut alterum Doctorem
authoritate reliquorum.
With the greater (says Valentia,) nay but sometime with the Canus. Ioc.
Theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. number. 8. Plurium Sanctorum authoritas, reliquis licet
paucioribus reclamantibus, firma Argumenta sufficere, and praestare non valet.
Lesser, (says Canus.) Can you dream of an Unanimity in Disparity? Sometime
there is a Non-Constat, what is the Judgment of the Fathers in some points,
which you call matter of Faith. What then? Then (says your Valent. quo supra.
Quod si per Sententiam Doctorum aliqua fidei controversia non satis commode
componi posset, eo quod de eorum consensu non satis constaret, sua tunc constet
Authoritas Pontifici, ut consultis aliis ad definiendum regulis, de quibus est
dictum, Ecclesiae proponat, quid sit sentiendum.
Jesuit) the Authority of the Pope is to take place, who being guided by other
rules may propound what is the Sense. Behold here the Popery, which is devising
and obtruding upon the Church of Christ new Articles of Faith unknown (for
ought you know) to Ancient Fathers. And is it possible to find an Unanimity of
Consent in an Individual Unity, or rather a Nullity? for what else is an
Ignorance, what the Sense of the Fathers is, whether so, or so?

Next, that it may appear that this Article, touching the Unanimous Consent of
Fathers, is a mere Ostentation and gullery, and no better than that Challenge
made by the wise man of Athens of all the Ships, that entered into the Road, to
be his own: as if you should say, All the Fathers do patronize your Romish
Cause. We shall give you one or two Examples, among your Jesuits, as
patterns of the Disposition of others in neglecting, sleighting, and rejecting
the more General Consent of Fathers in their Expositions of Scriptures. One
Instance may be given in your Cardinal, who, in his Commentaries upon the
Psalms, dedicated to the then Pope, professes himself to have composed them,
Bellar. Epist. Dedic. Paulo Quinto ente Comment. in Psalm. Psalmorum ego
tractatione^ magis propria meditatione, quam mul^a librorum lectione composui.
Rather by his own meditation, than by reading of many Books; whereas he
that will Unanimous Consent of Fathers, must have a perusal of them all. In
the second place hearken unto the Accents of your Jesuit Maldonate, in his
rejecting the Expositions of the Fathers, as for Example: Maldon. Ies. in
Matthew. 20. Existimant Patres filios Zebedaei temere respondisse: ego vero credo
eos vere esse locutos. Item in Mat. 16. 18. [Non praevalebunt.] Quorum verborum
sensus non videtur mihi esse, que^ omnes, praeter Hilarium, quos legisse
memini, Authors putant. Ite^ in Mat. 11. 11. Variae sunt Patru^ opiniones, sed
(ut libere fatear) in nulla earum aquiesco. Item in Matthew. 11. 13. [Prophetae
and lex.] Omnes fere veteres ita exponunt, sed non est apta satis
interpretatio. Item in Mat. 19. 11. Non omnes capiunt, i e non omnes capimus:
Sic omnes fere veteres exponunt, quibus equidem non assentior. Item in Ioh. 6.
62. Sic quidem expono, and licet Expositionis hujus Autorem nullum habeo, hanc
tamen magis probo, qua^ illam Augustini, caeterorumque alioqui probabilissimam,
quia hoc cum CALVINISTARUM sensu magis pugnat.
So indeed said the Fathers, but I believe the Contrary. Item, This seems not
to me to be the Sense of this place, which All, whom I have read, except
Hilarie, do think. Item, Their Opinions are diverse, I rest upon of them all.
Item, All Ancients almost do so expound this Text, but this is no fit
Interpretation. Item, Thus I expound this Scripture, and albeit I have no
Author of this Exposition, yet I do approve it rather than that of Augustine,
or of Others, although otherwise most probable, even because it is repugnant to
the Sense and Exposition of the CALVINISTS. So he, and that usually. (O dura
ilia!) With what Stomach could this man swallow that Oath?

Salmeron the Jesuit may stand for the Third upon that Text, Romans 5. In whom
all have sinned, which teaches the universal Guilt of Original Sin of
mankind. What the Sense of the Fathers was from this Text, your Canus will
certify you; Canus (...) Theol lib. 7. cap. 3. Sanct omnes qui in ejus rei
mentionem incidore, uno ore asseruerunt B. Virginem in originali peccato
conceptam fuisse. And then he rechoneth, adding: Et si nullos contravenerit;
infirmum tamen ex omnium autoritate Argumentu^.
All they (says he) who have formerly fallen upon this subject matter, have
confessed, as it were with one mouth, that the Virgin Mary was conceived in
Original sin, no one contrarying this Opinion. So he, of the Judgment of
Antiquity, which notwithstanding he durst contradict. But we return to your
Jesuit, who premising Faith, propounds Saloteron. Ies. in Rom 5. Disp. 49.
In quo omnes peccaverunt.] Mariam conceptam in originali peccato, etsi non sit
haeresis damnata, nempe tamen ad fidem spectat. Item Disp 51. A qua multitudine
Patrum, locum ab autoritate infirmum, and -- Pauperis est numerare pecus --
Exodus 13. In judicio plurimorum non acquitsces sententiae, ut a vero demas: and
multitudinem multitudini opponimus. At Devoti erga D. Virg. Resp. Totam
Devotionem erga illam non consistere in Patribus, ut in Bernardo, etc. At
Antiqui. Resp Quilibet senex laudator temporis acti^sed and illud asserimus,
quo juniores, eo perspicactores Doctores esse [After he wrangleth, and
wresteth some sayings of Fathers to his part,] In celeberrima Pansiensium
Academa nullus in Theologia titolo Doctoris dignus habetur, qui non primum
jusjurandi religione se adstrinxerit ad hoc Virginis privilegium tuendum.
Objections made out of the Fathers, for proof that the Virgin Mary has the
same Original defect in her own natural Generation, and shapeth Answers full
of regret, and reluctancie. For, first, To this Objection; The Fathers did
consent: He answers thus; The Argument from Authority is infirm. II. To
this; The Fathers were Ancient: Thus; The younger Divines are more quick of
understanding. III. To this; The Fathers were many: He answers; He is but a
poor man that can number his Cattle. And again, confronting the Ancient
Fathers, We oppose multitude to multitude. IV. But The Fathers were Devout:
he answers; Yet all Devotion toward the Blessed Virgin rests not in the
Fathers. And when one of the Devoutest of them (Bernard by name) is objected,
who had said of the point now in Question, Bernard. Epist. 174. Hanc prolis
praeroga^ivam B. Mariae tribuere non est honorate Virginem, sed honori
detrahere, Et Paulo ante. -- Nunquid Patribus doctiores, aut devotiores simus?
To ascribe the prerogative of the Son to the Blessed Virgin, is not an
honoring, but a dishonouring her: wherein the same holy Bernard appealeth to
Antiquity, saying, Are we either more Learned, or more Devout than the
Fathers? Your Jesuit

Here we see an Oath exacting a Consent to the Unanimous Expositions of
Fathers, and hear notwithstanding as plain a Dissent of your Jesuits
opposition unto Unanimous Consent of Fathers, which is the ordinary guise of
your Disputers in their expounding of Scriptures: and yet behold you (forsooth)
the native children, and heirs of the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers. Your
Fathers of the Council of Trent have set it down for a Canon, whereunto you
are also sworn, that the words of Christ his Institution, concerning the
giving of his Body and Blood, Book 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 1.
Have a plain, and proper signification without Tropes: which notwithstanding,
the same words of Christ have been evinced to be Figurative, not only by the
Unanimous Consent of Book 2. Chapter 1. Sect. 6. and Chap. 2. Sect. 6. and 7.
Antiquity, but also by the express Book 2. Cha. 2. Sect. 4. See also B. 3.
Chapter 3. in the words, [The fruit of the Vine.] Sect. 5.
Confessions of your own Jesuits, in the words [Eate, Break, Cup, etc.] and
wherein Tropes. Besides, the whole former Treatise is but a displaying of your
unconscionable wresting of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers. Ponder you these
Observations with your selves, and then judge whether your Swearing be not
Perjury it self.

IV. Overture of Perjury, in the Defenders of the Romish Mass, is in respect
of the pretended Necessity of their Doctrine. IN the last Clause of the Oath,
prescribed in the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth, you are sworn that every
Article therein is the Sea above in this Sect. 4. Initio, at the letter (a.)
True Catholic Faith, without which none can be saved; among which is the
Article already mentioned, swearing to whatsoever was declared in the Council
of Trent, by which Council your now Roman Synod. Trident. Sess. 15.
Missall, or Masse-booke is approved. Now take a Taste of your Oath in every
Epithet. First, [True:] and hereby are you sworn that in the days of
Innocentius the third, the Administration of the Eucharist to Infants was not
held necessary; which your own Authors have Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11.
confessed, and proved to be false. Secondly, that the presence of them, who,
at the administration of the Eucharist, do not communicate, is Ibid. Sect. 5.
and Sect. 10.
Commendable, and held a Doctrine Catholic (that is) anciently Universal:
which was generally condemned by Ancient Fathers; and, even in the Church of
Rome it self, abandoned by two Book 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 9.
Popes.

Lastly, in the point of Necessity to salvation; To swear that whosoever
believes not that one may be said to Book 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 5.
Communicate alone, is damned; that whosoever believes not that the Priest in
the Mass, being alone, can duly say, The Lord be with you, he is damned; or
that the Sea Book 4.
Body of Christ may not be run away with Mice, and be blown away with the
wind, he is damned; and a number other like extreme foolish Crotchets, set
down in your Missals, which we willingly omit. The Sum of all these is,
that the same your Oath, made to damn others, does serve chiefly to make the
Swearers themselves most damnable. If peradventure any of you shall oppose,
saying that none of you within this Kingdom (which never admitted of the
Council of Trent, nor of the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth) are yet bound to
that Oath, let him know that although this may excuse him from an Actual
Perjury, yet can it not free him from the Habitual, which is, that he is
disposed in himself to take it, whenever it shall be offered unto him in any
Kingdom, that does embrace and profess the same.


THe more odious the Title of this Section may seem to be, the more studious
ought you to show your selves in examining

Heresy has a double aspect: One is when it is direct, having the express
terms of Heresy; the Other is oblique, and by consequence, when the Defense
does infer or imply necessarily the same Heretical Sense, even as it may be
said of Treason. For to say that Caesar is not King, is a Treasonable speech
Directly, in a plain Sense; and to say that Tribute money is not due to
Caesar, is as Treasonable in the Consequence. Thus much being premised, we are
now to recognize such Errors, wherein your Disputers may seem to have
accordance with old Heretics,

BOOK I. Wherein your Church is found altering almost the whole form of
Christ his Institution, and the Custom of the Catholic Church, descended from
the Apostles; which Presumption Pope Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 3.
Julius condemned in diverse, who sopped the Bread in the Chalice, and squeezed
Grapes in the Cup, and so received them: even as did the Ibid
Artotyritae, in mingling Bread with Cheese, censured for Heretics by your
Aquinas. In which Book 1. thorowout.
Ten Innovations, for one.

2. Your Pope Gelasius condemned the Heretical Manichees, for thinking it
lawful not to receive the Cup in the Administration of the Eucharist, judging
it to be Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 7.
Greatly Sacrilegious: notwithstanding your Ibid.
Church authorizeth the same Custom of forbidding the Administration of the
Cup to fit Communicants.

3. As Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 10.
you pretend Reverence, for withdrawing the Cup; so did the Ibid. Sect. 10.
Aquarij forbear wine, and used only Water, under a pretense of Sobriety.

4. Sometime there may be a Reason to do a thing, when as yet there is no
right, nor Authority for him that does it. We therefore exact of you an
Authority for altering the Apostles Customs, and Constitutions; and are
answered that Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 4.
your Church has Authority over the Apostles Precepts. Iump Ibid.
They were herein above the Apostles, whom therefore Irenaeus reckons among
the Heretics of his Time.

BOOK II. It is not nothing, which has been observed therein (to wit) your
Reasoning, why you ought not to interpret the words of Christ [This is my Body]
Book 2. Cha. 3. thorowout.
literally; and why you urge his other Saying [Except you eat my flesh] Ibid.
for proof of Bodily Eating; so that your Priest may literally say in your
Mass, that The Body of Christ passes into your Bellies and Entrails, because
(forsooth) the words Book 2. Cha. 3. Sect. 2.
Doctrinall. And have you not heard of one Nicodemus, who hearing Christ teach
that every man must be Ioh. 3.
Borne again, who shall be partaker of Gods Kingdom; and that he, expounding
them in a Literal Sense, conceited a new Entrance into his Mothers womb, when
as nothing wanted to turn that his Error into an Heresy, but only
Obstinacy? But of the strong and strange Obstinacies of your Disputers, you
have received a full See above in this Book, Chap. 2. Sect. 3.
Synopsis.

BOOK III. After follows your Article of Transubstantiation. I. Your direct
profession is indeed to believe no Body of Christ, but that which was Borne of
the Virgin Mary. But this your Article of Transubstantiation of Bread into
Christ's Body, generally held, according to the proper nature of
Transubstantiation, to be by Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 2.
Production of Christ's Body out of the Substance of Bread, it necessarily
infers a Body (called, and believed to be Christ's) which is not Borne of the
Blessed Virgin, as Saint Augustine has plainly Book. 4. Chapter 4. Sect. 1.
taught; diversifying the Bodily thing on the Altar from the Body of Christ
Virgin. Therefore your Defense symbolizeth with the Heresy of Apollinaris, who
taught a Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 2
Body not Borne of the Virgin Mary.

Secondly, You exclude all judgment of Book 3. Chapter 3. Sect. 9.
Senses, in discerning Bread to be truly Bread, as did the Manichaei dicebant
Christum non esse verum hominem, sed phantasma quoddam. Pr^teol. Elench. Haeret.
Manichees in discerning Christ's Body, when he was here alive, which they
thereupon held not to have been a True, but a Fantastical Body. Tertullian
also challenges the Verity of Sense, in judging of Wine in the Eucharist,
(after Consecration) in Confutation of the same Error in the Marcionites.

Thirdly, for Defense of Christ his invisible Bodily Presence, you profess
that (after Consecration) Bread is no more the same, but changed into the Body
of Christ: which Doctrine in very express words was bolted out by an Eutychian
Heretic, and instantly coudemned by Book 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 12.
Theodoret, and as fully abandoned Ibid. Sect. 13.
Gelasius.

BOOK IV. Catholic Fathers were in nothing more zealous, than in defending
the distinct properties of the two natures of Christ his Deity, and Humanity,
against the pernicious Heresies of the Manichees, Marcionites, Eutychians, and
Eunomians; all of them diversely oppugning the Integrity of Christ's Body,
sometime in direct terms, and sometime by irrefragrable Consequences; whether
it were by gaine-saying the Finitenesse, or Solidity, or else the complete
Perfection thereof: wherein how far ye may challenge affinity or kindred

I. The Heretics, who undermined the property of Christ's Bodily Finitenesse,
said that it was in diverse places at once, (as is Book 4. Chap. 4. Sect. ^. and
Chap. ^. Sect. 3. and Chap. 6. Sect. 1.
confessed) even as your Church does now attribute unto the same Body of
Christ, both in Heaven, and in Earth, yea, and in Millions of distant Altars at
the same time; and consequently in all places whatsoever. Now whether this
Doctrine of Christ's Bodily Presence in many places at once was held of the
Catholic Fathers for Heretical, it may best be seen by Existence of Christ's
Body in one only place; not only Definitively, but also Circumscriptively:
both which do teach an absolute Impossibility of the Existence of the same in
diverse places at once. And they were as zealous in professing the Article of
the manner of Christ's Bodily Being in place, as they are in instructing men of
the Article of Christ's Bodily Being, lest that the denial of its Bodily manner
of being might destroy the nature of his Body. * So far, that the Ancient
Father Vigilius Vigilius. B. 4. C. 5.. 5.
testifies, that to believe The Body of Christ, wheresoever it was, to be
Circumscribed in one place, was the Ancient Catholic Doctrine of those Ages. *
To which end they have concluded it to be absolutely but in one place, sometime
in a Chap. 4 thorowout.
Circumscriptive Finitenesse, thereby distinguishing them from all created
Spirits; and sometime by a Definitive Termination, which they set down first
by Exemplications, thus: Ibid. Sect. ^.
If Christ his Body be on Earth, then it is absent from Heaven; and thus, Being
in the Sun, it could not be in the Moon: Secondly, by diverse Comparisons,
for comparing the Creature with the Creator God, they Ibid.
conclude, that The Creature is not God, because it is determinated in one
place; and comparing the humane, and divine Nature of Christ together, they
Cha. 4. Sect. ^.
conclude, that they are herein different, because the humane and Bodily Nature
of Christ is necessarily included in one place: and lastly comparing Creatures
with the Holy Ghost, they Cha. ^. Sect ^
conclude a difference by the same Argument, because the Holy Ghost is in many
places at once; and all these in confutation of diverse Heretics. A thing so
well known to your elder Romish School, that it confessed the Doctrine of
Existence of a Body in diverse places at once (in the judgment of Antiquity) to
be Ibid.
Heretical. * Yea and so Heretical, that it opens a Sluice for the old
raucid Heresy of the Ariomanitae, (by interpretation, Maddish-Arians) to ^low
in upon us, who denied the Holy Ghost to be God, as not being every where; whom
the Primitive Fathers did Confute, ( See B. 4. C. 7.. 2.
Seven in number) by proving the Holy Ghost to be every where, and therefore
God, because He is in diverse places at once. Which was likewise B. 4. ^. 6.. 3.
Tertullians Argument, to prove the Godhead of Christ.

II. The property of a Solidity likewise was patronized by Ancient Fathers, in
confutation of Heretics, by teaching Chap. 7. Sect. 6.
Christ's Body to be necessarily Palpable, against their Impalpabilitie; and to
have a Thickness, against their feigned subtle Body, as the Air. * A whole
Book 4. c. 8.. ^*
General Council of Ephesus determining that The Body of Christ is palpable
wheresoever it is: * and furthermore controlling these opinions following
(which are also your Crotchets) of a Bodies Cha. 7. Sect. 6.
Being whole in the whole space, and in every part thereof; and of Christ's
Body Cha. 4 Sect. 9
taking the Right hand, or left, of it self.

III The property of Perfection of the Body of Christ, wheresoever, in the
highest Degree of Absoluteness. This (one would think) every Christian heart
should assent unto, at the first hearing; wherefore if that they were judged
Heretics by Ancient Fathers, who Prateol. Elench. haeres. Tit. Philoponus
Alexandrinus. Statuit mortuorum resurrectionem esse, viz. rationalium animarum
cum corruptibili corpore indissolubilem unionem.
taught an Indivisible Union of men's souls with their Bodies naturally, still
subject to corruption after the resurrection; who can imagine that the holy
Catholic Fathers would otherwise have judged of this your general Tenet,
(viz. to believe a Body of Christ, now since his Glorification, which is
destitute of all power of natural motion, sense, appetite, or understanding)
otherwise than of a senseless, and Antichristian Deliration, and Delusion? *
Fie, no! for they believed no Body of Christ, after his Resurrection, but such
as is Book 4. Cha. 9.. 3.
void of all infirmity, and in all integrity most perfect. * Yea and that which
is your only Reason you allege, to avoid our Objection of Impossibilities in
such cases, (to wit) Book 4. Chapter 5. Sect. ^.
The Omnipotency of God, the same was the Pretense of Heretics of old, in the
like Assertions; which occasioned the Ancient Fathers to term the Pretense of
Omnipotency, Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 2.
The Sanctuary of Heretics: albeit the same Heretics, (as well as you)
intended (as a Father speaks) to magnify God thereby; namely, inbeleeving
the Body of Christ, after his Ascension, to be wholly Spiritual. To which
Heretics the same Father readily answered, (as we Chap. 4. Sect. ^. at (b and
c.)
When you will so magnify Christ, you do but accuse him of falsehood: not that
we do any whit detract from the Omnipotency of Christ, (far be this Spirit
of Blasphemy from us!) but that (as you have been instructed by Ancient
Fathers) the attributing an Impossibility to God, in such Cases of
Contradiction, is not a diminishing, but an ample advancing of the Ibid.
Omnipotency of God.

BOOK V. Your Orall Eating, Gutturall Swallowing, and Inward Digestion (as you
have Book ^ thorowout.
taught) of the Body of Christ into your Entrails, and from thence into the
Draught, has Capernaiticall, and termed by them a Sense both Book 5. Cha. 6.
Sect. 4
Pernicious, and Flagitious. Besides you have a Confutation of the Heretical
Manichees, for their Book 5. Chapter 6. Sect. 3.
Opinion of Fastening Christ to men's guts, and loosing him again by their
belchings: Consonant to your Romish Profession both of Christ's Book 5. Chapter 6.
Sect. 1.
Cleaving to the guts of your Communicants, and Book 5. Cha. 6. Sect. 2.
Vomiting it up again, when you have done. * Besides the same Fathers
condemned the Heresy of the same Capernaites See Book 5. Chapter 5. Sect. 5. and
Chap. 3. ^ 2. and Ch 8.. 2.
for not discerning Christ's words, after his speaking of Eating his flesh: He
made mention of his Ascension into Heaven; saying, When you shall see the Son
of man ascending where he first was, they did not understand that they
therefore could not Eat him on Earth, as they imagined, because he should
ascend to Heaven. *

BOOK VI. This is spent wholly in examining the Romish Doctrine of
Masse-Sacrifice, and in proving it to be Sacrilegiousnesse it self, as you
have seen in a former See above in this Book, Chap. 1. Sect. 2.
Synopsis.

BOOK VII. This contains a Discovery of your Heretics, but in one respect
exceeding the infatuation of the very Book 7. Chapter 8. Sect. 2.
Pagans; besides the General Doctrine of the power of your Priests Cha. 5.
Sect. 3.
Intention, in consecrating, has been yoaked, by your own Jesuit, with the
Heresies of the Cha. 9. Sect. 5.
Donatists.

When you have beheld your own faces in these diverse Synopses as it were in so
many glasses, we pray to God that the sight of so many and so prodigious
Abominations in your Romish Mass may draw you to a just Detestation of it, and
bring you to that true worship of God, which is to be performed in Spirit and
in Truth, and to the saving of every one of your souls, through his Grace in
Christ Jesus. AMEN. *
