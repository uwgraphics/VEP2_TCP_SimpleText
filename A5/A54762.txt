Monarch CHARLES II. By J. Phillips, Gent.

AN HUMBLE OFFERING TO THE Sacred Memory OF THE LATE Most Serene and Potent
MONARCH CHARLES II.
I.
IT IS not for Vulgar Verse
To soar those Heighths, and reach those Fires,
That should inflame
The Breast of Him, that full of Thought aspires
Above the Common Flight of Fame,
To pay the Tribute due
To Royal Fun'rals, and a Monarch's Hearse.
'Twas therefore that the Ancient World assigned
Another way to grace
The State of Kings, when they in Marriage joined
The Sons of God with Humane Race.
From thence by Holy Writ allowed
Those Consecrated Odds
Above the Common Crowd.
For Sovereign Kings
Are our Terrestrial Gods.
From Them, as from the proper Springs,
Mercy and Justice, Peace and Safety flow:
They Blessings on the People shower;
With equal Power
To punish, or Rewards bestow.
II.
And such was our Immortal CHARLES the Great,
Embracing now
His Father's Blessed Soul;
Whose soft Control
Three Nations made
The Happy Seat
Of Plenty and Peace, and all our former Storms allayed.
Departed therefore to another Throne,
And the Enjoyment of another Crown,
Where His Dominions full as far extend
In Blissful Rule, and Undisturbed Command.
For if in Heaven there be Degrees
Of Power and Dignities,
We may have Reason to believe,
It Is the Sublime Prerogative
Of Kings on Earth, to be in Heaven the same,
In those vast Regions of Ethereal Flame
And spacious Empire, where
Exalted Bliss, that never wants,
Can never impair
The Sovereign Dignity of Royal Saints.
III.
Let it not then be said, Kings die;
They only change their Spheres;
For here, they move like Stars;
Above, They other Orbs assume,
And Constellations straight become.
Thus Leda's Eldest Son,
To his beloved Brother Kind,
His Grand Prerogative on Earth resigned,
To share with One he loved to that Degree,
His Royal Immortality.
IV.
Long had Three Potent Realms bewailed
The Oppressive Hand
Of Bold Rebellion, pampered with Success;
Discord and Slaughter Chaos'd all the Land,
And ruinous Anarchy prevailed,
Till at length Rebels against Rebels fought,
With deadly feud,
And their own Monstrous Bulk of Strength subdued.
But then it was,
Three Kingdoms, bleeding, mangled, torn,
In Ruins all forlorn,
Showing their ghastly Wounds, for swift Redress
Their Exiled Prince besought:
Who straight appearing, with His Vernal Heat
Revived the Autumnal Face
Of Church and State,
And Wild Disorder became Lovely Grace.
V.
This a Bright Star, that at His Birth
Out-shone the Noonday Light,
Foretold the wondering Earth.
For Heaven, that shows no Prodigies in vain,
By that made known,
That one day He should so outshine the Sun,
And like that Star regain
The Ancient Luster of His Clouded Right.
The Valiant Son of Iesse thus
Distressed at first, perplexed, and grieved,
And sparingly in Foreign Courts relieved,
Disgraced at Home, to Death pursued,
No Safety in Judea found;
By Restoration till in Hebron Crowned.
Then courted by his Foes,
The Israelites renewed
Their broken Vows.
The silenced Virgins once more sweetly sang;
And shady Hermon with his Triumphs rang.
VI.
And now He sits Enthroned;
Tho Young, the Eldest Prince in Europe Crowned:
And justly too might He in Years excel,
That knew so well
To dazzle all the World
By Great Examples of His own;
So Bright within His Northern Sphere
The Glory of His Virtues shone.
Virtues in Constellation met
And radiant only in the British Sky,
For other Kings to steer,
Since Pilots too of Kingdoms They,
The different Vessels of their distant Sway.
To Wonder Just, and Clement to Excess;
In that more God-like Great,
Who Mercy still prefers
Before His Judgment Seat.
This the Young Vespasian famed;
This our Immortal CHARLES no, less;
Both therefore the Delight of Humane Kind.
Such Matchless Patterns of Imperial Glory
By Providence designed,
That reading One, we read the Other's Story;
While Both with equal Ardour strove
By Acts of Grace to win their Subjects Love.
VII.
Alike Indulgent, equally Sincere,
His Lovely Eyes were the more Lovely Seat
Of Humble and Majestic Both;
At once begetting Love and Fear.
When He gave Audience to the Great,
His Bright Majestic Beams He wore;
But His Humility received the Poor,
With open Ear
Their just Complaints to hear.
Truly Religious, far beyond
The vain Impertinence of Bigotism,
For still the Churches Rights
And Public Worship were His Reverent Cares;
Which all along He still secured from Schism,
And sly Attacks of Canting Hypocrites,
While only Learned Worth He called
To fill the Patriarchal Chairs.
VIII.
Prudent in Counsel, and in Battle Fierce;
No Prince more studious of His Peoples Weal:
Yet for their Sakes, when once provoked to Wars,
He would not fail
To keep Invasion from his guarded Shore;
And rather chose
To be the Aggressor, then expect His Foes.
Thus Plenty flourished in the Arms of Peace,
And Peace with Plenty War supplied;
For all His Wars took Peace's Side;
And only They that fought for Honor, died.
The Rest, Estates and Harvests still enjoyed;
And all were Blessed that valued Happiness;
Such Leisure our Terrestrial God
On Us bestowed,
To sleep in War secure.
But neither did those Storms endure,
For by His Far-fam'd Brother's Conquering Sword,
Those daring Foes subdued,
For Mercy su'd,
And Peace was also to the Waves restored.
The Victor would no longer then pursue
His Just Revenge: for well he knew,
Earth only then resembles Heaven, when free
From Rage, and Man-devouring Cruelty.
IX.
His Sea-girt Islands thus at Peace,
The vaster Continent was all embroiled,
And her most Fertile Fields, without Surcease*
By wicked War despoiled:
What time, by their Distresses driven,
The loud continual Cries
Of the Afflicted crossed the Seas,
As at a distance Poor Men's Tears reach Heaven,
And pierced His Sacred Breast.
Then could not our Compassionate Sovereign brook
The Havoc that Ambition made,
While ransackt Cities their lost Wealth condole,
And Desolation revell'd in the Waste
Of whole Dispeopl'd Provinces.
But feeling His Magnanimous Soul
With Royal Pity struck,
He straight resolved their Succor, and His timely Aid.
X.
He knew His wide Command
Of Sea and Land.
And therefore gen'rously disdained
In vain to hold the Balance in His Hand:
The Gallick Rage
Must therefore feel His powerful Might,
Or render to His Sacred Umpirage.
But first, in Prudence, He more softly chose
By holy Mediation to Compose
The Bloody Strife, and gently cool
The Flaming Ardour of Aspiring Rule;
Deeming, Victorious Reason would afford
A Nobler Conquest then the Sword.
Thus interposing, all submit,
And with respectful Awe
Lay their Pretensions at His Feet:
And finding His Determinations Just,
The Germans gladly yield,
The Gallick Fury murmuring, quits the Field;
And the distinct Confederates
Applaud the Issue of His Wise Debates.
XI.
Heavens! Could it ever enter Humane Thought,
To practice Mischief against such a Prince?
This surely must the World convince,
That Earth is Wickeder then Hell,
Where God's Proud Criminals united burn,
And their Great Lucifer Reigns safe from Plots:
But here, Rebellion Heads a Monstrous Rout
More Mischievous then They.
Such was that Impious Cabal,
The Offspring of Night, Contention's Sons,
By whom we learn, there is no Rest,
But where the Whole are Wicked, or All Blessed.
Was our sweet Sovereign's Mercy such a Crime,
To move your eager Gall?
Yes -- All was Criminal,
Which They themselves had forfeited.
Was it His Prudence, most sublime,
That Charged their cursed Infernal Guns?
Or was His Patience at the Rye waylaid?
Did His Humility your Pride incense
To murder Sacred Innocence?
And in His Person show,
Could ye reach Heaven, what you to God would do?
Must the Faith's True Defender bleed to Death,
A Sacrifice to Cooper's Wrath?
Must God's Anointed lose His Sacred Blood,
To gratify a Cursed Brood
Of Joyners, Catchpoles, and a Priest of Baal?
Hear, O ye Heavens! who had designed His Fall.
But thus a Young misguided Son,
Even in Saturn's Golden Reign,
Found an Ungodly Train
Of Villainous Confederates, his Father to Dethrone.
XII.
Had our Great Caesar fallen by such rude Hands,
We might with Reason have bewailed His Fate;
But Heaven was kind,
Disclosed their Monstrous Hate,
And up to Public Shame resigned
Those Bold Contemners of His soft Commands.
And all the Land with cordial Sounds
Of Loyalty rejoiced,
To see encroaching Tumult curbed,
And those that would have our sweet Peace disturbed
By Justice cropp'd, or Foreign Vagabonds.
XIII.
When Providence these Miracles had wrought,
One now remained, already then design^d,
(For Providence does not work by Rote)
To call our Monarch to Eternal Bliss,
And leave His Parallel behind.
Nor could Heaven miss*
For straight the Illustrious JAMES, desired
Of all with Loyal Thoughts inspired,
Was still preserved, to show
How kindly Heaven supplies,
Intending well to order Things below.
XIV.
Kingdoms, like Men
Their Paroxysms have;
Which, if they meet not timely Cure,
Send 'em to fell Destruction's Grave.
Thus Mournful Britain, sick by Sympathy,
Languish'd as He lost Strength,
Until at length
In losing Him, the Kingdom feared to die.
He all the while like Great Augustus lay,
Nor grieving for His Quiet Day;
Nor anxious for His People, well aware
Who would be next their Angel Tutelar.
For, like the old
Expiring Herb's, He foresaw
The future Grandeur of His Brother's Awe.
For Kings Before their last Aerial Flight,
Are privileged to deep Foresight.
Orodes thus, half Bloodless, and half Cold,
Mezentius Fate foretold.
From other Fears His Virtues set Him free,
Prepared for Second Caesar's wished Euthanasie;
What time that Sable Cloud
That soon or late eclipses all our Light,
Hung over His Brows, and took Him from His Subjects Sight.
XV.
Dull Sorrow in the Morn;
IN the Afternoon a strange
And sudden Turn:
And then distracted by the Change,
We knew not whether to Rejoice, or Mourn.
At length we mourned, rejoiced, rejoiced and grieved,
And thus our Joys our Sorrows still relieved.
But Mourning surely is His Due,
And we must mourn, since He mourns too
That to His Brother's High Renown Succeeds.
Ill would it Loyalty beseem
Not now to bear a Part with Him,
Till He put off, His Mourning Weeds.
Mourn for His Sake that now is gone;
'Twould be Ungrateful to forget so soon
The Peace and Plenty of His Reign,
And His Preserving Cares
So Nobly to supply His Throne.
Mourn for His Sake, who now survives
Protector of our Laws and Lives;
Whose Glories now outshine
The Story of the British Line:
He Will recompense your Grief
With a more generous Supply
Of long Tranquillity,
While You enjoy
The Effects of His Courageous Flame,
And those Great Deeds, that must enlarge His Fam(...)
And when we see Him Crowned with all His Beams,
Let Us not Forget our Second CHARLES,
But Honor and Obey our Second JAMES.
FINIS.
