Hospitals, etc. OF LONDON and PARIS.

LONDON, Printed for I. Lloyd in the Middle Exchange next Salisbury-House in
the Strand. 1687.

TO THE KING'S Most Excellent MAJESTY.
I Do presume, in a very small Paper, to show Your Majesty, that Your City of
London seems more considerable than the Two best Cities of the French Monarchy,
and for ought I can find, greater than any other of the Universe, which because
I can say without flattery, and by such Demonstration as Your Majesty can
examine, I humbly pray Your Majesty to accept from

Your Majesty's Most Humble, Loyal and Obedient Subject, William Petty.

AN ESSAY IN Political Arithmetic, BY Sir WILLIAM PETTY,
Tending to prove that London has more People and Housing than the Cities of
Paris and Rouen put together, and is also more considerable in several other
respects.

1. THE Medium of the Burials at London in the three last years, viz, 1683,
1684 and 1685, (wherein there was no extraordinary Sickness, and wherein the
Christenings do correspond in their ordinary proportions with the Burials and
Christenings of each year one with another) was 22337, and the like Medium of
Burials for the three last Paris Bills we could procure, viz. for the years
1682, 1683 and 1684 (whereof the last as appears by the Christenings to have
been very sickly) is 19887.

2. The City of Bristol in England appears to be by good estimate of its Trade
and Customs as great as Rouen in France, and the City of Dublin in Ireland
appears to have more Chimnies than Bristol, and consequently more People, and
the Burials in Dublin were Anno 1682 (being a sickly year) but 2263.

3. Now the Burials of Paris (being 19887) being added to the Burials of Dublin
(supposed more than at Rouen) being 2263, makes but 22150, whereas the Burials
of London were 187 more, or 22337, or as about 6 to 7.

4. If those who die unnecessarily, and by miscarriage in L'hostel Dieu in
Paris (being above 3000) as has been elsewhere shown, or any part thereof,
should be subtracted out of the Paris Burials aforementioned, then our
assertion will be stronger, and more proportionable to what follows concerning
the Housing of those Cities, viz.

5. There were burnt at London, Anno 1666, above 13000 houses, which being but
a fifth part of the whole, the whole number of houses in the said year, were
above 65000; and whereas the ordinary Burials of London have increased between
the years 1666 and 1686, above one third, the total of the houses at London
Anno 1686, must be about 87000, which Anno 1682, appeared by account to have
been 84000.

6. Monsieur Morery, the great French Author of the late Geographical
Dictionaries, who makes Paris the greatest City in the World, does reckon but
50000 houses in the same, and other Authors and knowing Men much less; nor are
there full 7000 houses in the City of Dublin, so as if the 50000 houses of
Paris and the 7000 houses in the City of Dublin were added together, the total
is but 57000 houses, whereas those of London are 87000 as aforesaid, or as 6 to
9.

7. As for the Shipping and foreign Commerce of London, the common sense of all
Men does judge it to be far greater than that of Paris and Rouen put together.

8. As to the Wealth and Gain accruing to the Inhabitants of London and Paris
by Lawsuits (or La chicane) lonely say that the Courts of London extend to all
England and Wales, and affect seven Millions of People, whereas those of Paris
do not extend near so far: Moreover there is no palpable conspicuous argument
at Paris for the Number and Wealth of Lawyers like the Buildings and Chambers
in the Two Temples, Lincoln's Inn, Gray's Inn, Doctors Commons, and the seven
other Inns in which are Chimnies, which are to be seen at London, besides many
Lodgings, Halls and Offices relating to the same.

9. As to the plentiful and easy living of the People we say, 1. That the
People of Paris to those of London, being as about 6 to 7, and the Housing of
the same as about 6 to 9, we infer that the People do not live at London so
close and crowded as at Paris, but can afford themselves more room and liberty.
2. That at London the Hospitals are better and more desirable than those of
Paris, for that in the best at Paris there die 2 out of 15, whereas at London
there die out of the worst scarce 2 of 16, and yet but a fiftieth part of the
whole die out of the Hospitals at London, and or 20 times that proportion die
out of the Paris Hospitals which are of the same kind; that is to say, the
number of those at London who choose to lie sick in Hospitals rather than in
their own Houses, are to the like People of Paris as one to twenty; which shows
the greater Poverty or want of Means in the People of Paris than those of
London. 3. We infer from the premises, viz. the dying scarce 2 of 16 out of
the London Hospitals, and about 2 of 15 in the best of Paris, (to say nothing
of L' hostel Dieu) That either the Physicians and Surgeons of London are
better than those of Paris, or that the Air of London is more wholesome.


10. As for the other great Cities of the World, if Paris were the greatest, we
need say no more in behalf of London. As for Pequin in China, we have no
account fit to reason upon; nor is there any thing in the Description of the
two late Voyages of the Chines's Emperor from that City into East and West
Tartary, in the years 1682 and 1683, which can make us recant what we have said
concerning London. As for Dely and Agra belonging to the Mogull we find nothing
against our position, but much to show the vast numbers which attend that
Emperor in his business and pleasures.

11. We shall conclude with Constantinople and Gran Cairo; as for
Constantinople it has been said by one who endeavored to show the greatness
of that City, and the greatness of the Plague which reigned in it, that there
died 1500 per diem, without other circumstances: To which we answer, that in
the year 1665 there died in London 1200 per diem, and it has been well proved
that the Plague of London never carried away above of the People, whereas it is
commonly believed that in Constantinople, and other Eastern Cities, and even in
Italy and Spain, that the Plague takes away one half or more; wherefore where
1200 is but of the People it is probable that the number was greater, than
where 1500 was or one half, etc.

12. As for Gran Cairo it is reported, that 73000 died in 10 weeks or 1000 per
diem, where note, that at Gran Cairo the Plague comes and goes away suddenly,
and that the Plague takes away 2 or parts of the People as aforesaid; so as
73000 was probably the number of those that died of the Plague in one whole
year at Gran Cairo, whereas at London Anno 1665, 97000 were brought to account
to have died in that year. Wherefore it is certain, that that City wherein
97000 was but of the People, the number was greater than where 73000 was or the
half.

We therefore conclude, that London has more People, Housing, Shipping and
Wealth, than Paris and Rouen put together; and for ought yet appears, is more
considerable than any other City in the Universe, which was propounded to be
proved.

AN ESSAY IN Political Arithmetic, BY Sir WILLIAM PETTY,
Tending to prove that in the Hospital called L' hostel Dieu at Paris, there
die above 3000 per Annum by reason of ill accommodation.

1. IT appears that Anno 1678 there entered into the Hospital of La Charity 2647
Souls, of which there died there within the said year 338, which is above an
eighth part of the said 2647, and that in the same year there entered into L'
hostel Dieu 21491, and *that* there died out of that number 5630, which is
above one quarter, so as about half the said 5630, being 2815, seem to have
died for want of as good usage and accommodation as might have been had at La
Charity.

2. Moreover in the year 1679 there entered into La Charity 3118, of which there
died 452, which is above a seventh part, and in the same year there entered into
L' hostel Dieu 28635, of which there died 8397, and in both the said years 1678
and 1679 (being very different in their degrees of Mortality) there entered into
L' hostel Dieu 28635 and 21491, in all 50126, the Medium whereof is 25063, and
there died out of the same in the said Two years 5630 and 8397, in all 14027,
the Medium whereof is 7013.

3. There entered in the said years into La Charity 2647 and 3118, in all 5765,
the Medium whereof is 2882, whereof there died 338 and 452, in all 790, the
Medium whereof is 395.

4. Now if there died out of L' hostel Dieu 7013 per annum, and that the
proportion of those that died out of L' hostel Dieu is double to those that
died out of La Charity (as by the above Numbers it appears to be near there
abouts) then it follows that half the said Numbers of 7013 being 3506, did not
die by natural necessity, but by the evil administration of that Hospital.

5. This Conclusion seemed at the first sight very strange, and rather to be
some mistake or chance than a solid and real truth, but considering the same
matter as it appeared at London, we were more reconciled to the belief of it,
viz.

1. In the Hospital of St. Bartholomew in London there was sent out and cured
in the year 1685, 1764 Persons, and there died out of the said Hospital 252.
Moreover there were sent out and cured out of St. Thomas's Hospital 1523, and
buried 209, that is to say, there were cured in both Hospitals 3287, and buried
out of both Hospitals 461, and consequently cured and buried 3748, of which
number the 461 buried is less than an eighth part, whereas at La Charity the
part that died was more than an eighth part; which shows that out of the most
poor and wretched Hospitals of London there died fewer in proportion than out
of the best in Paris.

2. Farthermore, it has been above shown that there died out of La Charity at
a Medium 395 per annum, and 141 out of Les Incurables making in all 536; and
that out of St. Bartholomew's and St. Thomas's Hospital, London, there died at
a Medium but 461, of which Les Incurables are part; which shows that although
there be more People in London than in Paris, yet there went at London not so
many People to Hospitals as there did at Paris, although the poorest Hospitals
at London, were better than the best at Paris; which shows that the poorest
People at London have better accommodation in their own houses, than the best
Hospital of Paris affords.

6. Having proved that there die about 3506 Persons at Paris unnecessarily to
the damage of France, we come next to compute the value of the said damage and
of the Remedy thereof, as follows, viz. the value of the said 3506 at 60 li.
Sterling. per head, being about the value of Argier Slaves, (which is less than
the intrinsic value of People at Paris) the whole loss of the Subjects of
France in that Hospital seems to be 60 times 3506 li. Sterling. per Annum, viz.
210 thousand 360 li. Sterling. equivalent to about two Millions 524 Thous. 320
French Livers.

7. It has appeared that there came into L' hostel Dieu at a Medium 25063 per
Annum, or 2089 per Mensem, and that the whole stock of what remained in the
precedent Months is at a Medium about 2108 (as may appear by the third Line of
the Table No 5, which shall be shortly published) viz. the Medium of Months is
2410 for the sickly year 1679, whereunto 1806, being added as the Medium of
Months for the year 1678 makes 4216, the Medium whereof is the 2108 above
mentioned; which number being added to the 2089 which entered each Month, makes
4197 for the Number of Sick which are supposed to be always in L' hostel Dieu
one time with another.

8. Now if 60 French Livers per Annum for each of the said 4197 sick Persons
were added to the present ordinary Expense of that Hospital (amounting to an
addition of 251 Thousand 820 Livers) it seems that so many lives might be saved
as are worth above ten times that sum, and this by doing a manifest deed of
Charity to Mankind.

Memorandum, That Anno 1685. the Burials of London were 23222, and those of
Amsterdam 6245; from whence, and the difference of Air, it is probable that the
People of London are quadruple to those of Amsterdam.
