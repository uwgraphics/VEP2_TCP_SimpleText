Baronet; and to the virtuous Ladies, the Lady Springet of the Broyle in Sussex,
and to the Lady Stapley of Patcham.
ALL things in the World be the Creatures of God: the efficient cause of
Creation is God; essentially, not personally taken: As for the order of
working, Divines thus say; the Father is causa Movens, the Son Operans, by whom
all things were made: the Holy Ghost Pe^ficiens; it is sa^d, Genes. 1. he moved
upon the face of the Waters. Yet are we not to think, as if there were three
efficient causes of Creation, but only one* the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
being one and the same essence, is but one and the same cause of Creation.
Indeed Creation is principally attributed to God the Father, both in respect of
order, and because he is Principium Operationum; the Son is of the Father, so
are all Divine actions. God is the only Creator of all things: not Nature; not
Angels; not Chance and Fortune, as many blasphemous Heretics, and some
Philosophers have conceited.

That the World was Created, Aristotle affirmed the Wo^ld was from Eternity:
Plato said, it wa^ c^eated out of a co-e^e^nal matter: the Angels did create,
us the Jews falsely affirm: the Epicureans blasphemously ascribe it to Chance.
and not Eternal, as the same Philosophers affirmed, faith principally assures
us of it. Hebr. 11.3. By Faith we understand the Worlds were created. In Genes.
1. Moses sets down fully the History of the Creation. But the Creation may be
proved. 1. From the Originals of all Nations; we may plainly know the first
beginning of all People inhabiting the whole World, as Genes. 10. Moreover 2.
when Arts were first invented, is clear and manifest; as the invention of
Music, of Instruments of Iron and Brass, etc. and by whom: it is unlikely, if
the World had been Eternal, so many Generations of Men had lived without them.
3. It appears from the Order of causes* there must needs be a first Cause,
otherwise there should be Processus in infinitum, which is impossible; now if a
first cause* then that which is the efficient of all other is God; therefore
all things were Created.

I will let pass the curious Questions of the Schools, as what God did before
the World was created, in what time of the Year, upon what Day it was Created:
why God did not create the World sooner, etc. it is knowledge enough to know,
that God did create the World.

Now God has drawn and framed all things out of nothing; for that is properly
to create, viz. to make something of nothing. The Schoolmen observe this
difference, inter Genita, Facta, and Creata, between things begotten, things
made, and things created: Things are begotten of their own matter; they be made
of another matter; they be created of no matter. We and all things are said to
have been created by God, because he made us of nothing, that is, of no
pre-existent matter, but (...), of things that were not before, giving being
to that which had not being: now when I say, God made all things of nothing;
Nothing is to be taken negative, nor privative, that is, God created all things
out of pure nothing. The Philosophers have a maxim indeed* that ex nihilo nihil
fit: but (as one well distinguishes) that is to be understood, de generatione
Physica, non Creatione Divina; of natural Generation, not of Divine Creation.
Nature must have something wherewith to work, something whereon to work; God
had neither of both when he created the first matter, out of which afterward
he created other things, called by Moses, Tohu vabohu; by Philosophers, Chaos:
he had neither Instrument to work with, nor matter to work upon; he commanded
only, as David says, and all was made; spoke the word only, and all was
Created. God said, let there be Light, etc. Which supposes no matter to work
upon but God by the Power of his word created it: Omnipotency can effect things
without matter, Creation is an act of Omnipotency. Angels, and the Souls of Men
were created of nothing, without matter, because immaterial; God therefore can
as well create, other things. If God created the World from some matter, then
that matter had being from it self, or from another: if from another, then that
was created of nothing; if from it self, then should it be the same with God,
because only God is (...), a Being from himself; to affirm that, were Blasphemy.

Now God only can, and did create, because God only is Omnipotent, and
Omnipotency is an incommunicable attribute: there is an infinite distance
between ens and non ens. Besides, every thing that is created is good only by
participation; therefore it is necessary all things receive their goodness from
that which is essentially good, which is God* Moreover, if God created some,
and not all Creatures, but left the Creation of inferior creatures to any
else, then it was either because God was weary, or because God takes no care of
smaller Creatures; but it is neither; God being Omnipotent, did by a Word
Create; What more easy? and he takes care of all inferior things.

As for the Form, it is double. 1. In respect of God who Created the World. 2.
In respect of the Creatures themselves. The Form, in respect of God in gene^al,
is the manner of Gods Creation of all created things; which manner appears in
these following things. 1. That God made all things by his word; Jussit and
gessit. August.
Let the Earth bring forth, etc. By (word) we are not to understand, as if God
did speak words and syllables; but by it we are to understand Gods powerful
willing of things to be. 2. He made all things without any wearisome toil or
labor; but with great facility and ease were all things made by him; God
willed things to be done, and they were done. 3. Without any change: a Workman
may (as occasion serves) change his Plot intended by him, but God does not so.
4. Without succession; his works were made in a moment, even in an instant.

The form of the Created Things is twofold.

General. Particular.
The general form is Gods wise and ordered disposition of all the parts of the
world. Although in themselves they are of diverse matter, diverse virtues and
operations; yet all sweetly conspire together, and make one exact harmony: as
in an Instrument, though the strings be of diverse sounds, yet they make but one
harmony together.

2. Their particular form is the power, force or efficacy of Nature, stamped
upon all Creatures after their kinds, according to their particular beings and
their conditions, by which all creatures are enabled to their proper
operations. From this arises the goodness of the creatures, 1. General, of
all creatures, which is the entire perfection of all natural power according
to their natures: 2. Special, which is the reasonable creature endued with
supernatural gifts, heavenly wisdom, righteousness and true holiness; we may
hence admire the wisdom of God in making things after such an excellent form;
and cry out with David, O Lord, how wonderful are thy works! In wisdom have
thou made them all.

God's ultimate end in the Creation, is his own glory.

(1.) For the showing forth his glory, God does unfold himself in the Creature.
Five things are revealed in the Creation about God.

1. That there is a God, Romans 1.20. The Prophet Isaiah brings many proofs
from the Creation, to show that there is a God, and to difference the true God
from Idols and false Gods. Isai. 41.26. and Chap. 42.5.

2. The Eternity of God is revealed by the Creation. He that made all things,
and time it self, the measure of things, must needs be Eternal. Thy years are
throughout all generations: of old have thou laid the foundation of the Earth,
and the Heavens are the work of thy hands, etc. Psalm. 102.24, 25.

3. The Wisdom of God in creating innumerable and diverse things is revealed;
as also in the orderly disposing of innumerable things, and in giving to all
their natural perfections.

4. The Goodness of God is revealed: being (...), yet would he communicate his
goodness to the Creature of whom he had no need at all.

5. The Power of God, in making all things of nothing. Romans 1.20.

(2.) That the Creatures (especially Man and Angels) might give him the glory
due to his name, by acknowledging him to be such a God; The Creatures in their
kind do glorify God their Creator: and Men, by taking notice what the
Creatures declare of him: and wh^re they make the Creatures as Spectacles to
see God in them. The Creatures are Doctores Theologici; yea, they are like
Jacob's Ladder, wherein we may ascend from Earth to Heaven.

Light was the first Creature which God made: and agreeably, the adorning of
the World began with the light, from whence other things which were to be
created, should be seen: very probable it is, that the light first appea^ed
there, where the Sun being carried about in his Daily course, appears. God in
the Creation proceeded. 1. A negatione ad habitum, when he had created the
World. 2. A totali privatione ad habitum, when he brought forth light out of
darkness. 3. A partiali privatione ad habi^um, when he made the Day to succeed
the Night.

Quest. 1. In the second Days work it may be demanded, Why God did not bless
the Work of that Day in approving it, when to every other Days Work an
approbation is added; And God saw that it was good?

Answ. There is no express mention made of an immediate approbation of this
Days work. 1. Because this work of distinguishing and settling the Waters in
their place, was then imperfect, but was completed on the third Day. 2.
Because on this Day (as some think) Hell was created, which simply in it self
is not pleasing to God; or because the Angels fell on this Day, and became
Devils by their apostasy, as others imagine.

It is also observable, that in the creation, the lights that were dispersed
for three days, were on the fourth day all found in the Sun.

Quest. 2. It may in the next place be demanded* Why God, between the Creation
of the Plants, and of Animals, did interpose the Creation of the Stars?

Answ. I answer, that he might show, although ordinarily the Sun and other
Stars do concur to the generation of Plants as well as of Animals; yet the
generation of things is not simply to be referred to the Sun and Stars, but to
God; who before the Stars were created, commanded the Earth to bring forth
Herbs and Plants yielding seed, and the fruit-Tree to yield fruit after his
kind. Genesis 1.11. Before the Creation of Animals, he would create the Light,
because for the most part they have need of the light in a special manner.
Moreover, ye may take notice, that when God made the Fishes of the Sea, and the
Fowls of Heaven, he blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill
the Waters in the Sea, and let Fowl multiply in the Earth, etc. Verse. 22. But
when he made the brute Beasts of the Earth, we do not read that he gave any
such blessing at all to them; intimating to us, that he that will get that
blessing which God gives unto good Men, he mu^t not delight in Ea^thly
pleasu^es, like brute Beasts, but mind Heavenly things; for unto those who
wallow in temporal delights, God will not at all give his benediction, but his
malediction. It is also remarkable, that when God made the Light, the Sun,
Moon, and Stars, and the Earth, and all other Creatures, he saw that they were
all good: but when he created Man, he does not so particularly pronounce this
of him, as he does of other Creatures; he does not say, that he was good or
bad; yet are not these Creatures better than Man, but inferior to Man, being
all made for the use of Man: the reason is, because God would leave him to his
choice to choose good or evil to him self, Stella de contempt. mundi.
and accordingly he should have his denomination, as Stella notes.

Quest. 3. It may further be demanded, Why earthly Animals were created on the
sixth Day?

Answ. I answer, because they were differing in kind from the other Creatures
that were made before them, and because they were to dwell with Man* and were
more like unto Man both in their ^ody and genius, than either the ^irds or
Fishes; and also because many of them were to be helpful and serviceable unto
Man; therefore were they brought forth on the same Day wherein Man was Created*

Man was the last work of God in the Creation for diverse reasons.

1. That God might show unto us his own Order, in proceeding from more
imperfect things, to things more perfect.

2. That Man might be a little World, in whom all things should be summarily
contained; called of the Hebrews, Ainswor. Annot. in Genesis 1.
Olam Hakaton, and of the Greeks, Microcosmos, A little World: for he has in
him the beauty of things inanimate, even the chiefest, as of the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, etc. Genesis 37.8, 9. Ezekiel. 28.13, 14. He has growth as Plants, Genes.
38.11. and 49.22. Sense and sensible properties with ^easts, 2 Samuel 23.10.
Reason and wisdom with Angels, 1 Samuel 14.20.

3. That God might bring forth every Creature for Man's use and refreshment,
before Man himself should be Created: Zinch. de operib. Dei.
it behooves, that first there be an House, and all things necessary; then that
an Inhabitant be brought into it.

4. because God would communicate himself to Man, and acquiesce in him.
Vocabulum Homo, est duarum substantiarum sibula. Yertul.
When God created Heaven and Earth, he rested not in Heaven, nor in any
Heavenly thing; neither in the Earth, nor any Earthly thing, but only in Man;
because he is an Heavenly thing for his Soul; Earthly in regard of his body.

5. If God had first of all made Man before any other of his Creatures, then
Man might have had some colorable excuse to have spent his time in idleness:
but God created Man after he had made his other ^reatures, that Man might
forthwith be employed in the works of his Creator.

Zanchy of late, and some of the Ancients are of opinion, that when God created
Adam, christ did then assume an humane body, and made Adam's body after the
pattern of that. Munster does well observe on Genes. 2.7. that the word in the
Original, which signifies [formed] is written with a double (...); when it is
said, he formed the Beasts, it is written with a single (...); noting out to
us, that Man was partly from the dust of the ground, in regard of his body,
partly from Heaven in regard of his Soul, but the Beasts were only created of
the dust of the ground. The Ancients called the fabric of Man's body, Librum
Dei, the Book of God, because much knowledge is taught to Man out of Man. And
Man's being created after the Image of God, is to put him in remembrance, that
he should continually work after that Original Copy which God gave him from
Heaven. I shall discourse no farther upon these things, because this ensuing
Treatise of our Reverend Author will furnish you with variety of most excellent
Meditations upon the whole Story of the Creation.

Much honored in the Lord! I do not here present you with any thing that is
altogether new: I know, among Men the newness of the matter does chiefly
commend the Books; being like the Indian Elephants, which at their first sight
in Asia, were so admired, that Antiochus having but two, named the one Ajax,
the other Patroclus; but afterward growing common in every Consuls Triumph,
they were called in contempt Lucanian Oxen: So it is with Books; they are now
little regarded, because of the commonness of them. I confess, many Books now
adays are like Mythridate's Sword, whose Scabbard was more costly than the
Blade, and so their swelling Titles do make more show than all the Book
affords sub^tance: and in prefixing great Titles to babbling Books, Men do but
deceive the buyer; like unto some Vintners that hang out new Ioy^bushes, Senec.
ad Lucil. Epist. 33.
when they have nothing within but old musly Wine, as Seneca speaks. But the
substance of this Treatise does correspond with the Title; and as it is stuffed
with many choice notions, both natural and allegorical, God never made (...),
as some Philosophers Would have it, but every thing for a double use; one
natu^al, the other spi^itual.
together with many practical and useful inferences, so it is also written in
a pleasant style, and so the more delightful to the pious and ingenious
Reader. Good words are the garment of truth, and although truth is so glorious
within, that it needs no outward decking, yet if she does appear in a Raiment
of Needlework, it is but for a more excellent comeliness, not gaud^ gayness. The
worthy Author in this Treatise deals with you like Nurses, who feed their
Babes with milk first concocted within them. That voice that August. heard from
Heaven, is my humble advice to you, ^olle et lege, toll et lege. Take up and
read, take up and Read. So say I to you, Take up this Book, take up this Book
and read it, and do therein as an ancient Knight spoke of his reading good
Books, viz. the first time to read* both to see and like; the second time, to
note and observe the matter and method; and the third time to carry away, and
make use thereof. Thus not doubting but this Treatise will find acceptance at
your hands, and receive protection under your shadow, I humbly take my leave,
and am

THE BEAUTY and ORDER OF THE CREATION.
CHAP. I.
Genesis 1.1. In the beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth.
BEing about to speak of the Works of Creation, I have chosen the first Words
of Holy Scripture as a ground of my Discourse, which in brief contains in it
the Story of the Creation. In the Words we may take occasion to consider:

1. When all things were made] In the beginning of time.

2. Who made them?] God.

3. The matter whereof they were made] Nothing.

4. The Form or Order of the Creation] A comely and orderly disposing of the
Creatures; the Heaven being placed above the Earth in the highes^ rank, the
Earth being seat^d under it.

5. The end for which God did create them.

6. The effect or things created.

I. When] viz. In the beginning of Time; God is Eternal, before all (...),
without all beginning, enjoying Himself in infinite All Sufficiency of
blessedness and perfection. Now before the Creation there could be no time,
there being nothing but God himself, the eternal Jehovah, who is not subject to
the measure of Time: but Time began with the Creation, it being the duration or
continuance of the Creature; so that the beginning of the Creation was the
beginning of Time. Now as we may consider the Creation conf^s^^ly, before there
was a distinction of Creatures so also may we consider time it self. It is said
Verse 2. The Earth was without Form, and ^^id, and darkness was upon the face
of the deep, etc. So that ^i^st there was Created one huge deep confused Mass,
as a common mat^er, out of which all things (at least all b^dily substances)
were afterward distinctly created: So also in the beginning of this confused
lump of Creatures, there was a beginning of Time, but so that Time was in a
sort confused too, like that which was created, to which it was coexistent But
as the distinction of Creatures began, so did the distinction of Time: so the
Light being the first distinct Creature, made the first distinct Day, or
measure of Time. God said, let there be Light, etc. Verse 3, 4. And presently
it is said, Verse 5. The Evening and the Morning were the first Day: So that in
both respects it may be said, that the Creation was in the beginning of Tim^ --
In the beginning of Time confused, and not distinctly measured, was the
Creation of that confused Mass, and lump of things not distinctly ordered: In
the beginning of Time distinctly measured, viz. on the first Day of Time, was
the beginning of the distinct and orderly Creation of things; the Light which
was the first distinct Creature, and the first Day of Time beginning together.
So we have it, Hebr. 1.10. Thou Lord in the beginning have laid the Foundation
of the Earth.

II. Who made all things?] The Text says, God. Here two things are to be
considered. 1, The Persons in the Godhead which did Create. 2. The manner of
working.

1. For the first, we must note that all the Persons in the Holy Trinity did
create: there is no doubt of the Father, who as he is the first Person in order
of subsisting, so is he always the first in order of working. The second Person
is plainly mentioned. Ioh. 1.1. In the begi^ning was the Word, etc. By him all
things were made, and without him nothing was made that was made, Verse 3. Of
the Holy Ghost Moses speaks in the second Verse of this first Chapter of
Genesis. And the spirit of God moved upon the Waters; or hovered and sat upon
them* as a Bird upon her Eggs; by his divine virtue, framing the several
distinct Creatures out of the common Mass, as she by her natural warmth
brings forth her young ones after her kind, with all the distinct parts of
their bodies, out of the shapeless lump of matter in the Egg; according to
this sense do the best Expositors take that metaphor: so says the Psalmist, in
Psalm. 104.30. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created. So that the
Father creates by the Son, through the virtue of the Holy Ghost. And
therefore, albeit we use to call God the Father the Maker of Heaven and Earth,
as is expressed in our Creed* yet must we not exclude the Son and the Holy
Ghost, although the Father be first in order of working. Thus you see that God
made all things* as Solomon says, Proverbs 16.4.

2. Now we must consider in what manner all things were thus wrought by him. 1.
Voluntarily, of his own free will. 2. Without the help or use of any
Instruments. The Psalmist says, Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in
Heaven and in Earth, in the Seas, and all deep places. Psalm. 135.6 Now we see,
the more excellent any Creature is, the more free in its works. The Trees and
Plants grow up without all liberty, by a natural necessity, having no sense of
that which they do, and without any freedom of choice or voluntary manner of
doing. The sensible creatures, Beasts, Birds* etc. As they are of a more
excellent nature than the former; so they have some shadow of liberty, doing
that which is pleasing to them, and refusing things distasteful: yet this is no
true and perfect liberty, because they have not the light of reason to guide
them to liberty or freedom of will in choosing things, or refusing. But Man at
his Creation, and the blessed Angels that kep^ their first estate, have a
perfect liberty in their kinds, though subordinate to him that gave it, yet
vo^untarily choosing or refusing, according to the Light of their
understandings* Now then it must needs f^llow, that God who is infinite
perfection, is perfectly and absolutely free in all his works, and so in this
work of Creation: he cannot be imagined to have any to command him, he being
the supreme Commander, and absolute Sovereign over all: he cannot be conceived
to have any need of any thing created, and by it to be compelled to make them,
(as some are constrained to work for need* who otherwise would be idle) since he
is infinitely and absolutely All-sufficient, to whose eternal happiness and
perfection nothing can be added, no not by ten thousand Worlds. And as he made
all things voluntarily; so likewise without the use or help of any Instruments:
only by his immediate Word. So you see all ^long in this Chapter; He said, let
there be light, and there was light, etc. So Psalm. 148.5, He commanded, and
they mere created. So that by his spirit, the eternal Word, he made the World,
without the use or help of any Instrumen^s.

III. Of what matter they were made] Of nothing. In all the artificial works of
Men, we look to the stuff or matter, out of which they were made: but here was
none; God made all things merely of nothing; there was no matter preceding his
work. It is true! there was a common, rude, unwrought lump of things, before
the distinct and orderly Creation of things, out of which distinct and several
Creatures were framed: but this also was created by God; so that originally all
things were created of nothing. Job. 1.3. All things were made by ^im. And
therefore that thing, out of which all other things were made, was made of
nothing by him: for it is impossible that any thing can be of it self, but God
who is the Being of Beeings, and the Fountain of all things else.

IV The form or order of the Creation is seen in the orderly placing of all
things created; the Heaven in the highest place, as the roof of this glorious
building, decked with the Sun, Moon, and Stars: under these (as some say) an
Element of Fire [we are sure] an Element of Air, being of a pure invisible
substance, coming n^erer the nature of Heaven, than th^se grosser Bodies which
are placed below: next that are the Waters more gross than the Air, yet more
pure and light than the Earth, being naturally above the Earth, containing it
on every side, and that is the proper place of the Waters: but the Almighty
Creator did shut it up in narrower limits, commanding the Waters which covered
the whole Earth, to gather themselves together into one place of the Earth, for
this purpose, that the dry Land might appear for the use of Men and Beasts,
etc. which he had appointed to live upon the Earth, Genes. 1.9. yet so, that he
gives it leave now to overlook the Earth, (as it were) in lieu of that right
which it has to stand above by its Creation; as you may see, if you look on
the Sea where the Shore is level, and not mountainous: yet has the Lord by his
decree (as it were) barred and bolted it up, Job 38.10, 11. saying, Hitherto
shall you come, but no farther; and here shall thy proud Waves be stayed. Psalm.
33.7. He gathers the Waters of the Sea together as an heap, he lays up the
depth in Store* hous^s; kept as it were under Lock and Key: So the Apostle
says, 2 Pet. 3.5. The Earth was standing out of the Water, and in the Water.
In the lowest place, is the Earth by the mighty hand of God fixed unmoveably in
the midst of the great Creation, resting upon no Foundation, but the Almighty
arm of its Creator, having the Heavens round about it. The more particular
survey of the comeliness of several Creatures, we may consider of afterward:
thus briefly of the main Frame.

V. The end why God created all, could not be his own increase of happiness and
contentment; for he was All-sufficient of Himself; and since the Creatures were
mee^ly nothing, having no being at all without Him; they could give nothing to
him, which he had not without them in himself; for all that they are, or have,
is wholly of him and from him: and therefore the ends we conceive the Lord to
aim at, are two: viz. To communicate his goodness. To manifest his glory.


1. He did it to communicate his goodness* He made all things, that he might
give unto them Being, and perfection of Being, according to their kinds;
Himself being the Being of Beeings, infinitely perfect; not to receive from
them who are nothing without Him.

2. The second and main end, is the manifestation of his glory; which does not
add any thing to him, but shows what is in ^im, though incomparably short of
that he is: so by the Creation he shows forth the glory of his Eternity, in
that bringing fo^th the World, in the beginning of time he is manifested to be
before all time: The glory of his infinite presence, in that he has raised and
supported this huge f^ame of Heaven and Earth: The glory of his infinite
wisdom, in the most excellent composition of this goodly building: The glory
of his All-mighty power, in bringing so great a work out of nothing: The glory
of his infinite goodness, in communicating Being unto that which was nothing:
Of his holiness, in making all things good, not one spot defacing any part of
his work: Of his infinite mercy, in delivering the Creatures out of misery,
which had not been manifested without a Creation: Of his infinite justice, in
punishing the rebellion of his Creatures, which had not been evidenced but by a
Creation: Of his perfect tr^th in his dealings wi^h the Creatures; which, how
had it been made known, had there not been Creatures made? Of his glorious
providence, in governing and disposing things Created.

VI. The effect is the last thing to be considered, which is the whole
Creation, the whole body and frame of the Creatures; which may be generally
considered in the whole, as the Lord looked upon all together, and saw every
thing that he had made, and behold it was very good; which you must understand
is meant, 1. Of a natural goodness or perfection in every Creature, whereby
every one was made perfect and complete in its kind, without all natural
defects. 2. Of a special goodness or holiness in the reasonable Creatures,
Angels and Men. Thus of the Creation in general; of the several kinds of
Creatures in special, I shall speak more hereafter.

CHAP. II.
Use 1. THis condemns the Atheism of all those, who deny, or doubt of this
truth, and imagine that the World was not created of God; but that it was
without beginning: which senseless conceit, the World it self con^u^eth; for,
who but a fool cannot see, that no Creature could make it self? for then it
should be before it self; then it should be and no^ be at the same time:
neither can the m^st excellent Creature make the least or vilest out of
nothing, it being a work of him alone, who is the Fountain of Be^ing; yea the
change^ and alterations of the World, and the things thereof; the fadings,
decays and imperf^ctions of it, do all prove it had a beginning, and that it
enclineth to an end; for that which is witho^t beginning is also without
alteration. Now since the World must have a beginning, it must needs have it
from one of infinite excellency and perfection, which is God alone; none else
could frame so great, so glorious a Building.

2. If God made the World, and all things in it; then let every part of the
World, and every Creature in the World, put thee in mind of God that made it:
Let every thing that has Being, serve as a Stream to lead back thy thoughts
to God, who is the Spring and Fountain of all Being: When thou see the Sun
to shine, the Moon and Stars to give some light, borrowed from the Sun, look
thou to the Father of lights; and let that created light and brightness which
is in these Creatures, enable thee to see him that is invisible, from whom the
Creature receives all its excellency. Every Creature which thou see, is a
part of his Workmanship, and puts thee in mind of its Maker; but these, viz.
the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Heaven and Earth, are the same immediate works, which
the Lord made at the first: Thou see that Sun, that Moon, those Stars, that
Earth, which God did immediately bring forth by his All-mighty Word^ The T^ees,
the Beasts, the Bird^, a^e all his Creatur^s; all b^o^ght out of the Mass and
common (...) which (...) ^he first was without fo^m and (...): and all th^s^ in
pa^ticular, are brought ^^rth from time to ^^me by his Mighty Power* who (...)
Day works all ^^ings acc^^di^g ^o the c^^ns^l o^ his own will* (...) yet
th^^e are many In^tr^^^nt^ used to bring f^rth these: the old to b^i^g ^o^th
the young, etc. and t^ough ^he kinds of Creatures rema^n* which God him^^lf
made; yet the p^^ticular Males and Females ^^de* (...) beginning are l^ng since
ex^ing (...) an^ others by many succ^ssions are (...) many Ages in their st^ad.
But th^se (...) are the very same wit^ou^ succ^ssi^n and t^^^efore the Heav^ns
in sp^cial man (...) do s^t (...) the glory of God: the Sun and the Moon which
God has ordained, are in a special manner to be h^^ded, that we may s^riously
c^nsider of the Lord, whose immediate workm^nship they are. If you c^n once
learn to see God in his Creatures, as ^he Apostle direc^eth us, Rom, 1.20.
(where he says, The invisible things of God, from the C^^ation of the World,
are clearly seen, etc.) Thou may then see him Daily round about thee: Thou
can not set thy Foot upon the ground, but thou may remember that thou
treadest upon the Lords workmanship, and that thou could not stir a Foot,
but that he has made this ground to bear thee, and given thee leave to walk
upon it. When thou see the beautiful face of the Earth, and the Fruits and
Plants which it yields* thou see abundant variety of the Lords Creatures,
and art taught (if thou will learn) to remember him by whom all of them were
created. Thou must think thou hear Him in the noise of strong and mighty
winds, in hideous claps of thunder; that thou discernest Him in the Clouds, in
the showers ^f Rain, in the Hail, Snow* Ice* and Hoar-frost; in the Spring,
Summer, Harvest, Winter; in all the seasons of the Yea^; yea in the very Day
and Night; for Day unto Day, and Night unto Night, teach knowl^dge; Time it
self, and the continuance of it, are his wo^k.

Look upon thy self; every part, ^very memb^r of thee; thy Br^ath in thy
Nostrils* the spiritual substance of thy Soul, with all its excellent
faculti^s; thy reason when thou usest it; thy Memory which preserves unto thee
the knowledge of things gone and past; thine Eyes, thine Ears etc. which let
in things like Windows, into ^hy mind: These and multitudes of other things
which thou bea^est every Day about thee, should make thee th^nk with much
admiration of thy God that made thee, and all that is within thee. How can
thou look away from God? How can thou turn off the eyes of thy mind from
b^holding Him, if thou do indeed discern Him in his works? Can thou see any
thing that is, and not see (as it we^e) the pri^t of his H^nd upon it? We
should not be so fo^getfull of God, if we did make use of this point, that he
is the Creator of all things. Ye look upon the Creature, and no farth^r, as if
it had m^de it self, and had no C^ea^or to frame it: nay so strange is our
earthliness and s^ns^ality, that we fo^get God, by looking so much upon the
Creatures; our plenty of the Creatures makes us to forget him: our dealings
about the Creatu^es, do put the Creator out of our thoughts, whereas there is
never a Creature in the World, but it does in its kind effectually call upon
us, to remember it and our Creator: Yea the minding of our selves so much;
inordinate self-love, and too much carnal respect had to our selves, makes us
to forget our Maker; whereas our selves, (as I have said) should in special
manner make us mindful of Him that made us: Consider th^s* ye that fo^get God,
and either remember him ^ff^ctually by his works; or else be sure, his
Creatures shall bear witness against thee, and condemn thee for thy
forgetfulness.

CHAP. III.
Use 3. AS the Creatures should make us remember God, s^ should they make us
admire and glorify Him. This wonderful work, viz. the whole World, and all the
Creatures in it, should move us to esteem him wonderful* even beyond
astonishment. We cannot be sufficiently amazed at his excellent greatness,
manifested in his wonderful works. 1 Kings 10.4, 5 6. When the Queen of S^^ha
had seen all Solomon's wisdom* and the House that he had built, and the Meat
of his Table, and the sitting of his Servants* and the attendance of his
Min^sters, and their Appar^l, and his Cup-bearers* and his ascent by which he
went up into the House of the Lord; T^ere was no mo^e Spirit in Her. These
things in this variety laid together did aston^sh Her for a time, and She was
as one amazed, as if She had been left without a Soul. But alas! what was all
Solomon's glory unto the Excellency of God, his glory and greatness shining in
the Creation? not so much as a Glo^-worm is to the Sun. Our Savior has
p^^ferred* he beauty of a Lilly (one of the least of Gods Creatures) b fore the
ri^h^st R^bes that ever Solomon wore in his gr^atest glory. If Solomon's
wisdom were so admirable unto Her, how wonderful should the infinite wisdom
of God appear to be unto us* as it shines in the excellent composition of the
whole Creation? If Solomon's House did so dazzle Her Eyes with its stateliness,
greatness, and magnificence: how should we with much admiration look upon this
goodly frame of Heaven and Earth, which the Lord by his mere Word brought out
of nothing, to which the House of Solomon was no more than a poor Cottage? If
the consideration of diverse things together, orderly disposed, and fitted, did
thus overcome Her spirit; how should the exact order, and plasing of numberless
Creatures of diverse kinds, their several natures, tempers, qualities, virtues,
enclinations some of them great, some lesser, ra^ish us* some of them giving
support unto the ^est, some contained within the rest; some moving about with
restless motion, as the H^aven^, and in them the Sun, Moon and Stars, tu^ning
ab^out with them the Wheel of Time c^rrying ab^u^ with them Days* Weeks
Months, Yea^s, Ages; altering Times and Seasons; raising the Earth to Life
again in the Spring, and renewing its Face with you^h and beauty; ripening the
Fruits of the Ea^^h in Summer, scorching our Bodies wi^h heat, and even making
us forget the cold breath of Winter; then stri^ping the World of thi^ h^lf
Years clothing at the f^ll of the Leaf or Autumn, and soon after leaving it for
dead in the benumbed Winter, until it obtain another r^surrection (as it were)
at the Spring. This is the course of the H^^vens, and these their effect.

(...) ^g^in^ look on the Earth holding (...), and not st^^ri^g from its place,
eve^ (...) it C^eation: See some (...) of (...) big^^ss yet neithe^ sti^ring
nor growing, as Rocks (...) M^untains: Some g^owing, but not moving from their
^laces, as T^^es and other Plants of ^he Earth: some growing and stir^ing to
and fro; some creeping, others going and running, some swimming, othe^s ^l^ing;
some of wonderful strength and swiftness, some weaker, and slow in their
motions* Consider the unspeakab^e multitude of them even b^yond all im^gination
no Man on Earth being able to number all the several kinds of Creatu^es, much
l^ss the particulars of those kinds: And then, if there were not much dullness
in our spirits and want of appreh^nsi^n, there would be (as it were) no spirit
in u^; the powers of our Souls would even b^ swallowed up with admiration, and
we should with feeling hearts express our astonished thoughts and cry out with
the Psalmist, O Lord our God, how wonderful is thy Name in all the Wo^ld!
Psalm. 8.1. In some one of the least Creatures the Lord is to be seen in
admirable Workmanship, how much more in the whole ^reat^on, especially
considering, how it is brought out of nothing? in which respect the least Worm
is a witness of his Omnipotency beyond exception; and therefore we must take
time for Meditation on the Creatures, that we may set forth the praise and
glory of the Creator, and (as the Psalmist says) May talk of all his wondrous
works. That the Heavens may move us to declare the glory of God, and the
Firmament may provoke us* and prevail with us to set forth his Handywo^k.

CHAP. IV.
Use 4. AS we should admire and bless the Lord for the whole Creation* so in
special for any Creatu^es by which we receive any benefit. Remember, whatsoever
has any Being in the World, whereby thou receiv^st any comfort in any kind,
it is part of his Creation; it is one of those things which he brought out of
nothing. A due consideration of this would be an excellent means to lead our
minds unto thankfulness and to make ^s both love and praise the Lord, at whose
hand we receive it* If we could but deal seriously, there is not the least
thing that s^rveth to cover our nak^dn^ss, or to keep off the cold in Winter,
not the least refr^shment to a drop of D^ink, or a cru^ of Bread* which we take
into our Bo^ies, not one draught of the Air which we suck in at any time* not
Fire or Wa^er* which are so us^ful to us, but that every on^ at any time, when
we partake of the benefit of them should be a motive unto thankfulness. Once
this and that was merely nothing, but God gave it Being, and these and these
qualities, whereby it might do me good: yea, the Lord, to whom his works are
all known in all Eternity, did show his Almighty Power, in bringing these
things out of nothing, for this very pu^pose, that it might do me good, and
supply my wants. In special^ the Light which is ^o common a blessing, how
excellent is it in its nature, how needful and useful unto us? how should we
glorify the Lord for the use of this mercy every Day, that when the Earth was
without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, the Lord by
his Almighty Word did bring forth this glorious Creature, whereby we have the
use of that most excellent sense of seeing, which otherwise could not be useful
to us; yea, whereby the Lord in a notable manner shows forth his glory: so
that He that is not blind, may from this Creature especially, learn to see him
that is Invisible. Yea, God himself has pleased to c^ll himself by the name of
this Creature; God is Light: So brightly does his glory shine in this work of
wonder. What plentiful matter of thanksgiving does all the world offer us, if
we could take it; yea we cannot look about us, but we see that which should
enlarge our hearts and open our Mouths for the praises of the Almighty Maker of
Heaven and Earth, all our lives should be a course of thankfulness; and as all
the Lords works do give us occasion of thankf^lness; so all our actions should
be works* wherein our thankfulness should be expressed for the works of God.

CHAP. V.
Use 5. THis should keep us from abusing the least of the Creatures, as we fear
to become guilty* of defacing the Lords own Workmanship; and in this regard, we
should not dare to show our selves cruel to our very Beasts, which we use in
our service, either to carry our Bodies, or to do our work. The Righteous is
merciful to his Beast, but their mercies are cruel, who carry merciless hearts
towar^ the poor Creatures. We must always remember, that the Lord who made
them, has more right unto them than we can have; our right being wholly
derived from him; and therefore we must usurp no farther upon them than he
allows us; which is moderately and mercifully to use them, not cruelly
without mercy to abuse them. And therefore the withholding of due and necessary
food from the Beast, or over-burdening it beyond measure, is a dishonor
offered to its Creator. And as these Beasts of service must not be abused,
because they are the Creatures of God; so neither may we in sport torment the
poor Creature that crawleth upon the Earth. If I should name some practices
among us of this nature, perhaps some would think them too mean to be mentioned
here. But Christians must walk exactly, and keep Gods commandments diligently,
or exceedingly, as the Hebrew word, (...)
in ^sal. 119* 4. notes unto us: and the poorest Creature that is, is a part
of G^ds Workmanship, and God may be dishonored in it: yea, to abuse in sport
(though it be as mean a Creature as a Fl^^ etc.) is to take the Name of God in
vain; since these works of His, are such things, by which, as by a name, he has
made himself known unto us; the least Fly being an evidence of his Almighty
Power.

So for those Creatures which we use for clothing, nourishment, or other use,
we must take heed of all excessive abuse, and so of taking the name of the Lord
in vain. Still remember, that this is created of God, and I must use it as a
Creature of His. The Apostle against the sin of Fornication, uses this speech,
S^all I take the Members of Christ, and make them the Members of an Harlot? God
forbid. 1 Cor. 6.15. So may I say of the Creatures, shall I take Meat and
Drink, the very Creatures and Workmanship of Gods own hand, and make them
Instruments of Satan and sin, of Gluttony, of Drunkenness, means whereby to
dishonor God, and fight against Him that made them? Shall I take Money and
Clothes (Gods Creatures) to show forth my pride, and my heart lifted up against
God, that made these, and made me a poor naked Creature, allowing me a ^ob^r
use of them to cover my shame, not an excessive or fantastical abuse of them to
satisfy, and show forth my pride and vanity? God forbid. So for Time, which God
made at the first in the beginning of the Creation, we should especially take
^eed of abusing it, and account it as a precious thing fl^wing o^t of Gods
Eternity, too precious to be was^fully misspent and abused. If the ancient of
Days has ou^ of his Eternity bro^ght forth time, and giv^n us time, continuing
it to us out of his long-suffering and patience, even from the beginning of the
World hitherto, let us not by idleness, immoderate eating and drinking,
unprofitable or unseemly wanton exercises, immoderate sports, excessive
^ar^i^g, etc. (taking up more of ou^ t^me tha^ Re^igious duties) Let us not by
these and the like exercises embezle away those (...) hours, which when we have
once lost, we shall never see them more.

CHAP. VI.
Use 6. FOr as much as God made all things of nothing: this should make us to
trust in God in all straits and necessities: Great is the sin of distrust and
infidelity, when we distrust God for want of means; it is in effect to deny him
to be God, and to make no difference between the Creator and the Creature. Do
we doubt of Gods All Sufficiency, because we see no outward means? What
difference do we then put between Him and man? Man can help and supply us, if
he h^th means; but God the Creator is infinitely above the Creature, and can
help without all means. If thou had Meat, Drink, and Money eno^gh, thou
would fear no want, but the l^ck ^f these makes thee di^trustfull: Alas!
whe^c^ come all th^se? Did not the Lord bring them all out ^f nothing? and can
he not now as ^asily help thee many ways u^known, and not thought of by thee,
if thou trust in Hi^* as then he could bring the whole World out of nothing. It
is Atheism, and a denial of the Godhead, to doubt whether God could make the
World of nothing; and all infidelity in these cases s^v^u^eth of Athiesm, and a
^^ni^l of the Godhead* when we doubt whether God can help us, when we see
nothing but wants. I^ it not easier to h^lp ^s than to make a World? So in any
dangers, when we are s^rai^ly be^^t, and (...) to, and s^e no means of
deliverance and escape: Let u^ th^n lea^n to depend upon the Lords
All-suf^iciency; if we had a strong gua^d of S^uld^ers at (...)* we wo^ld ^ot
(...) b^t that we should break through our Enemies. Alas! Did not God m^ke
those Soldiers and all the World out of nothing? and does He need their help
to deliver ^s? I^ he please to del^ver us, the want ^f ^h^ir aid shall not
^i^d^r it: if not twelve Legions should not be able to pr^cure our safety.

Use 7. If God, that needs no ^eans to do us good wi^hall, but could h^ve
sup^lied all o^r wan^s c^n^inu^lly ^ut ^f no^hi^g* were yet pleased ^o (...) of
Creatures to be means of g^od unto us; thi^ should (...) us not to (...)

therefore I ca^e not (...) ^ay* God by giving (...) pleasur^ ^o help (...) ^y
^h^m, therefore I will take them as h^lps with thankfuln^ss from the h^nd of
God.

Us^ 8 This should make us fear the great God, who had made all things of
nothing, and not ^^ar any Crea^ure of His mo^e than the C^^ator. See our ^olly
and vanity of mind he^ein; we ^^ar Man so much, t^^t for f^ar of him, we sin
against he Lo^d without fear ^r c^^e. Vain Man! (...) that the Creat^^e which
was n^^hing (...) and which God made o^ nothing c^n (...) ^hee (...) th^n the
Creator* who by his Almighty Power made this Crea^^^^ of nothing; and gave it
all the Power which it (...), eith^^ to h^lp ^r hur^? Thi^ (...) ^f o^r f^olish
minds is no be^^e^ th^n (...), ^f it be ^^ghtly consider^d: The Lo^d g^ve ^s
wi^e and unde^standing h^a^t^. Fear him that c^n raise ^erro^s and troubles
unto the^ ^ut o^ nothing, that can set thine own ass^^gh^ed (...) against thee,
and make t^ee a^ ^ntoll^r^ble b^rd^n to thy self, that c^n bring mo^e misery to
thee out of thy own boso^e, than ^ll the Wo^ld can wo^k ag^i^st th^e. It is
more dangerous beyond c^^parison to (...) God against th^e, th^n all the M^n
and (...) C^eatures in the World, which were ma^^ of nothing by him,

CHAP. VII.
Use 9. THis should also move us highly to ^steem, and love the Lord, who is
the Maker of Heaven and Earth, above Heaven and Earth, and all things in the
same. He^e is a c^se which does wonde^f^lly discover the naughti^ess and
pervers^ess of our hearts, tha^ many of us esteem and a^^^ct s^^e one poo^
silly Creature above the Creator of all things. Alas! before the World was, He
was as pe^f^ct, as b^^ss^d ^s excellent as now he is, since hence the creat^on
of all things, but the World was nothing before he made it. These things of the
World, which now seem such Pea^ls in thine eye, were nothing, had no excellency
in them, but what he gave them: and therefore if there be any goodness in them,
that should not withd^aw thy heart from God to them, but cause thee the more to
admire and love the Lord, who out of his infinite goodness gave them all, that
which seems so good in them, unto thee, when of themselves they had neither
goodness nor being. The pleasantness that is in Meat and Drink, did it not
wholly come from Gods infinite sweetness and goodness? Do not then l^ssen thine
affection to God out of a bru^^^sh appetite toward them, but rather use them in
Ch^istian sobriety, wi^h an heart lif^ed up unto God, and admire his infinite
goodness and sweetn^ss, whereof thou ^astest some drop, in these creatures. Are
worldly riches things to be desir^d in thine opinion? All the ^iches in the
Wo^ld came out of the infinite (...) and sto ^^house of his All-^^fficie^cy or
S^lf-s^fficiency. Therefore if thou will be rich, covet him and long and labor
to p^ss^ss and enjoy Him for thy po^tion, and so thy Riches shall be more than
all the golden Mines in the World can pu^chase. Kn^w this, that as these riches
are nothing without Him, so they are as good as nothing if you have them
without Him; and that how rich so ever you seem to be in these ^utwa^d things,
yet you are poor and miserable, except you be rich in God: if thou have not
Him, thou have nothing, for all things are nothing without Him; learn to esteem
of God above all Riches, Children, F^i^nds, and to account all things as
nothing in comparison of Him, as the Psalmist did. Whom have I in Heaven but
thee, and there is none upon Earth that I desire in comparison of thee. Psalm.
73.25. It is good for me to d^aw near to God, he is my portion for ever. Let
thy love to other things be cold, in comparison of thine affection unto Him;
let thy Soul be carried with winged d^sires after Him: oh that I might enjoy
Him more fully, who brought all things out of nothing* who is the fullness of
all sweetn^ss and happiness! Oh that I could enjoy Him, and that he would be
mine, and I might be His, that I might live in His bosom, and walk in the
Light of his count^nance. For as God did bring all things out of nothing
immediately, and the things so brought forth were most pure and good, and
excellent, according to their kinds; but those that were brought forth since by
the Creatures, as His Instruments, have degenerated, and lost much of their
first excellency: So the swee^ness and comfort that is to be had immediately
from God, in a spiritual communion with Him, and in beholding by faith his
loving countenance through Jesus Christ* is incomparably beyond all the
sweetness, which is instrumentally conveyed to us by the Creatures. Therefore
let our Souls long and labor to drink immediately out of the Fountain, to taste
and see rather how good the Creator is, than to glut our selves with a sensual
sweetness of the Creature. Oh the pure Waters of the Sanctuary, which flow
immediately from the presence of God into the souls of the faithful! The Spouse
in the Canti^les says, The Name of Christ is like a precious ointment poured
forth, full of fragrant swee^ness, and therefore she begins her Song of love
thus: Let him kiss me with the kisses of his Mouth. She desires immediate
communion with him. A Love-Letter will not satisfy Her* but his Mouth to her
Mouth, Himself by his blessed Spirit imparted and communicated to Her: So tell
a faithful Soul longing after immediate communion with God, here is weal^h,
honors, pleasures, etc. His Answer will be* What talk ye of this dross and
dung, of these shadows? Away with these muddy trifles, give me God himself, and
take from me all the World: it is the Creator whom I love; it is this
All-sufficient God, with whom the whole World is not worthy once to be
compared: Give me Him, and take from me what you will.

CHAP. VIII.
Use 10. SEeing God made all things of nothing, when being nothing, they could
deserve nothing at his hands; and being made, they could not help or profit him
in any kind, this should move us in imi^ation of his free goodness, to do for
those that cannot deserve any thing from us, who are not likely to be able
either to help or hurt us, or to make us any requital. The Lo^d did this, when
no Law bound Him to his Creature: but we are bound to do for our fellow
Creatures, by the L^w and will of our Sovereign Creator. It is great shame for
us to grudge at this, and hang back saying, it is but cast away, I shall have
nothing for it. God gave Being to that which was nothing, and which could add
nothing unto him: but the most unable Man may possibly do us some good in some
case or other; and though he should be unable yet God is able and ^eady
abundantly to r^wa^d u^; whereas none could ^ecompense his wo^k which he did,
in giving Being to the Creatu^es which were nothing: yea all Men a^e of one
and the some blood with our selves; our bone and flesh; of our Kindred, issuing
out of o^e stock, as branches of one Ro^t: all the blood that runs in the
V^ins of all Flesh, it st^e^med down from one Fountain* even Adam ^ur common
Father, and therefore there is (...) reason that we should one do for ano^he^*
But what kin was the infinite Jehovah unto mere nothing to emptiness it self?
what neerness was there between him and it, that he should bestow so much upon
it, even the whole World? none at all; but rather an infinite distance between
an infinite Being and mere nothing: yet thus did the Lord give Being to
nothing, and made that to be which was nothing. How then should we blush at our
unnatural churlishness in this behalf! and learn of God to do for them, that
cannot do for us, ^or recompense that which we do for them, that we may be like
our great Creator, and our Father which is in Heaven.

CHAP. I.
Colos. 1.16. For by Him were all things Created, that are in Heaven, and that
are in Earth, visible and invisible, etc.
SECT. 1.
HAving spoken of the Creation in general I come now to the Creatures in
special; which are (as learned Zanch divides them) of three sorts. Zanch. De
Operibus Dei.
1. Visible. 2. Invisible. 3. Partly visible, partly invisible. Of the two
former sorts the Text in hand speaks, and under them both, includes the
third also, which partaketh of both the other kinds; but I have chosen his Text
purposely for the first and second kinds, intending upon a more peculiar Text
to speak more largely of the third. By the Creatures visible, I mean all
substances meet bodily, though some of them cannot be seen* as the Air and
Spirits in sensible Creatures: yet under [ visible] these I comprehend by a
Synecdoche, because sensible, and such as may be discerned by some sense or
other. By invisible, I understand all Creatures merely spiritual* f^^e from all
bodily substance, as the Angels. By those partly visible, partly invisible, I
understand Mankind consisting of his Body, which is a gross material
substance, and his soul which is of an intellectual and spiritual nature.

Of the first, Moses writes at large in the first Chapter of Genesis. And
therefore in the first place, observing that God made all bodily creatures, I
will fetch the explication of this point out of the Holy Story, the most
ancient that ever was penned; the Original Diary of the World, and Chronicle of
the Universe; where first, you have the Creation of the whole in the first Day,
and therein two things: 1. Passive. 2. A^^ve.


The passive substance was the huge unwrought Mass of things, without any
distinct form or shape, not yet distinguished and dig^sted into several kinds
of Creatures, not qualified with those several perfections of natural goodness,
which afterward the All (...) Creator b^stowed upon its se^eral parts. Moses,
tells us, it was without form] without any special or distinct form or shape:
and void] like a ruinous, confused heap; void of beauty, void of perfection,
void of such qualifications, Gen^s. 1.2.
as should make it very good. Again, it was dark. [ And darkness was.] This
confused lump lay wrapped up in the thickest Mantle of utter darkness, without
any the least glimpse of light, that can be imagined, most dreadful and
hideous, but that there was no Creature then made to be aff^ighted by it. This
darkness was upon the ^ace of it, or the superficies; it was not only a dark
Mass within, but the very surface or outside of it was void of all glimpse of
light shining on it. Again, it was deep.] An ^^ge Mass of wonderful and
extraordinary bigness, which yielded stuff and materials for the framing all
bodily substances afterward, except the Heavens, (if at least they are to be
excepted, as for my part, I think they are) and (as I conceive) the Text makes
it clear. For In the beginning, it is said, that God made the Heaven and the
Earth. And the next words are; And the Earth was without form, etc. So that by
the Earth before, I understand the rude Mass of things, out of which was
brought Earth* Waters, and other Creatures compounded of these* and this Earth
was distinguished from Heaven* and as this Earth was without fo^m, so the
Heaven was without light at the first: so that this (I conceive) at the first,
was made that huge O^b or Sphere of Heaven, without Sun, Moon, or Stars, and
together with it, the common matter of all inferior Bodies: for first he
says, the Heaven and Earth were made; but he does not say that the Heaven, but
the Earth only was without form and void; And the Spirit of God moved upon the
Waters.] Or hovered over this mixed Mass of Earth and Waters, as the Bird over
her Egg, by its divine virtue framing and sha^^ng distinct and several sorts
of Creatures, out of this common lump.

On this first Day was the Light created, as an active Instrument to
distinguish Time, and as I conceive, so also to be used in bringing forth
distinct and special Creatures, by virtue of a quickening operative heat
accompanying this Light. This Light you see was before the Sun, which was not
created until the fourth Day. And in probability, this Light was f^xed and
radicated in the Heavens, and so shined here upon this confused heap of the
Earth and Waters: for had it been without a subject scattered abroad throughout
the vast and void empty spaces between Heaven and Earth on every side; where
had the distinction been between Day and Night? And therefore I conceive, that
this excellent Creature being seated in Heaven by the Father of Lights, did
shine upon half the Earth at once, as now the Sun does, and so was ca^ried
about with the motion of the Heavens, and made Day where it shone, and left the
Night there whence it removed: so that whiles the Earth continued without form,
and had its face cove^ed with darkness, there was the first Evening; and when
the Light was made and shown upon the Earth out of darkness, there was the
first Morning; and this Evening and Morning were the first Day.

SECT. 2.
IN the second place is to be considered the distinction and division between
the greatest parts of the Earth and Waters.

1. The division of the upper parts of the Waters from the lower parts of the
same, which was by the Firmament, or Body of the Air, which God made between
the upper and lower parts of the Water, which I apprehend thus: That although
the Earth and Waters lay confused together in one heap, yet the thinner parts
of this lump coming nearer the nature of Water, was raised to the upper part;
and that these muddy Waters lying in an huge heap above the gr^sser and more
earthy part, the Spirit of God did penetra^e into them, and b^ his virtue
rarily the middle part of this wate^y matter, turning it into an huge,
spacious, but much purer and thinner body of the Air, which is called an
Expansion, or out-spread Covering, wher^by a separation was made between the
W^terish matter, compassing and hiding under it the whole Earth on every side,
and the upper parts of the Water, which in Clo^ds and Exh^lations were drawn
and raised up; some higher, some lower, above some parts of this Air or
Covering. And this Firmament is called Heaven; even the same spoken of
elsewhere in Scripture: The Heavens shall hear the Earth, Hos. 2 21. That is,
the Air shall shower down fatt^ning Showers upon the Earth, and so we ^ead of
The Fowls of Heaven, that is, of the Air: As S. Paul also calls the Heaven
of the bl^ssed Saints and Angels, The third Heaven; and ^o prop^rtionably, that
which is the place of the Sun and Stars, is the second, and this of the Air
here mentioned is the first Heaven; and this Evening and Morning wherein this
was do^e, was the second Day, though yet without a Sun.

2. As there was a distinction of the upper and lower parts of the Waters; so
now of the Waters from the Earth; the Waters that encompassed and wholly
overwhelmed the Earth before, being by the Word of God g^^h^red toget^er, and
shut up in one pl^ce, and called Seas; so that the d^y L^nd, wh^^h was
al^ogether hidden before, did now appea^: the wisdom of God thus provid ng for
those Creatures, which he pu^po^ed to place upon the Earth.

Next to this was ^he furnishing the Earth with Pl^nts, Trees* Herbs, Grass
etc. which were the first Creatures that had life, and that the first degree of
life, v^z. Vegetation, without sen^e or motion from place to place, yet end^ed
with a seminal virtue, enabling them to propagate their kind, and to bring
forth an increase. And this was the work of the third Day, when as yet the Sun
was not created.

SECT. 3.
NOw follow the Ornaments of the chi^f part of this glorious Building. 1. Of
the Heaven on the Fourth Day. 2. Of the Air and Waters on the Fi^th Day. 3 Of
the Earth on the Sixth Day. Now the Lord having without Sun, Moon or Stars,
given Light to the World three Days together, does by his All-mighty Word
create Lights in the Heaven, viz. the great Light of the Sun, which should now
henceforth become a Fountain of Lig^t both to other Stars, and to the rest of
the Wo^ld, by which the Day should be ruled: and then a l^sser Light, though in
appeara^ce great to us at a nearer distance than other st^rs, even the Moon to
rule the Night; so that now there should be some Light in the Night, and not
me^r Da^kness, as in the three former Nights: but either the Moon should shine
with greater b^ightness on the Earth, or (a^ least) the Stars should give some
lesser Light in the absence of the Moon, and even in the most cloudy Night
should give some little abatement of utter Darkness. But this was not all;
these glorious Bodies were to serve for S^gnes and for Seasons, and for Days
and Years* Wherein,

I. I embrace the Opinion of Par^^s, Parai comm^nt in Genes.
who acknowledges the Stars to have a th^^e-fold kind of Signification;
Natural. Civil. Divine.


1. Natural: as they signify and fore-shew Rain and Drought, Cold, Heat,
Famine, Plenty Eclipses, etc By their rising, setting, opposi^ion conju^ction,
etc.

2. Civil: As they show unto diverse sorts of Men, when is fit time for several
employments viz. Pilots, Fishermen, Husbandmen, Physicians, etc.

3 Divine: So they many times foreshew the judgments of God ^o come, as Wars,
Pestilences, Con^lag^a^ions, and fearful alterations of States and Kingdoms.

II. As they are for Sig^es, so likewise for Seasons. The S n by his va^iety ^f
motion, making the ^pring, Sum^er, Aut^mn, and Winter, and the Mo^n making n^w
Mon^t^s by her changes and revolutions.

III. They are likewise for Days and Y^ars: the Light carried about before,
made the Day, but now the S^n should meas^re the Day from this fourth Day to
the last Day, the Day of Judgment, by enc^mpassing the Earth in twenty and four
hours, making a na^ural Day complete; and by a full revolution to the same
point where it begun, making a full Year.

IV. To give Light to the Earth: without which all the Creatures would be in
Darkness, and with that Light to impart a c^erishi^g heat and warmth, without
which the natural hea, and living Creatures would ^^on be extinguished. And
this Evening and Morning was (...) Fourth Day viz. with those ^hree that were
before the Sun; but the first Day wherein there was a Sun to give Light.

The n^x^ Day, the Air and Wa^ers were furnished* where it seems that God
brought both Fowls and Fishes out of the Waters: so it seems the Fowls were
brought forth out of the Waters above the Fi^mament, and now are appointed ^o
fly in the Fi^mament or Air; and the Fishes we^e brought forth out of the
Waters b^low, where yet they abide and swim; this was on the fi^^^ Day. On the
Sixth Day was the Earth furnished with Beasts, and creeping things of every
kind. And last of all was created a Lord of the rest, even Man upon the same
Day; of which more hereafter. Thus much for these bodily Creatures, concerning
which something may be profitab^y spoken by way of Application, and some^hing
also by way of Allusion.

CHAP. II.
Use 1. IN that God did choose to make the World in this space of time, who
could as easily have made it, as well in one moment, as in six Days; this
should teach us to take time for Meditation on his Works. He that could in one
instant, at one word have brought forth Heaven full of Stars, the Air full of
Fowls, the Water full of Fishes, the Earth full of Beasts, creeping things,
Trees, etc. was pleased to make several Days works of this wonderful Creation,
and to proceed distinctly and orderly in his work: teaching us by the manner of
his working only by his Word without Instruments, that he could have done all
at once, which now he did at several times: it being as easy for Him at one
word to say let there be a perfect World* as at one word to say, Let there be
Light; and on the other side, by this stay and pause in working teaching us to
stay in our thoughts, and to cause our minds to dwell upon his glorious works;
our minds (I say) which are of narrow capaci^y, and can but take in things by
peece-meale into their consideration. The eyes of our Souls are but narrow, and
it is not enough for them at one glance to view the whole frame of this
glorious Building: but rather by settled Meditation to fix themselves upon it,
and leisurely to pass from one part and point thereof to another, and in every
part to admire the Infinite and All-sufficient perfection of the Worker. It is
that which may make us ashamed, and tremble also (...) God should call our
Consciences to account, few of us could say* that of ^ll the time we have
spent, ever sith-hence we had the use of ou^ understandings, in a serious
Meditation on Gods works, to this end that we might glorify the Maker, would
not make up one Week, not one six Days, not so long as the Lord was in bringing
them forth. Is not this a shame for Man, who was made of purpose to glorify God
in his works, that he should not in all his life spend so much time in
meditating on the works of God, notwithstanding his dullness and sloth of
apprehension, as the Lord was pleased to take in making of them*
notwithstanding his Omnipotency, which could have made them all in less than
one minute, as easily as in a thousand years! Th^s therefore should cause us to
humble our selves for ou^ failing in this regard, whereof we are guilty in an
high degree; and move us to spend more hours in studying this great Book of
Nature, which the Lord has spread open before us, therein describing unto us
those invisible things of his Eternal Power and Godhead in such plain and
legible Characters, that he which runs may read them: every main part being
(as it were) a several Volume, the Heaven, the Air the Earth and Waters, every
Creature in th^se being a several Leaf or Page: every part of each Creature;
every natural property, quality or created virtue in each, being a several
li^e, or (at least) word or syllable, deserving a studious and attentive
Reader; that is, one that will seriously take into his thoughts the admirable
incomprehensible excellency and perfection of the Maker. And as our Savior
speaking of Daniel's Prophecy, concerning the abomination of desolation
standing in the holy place, says, Let him that reads consider: so say I of
these great works of Gods Creation, which we may call the Books of Nature,
written with the Finger of God, let him that reads them consider: let him
that looks upon them, not do it with a careless eye, but with attentive
thoughts, and most effectual Meditations: ye may not herein be like idle
Readers, that only lo^k at the beginning of a Book, to see the name, and then
throw it away again. And what if I should say, it were expedient herein to
follow the same order in considering of the Lords works, as the Lord himself
did in their Creation; that is, to bind our selves to do the work of the Day in
its Day, namely on the same Day wherein each work was done, to meditate on the
work of that Day? I will not say, that he sins, who does not follow this
order, I know no such warrant. But this I say, considering our weakness, who
must have time to make a distinct consideration of things, considering how apt
we are to be carried away with idle, impertinent and unprofitable musings, and
so to look away from those things whereupon our thoughts should especially be
fixed: considering the great and admirable variety of Creatures, and of natural
qualities and perfections in those Creatures, all issuing from that one single,
but All-sufficient perfection of an infinite God; especially considering that
the Lord has been pleased, not only to let us know, how many Days he spent in
the Creation of all the whole, but also particularly and distinctly to acquaint
us with his several Days works; telling us what he did the first Day, what he
did the second Day, etc. ^ dare boldly say, it is expedient even to tie our
selves to set apart some time in those several Days, for a more special view of
those several works. The work it self is necessary, and a more natural and
convenient order to be used in performing it, I cannot think of, than this
which I now propose.

CHAP. III. Meditations on the first Days Work.
SECT. 1.
LEt us now consider what was the first days work, and that upon the first day,
which now we call the Lords day, and therein first consider what was done in
the Evening of that Day, and then what was done in the Morning.

1. What was done in the Evening: it seems that in the Evening or N^g^t, was
ma^e the Heaven without Light, the Earth without form, darkness c^vering the
face of the de^p. and the spirit of God moving upon the surface of the Waters.
And here is plentiful ma^ter for thy thoughts to work upon, on this first day
of the week.

1. Then admire and magnify the wonderful power and wisdom of the Lord, in
stretching out the huge and far-spreading body of the Heavens, encompassing all
the rest of the Creatures, after-mentioned. And let the wonderful circuit of
this Creature make thee with much holy admiration to look upon that infinite
Jehovah, by whom it was created: and if the Heavens be so great, that they
exceed thine imagination; how great is He of whom it is truly said, that
Neither the Heaven, nor the Heaven of Heavens can contain Him! if the Heavens
be so glorious, how unspeakable is His glory and Majesty, who has the whole
Heaven for his Throne and treade^h upon the Ear^h as his Footstool? yea
consider, that if Gods wisdom, power, greatness* etc. be so notably manifested
in these Earthly Creatures which we see, it is much more gloriously apparent in
the wonderful frame of the Heavens, which we can scarcely see by reason of
their distance, not doubting, but that the Heaven does as far excel these
lower Creatures in the excellent perfections of its nature, as it is above them
in height of situation.

2. Again, let this make thee wonder at the goodness of God with a thankful
heart, who has not only given Man a pleasant dwelling here on Earth,
plentifully furnished, and a Lordship over other Creatures, b^ought out of the
same common Mass with himself, but also offers him a place in the highest
Heaven, that he may dwell for ever in his glorious presence; yea, that he may
sit down with him in his Throne, as it is said in the Revelations* so that Man
who is but dust and ashes, even a very piece of this lower Earth, shall be
exalted above the rest of the Creatures, and made to dwell for ever before the
face of God: seeing then the Lord has made Heaven for Man to possess, let not
the Earth then so steal away thy heart, O Christian, as if there were no better
thing than the Earth for thee to enjoy: let the Heaven be of greater force to
raise and lift up thy heart toward it, than the Earth to sink it down-ward: see
thine own folly, and bewail it, that thou have spent more precious hours,
employed more serious thoughts upon some few spans of the Earth, or in
gathering some few pieces of white and red Earth, than in seeking an ass^^ed
title of an inheritance in those glorious and spacious Heavens. Think with thy
self, that no pains can be too much; no service too hard, no endeavors too
constant, no affection too eager in seeking Gods Kingdom, and its
righteousness. When God would comfort Abraham in hope of the promised
inheritance, and so make it a motive to him, that he might be stirred unto
obedience, and strengthened in the faith; Look (says the Lord) Eastward and
Westward, Northward and Southward, for all the Land which thou se^^t, to
thee will I give it, and to thy Seed for ever, Genes. 13.14 15. So would
thou have encouragements for obedience, would thou know why thou should
do these and these duties, and shun these and these sins; then look up to
Heaven, have an eye to the glorious inheritance, which God has provided for
thee. Would thou fain be above the reach of malicious tongues, or other
injuries, look up to Heaven; they shall not touch thee there. Would thou
learn contentedness with thy portion, look up to Heaven! Thou ar^ apt to think
thou have not enough here, but when once thou shall take hold of that Heavenly
Kingdom, thou shall say, I have enough. Look up to Heaven, and remember, that
Christ is there, in the same nature of Man, wherein now thou walk up and
down, making intercession for thee, and that thou have a sure friend, a Sure^y
and Advocate, a Spokesman, one that is thine Head, and to whom thou art united
as a Member, now in the highest part of the whole C^eation. Consider the
dignity and privilege of a Christian, whose happiness is as far above that of
the Worldling, as the Heaven is above the Earth.

3. Consider the restless motions of the Heavens, never at a stop, never
abating in any degree the swiftness of their motion; and learn both the
perfection of God, whose providence is in a continual course, by which as well
the Heavens, as the lowest Creatures, are carried about, all in him moving and
having their Being: and on the other side take notice of thy duty, and learn
to go on in a restless course of godliness, as one carried about by the power
of the spirit; as the first mover in all the ways and works of God; whereby the
heart (as the first wheel) is stirred, and the whole outward Man carried about
by that motion, from which proceeds both to will and to do, according to his
good pleasure.

In the second place, to the first Nights work belongs the Creation of that
first confused lump and mass of things, here called Earth; but having in it (as
it were) the stuff and materials of all these lower Bodies,

1. Consider what a rude misshapen lump this was at the first, and in thy
thoughts strip the Earth of all its glory; consider it bare and naked, without
Grass, Trees, Herbs, Men, Beasts, Light, or any thing that belongs to its
comeliness* furniture, or perfection: and then remember* that as it had Being,
so all its excellency and beauty was from the Lord; and therefore suffer not
any thing belonging to the Earth* not any thing that partaketh of it, or is of
kin unto it to draw away thy heart from him* who gave it all that it has: let
not that which is wholly God's, d^aw thee from God, but rather lead thee to
him. Take the Earth as it was of it self, and it was nothing: take it as it was
in the beginning of its Being, and it was as good as nothing: it had not any
excellency of Being to draw thine heart after it, if then thou had been
Created: and then conclude it were a madness to conceive it thus to be decked
and dressed up by the Lord himself for this purpose, that it might draw thy
heart from him, and move thee to prefer it above him.

2. Learn here to see a Picture of thy state of unregeneration: thy body of
sin, what is it b^t a very Chaos, a rude confused lump of disordered lusts,
Earthly affections, and muddy distempered passions? Is it not without its
proper form? Doubtless the Soul has lost that beautiful shape and Image of its
Maker, consisting in wisdom, righteousness and true holiness; darkness is upon
the face of it. What a misty Night shadoweth the understanding of every natural
Man, so that h^ cannot di^cern the things of God? Alas! he has no Light, the
Day is not dawned, neither is the Day Star ris^n upon his Soul: he speaks,
reads, hears of God of his love in Christ, b^t has no clear sanctified
a^^re^ension of any Heavenly mystery: he looks blindly upon his sins, upon
his afflicti^ns, upon his crosses, upon his comfor^s, upon all or many of
these, that which the faithful Soul sees, whose eyes have been enlightened ^y
the Father of Lights: learn hence ^o see what thy condition is* and so loath
thy (...) in poverty of Spirit. And as this senseless lump of things (...),
until the Spirit of God moved upon (...) ^aters: so c^nsid^r what a pi^ce of
dead (...) w^st thy ^elf, and how ^hou did (...) block, without all (...),
life, un^il the blessed quickening Spirit o^ G^d began to (...) thine heart; and
learn to (...) all proud c^nceits of thine own from ^n humble heart
acknowledging, that by the Grace of God, and through the work of his Spirit,
Thou art what thou art.

3 By this Evening of utter darkness which was before the first Day, learn to
consider that dark and dismal Night, wherein the Church of God was, after the
death, and before the Resurrection of our Savior, who rose to life upon this
first day of the Week. What sad thoughts possessed the Souls of those faithful
Wo^en, who this Night were coming with their Odours, to do honor to his dead
Body, whose life was so precious to them? When the forme^ hopes of his
Disciples were clouded with such dark distrustful conceits as this. We had
hoped that it had been He, who should have saved Israel. Surely, heaviness
endured with them this Night, but joy came in the Mo^ning: the Sun of
righteousness arose out of the Grave, as here the Light (...) commanded to
shine out of da^kness: and (...) it was verified, which our Savior spoke unto
them: Ye shall have sorrow, but the World shall rejoice, and your sorrow shall
be turned into joy.

SECT. 2.
LEt us now consider what was done on the Morning of the first Day: here turn
thy thoughts to consider of that excellent Creature [the Ligh^] which the Lord
called for in the midst of Da^kness, and which immediately came at his Call;
when Darkness was upon the face of the deep* God said, let there be Light, and
there was Light: Admire this wonderful change which the Lord made upon this
Day, when suddenly the Light brake forth there, where was nothing but Da^kness:
the glory of God is notably seen by this Light, inasmuch as without the help of
Sun, Moon, or other Stars, he created a bright shining Light to drive away that
Darknes^, whe^ewith those beginnings of the Creation were enwrapped. We should
think it strange to see at midnight a perfect Light suddenly breaking fo^th
without any dawning, or such other degrees of preparation; the Air in one
instant becoming as light at midnight, as at Noon in the cleer^st Day: yet
this was more, inasmuch as it was the first appearance of the Light that ever
was in the World, there being no beginnings, no glimpse or degrees of it
before. And here consider:

1. As the Light was created upon this day* so Christ (the Light of the World)
did this day arise out of the Grave of Death and Darkness; and by his
Resurrection the Light of his Godhead did shine abroad into the World, which
before was over-shadowed with miserable blindness and darkness; so the Apostle
says, He was declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the S^irit
of Holiness by the Resurrection from the Dead, Romans 1.^. His time of suffering
was the hour of Darkness, and a kind of N^ght: his ignominious death, burial,
and ab^de in the Grave, was so da^k a Night, that in it the quickest eyes, even
the faith of his own Disciples could hardly disce^n him to be the Son of God,
and Savior of the World. But being risen, he made it manifest that he was the
Son of God, as the Sun does show it self by the brightness of his own beams;
and now he cast abroad the light of his heavenly truth in the Ministry of his
Apostles by whom was Preached Christ Jesus dead for our sins, and risen again
to make us righteous.

2. Consider, that as on this Day the Light was created, and this day Christ
the Light of the World did arise, so the Lord has ordained, that on this day
the light of the holy Gospel should shine brigh^ly and plentifully in his
Church, through the preaching of the Word; and therefore consider seriously
with thy self, that on this day thou must set thy self with an open and fixed
eye of thy Soul to receive the Light; that is, wi^h a willing teachable and
a^tentive mind to recei^e the Word of God, which is a beam of light issuing
from him, who is the Father and Fountain of Lights. Sad is the practice of
many, who like Owls and Bats, and such other Night-bi^d, shun the Light, and
come not abroad in such times when the Sun shines; namely such as purposely
keep home on this day, and are off^nded at the Light* causelessly ab^^nting
themselves from it, or wilfully refusing to entertain it; such as would like
the World better, if it were over-shadowed with a Night of ignorance; and like
those Churches best, that have but dark Lanthorns; or such Candles, as after a
little time of blazing, go out with an unsavory snuff. Oh think it a special
mercy of God, that he holds forth the Light unto thee on this day, and do
thou with all readiness both look toward it, and walk by it.

3. Again. Consider, that as Light was the first thing which was made, when the
Earth was without form and void; so when any Souls in the state of natural
corruption, are without Christ formed in them, void of grace, full of
pollutions; the first thing wrought in us is a light of sanctified knowledge,
sound illumination, before we can bring forth any duty pleasing to God. And
therefore be not deceived, like those, who think that Ignorance is the Mother
of Devotion: Ignorance is as great an Enemy to the Soul, and its salvation, as
utter darkness was to the World, and to the Creatures in it: and that spiritual
light is as needful for the former, as this other light was for the latter.
They therefore that are in their natural blindness, are as far from the new
Creation, as the Earth was from its natural perfection, while darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

4. As God alone by his Call did bring forth Light; so think you, that all the
knowledge which thou have (especially in Heavenly things) is wholly from God,
without which nothing was in thee but utter darkness; and therefore thou have
no more cause to be proud of thy knowledge, than that muddy heap of Earth in
the beginning had to brag of the Light which shined upon it by the command of
God; whereas of it self it was altogether dark and covered with darkness.

5. Consider the benefits which thou receivest by this Creature; it gives thee
the use of thine eyes, it delights that sense: it freeth thee from many
fears, which darkness does naturally suggest unto thee: it shows thee things
in their right colors; it helps thee in avoiding many dangers, in ob^aining
many comforts: it is a guide unto thee in thy travel: it is comfort in thy
labors; it is a means, whereby thou may conve^se with others: it is not to
be imagined how many wants and inconveniences the loss of this Creature would
bring upon thee: for among other things, it has a cherishing warmth and lively
heat accompanying it, whereby it gives life, and preserves life, motion, and
natural heat in Men, and other Creatures; and therefore conclude, Oh Lord, our
God! how wonderful are thy works; and especially this firstborn Creature, the
Light which upon this first day thou did cause to shine out of utter
darkness! and when thy heart is covered wi^h a dark night of sad uncomfortable
thoughts, then look up to him who can cause the light to shine out of darkness,
and joy and comfort to arise out of sorrow and heaviness.

CHAP. IV. Meditations on the second Days Work.
FRom the first, come we to the second day, which we ord^narily call Monday.
Here you are to consider the wisdom and wonderful power of God, in making a
division between the huge heap of the Waters, spreading the Firmament of the
Air between its parts; raising the Clouds above, and there making treasuries
for Rain Hail, Snow, and other m^teors: Oh consider the goodness of God in
giving thee this admirable Creature of the Air, which feeds thee with Breath
continually, whereof the poorest Beggar has as large a portion, as the
greatest Monarch. Consider that the least draught of this Air is more than thou
can deserve at the hands of God, who yet art apt to repine and murmur, when
thou have not fullness of Bread* and art abridged in some small degree of the
plenty which thou had at other times.

1. Consider, that as without this Air the natural Man cannot live, so neither
can the spiritual Man, without the blessed spirit, which gives an heavenly
breathing to the Soul regenerated, as the Air does to the Body. And as the Air
does pass unseen into the Body, but then is breathed out again in a visible
manner, so the spirit of God works and conveyeth his heavenly influence in an
hidden invisible manner into the minds of the faithful; but is visibly
breathed forth again (as it were) in regard of its fruits, in holy speeches,
and heavenly actions, that Men may see the good works which he brings forth
in the godly, and glorify their Father who is in Heaven. Wonderful are the
effects of the Air, and according to it our Bodies are usually inclined and
disposed; yea, and our Souls too in some respect, by reason of the near
Neighborhood between the Soul and the Body, and the special affinity between
the Air and the Spirits in the Body, which are the immediate instruments of the
Soul. We of this Kingdom have special cause to bless God for one of the
sweetest and most temperate Airs in the World, se^ving much for delight, for
health, for our furtherance even in the best things, if we were car^full to
make the best use of such a blessing; a quick and kindly Air being no small
help to the spirits, even in the service of God.

2. We may further consider, that as such stoppings as hinder the Air from
passing too and fro, do endanger the natural life: so those sins that stop the
lively working, moving and breathing of the sanctifying spirit, do endanger the
spiritual life. The Wind (which is the Air stirred and moved) and is (as it
were) the same in the Air, which the Waves are in the Sea, is of wonderful
force and strength: it bears down Trees, Buildings, and things of wonderful
strength and bigness; it tosseth the Seas, and rouleth in the Waves, and
works wonders in the deep; hereby magnifying the Almighty Power of its
Creator; W^o (as the Psalmist says) rides upon the Wings of the Wind. And yet
you must remember, that the Winds and Seas obey him, who sent a calm, when
Jonas was cast out of the Ship; and at another time, when Christ came into the
Ship: so when sin is cast out of the Soul, and Christ received and embraced,
then the tempest of an accusing conscience is calmed, and a swe^^ peace
follows upon it, which passes all understanding.

3. As the Air is sometimes more, sometimes less stir^ed by the Winds; so the
blessed spirit of God, blowing when, where, and how he lists, does sometimes
(as it were) breath more st^ongly, and sometimes impart a l^ss measure of h^s
heavenly virtue. In the second Chapter of the Acts, at the Feast of Pentecost,
he cam^ down like a mighty rushing Wind upon the Apostles, who were gathered
together, and so they were carried mightily in the Power of the spirit, to
spread the Gospel of Christ throughout the World. But ordinarily, the blasts of
the spirit are not so strong, and to our pace is but ^low in the ways of God:
and therefore should we pray with the Spouse in that song of Songs. Arise O
Northwind, and come O South, Cant. 4.16.
and blow upon my Garden, that the s^ic^s thereof may fl^w forth.

4. But in this Days work, we are especially to consider the Clouds above,
which are those Waters above the Firmament, and in these admire those
storehouses of sweet refreshing showers, which water the Earth with a
fa^tening dew and fruitful moisture, that it may yield increase for the use of
Man and Beast, which should make us to admire his goodness: and on the other
side, to tremble at his displeasure, who once did open the floodgates of
Heaven, so as to overwhelm the World of the ungodly destroying all that
breathed, those only excepted which were contained within ^he compass of one
Ark: where also we are ^o admire his patience, who thus long forbeareth
sinners, being continually provoked; al^hough he has not only floodgates of
Rain and Water but also storehouses of Hail-shot, mortal Thunderbolts,
treasuries of Fire and ^^imstone* etc. whereby he could in a moment many
thousand ways avenge himself of his Enemies.

5. Consider, that as that ground is near unto cursing, which drinks of the
dew of Heaven, and receives the Rain, and yet (...) forth no increase: so that
case is dreadful, when the Heavenly dew of the Word falls continually upon
the heart, and yet it remains altogether bar^en and fruitless to^a^d God.

6. Consider also how the Lord gives snow like wool, c^ste^h forth his Ice
like morsels, ^^^^ereth the ^oar^ first like ashes. In this Air are to be
admired the hideous claps of ^^under, the dreadful flashes of lightening,
whereby the Lord shows his Almighty Power and Majesty: and as he made show of
these terrible things in the delivery of his Law; so even common sense may
teach us, that he will be much more dreadful, when he calls to account the
impenitent transgressors of his Law; yea, we should consider, that the same
reverence is to be yielded to Him, when he speaks in the soft still voice of
the Gospel, which was due unto his voice, when it was attended with thunder and
lightning.

7. Learn to acknowledge Him in the different change of weather, be it
seasonable or unseasonable, and to call upon Him, and give Him thanks, as the
cause requires.

8. Let the Air, filling all empty corners in the World, in a wonderful
manner, leaving no creek nor crany in any degree not filled, put thee in mind
of the infinite presence of God, who fills all in all, and through all: And
thus much for the second Day.

CHAP. V. Meditations on the third Days work.
SECT. I.
I Proceed to the third Day, which with us is usually called Tuesday, wherein
the Waters were gathered together in one place, and called Seas, and the Earth
was dried and clothed.

1. On this Day then, thou have special occasion to admire and magni^y the
wisdom of God, in foreseeing what was fit for the use of the Creatures; his
goodness in ^ffecting it, and his Power in crossing and controuling the first
order of nature for this purpose. Consider this day, how all was Water; no sign
of Earth, no Mountain, no dry Land appearing: and then on a sudden, by the Word
of God, the Waters rouling together into one place, called Seas, and there
abiding. And here consider what wonders are in this deep, what numberless
swarms of Fishes swimming and floating up and down: of which af^erwards on the
fif^h Day.

2. Consider, how admirable is the Power of God seen in bridling the Waves of
the Seas, and by his invisible, but most mighty hand, holding them, in that
they shall pass no farther. And thus also does the Lord restrain the Enemies of
his Church, both Devils and wicked Men, who otherwise would soon bring down a
deluge of misery upon the people of God, and swallow up his little Flock: and
therefore, as when thou see the Waves beat furiously against the shore, as if
they would return to their old place again; thou do not fear it, because the
hand of God keeps them in: so when thou see the rage of the Enemies against
the Church at the highest, yet remember, that the Covenant which God has made
with his own people, is as a strong Bar against their might and malice.

3. Wonderful is the Lords Majesty set fo^th by the greatness of the Seas,
bordering upon so many Nations, and compassing the E^rth about, yielding by
means of Navigation a speedy intercourse between those Countries which are far
distant from each other.

4. Wonderful it is in the secret passages which it has, whereby it sends
forth Waters into the Cranies of the Earth, which in diverse places break out
again in sweet and fresh Springs, losing the saltness which they brought from
the Sea; and then by the conjunction of many Springs, making Rivers, and
emptying themselves again in the Sea, Eccles. 1.7. So also we, who receive all
from God, should return all to him again. It were a monstrous thing in nature,
for a stream to wheel about, and come home, and sink into its own Spring again,
not emptying it self into the Sea from whence it came. No less monstrous is it,
but much more common, for us to run thus in a Circle, and to reflect wholly
upon our selves, to aim at our selves, our ease, our credit, carnal
contentment, and not seriously and effectually to bend our hearts and thoughts,
to direct our aims, to employ our gifts and talents of several kinds, for the
honor and glory of the giver. A sin that will fall most heavy at the last day,
if not repented of, and forsaken. How can we cross and oppose the Lord more
(who made us for himself alone) than when we make our selves only to aim at our
selves? These Rivers run into the Sea, yet is not the Sea indebted to them, nor
over-filled by them: when we have done all that we can for God, yet are we
unprofitable servants; we cannot give him a recompense answerable to that which
we have received; much less deserve any thing at his hands.

5. The pe^pe^ual course of these streams and Rivers fed by a living Spring,
should put us in mind of that Well of Living Waters, even the Fountain of
sanctifying grace, which Christ by his spirit shall cause to arise in the
hearts of the faithful* never to be dried up again: and such must our graces
be, not like a little rainwater, filling the Cistern, and soon dried up, or
drawn out, but like a Spring that gives a continual supply. And as many
Waters, which now glide along, and show themselves in the Valleys, had their
first rising in the Hills; as it is said, that the R^ine, the Rhene, and the
Poe, three great Rivers of Germany, France, and Italy, have their Springs in
those Mountains called the Alps; so those streams of grace, which are to be
seen in the low Valleys, even the conversations of humble Christians, had their
beginnings in that Mountain of holiness, and came down from the Father of
lights.

SECT. 2.
NOw then, the dry Land, the huge massy Body of the Earth appears, the Waters
being put up in one place; and here,

1. You may think of huge Mountains, deep Valleys; in the bowels of it, veins
of gold, silver, brass lead, iron; and consider, that these things which the
World esteems most precious, and for which many thousands cast away their
precious Souls, are laid up by God in the lowest and basest part of the
Creation, buried under ground. And therefore, though in these we should admire
the wisdom, goodness, riches of their Maker, yet at the other side, we must
take special care, that we do not let them steal away our hea^^s from him, who
made both them and us. That brazen Serpent which Moses made by the Lords
appointment, was a Sacrament unto the Is^aelites, who had f^lt the Fiery Venom
of those Serpents in the Wilderness; but the Pe^ples sin in aftertimes made it
a danger^us Id^l, and so a Neh^shtan or contemptible piece of Brass, 2 Kings
18.4.
as Hezekiah called it: so God has created these metals, etc. and has given
them their natures, beauty, qualities, for ou^ use and his glory; but if we
give that affection to them which we owe to him, we make them Idols, and are to
remember, that they are but a brighter kind of de^d Earth, and that the meanest
Soul in the World is of more worth, than a Mountain of Gold: and therefore it
is a notorious indignity to the Father of Spirits, and Maker of all things, if
we prefer one of his meanest works above Himself. Again, it is reported, that
those grounds which abound with Gold and Silver, are barren in bringing forth
living Plants; as Trees, Herbs, Grass, etc. So the heart that has a golden
Mine, or a vein of Silver running through it, is barren in bringing forth any
lively fruits of holy obedience.

2. But the Earth is without all ornament and clothing, now that the Waters are
removed; neither did it bring forth one poor grass or herb, or any other thing,
until the working and All-mighty Word of God laid a new Commandment upon it.
Let the Earth, etc. And therefore do not think, that the Earth has this virtue
to bring forth of it self a yearly increase, but that it would have layen like
a dead unprofitable lump, without any thing growing upon it in the most
seasonable time of the year, had not the Lord bidden it; and in bidding it,
enabled it to bring forth. Consider then with thy self, that every years
increase, every crop of Corn, every Tree, every Grain every Seed, or Fruit of
any Tree; every Grass and Herb, which the Earth beare^h at any time, i^ came
undoubtedly out of the Earth, by virtue of this Sovereign command of God: yea,
as well the propagation and succession of these, as the first Creation, comes
from his word: for so he said; Let the Earth bring forth the Tree bearing fruit
after its kind, and the Herb bearing Seed after its kind, and it was so. And
therefore give all the glory to Him for these things, from whom all things are
received: by whom the Earth is made fruitful, and yielde^h an increase. Let us
lament the unthankfulness, the pride and blindness that is among us. Do we not
murmur (many of u^) if we have not as much as formerly we had, as if now we
could plead custom with God, and challenge it as a due, because we have had it
so long, as if we could accuse him of withholding our right, when after many
years of abundance, we are a little stinted, and have now somewhat less. Is not
this great blindness? Do we not know that by our fall in Adam we forfeited all
our ^ight to these things, and that the Lord might justly have fed us no
otherwise than some condemned wretches, with a poor p^^tance only to prese^ve
life, that our mise^y might be the greater. All our right to these things was
but by his free grant, this grant was but conditional, the condition of this
grant we brake, where then i^ our Plea? Are we better than Jacob? O Lord, I am
less than the least of all thy mercies, says he. Is not this great pride, that
Men should think themselves not well used (as it were) at the hands of God; and
that they deserve better dealing. If thou had thy desert (whosoever thou
art) thou had felt more misery long agone, than any ever felt upon the
Earth: and this every one may seemingly acknowledge, whose heart God has
touched: Is it not great unthankfulness thus to requite the Lord? because thou
have enjoyed so much plenty heretofore, thou should now much the rather with
patience endure some scarcity: because thou have received good, thou should
with more s^bmission bear some evil, or want of that measure of good, as Job
reasoned with his Wife. Nay, if many were put to it, I am persuaded, they could
not say in their consciences, that ^ver they did pray for this blessing
feelingly and effectually: and is it not a shame for thee to murmur against the
Lord, for not giving that which thou never did effectually ask? Nay, if we
should consider the ho^rible abuse of Gods Creatures by all sorts; rich and
poor, we may justly wonder that the Heavens are not long since hardened into
brass, and the Earth into Iron against us.

3. Among these Plants observe* how weeds and other hurtful things do grow of
themselves: but the best and most useful must be carefully planted: so sin and
corruption springs naturally out of the evil soil of our hea^ts, but grace
and holiness are of the Holy Ghost his Plantation. Again, barren Trees are cut
down by the provident Husbandman, that they may not cumber the ground as you
see in the Gospel, which should move us by bearing fruits unto God, To work out
our own Salvation with fear and trembling. The leaves of an outward profession
are not sufficient, but to them must be joined the fruit of a sanctified
conversation. The Tree, and every branch and twig thereof, receives sap* life,
nourishment from the Root. Every true believer receives heavenly life and
grace from Christ Jesus. So long as the Branch is joined to the Tree, and so to
the Root, it receives benefit and refreshment from the Dew and Rain; but if it
be cut off from the Tree, the sweetest showers cannot preserve it from being
withered. He that is truly united to Christ* as a Branch to the Root, by the
spirit and faith, he receives benefit, growth, and spiritual refreshment from
the outward means of grace, the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments. But if
he be not truly united to him, the sweetest dew that ever fell from Heaven,
cannot keep spiritual life within him: on the other side, though the Branch
does receive life and nourishment from the Root, yet it wants refreshment
from the showers of Heaven: so those Fanatical dreamers are to be condemned,
who pretend an union with Christ, and partaking of his Spirit, and therefore
brag they have no need of the Word preached, or any outward means. Again, let
the renewing of the face of the Earth by these Creatures every Spring, put thee
in mind of the wonderful efficacy of God his Word, which from the beginning
unto this present time has made the Earth thus fruitful: and let it teach
thee to rely upon his truth and promise in other things, as well as this.

CHAP. VI. Meditations on the fourth Days Work.
SECT. 1.
FRom the Third* I come to the Fourth day, which we usually call Wednesday,
which was the first day that had a Sun to give it light, to which were added
the Moon to rule the N^gh^, and the Stars to attend her; which glorious work of
a most glorious God should raise our thoughts to some holy meditation.

1. Now consider on this Day, how that as the Waters, which were before
dispersed all abroad upon and about the Earth, were on the third Day gathered
into one storehouse, called Seas; so the light, which was before diffused,
through the huge spaces of the Creation, was now (as it were) drawn together
into one Body of the Sun, as a full and common treasury. Consider here, that
the Lord, who is in himself infinitely more bright than the light it self,
needed no light in respect of himself: and therefore it was for us, that he
made the light: and we should bless him for it: so in regard of himself, he
needed no word, nor revelations of heavenly mysteries, being infinite in all
knowledge and wisdom; and therefore it was for us, that he gave his Word to be
a Light, and caused by his Spirit the bright beams of holy truths to be cast
abroad into the dark World: therefore we may conceive, how shameful our sin
and unthankfulness is, that we must be entreated to turn our eyes toward this
light, and to come to Church to hear the Word, whereas (if need were) we should
beg a place in the house of God upon our knees, rather than go without this
light.

2. Consider, that although the Lord was pleased to give light to the World,
yet there needed no Sun whereby to do it: witness the light of the three first
Days, wherein no Sun shined: so when it pleased the Lord to give the light of
Heavenly knowledge to his Church, yet he needed no Books, no written Word to do
it by: witness those two thousand years, and more from the beginning of the
World till Moses wrote the Holy Text, by inspiration of the Holy Ghost: and
then consider, that as after the third Day, the Sun was made to give light to
the World, which before was illightened without a Sun; so after many hundred
years, the Lord placed the Books of Moses, and then other Holy Writings, as a
Sun in the Firmament of his Church, to give light unto the same: And, as after
the Sun was made, Men had no want of that light, which was given without a Sun
in the former three Days: so you may consider, that now the Books of Scripture
are written, and the light of Gods truth plentifully shining in them, there is
no need of unwritten Traditions to give light unto us in any way or work of
God: and therefore conclude, that the dotage of the Papists, in pleading for
unwritten Traditions (now we have the written Word) is as gross, as if a M^n
should complain for want of that wandering light of the three first days, now
when ^he ligh^ is fully seated, and firmly fixed in the body of the Sun.

3. Consider, that as one Sun gives light to the whole World: so one Word to
the whole Church scattered throughout the World. And here see the absurdity of
some unsound ones among us, who being more than half Papists, are not ashamed
to condemn the study of those worthy writings of many foreign Divines, upon
this poor pretense, because they lived in other Kingdoms and Commonwealths;
and so their Doctrine does not so well suit with our State and Kingdom. As if
the same Sun could not serve all Nations with light; but that we must have one
in England, and they another in France, etc. So if the Sun of holy truth do
shine in the writings of these holy Men, why cannot we see and walk by this
light, as well as outlandish Men?

4. Consider, that the light is still like it self; that light which was before
the Sun, is of the same nature with that which now is in the Sun: so the truth
and word of God is still the same, not contrary to it self. The light of holy
truth, which was before the Word* written, and this which shines in the holy
Scriptures, is the same: and therefore the Papists, are yet more shameless,
when under pretense of the unwritten Word, they thrust upon the Church such
idle forgeries, as are contrary to the Word written, as if light could be
contrary to light; or darkness might be called light. If the light of the
written Word does show us, that marriage is honorable among all Men, and
therefore not only among the Laity; then know it is no beam of this Heavenly
light, which makes Men think they see much sin and shame in it, when it is used
by the Ministers of the Word, but that it is even a dark vapor of the
bottomless Pit; and so S. Paul says, it is a Doctrine of Devils. If the Word
written, by its light do show the worship performed to Images to be gross, and
shameful Idolatry, then that Doctrine which commends this as a special point
of devotion, and condemns to the Fire those that refuse it, cannot be any
beam of light issuing from the Word of God unwritten, but rather a dark shadow,
caused by the Prince of darkness: so you may think of many other Popish
fopperies. The Seas, the Trees, Grass, Herbs, etc. which were on the third Day,
appeared to be of the same color, by that light which then was, without a Sun,
as th^^ did afterward by the Sun-light: so those thin^^ which by the word
written are now (...) to be white or black, lawful o^ ^^lawfull, did appear so
also by the light o^ ^he Word, before it was written.

5. Consider also, that as the Lord could have given light without a Sun* and
yet being pleased to make a Sun, does also require, that we should see by this
Sun: so the Lord, who could have given us knowledge without a word preached,
and have taught us immediately by his spirit being pleased to set up the
Ministry of the Word, and to teach us by it, does req^ire that we should learn
and profit by it. And therefore we must not think that we may neglect the Word*
because God can teach us without it: we must be taught as God will teach us;
and not as he can, but will not. God spoke immediately to Saul from Heaven,
condemning his cruelty against the Church; but yet sent him to a Man to learn
what he should do. The Lord strikes down a sinner with the apprehension of his
wrath for sin, but sends him to Men, even to the Preachers of his Word, to
learn what he ought to do. And therefore they, who in regard of knowledge
despise the preaching of the Word, and think it needless, may as well despise
the Sun in regard of outward light for the eye of the Body, and think it may
well be spared.

6. Again consider, that as the Sun in his circuit, passes from East to West;
so the light of the Word issuing by the special providence of God from the
East, has come toward the West. It is probably thought that Adam was created
in the Eastern parts of the World, to whom the Word was at first delivered.
However! it is certain, that Jerusalem is Eastward, whence the Law did issue,
and the Gospel proceed unto these Western parts: and now toward the end of this
great Day of the World, this light is bending toward those poor Western
Barbarians of America.

7. Again* as the rising Sun is most looked at, being especially welcome after
the dark Night, and not so much regarded at Noon, though then it shines
brighter: so the Word Preached is most affected ordinarily by a People at its
first coming; but afterward^ through their great corruption and unthankfulness,
it seems stale unto them, although there be an increase of gifts in the
Preacher, and the truth shining brighter to them in his Ministry than at the
first. If you find this in your selves, let your hearts smite you for it, and
be earnest with God to renew your affections to his Word, that you may gather
an appeti^e by feeding upon this Heavenly Manna, and not like the carnal
Israelites, begin to loath it, and to lust for grosser food, because this has
been so common. Consider, that as any Man well in his wits, accounts it a
blessing to have the Sun once in 24. hours, so should any one who is wise unto
salvation, and taught of God, account it a blessing to have the word twice in a
week, although it be the less regarded by earthly spirits, because it is
ordinary.

8. Moreover, think with thy self, that as he that is stark blind cannot see
the light when the Sun shines most brightly: so he that is in natural
blindness, cannot rightly see the divine virtue, and saving excellency of the
Word; therefore call upon God with the Psalmist. Teach me O Lord, open mine
eyes, etc. and make no great account of the judgment of such in spi^i^u^l
things* who are worldly wise, or learned, but unsa^ctified: Think rather, that
as no Spectacles can make that eye to see that is altog^ther blind* so no help
of humane lea^ning, natural sharpness of wit, etc. can make that Man that is
spiritually blind, rightly and savingly to discern spiritual things. If there
be some light in the eye, though but dim, it may be helped and furthered by
such outward means: so if there be some light of the enlightening sanctifying
spirit* and ^he mind, then th^se outward helps of secular Lea^^ing, Arts,
Tongues, natural quickness of wit, etc. may be of great and excellent use, and
must not be despised.

9. Again consider, that as there is great difference in the cleerness of the
light, between such a Day, when the Sunbeams are intercepted by a thick Mist
or dark Cloud, and then when it shines brightly through a clear Air: so when
the light of heavenly truths was dimmed by a thick mist of Jewish Ceremonies,
when a Cloud was in the most Holy Place, even before the Oracle and Ark of Gods
presence, when the Vail was whole, and not rent asunder, the means of grace
were not so clear, the mysteries of grace not so plainly unfolded by many
degrees, as now since our Saviors coming, when there are no impediments; and
this should stir thee up to thankfulness; every Sun-shiny day should make thee
lift up a thankful heart with feeling affections to the Father of lights for
that clear light of the Gospel which now shines unto thee in the Church. And
as there is a great difference between the Sun in an Eclipse* and the Sun free
from such Eclipse in his full glory; so should thou think there is a great
difference between the Gospel now clearly preached since the reformation, and
the Gospel much darkened by Popish mists, by humane Doctrines, yea Doctrines of
Devils in the time of Popery. And whenever thou see the Sun Eclipsed, lament
the miseries of those times: and when thou see i^ freed from the Eclipse
again, bless God for the happiness o^ these last hundred years. And as the Sun
is not in a moment freed from the Eclipse, but by degrees; so was it in the
reformation, by the Ministry of Walaus, and his followers, of W^ckliff and his
fol^owers, then of John Huss, of Hierom of Pragu^, of Luther, and Calvin, etc.
And therefore think how vain the Popish objection is; Luther and Calvin did not
agree, therefore both were Heretics: the Sun was not so folly freed from its
Eclipse, than in Lut^e^'s beginnings, as afterward; and the difference was no
more than between the Sun in some degree freed from the Eclipse, and the Sun
more cleared and fre^d. Again consider, that the Sun is Eclipsed by the body of
the Moon, coming between it and our sight: so the light of Gods Word is Eclpsed
many times to many of us in particular, by reason of the World, and the things
of the World, which are changeable like the Moon coming between it and our
affections: so that our hear^s embracing and cl^aving to earthly things, have
the Earth standing in their light, and Eclipsing he light of the Word.
Therefore if you will see clearly by the light of the Word, you must remove the
World out of the way, put ^he Earth out of your heart. And as Zacheus f^und
himself too low, when he stood upon the ground, and therefore went up into a
Tree, and stood above the Earth, that he might take a view of Christ: so that
you may clearly see Christ Jesus, you must not stand, much l^ss crawl and
grovel upon the ground with an earthly heart, cleaving to the dust, and glewed
to the Earth, but must get up above the Earth, in the height of an heavenly
spirit, seeing the Earth below thee, and accounting it but as an heap of dung
which thou treadest under thy feet; and refusest to lay in the bosom of thine
affections, or to set it before the eye of thy Soul.

10. Consider, as the light of the Sun is offensive and displeasing to sore
eyes, which rather delight in a dim Air, so consider that the reason, why the
light of Gods Word preached, is so displeasing unto many, is because of the
carnal distemper of their hearts, whereas to a sound heart it is most
delightful. And consider, though the light of the Sun be pleasing to a g^od
eye, yet the sharpest sight may be dazeled by its brightness: so the light of
heavenly mysteries in the Word: is of that surpassing excellency, as to
overcome the cleerest apprehension of any sanctified Christ a^.

11. Consider, as the light of the Sun is accompanied with a cherishing heat
and warmth, whereby the Creatures on earth are refreshed, and made to grow;
yea, whereby life is ingenerated and preserved: ^o the light of the word is
attended with a Divine operative warmth and virtue of the blessed spirit,
whereby the new life is ingenerated and preserved in the hearts of the elect.
Again, as the Sun by its coming in the Spring, renueth the face of the earth,
and makes such a difference in the world, as if it were a new world: so when
the Gospel was preached abroad in in the world by the Apostles, it made a
wonderful alteration in the world, even as if it had been a new world:
insomuch, that the heathens themselves, and enemies observed it, as Demetrius
told his fellow smiths (speaking of Paul and his fellow Apostles) these be the
men that have turned the world upside down. Ah wonderful change! when those
idol Gods should be hated as wicked Devils, and lying spirits, which before
were thought worthy of all reverence, when Demetrius his Diana shall be set at
naught* and his wa^^ out of request, which before were so highly set by: when
the name of one God shall be glorified throughout the world, whereas before
many Gods were worshipped even in all parts of the world.

12. When the Sun is up men do both arise and perform the business and works of
the day: so when the gospel is preached, as it has been with us a long time,
we must think it time to rouse up our selves from the beds of security, and
awake by repentance out of the sleep of sin and impenitency, and to being forth
fruits answerable to the gospel, and the means of grace. Consider how unseemly
it is in this daytime to go naked without putting on Christ, to come abroad in
the light with the loathsome rags of our natural pollutions, to be still in
bed, to be busied in our night-works of darkness; to behave our selves no
otherwise than those who never saw the light. Oh detest those courses of
idleness, swearing, whoring and drunkeness, etc. as most unseemly in the day,
most unfi^ for the light; put away the works of darkness, and put on the armor
of light.

13. Consider also, that as the Sun at the same time and in the same place
hardens one thing, and softeneth another: so the word is a means to soften
some hearts, and an occasion (though not a cause) of greater hardeness to
others: as the Sun killed* some things by its scorching heat, and quickneth
other things; so the word is to some the savor of life unto life, and to
others the savor of death unto death. Many other meditations may you gather by
comparing this excellent creature of God with that more excellent word of God.

SECT. 2.
NOw let us compare the Sun with Christ himself: he is called the Sun of
Righteousness, of whom it was said, that he should arise with hea^ing in his
wings, Malach. 4 2.

1. The coming of the Sun gladdeth the world: oh how joyful was that news,
when the Sun of righteousness was reported to be risen upon the earth, when the
Angels said to the Shepherds; behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy,
which shall be to all people, Luke 2.10. Oh how happy is the soul of a
Christian, when after a night of natural blindness, after a stormy night of
errors in the conscience, this blessed Sun rises upon the soul, shines upon
the heart, dr^veth away clouds, darkeness, guilty fears, di^^rustfull th^ughts!

2. As the Sun is sometimes hidden, so sometimes Christ does withdraw the sense
of his gracious presence from his beloved. The spouse in the song of songs
sought long ere she could find him, when once he stepped aside. As the S^n
returning makes the earth which was benumbed in winter, to spring and bring
forth fruit again: so when Christ is effectually present and united to the
soul, he causes a spring of grace and fruits of the spirit to arise in that
soul. Let the Meditation hereof move thee to lament thy barrenness, and cry
with that blessed Martyr at the stake; Son of God shine upon me, shine upon my
soul; heal it, quicken it, make it fruitful to thy glory. It is an argument
that they are far from Christ, who bring forth no fruits pleasing unto God, but
yet remain in a carnal estate.

3. Consider also that those fruits are most sweet and pleasant commonly which
grow toward the Sunrising, and have the morning Sun to ripen and bring them to
perfection: so the zeal and obedience of the Christians, who lived presently
after our Saviors resurrection in the primitive Church, and in the times of
the Apostles, was most excellent: and so the graces and obedience of such as
remember their Creator in the days of their youth, and consecrate the first
f^uits of their time unto God, are exceeding pleasing and acceptable unto him.

4. When the Sun sets at night, and leaves us in the dark, we doubt not but
that he will return again: so when Christ seems to withdraw himself from a
faithful soul on which he has cast the sweetest beams of comfort and
refreshment: let such a one know for his comfort, that he will rise again: this
night will not always last, though it be a long Winters night, a tedious time
of desertion, yet a dawning; yea a perfect day will follow it, when the face of
Christ shall shine again upon it. Again, as the Sun never so sets, as not to
shine at all, but when it sets to one part of the world, it arises to
another: so Christ never withdraws his light from the whole world, but
although he removes from one nation, yet he shines upon another; he has a
Church in all ages.

5. Again, as among those fruits which grow in the earth, such as grow most
toward the Sun, are sweetest; such as are most in the shade, are sowrest: so
among those Christians which are united unto Christ, those who have more free
and constant communion with him, partaking most of his spirit, keeping more
close to him than others, they bring forth most sweet and savoury fruits of
obedience, their services have a more pleasing and heavenly relish of the
spirit in them, than theirs; who though they partake of some life and warmth
from Christ, yet have it in aless degree, and are less careful to remove such
things out of the Sun as hide the face of Christ from them. Therefore this
should move us to draw near unto him, to dwell wi^h him, to walk i^ the light
of his countenance, then should we esteem his love to be better than life; so
should we delight more in him, and both we and our services would be more
pleasing to him. Ephesus was charged with the decay of first-love; surely this
decay of heat had never been, but that she had withdrawn her self from the Sun;
she did not keep so close to Christ as before: perha^s the world did get
between Christ and her heart, and kept off the heat, and thereupon she cooled.
And as you shall see some ag^d person, whose blood is cold, to stand in the Sun
for warmth; so let us close with Christ Jesus, come home to him, that we may
receive heat from him; and let us be more watchful that we step not aside from
him in time to come.

6. As the Sun is able more effectually to thaw and melt the frozen ice, than
many thousand men with axes and bettles: so the presence of Christ, and his
love manifested to the soul, and shed into it, is more effectual in melting an
hard frozen heart into sound godly sorrow, than a thousand threats or terrors
of the law. Therefore let not an afflicted soul put back the hand of God
tendering unto it the offers of grace in Christ-I^sus, because it is not yet
sufficiently humbled; but so long as its conscience bears witness, that it
seeks not mercy for a cloak of sin, but for a motive to obedience, let it
with confidence apply the promises, knowing that the apprehension of the love
of Christ shining upon the soul, is of all other the most ready and the most
excellent means kindly and sweetly to melt and soft^n the heart, and to conform
it to the will of God: this will make it yield, and fit it to receive any stamp
of grace, that now it will be like wax before the fire, that will be molded as
it shall please the hand of God. Therefore do not stand back from Christ,
because thou art sensible of too much hardeness in thy heart, but rather come
to him; that this hardeness may be removed, and thy heart may melt at his love.

7. Let the glory and excellency of the Sun make thee to admire the infinite
glory and excellency of its Maker: if the Sun cannot long be look^d on with a
steady-eye, oh then how does God dwell in that light which cannot be approached
unto, who can stand before him? (...) Angels may well hide their faces at his
presence; where then shall man appear in the rags of his pollutions? Oh learn
to contemn all the glory of the earth in comparison of his infinite excellency,
who made the Sun it self of nothing, which is more worth than the whole earth,
and all its golden mines. Learn to humble thy self before him, whose eyes are
ten thousand times brighter than the Sun, who knows many more faults in us
than we can see in our selves, be we never so watchful, who is greater than our
hearts, and knows all things. Let it not seem incredible unto thee, that God
should be every where present, and see all things in all places, seeing the
Sun, which is one of his Creatures, and but apart of his fourth day's work,
does at once shine many hundred thousand miles, if you reckon how his light
reaches downward from heaven to earth, and that Northward, Southward,
Eastward, Westward; yea from heaven to heaven: for, when it is on the other
side of the earth, it shines on the Moon on this side the earth, and causes
it to shine; yea it shines upon every tree, upon every little grass, and does
(as it were) in its kind, look upon the smallest thing. Is it then to be
doubted, that God, who can make a thousand Suns as excellent as this, with a
word, should be in all places at once, and see all things at one view? Even
reason may teach us, that it is more strange, that the Sun being a Creature,
should shine so far, and on so many Creatures at once, than that the Infinite
God should be thus every where present, and see all things. Yea, thou may
assure thy self, that as the Sun is not polluted with the loathsome puddles and
dunghils on which it shines; so neither is the Lord by filling all places,
even there where are the greatest pollutions. He is no farther from happiness
in Hell than in Heaven; for himself is Hi^ perfection and excellency, from whom
no degree of happiness can be taken.

8. Consider also the swiftness of the Sun, which is beyond the thought of man:
wonderful is the work of God in this regard, if we consider what an huge
compass the Earth has, and then how the heavens are above the Earth, so that
the Sun in twenty four hours does not only go round about the Earth, but also
round that huge compass between Heaven and Earth. I cannot conceive, but that
it must needs go many hundred thousand miles in one hour. Now, is it not easier
for God to be every where at once, ^han for the Sun to make such a speedy
course? yet notwithstanding, the time of thy life goes as fast as the Sun it
self; for it carries about, thy time, thy days, thy years, thine age with it.
Oh consider every time thou see the Sun in his race, my life runs along, and
keeps pace with this Sun, a thousand times faster than any Eagle can fly in
the air; I sit still, but my life runs post; I am idle, but my time is every
moment in a speedy course; nay, I go backward when my time runs forward: woe
is me, that I grow less careful in hastening on in my journey; that I linger
that I go out of the way, when my days are carried away upon the wings of the
Sun: oh call to God for quickening grace, that the spirit of God may lift thee
up, and carry thee on in a far more speedy course of holy obedience. When thou
thy self lackest means to pass away the time, or hear others complain in
this regard, look up to the Sun, and think with they self, does not the Sun go
fast enough? surely time goes along with it, and never laggeth one inch behind
it; is it not a madness then to call for more help to drive it forward? Is
there not much more cause to labor by all means to make have after our time
which we have already lost, which has long since outrun us? let us take time
to bewail our loss of time, and be ashamed any more to complain of it, as if it
were too slow-paced.

9. Consider, that as the Sun is not the Author, nor cause of darkness, when
he takes away his beams from us, but the darkness follows upon his removal;
so God is not the Author of sin or blindness, when he most justly denies his
light and graces to the unworthy sons of Adam, but that sin follows
thereupon: glorify his perfect purity, and do not conceive one thought against
him, so as to enwrap him with thy self in guiltiness; but say with the
Psalmist; The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
Thus much for the Sun.

SECT. 3.
NOw follow the Moon and Stars. The Moon, which is appoin^ed to rule the night,
is a Creature where we may behold the glory of God, though more dimly shining
than in the Sun.

1. Here see God's wisdom and goodness in mitigating the darkness of the
night, that when the Sun is out of sight, yet we should have a Moon to give us
some, though not so great a light; and if both be sometimes absen^, yet then we
have the Stars to make some abatement of utter darkness. How wonderful was the
Lord in his works, who was pleased not only to give us so great a light by day
but also to set up candles for us in the Heavens in the night time? even so
should we think also how the Lord deals with his servants, if he take away
the Sunshine of comforts from them, even fullness of joy, yet even then he
leaves some Moonlight or Starlight at the least; some glimmerings whereby
they conceive some hope, and are (though not much cheered, yet) supported. Be
thankful for the least degree* and wait patiently for a greater measure* seek
to him, stand not in thine own light, let not thy soul refuse comfort: or if
there be no Moon or Stars to be seen, by reason of the clouds, yet I am
persuaded, that in the darkest night there is some little degree of light,
though not scarcely to be discerned by us; yet I do not think it is ever so
dark as in those three nights before the Sun was made: so in the greatest decay
of grace, the greatest darkness of spiritual desertion, when there is scarce
any degree of spiritual life, grace or comfort to be discerned; yet in every
true Christian, who once was made a new Creature, there is some degree; and it
is not with him, as it was before the Sun of righteousness was risen upon him;
there is not that utter darkness that was upon his soul, while it was in that
more confused chaos and heap of unregeneration.

2. The Moon in respect of the Sun, is as the Church in respect of Christ; the
Moon borrows her l^ght of the Sun: so does the Church her graces,
righteousness, and all her happiness of Christ* the Sun of righteousness. What
a poor Creature is the Moon! how dark is it when the Earth comes between the
Sun and her! how empty would the Church be of all light, grace, comfort, if
Christ should be hidden from her! when the Moon is most enlightened by the Sun,
yet there are some dark spots to be disce^ned in her: so when the Church is
most replenished with the beams of this Sun of righteousness, viz. the graces
of Christ-Iesus, yet she has her spots in this life, which shall never wholly
be done away until the life to come, when she shall be presented by Christ to
the Father* not having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing: and therefore, to
imagine a Church on Earth free from all blemishes, is, to fancy a Moon without
spots.

3. As the Moon having received light from the Sun, gives light to others, so
that they see by the light of the Sun shining in the Moon, and then reflecting
from the Moon upon the Creatures here below: so the Church, and every true
member of it, having received the light of heavenly knowledge and
sanctification from the Sun, must cause this light to shine before men, that
they may see his good works, and so be moved to glorify his Father which is in
Heaven; yea, to glorify Christ-Iesus, who is the Sun from whom the light which
shines in their hearts, is derived and received. And to be wholly dark, and
void of the fruits of holiness, is an argument that we have no communion with
Christ-Iesus: you must therefore shine to others by an holy Example, that they
which will not see by the Sunshine of the word, may yet see by the Moonlight
of their lives derived from this Sun.

4. Again, as thou see the Moon to shine in a very dark night; as it cannot
choose but shine having received light from the Sun; so in the midst of a most
crooked generation in evil times, in places that abound with children of
darkness, and works of darkness, a Christian must not forbear to shine in
holiness, having received light from Jesus Christ.

5. The Moon cares not, though thee vish persons hate her light, because it
discovers their works of darkness; neither does she cease to shine because
the dogs bark at her: so a Christian having received light from Christ, must
not care though the wicked are offended at that light which shines in his
life, whereby their contrary practices are discovered the more clearly to be
hateful works of darkness: neither must he cease to show forth this light,
because the doggish tongues of wicked railers and scoffers be moved against
him: keep on in thy course, as the Moon does all this while, and let thy light
shine before men, that even the night-Walkers and Children of darkness may be
converted and convinced by it.

6. As the Moon by being Eclipsed, does show that the light it has, is not its
own, but is received from the sun, in as much as the body of the earth coming
between the sun and it, is seen to take away her light; which if she had of her
self, she needed not to look toward another for it: so also the Eclipses and
intermissions of the Acts of grace and motions of the spirit in a Christian, do
oftentimes make it manifest to himself, and sometimes to others too, that the
light which he has is not of himself, but received from Christ, at whose
pleasure it is either imparted or denied. Therefore learn thou to work this
good out of that evil, even by thy failings to see thy emptiness, and to give
glory to him by whose free grace thou art what thou art.

7. Again, as the Moon is unconstant, and full of changes, and yet still
receives some light; so the Church has been in an unconstant unsettled
condition, is full of changes, yet never without some light: she is sometime
waxing, sometimes waning; sometimes flourishing in grace, and in the purity and
plenty of the word preached, like the full Moon; and then again declining, then
again renewing; so that though the Moon be always visible, yet is she at
sometimes but darkly visible; so the Church is always visible unto them who have
eyes to see her, but at sometimes she makes a dimmer appearance than at other.

8. Moreover, as the Moon when she is in conjunction with the Sun, does then
shine less unto us, than when she is in opposition, one half space of heaven
distant from it; for when she is joined with the Sun, she is at the change; but
when there is this diametrical opposition, she is at the full: so when Christ
was here in the flesh conversing with the Church, it was then but in a mean
condition, even in the change from Judaism to Christianism; so that now
presently it became a new Moon, changed from a Jewish Synagogue to a Christian
Church: but in short time after his ascension, through his spirit abundantly
poured down upon it, when there was a diametrical opposition between Him and
It, then it was at the full; and therefore he told them aforehand, that it was
expedient he should go away from them, and then he would send the Comforter,
even his blessed Spirit, whereby they should be made to shine more brightly in
knowledge and graces than before whilst he was with them.

SECT. 4.
THe Stars also, those glistering pearls of the Orb of heaven, are notable and
bright evidences of an infinite and most glorious Creator; every one does set
forth his praise, even as if the heavens had as many Tongues as Stars to
proclaim his excellency to the Earth.

1. Admire him therefore in the numberless multitude of the stars; admire him
in their constant and orderly motions: admire him that tells the number of
the Stars, and calls them all by their names. Think of the star that guided
the wise men unto Christ, and pray that the day Star may rise in thine heart.

2. Consider how bright the Stars shine in a cold night, and think how thy soul
should shine in grace in time of adversity.

3. Consider that neither Moon nor Stars do carry any special brightness in the
presence of the Sun; and though the Moon be seen. yet she shines but dimmely,
or not at all; but the Stars are not apparent: so the Church in general has no
excellency in comparison of the Excellency of Christ: and as for the particular
members, they are like stars after Sun rising; their beauty is scarce to be
discerned.

4. Remember our Saviors comparison, who calls the Ministers of the Church,
Stars which he holds in his right hand. Rev. 1. and therefore think, that as
the Stars are the ornaments of the heaven, so are faithful Ministers the
ornaments of the Church, and not esteemed by Christ, as they are by the world,
the offscouring of all things.

5. Consider those Comets or Blazing-stars; though they make a greater blaze
than the true stars of heaven, yet were they never fixed in the heavens, and
therefore are soon extinguished: so those hypocrites, that make but a blaze for
a time, they were but Meteors wandering in the air of unstable affections, not
fixed in the Church, nor engraffed into Christ.

6. As the stars are numblerless; so are the heirs of glory, though far short
of the reprobates: let the hope of a glorious condition like that of the stars,
make thee heavenly-minded, and teach thee to comfort thy self in God, who has
provided such great things for thee.

CHAP VII. Meditations on the fifth Days Work.
SECT. 1.
COme we now to the fifth day, which with us is usually called Thursday; the
story of which days work we have laid down in Genesis 1.20, 21, 22, 23. Wherein
the waters were furnished with fishes, and other Creatures that live there; and
the air with fouls, and such creatures as live in it.

1. Here consider, that after those four days, when the heavens were furnished
with lights* and the earth beautified with plants springing out of it by virtue
of the word of God; yet all this while there was not one creature throughout
the whole Creation, that had sense, or power to move from place to place; not
one fly, or the least thing moving in the air; not one fish swimming throughout
the seas, rivers, or other waters; not one worm creeping on the earth* here
then admire the wonderful power and wisdom of God, who on the fifth day by his
All-commanding word filled the air with multitudes of Creatures flying there,
the waters with abundant of fish^s swimming there: this was done even in a
moment. Consider what numberless swarms there were both of fouls and fishes
brought forth on the fifth day; whereas the very day before, there was not one
of any kind to be found in any part of the Creation. And as the wisdom of God
joined these two sorts of creatures together, so he made in many respects a
special affinity between them; as the fouls are covered with feathers, so the
fishes with scales: as the fouls move in the air, so do the fishes in that
element which comes nearest the nature of the air: as the fouls have wings to
fly withal, so the fishes have ^innes whereby they swim; and that is a
motion very like to that of flying: yea some of either kind do communicate with
each other in their element for, as we have water-fouls, so there have been
flying-fish in great abundance: so that here you may magnify the wisdom of
God, who in the day that these creatures were made, did imprint upon them such
properties and qualities, as should be evidences to the end of the world in
some sort, that they were but the work of one and the same day.

2. Consider here, that as the Lord has appointed the fouls to fly in the air,
and the fishes to swim in the sea, confining each to his own element for the
general, though some few particulars be suffered to live in both; this should
teach us to walk within the compass of our callings, and not to think we shall
mend our selves in a different element, or another kind of course, without some
special cause. Some few may have some special warrant to change their callings,
as Amos to leave his flock, and teach the people; and Peter to leave his nets,
and fish for men. These had an immediate call from God; and so I dare not deny,
but that in case of great necessity, when the Church is destitute of able
Ministers, some well-studied in the Scriptures, and experienced in the
mysteries of grace, may take upon them the office of the Ministry, being
lawfully separated unto that function: yet this will prove no more that every
one may at his pleasure run from the shop to the pulpit, than it will follow,
that all the fishes in the sea may fly up into the air, because some few do so.
And this should especially ^each Christians, who are called unto holiness, to
take heed how they leave their element. They are bidden to walk in the spirit,
even as birds fly in the air, and in this element they must keep: for as the
air gives breath unto the fouls that fly in it, so the sanctifying spirit
gives the new life unto those that walk in him; the waters would choke and
drown the fouls if they should fall into them: so sin is that which endangereth
the spiritual life, when a christian falls into it. The air gives a speedy
flight and motion to the Birds, whereas the waters would wet their wings, and
cause them to move but slowly if they fall into it: so the spirit, when a
Christian walks in it, carries him along with winged-affections, and sets
his heart in a speedy motion upon the things of God, making him ready unto
every good work; but if he fall into sin, which is like the waters of the dead
sea, that Lake of Sodom, his heart is like a bird drenched in water, his
affections are deaded, his heart moves but slowly; yea many times he lies for
dead, and there is scarce any motion of the spirit to be discerned in him. And
as in such cases, a foul had need of more than ordinary means to help, as to be
held over a warm fire, etc. So a christian, that he may recover his wings
again, and have his heart spiritually affected, and enlarged toward God, had
need of special humiliation, special meditation, p^aier, and other warming and
quickening means to raise him up.

3. As the air gives breath and motion, so also it gives support to the
birds, The Beasts find no support in the air, but sink to the earth.
and it carries them even as the earth does the beasts, which go up and down
upon it: so does the spirit also give support unto all that are born of the
spirit. They are kept by the mighty power of God through faith unto salvation.
If it were not ordinary, it might seem strange, that the air which none can
see, being so thin a substance, should carry so many millions of souls as there
are in it flying up and down; wonderful is the power of the blessed invisible
spirit, who supporteth so many thousand christians by his sanctifying virtue
against all the powers of darkness.

4. As these birds do now live in the air, so were the fouls created in the air
at the first: so whosoever walks in the spirit, was also born of the spirit;
he had his beginning in this element.

5. Consider, that as the Birds, although they live and move in the air, yet
they come down to receive some refreshment from the earth: so the Lord allows
his children to receive some nourishment from the earth, and to partake of its
refreshments; yet so, as they must not delight in the earth as in their
element, nor in the things of the earth as their chiefest contentment: but like
the birds of heaven, having supplied their necessities, must be ready to soar
aloft again, and not in their affections be still grovelling here below.

6. You see how sparingly the birds take of the water; a bird does not drink
like a beast, it rather sippeth: so should a christian sparingly use the
pleasures of this life; rather sipping like the bird, than swilling like the
swine. As for those that give themselves to drink down iniquity like water, and
to commit sin with greediness, they are none of those who have their
conversation in heaven; nay, those that glut themselves with earthly pleasures,
knowing no better contentments than in such things as please the senses; the
appetite* the eyes, ears, taste, etc. They are none of those that are born up by
the spirit of God above the earth. Consider how little contenteth one of these
creatures, and then learn to be ashamed that thine appetite is so much beyond
thy necessity, and practice mortification. As far as we can guess, the birds
take more delight in flying and singing, than they do in feeding, and therefore
they have soon done with this: so should a christian be more delighted in
conversing with God, in walking in the spirit, in running the ways of his
commandments, than in serving the necessities of nature: yea, it should be his
meat and drink to do the will of God, as it is a delight to the bird to sing
and soar aloft. Again, as the bird uses not these things, so as to make her
unfit to fly; so a Christian must not abuse meat and drink, so as to clogg and
dull his spirits, and make him more dull and dead in the service of God; but so
to refresh himself, that he may be the more cheerful and lively in his heavenly
flight.

7. As the Bird not sowing nor gathering into Barnes (as our Savior tells
us) yet is fed by our heavenly Father; so should a child of God depend upon his
providence without distrustful ears against the providence of God, though not
without moderate and christian cares, which serve the providence of God.

8. As the Bird having found somewhat to satisfy its hunger, by its chirping,
calls others to partake with it: so should christians cheerfully invite
others to partake with them of those things that God has given them, and not
like the hog, grunt and wrangle at any that feeds near them.

9. As the Bird does not so much as light upon the ground without the
All-guiding providence of God, Mat. 10. So should a christian learn to depend
upon the providence and protection of God, who is of far greater price in the
esteem of his heavenly father, than many sparrows: know certainly, that thy
hairs are numbered, and that none of them can fall to the ground without thy
heavenly Father.

10. Consider, that as when the Bird flies highest, it takes least notice of
earthly things, and is least moved with them, and affected toward them; so when
a Christian is most raised in spiritual affections to the greatest height of
heavenly-mindedness, keeping nearest heaven, then is the earth farthest out of
sight, and he is least moved with the things here below, and best able to
contemn earthly vanities: he is too far above these to be much affected toward
them. Therefore this should make us think of the exhortation of the Apostle,
Mind the things which are above: and this should teach us to help our selves
against earthly affections and fleshly lusts. Think with thy self, what is the
reason that I am so earthly-minded, that my affections are so engaged to this
or that in the world, yet I cannot come off, nor free my self, that I can
scarce persuade my own heart to be without these and these things; it is this,
because my heart is not carried aloft; it draws too near the ground, it
withdraws too much from God: if I should keep up my heart closer to God,
these things would be out of sight; the earth would seldom be in my thoughts,
at least not so as to work much upon my affections. On the other side, you see
that those Birds which use so much upon the ground, they fly but softly, as may
be seen by those that use about our houses: so also those Christians, that are
much taken up with the dealings and business of the world, they fly but softly,
have but slow affections, and sluggish motions to the things of God; they go
but coldly about good duties: and therefore we should pray for a greater
measure of the spirit to bear us upward.

11. Consider also, that as the Bird can mount up into the air, and yet light
upon the earth too, and receive some refreshment there; whereas the Beast
cannot mount up and live in the air: so a Christian can, and may partake of the
natural comforts and refreshments of this life, though in a moderate manner and
measure, as well as the natural man. But the natural man cannot mount up to
heaven, cannot live in the air, cannot live by the spirit, he has no relish of
spiritual things. The spiritual man judges all things* he can discern what is
in nature, but himself is judged of no man, his excellency cannot be discerned
by the eye of nature.

12. Again, as the Birds live in a stormy element, and feel much alteration of
weather, heat cold, winds, etc. as the air is the most unsettled of all other
parts of the Creation: so Christians do live in a condition subject to manifold
alterations, subject to many storms of persecution, and temptation. And as the
Birds are then especially in danger by snares and ginnes, when they are upon
the earth; to which they are not subject, when they are aloft in the air; so a
Christian is then in danger to be ensnared and entangled when he deals with
earthly things, and is most affected to the things below: when he is most
heavenly-minded, then is he most out of danger of these snares.

13. The Birds in the air meet with Birds of prey there also, which are ready
to seize upon them, and destroy them: so the Devil, who is called the prince
that rules in the air, does especially choose to assault those that walk in the
spirit, even then when they are most spiritual, endeavoring to pull down those
that are highest in the favor of God, as David, etc. therefore special
watchfulness must be used by such.

14. As the Birds are of all other living Creatures, the most cheerful: as they
are highest above the earth, and nearest heaven: so should a Christian labor
of all other men to be most chea^ful, and replenished with heavenly joys, as he
is nearer heaven, and farther from the earth than others: God is infinite in
all goodness and happiness; and the nearer to God, the more happy, and the
greater cause of cheerfulness. As the Birds are most cheerful in a clear
sun-shiny day: so is a Christian, when the light of Gods countenance shines on
him. As the Birds sing most cheerfully after a sweet refreshing shower; so
should a Christian go away most cheared from the word of God, when it has
distilled upon him as the dew of heaven. As the Birds are merry in the spring;
so a Christian is, when there is a spring and increase of grace in his soul,
and a nearer approach of the sun of Righteousness, and a special warmth of Gods
love is shed abroad into his heart. As the birds by chirping do set others on
singing, and many join together in consort: so one christian should draw
another by example to yield up sweet songs of praise to God, and many should
join together with one spirit to glorify the Lord. As the Birds sing, although
they know not where to have their next supply of food: so should a Christian
labor, out of the providence, love, and promise of God, to gather matter of
cheerfulness and contentedness, even then when he sees no special means for
supply in outward things. Moreover, as the Bird sings although she be in the
Cage; so a Christian must rejoice in his afflictions, and like Paul and Silas,
sing in fetters: as it is reported of the Nightingale, that she sets her
breast against a thorn to keep her waking, that she may not through sleep cease
to sing: so a Christian must even enforce himself to spiritual watchfulness,
and use special means to keep his heart awake, that he may show forth, and sing
out the praises of God, even in the night; that is, at such times when others
sleep in sin, and care not to honor the Lord. Finally, as a bird prefers
her liberty in the Wood or Hedge, before a dwelling in a princes palace, where
she has her meat continually brought unto her: so a Christian prefers that
spiritual liberty, whereby his heart is freed from the fetters of sinful lusts,
above the greatest earthly estate in the world, with thraldom under sin, and
want of an enlarged spirit.

SECT 2.
WE might also speak of many particulars among the Birds.

1. The Stork may teach children their duty toward their parents; of which it
is said, that as the old nourishes her young, so the young nourish the old
again; a lesson which many children have not yet learned, though this
unreasonable Creature teach it. So the Turtle may teach conjugal love between
Husband and Wife, these (as it is reported) being so so constant and entire
unto each other. The Pelican may teach special love of Parents toward their
children, who is said to feed her young wi^h her own blood; especially, it may
make us with all thankfulness and holy admiration to bless Christ Jesus for his
unspeakable love to us, who gave his body to be meat indeed, and shed his blood
to be drink indeed, whereby we might be fed, and live for ever. The Ostrich, in
leaving her eggs in the sand, and not considering that the foot may crush them,
is an image of careless unnatural parents, who use no Christian providence in
behalf of their children.

2. As those Birds of Prey, and ravenous fouls, make use of that advantage
which they have in height and strength, to seize upon diverse things here below;
so many oppressors, and greedy worldlings abuse that advantage which they have
in wealth and power, to seize upon the estates of others that are below them,
and not able to make resistance. And as those ravenous Birds are of all other
the most hateful; so these greedy and over-bearing oppressors do carry the
curse and de^estation of the Country with them. Again, as some Birds hate the
light; so some men, in love to the works of darkness, cannot endure the light
that shines in the Ministry of the word, or in the conversations of the Godly.

3. Consider also, that as the fouls do gather and cherish their young ones
under their wings; so the Lord does shroud his children under the wings of his
protection: and as the little ones are thereby safe against the ravenous Birds;
so the Godly are thus sheltered against cruel enemies and manifold dangers. As
the young ones are cherished and refreshed by this means with a kindly warmth;
so the godly are wonderfully refreshed in the bosom of Gods love, with a
lively and most comfortable warmth from the presence and favor of God. And as
the young ones, after a storm, are apt to stray abroad, and play about in the
sun again, until the Kite be ready to seize upon them: so the Children of God,
in time of prosperity, are apt to withdraw themselves from that near communion
with God, until that Prince of the air flying all about, and seeking his Prey,
do fall upon them with some dangerous temptation.

4. As the Birds are affrighted and driven away from the corn when one of them
is killed, and hanged up there for terror to the rest. So should men learn by
others punishments to abstain from things forbidden. Gods judgments upon many
swearers, drunkards, oppressors, adulterers, scoffers at godliness, railers,
persecuters, unnatural children, etc. should skare away others from those sins
which have proved so deadly and dangerous to the former. When Herod's carcass
was eaten up with worms, it was a fair warning to all the enemies of Gods Word
and Ministers, such as Herod was. And He that not long since hanged himself in
this parish, after he had continued long in a course of railing against the
Minister that then was, may justly be thought to be hanged up by the special
providence of God, as a dreadful skare-crow to all other tongues set on fire of
hell in the like kind.

5. Again, we may here think of Solomon's comparison; as a Bird, when it is in
hand, may soon make an escape, and never be seen again: So Riches get
themselves wings; says he, Riches vanish away many times like a Bird in the
air, and the owner can never catch them nor come near them again: if the father
hold fast, the son lets them fly; or if the son be as sure of his hand as the
father, yet the next heir lets go his hold; or the Lord himself by some
special judgment or other cutteth the string, and they are gone; especially
when men get wealth as ^oulers catch Birds with snares, nets or ginns, by
unlawful means, or too much niggardly sparing. This should teach us not to make
much account of these things, much less to purchase them with the loss of
everlasting life.

6. In a word! we may here consider the wonderful wisdom and excellency of the
Lord, in the abundant variety of these winged Creatures, in the beauty of many
of them, in the swiftness of many and most of them; the variety of kinds, of
colors, of quantity, of quality. And to those we must refer those lesser sorts
of creatures, viz. Bees, Flies, Wasps, Hornets, Locusts, Caterpillars; yea, the
least Gnats, or whatsoever flies in the air; all which might yield us much
matter of meditation and admiration. Gloriously does the wisdom and goodness of
God appear in the little Bees, which are said to have their King whom they
follow and obey, which out of many flowers suck that which they digest into
honey, and set it into such a frame of the Comb, as no wit of man can make the
like. This honey, as sweet as it is! yet every child of God must get such a
spiritual relish, that like David, he may find the word of God more sweet than
it. And as the honey is both pleasant and nourishing, (...) is the word to that
soul which has a spiritual appetite. But in one respect the Be may put thee
in mind of the nature of sin, which carries honey in the Mouth, but a sting in
the tail: therefore we should hereby learn not to be deceived with the seeming
sweetness which sin brings at the first, but to beware and tremble at that
venomous and smarting sting which it leaves behind. Again, as flies are most
busy in the sun, so are temptations in prosperity: and as the flies are apt to
light upon that part of the body where there is a fore; so is Satan wont to
assault the soul where it is weakest, and to take advantage of those
corruptions that do most prevail in in the heart. And as when flies are beaten
away, they come again very speedily; so when Satan's temptations are resisted,
and put back, another swarm of flies is at hand, other temptations are ready to
assault: and of this especially, Christians have experience when they are
pestered with blasphemous thoughts cast into their minds by Satan: against
which they must take comfort, in that by the power of the spirit they are
enabled to renew their resistance, even as the assaults are renewed.

SECT. 3.
THe other sort of Creatures made this day were the Fishes, wherewith the sea
and rivers were wonderfully stored: Admirable were these works of the Lord, and
his wonders in the deep; and it is thought, that of all sensible creatures in
the world, there is the greatest numbers of fishes; yea, and some kinds of them
of the greatest Bulk and bigness of any other creature that lives and moves;
their abundance appears in the story of the Creation, Genesis 1.20. And God
said, let the Waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life;
and ver. 21. it is said, the Waters brought forth abundantly. And again* v. 22.
Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas. He says of the
fouls, let them multiply; but he does not say, let them fill the air, as he
bids the fishes to fill the Waters. And as the Lord gave this extraordinary
power of multiplication to the fishes of the sea, so they enjoy this grant of
his unto this day; and as may be seen by the rows of fishes, they bring forth
thousands at once, insomuch that it has been used as a Phrase of speech, To
increase as the Fish, employing an extraordinary increase. Here admire the
wonderful goodness of God, in providing so abundantly for us; not only by
these Creatures, which we daily see walking in the fields, or flying in the
air, but also by an innumerable multititudes of fishes covered under water*
abounding in the seas and rivers.

SECT. 4.
1. THe greatness of some fishes is as admirable as the multitude. Pliny in his
Natural History reports, that about Arabia have Whales been found six hundred
foot in length, Plin. Not. Hist. Lib. 32. cap. 1.
and three hundred and sixty foot in breadth; so, that if his report be true,
the length should seem to be above the sixth part of a mile, six hundred foot
making two hundred paces, and a thousand paces making a mile. Howsoever! the
greatness of these fishes is admirable, as the experience shows of our
Merchants daily trafficking toward Greenland to take them; and they are far
greater than any other living creature in the world, which should make us to
magnify the admirable power and infinite greatness of him that made them. Oh
Lord our God, how wonderful are thy works in all the world! And the holy Text
it self takes notice in special of this creatures greatness, Genesis 1.21. God
created great Whales. Admirable it is in these fishes, that whereas the Beasts
and Birds cannot live, if they be kept any long time under water: These on the
other side, cannot live unless they be under water. So whereas a Christian
lives by the spirit, and it is the life of his life, and the joy of his heart
to partake of the spirit, and to be conversant in the ordinances of God: on the
other side, it is even death to a Carnal heart to be exercised this way, and he
thinks not himself a free man, until he is let loose from these. The fish,
though it live, yet it is not lively, but lies almost for dead when it is in
the open air out of the waters: and the natural man, though he be alive, not
yet dead, yet is he not lively, but like one as good as dead when he is taken
out of his element, and restrained by any means from his beloved sins, and tied
to holy duties in public or in private: He has no life in these things, his
heart is dead toward them.

2. And as the fish living in the salt waters remains fresh, so a carnal man
living in the Church, and in the midst of the means of grace, remains in
his unsavory natural condition, not having the salt of mortification, whereby
to eat out his corruptions and dead flesh, and make him an acceptable sacrifice
unto God (as it is said, every sacrifice must be salted with salt) though he
live under the word, yet he carries no relish of the word in his heart and
life. Therefore we must not only look what means we have, but how these means
do work upon us, whether we be transformed into the word: for a man to imagine*
that he is therefore a Christian, because he hears Christ preached, is as
idle as to say, the fish must needs be salt, because it lives in the salt
waters.

3. Again, in that the Lord feeds such innumerable multitudes of Fishes in
the waters, by what means we cannot imagine: so should we be confident that he
will provide for us, though the means as yet seem to be hidden from us: for,
though some of the greater fishes do feed upon the lesser, yet it cannot be
imagined, how such an admirable number of them should be continually supplied;
but the Lord All-sufficient opens his hand of bounty, and fills them with
good things.

4. Wonderful is the work of God in the strange variety of kinds, in the
strange shapes of these creatures: insomuch that it is thought there be few
Beasts on earth, but that there be fishes in the sea which resemble them: so
they speak of sea-calves, sea-horses, etc. Wonderful strange are the properties
of some fishes, Plin. Not. Histor.
which the Al-mighty Creator has given them. Pliny speaks of a little fish
like a great snail, which by cleaving to a Ship under sail, and driven with
strong winds, will stay it, that it shall not be able to go forward; and that
even about his own time, the Gally of the Emperor Caligula was held fast by
one of these against the uttermost endeavor of four hundred Mariners with
their Oars. It were strange, that a Man of his dignity and place in the
Commonwealth, should expose himself as a laughing stock to the Common people
in reporting so notorious a lie concerning a thing done in his own time, and
his own country: Therefore for my part, I conceive it to be true, and being
supposed to be true, how wonderfully does it set forth the admirable power and
wisdom of God! and in this particular example it is to be thought, that the
great God did purposely befool the madness of this arrogant Emperor, who would
take upon him to be God, and required (among other people) the Jews also to
yield him divine honor: here now let this wretched man take notice of his own
Godhead, that cannot stir against a poor fish like a snail, with the help of
the winds, and four hundred Oars, when the true and living God shall appoint it
to stop his course. Wonderful also is that property given to the fish called
Torpedo, which, if it be taken with a Net, so soon as the Fisher takes hold of
the Net wherein this fish is, though he does not touch the fish it self, yet
presently, it is said, his hand will be benumed, and he shall lose the use of
it for the present, as if it were taken with a dead palsy. This is not only
reported by Pliny in the place forecited, Zabarel.
but Zabarel (as I remember) also discourses of that point in natural
Philosophy, showing how natural agents do agere per contactum, and brings in
this by way of objection. The wisdom of the Creator is notably seen in this,
and we may consider of it, that those who with Nets of fraud, and indirect
means, do fish for things of this life, their wealth proves to them like this
Fish; it works a kind of dead palsy in their consciences, which in such men
usually become seared and past feeling; it works a kind of dead palsy also
in their hands, which do not freely open to receive the necessities of others;
for, commonly they who are unjust getters, are also niggardly keepers; this
Tropedo in the Net, takes away that charitable use to which their hands should
be put; they come hardly by that which they have, viz. with the loss and
forfeiture of their own souls, and therefore are loath to part with it to
supply others.

5. The unseemliness appearing in some Fishes going backwards, should make us
consider, how shameful and unseemly it is for a Christian to go backward in the
ways of God, cooling in zeal, slackning his pace begun: the Lord says, If any
man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him, Heb. 10.38. We must
therefore stir up our selves with St. Paul, to reach and press forward toward
the Mark, and prize of the high calling that i^ in Christ Jesus, Phil. 3.13, 14.

6. You see the Fish by catching at the bait, swalloweth down the hook, and so
by the greediness in getting it, loses it self: this should put us in mind of
our carnal folly, who by catching at such things which Satan offeret, h
pleasing to our corrupt affections, are caught our selves, and take a ready
course to lose our souls by satisfying our lusts: let us not then so much set
our eyes upon the bait, but especially have our thoughts upon the hook which
lies under it.

CHAP. VIII. Meditations on the sixth Days Work.
I Proceed to the sixth and last Day of the Creation, with us usually called
Friday, wherein the Lord made those Creatures that furnish the earth, namely
the Beasts and creeping things, and then Man in the last place, as the Lord of
the rest. First of the former, those unreasonable creatures; for of Man I
purpose to speak afterward more at large* And in these creatures brought forth
out of the earth, the admirable power, wisdom and goodness of God is manifested.

1. Consider with astonishment, how in a moment, at the word of the Lord, out
of the dead womb of the earth issued multitudes of beasts, great and small, and
creeping things: Lions, Bears, Tigers, Unicornes, Horses, all sorts of Cattle,
etc. And that of a just size, every way in their several kinds for strength,
stature, and other properties. And here consider, that the least creature that
crawleth upon the earth, is a part of Gods own work; even every creeping thing,
as the Text says. And in these the Lords omnipotency appears, the least worm
being a work of an Al-mighty power; yea doubt not, but as the least are the
works of his hands, so the least are within the compass of his Al-guiding
providence. And if the least creeping thing be within the Lords care, and
receive its maintenance from him, Wherefore are ye doubtful O ye of little
Faith? Will God feed the worms, and let his children starve?

2. Wonderful is the strength, wonderful is the swiftness of many beasts;
wonderful is their variety in kind, bigness* quality, voice, etc. Consider the
wonderful strength and courage of the Lion; and then consider the excellency of
that glorious Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Christ Jesus, who (as the Prophet
says) travelleth in the greatness of his strengtb, and is mighty to save, Isa.
63.1. He is as a Lion unto his enemies to destroy them; Therefore kiss the son,
left he be angry; submit to Christ, lest he tear you in pieces as a Lion, and
there be none to deliver: He is as a Lion to defend his people against their
enemies; this Lion is too strong for that old Red-Dragon, and will crush his
head, and tread him under his feet. And as Sampson, having killed the Lion,
found sweet refreshment in the dead Carcass of the same, which occasioned his
riddle wherewith he posed the Philistines: Sweetness came out of the strong
one, and meat out of the E^ter* Judge. 14.14. So our Savior, this Lion of the
tribe of Judah, being slain for the sins of the world, yielded sweet
nourishment and refreshment to those who feed on him by faith; so that out of
this strong one comes sweetest meat for hungry souls: yea, as the Lion yielded
pleasant nourishment to him that slew him; so does Christ to the faithful, who
slew him by their sins: yea, many of those, who in a more special manner did
join in sheding his blood, did feed on him by faith, as appears by the fruit
of St. Peter's Sermon, Act. 2. Again, the Lords voice in the ministry of the
word, is compared to the roaring of a Lion. When the Lion roareth, who does not
tremble? When the Lord speaks, who will not prophecy? Amos 3.8. This voice
of the Lord should rouse up sleepy sinners from their pillows of deep security,
and make them tremble at the word of the Lord with an holy fear, and not
trample it under foot, nor cast it behind their backs with an hellish scorn.
Miserable is their folly, who are more afraid of the barking of Dogs, than of
the roaring of This Lion; more afraid to do those duties, which the wicked
scoff and rail at, than to do those sins which the Lord in his word forbids
and condemns upon pain of everlasting destruction.

Read at large, how the Lord in the book of Job, sets forth the excellency
of the Elephant, or Behemoth of the Unicorn, of the warlike Horse, and that of
purpose to overawe Job with an apprehension of his infinite Majesty, by a due
consideration of the excellency of these Creatures. These things were not
spoken to him alone, but to us also.

3. Consider what multitudes there be of cruel savage beasts in the world,
which the Lord so restrains, that they do not overrun mankind; which should
make us admire his infinite power in curbing them, his infinite-goodness in
preserving us.

4. Consider of what use many of these creatures are to us; especially those
which are most common among us. What supply of Milk do the Kine afford us? what
Fleeces of Wool do the Sheep yield us? what store of strong, wholesome, and
pleasant nourishment do their bodies yield us? and what labor is bestowed
about these? when we have eaten of these and are full; when we are clothed by
these and are warm, then should we take heed lest we forget God, of whom we
have received all.

5. Among other things, we should observe the Lords goodness in giving us
diverse of these creatures to do our work, to carry our burdens, to bear our
selves. What benefits do we daily receive by the labor of the Ox, plowing our
ground, and doing us necessary services many ways? How serviceable is the Horse
unto us, both for speed and ease; carrying us from place to place? wonderful is
the goodness of God in making these creatures, far stronger than our selves, to
yield to us; not using their strength to resist us, but to do us service.
Therefore we should not at any time use any of these creatures* but that we
should be moved to lift up thankful hearts to God for this mercy, which we
would think worthy of much admiration, if they were not so common among us; but
on the other side, we should think, the more we have of them, the more
thankfulness we owe to God for them.

6. Consider, that as a man has in him the senses of a Beast, and something
more excellent, as Reason and Understanding; so a Christian has Nature in him,
and something above Nature, even the Spirit of Regeneration. And as some Beasts
have some things in them wherein they excel man, as the Lion in strength, the
Horse in swiftness, etc. yet the meanest man is naturally more excellent than
the most excellent among the Beasts: so, though the children of this world do
in some things outstrip the children of light; as many times in beauty,
strength, wit, outward carriage, policy, civil deportment, etc. yet the meanest
true Christian is more excellent than his best carnal neighbor, in regard of
the Image of God restored to him.

7. Again, seeing the Beasts have those pleasures whereof the senses are
capable, this should persuade us, that these are not the most excellent
delights, but that there are purer, higher, more heavenly delights, which suit
better with an intellectual immortal soul: and this should teach us to bewail
our brutish affections, which carry us so strongly after sensual delights of
the eye, the ear, the taste, etc. as if we had no better souls than the Beasts.
Solomon says, The spirit of a beast goes downward, and the spirit of a man
goes ^pward, Eccles. 3.21. So it should be in our affections, our souls should
go upward, reaching toward the things above, and not go down-ward, enthralling
themselves to these sensual things here below, like the spirits of the Beasts.

8. As the Beasts do bear our burdens, so should we willingly bear those
burdens, and do those services which God requires. How would thou rage, if
thy Beast should continually fling and cast thee, and those things which thou
layest upon it! and are not we herein worse than Beasts that perish, when with
froward spirits we fling and kick at the Lords commandments, and do not
willingly and obediently submit unto them?

Of the Creation of Man.
CHAP. I.
Genesis 1.27. So God Created man in his own Image, in the Image of God Created he
Him, Male and Female Created he them.
SECT 1.
THe rest of the Creatures being made, the supreme Lord of heaven and earth was
pleased to make Man after his own Image, to be his Deputy here on earth, and
under him a Lord of the other creatures, which being a principal work requiring
special attention, the holy Ghost sets down the consultation of the Trinity
about it, and shows us how it was accordingly performed in these words, where
you may take notice of three things, which you may take as so many several
points of doctrine: I. That God created Man, II. That God created both Sexes,
Man and Woman, Male and Female. III. That God made man in his own Image.


For the first, that God Created Man: this is that kind of creature (as we have
said) partly visible, partly invisible; and so his Creation is to be considered
according to his several parts: first then, consider the creation of man's body,
and then of his soul.

The Creation of man's body is but briefly laid down, Genesis 2.7. And the Lord God
formed man of the dust of the ground; that is, his body: where, though the dust
of the ground be mentioned, yet I conceive that the matter of man's body was
tempered with the other elements, although the earth was that which bare the
greatest bulk, and made up the greatest part of the substance in the body.

Now to set forth the excellency of the Creator, it may not be amiss briefly
to consider of the notable workmanship of man's body, whereof the Psalmist
speaks, Psalm. 139.14* 15, etc. and in it may be considered, The general
frame, The particular parts.


1. In the general frame, is to be observed a notable and excellent temper of
body, consistin^ ^f diverse humors admirably composed and mixed together, and
fitted so, as to be a serviceable Instrument of the soul; this was in full
perfection when God made it, for we mus^ not judge of it according to those
distempers, whereunto the body now is subject; yet now in some tempers above
others there is some degree of evenness, which gives us a shadow of that
exactness that was at the first. But in that state of ^reation, there was not
the least defect nor disorder in the temper of the body, nothing which a man
could have wished to have been otherwise than it was; the constitution and
complexion of the body, and so the color and appearance of it was perfect and
exact: For as every thing was good in its kind, so man especially had his due
natural perfection every way.

2. As there was this perfect temper, and so an excellent constitution, so
there was a just and due proportion: the whole body had its just stature, and
every part its due measure: it was exactly shaped and framed; nothing wanting;
nothing exceeding; nothing beyond; nothing short of the due size. And this
exactness both of temper and proportion, made up the perfect beauty and
comeliness, which God gave to the body of man in his Creation.

3. In the general frame also, we may consider the upright and erected posture
of man's body, in which regard he was permitted to look up to heaven; and an
excellent Majesty was given him, as a Lord and Ruler over the other Creatures,
who were made to bow down their back in subjection unto him; and by the very
stooping of their body to do him homage, and acknowledge his dominion over
them: and thus much for the general frame.

SECT. 2.
NOw come we to the particular parts, and therein let us consider,

I. Those that are contained in the rest, namely the Blood and Spirits.

1. For the blood, you know it is an excellent part of the body, and of
absolute necessity, insomuch that the blood is said to be the life of the body,
which must not be understood directly, as the words seem to imply, as if the
life of a man were nothing but his blood, for that is not possible: if that
were so, then nothing could live which has no blood: but this is certain, that
Bees, and many other like Creatures have no blood, and yet have life: it would
also follow, that so many drops of a man's blood as he loses, so much he loses
of his life; whereas many times the evacuation of blood is the preservation of
life. And (that which is most absurd) it would follow, that a man's life might
be severed from him, and yet remain for a time after such separation: for so
you see, that the blood of men, and of other creatures, may be kept a long time
in vessels after it is severed from the body. And besides all this; the Angels,
who have neither blood, nor other bodily parts, have life in greater perfection
than a man.

Thus then we understand these places that speak of the the Blood, that it is a
special instrument of the soul, whereby life is convayed to the several parts
of the body by reason of the spirits, which are a kind of airy invisible
substance (yet bodily) arising like vapors from the purest part of the blood:
for although it be said, the life is in the blood, yet this is because the
blood is a thing which is more obvious to the senses than the spirits; and
again, because it is the nursery, and as it were the fuel of the spirits,
whereby (as by a precious oil) the lamp and flame of life is cherished and
maintained: so that life is more immediately in the spirits than in the blood.
Again, life is lost by the shedding of the blood, because the spirits (the
immediate Instruments of the soul whereby it communicates life to the body)
are extinguished by the shedding of the blood, even as the flame goes out when
the wood is qui^e taken away; and so in this respect also the blood is said to
be the life of the Creature.

Moreover, consider the spirits, whereof somewhat has already been spoken by
the way. These are called spirits, not, but that they are bodily substances*
but, because they have the least grossness in them of all other parts of the
body, and come nearest to a spiritual nature. And these are indeed the
immediate instruments of the soul, and being as it were of a middle nature
between the soul and body, they are a common tie or bond between them both,
uniting both together. These are of most excellent use in the body throughout
the parts, they convay life, sense, and motion to them all: they are in special
manner employed in the more retired and spiritual actions of the soul, in the
exercise of reason and understanding, in the serious thoughts and meditations
of the heart: by it the pain or delight of one part of the body is convayed and
imparted to the rest, and a sympathy or fellow feeling is derived from one to
the other; and in these the singular wisdom of the Creator is notably
manifested.

SECT. 3.
THe parts containing these, are in the next place to be considered; where
first, the Head is that which is set in the highest place, and is full of most
curious workmanship: it is the seat both of the outward and inward senses; and
as all the outward senses are placed there, so none of the five are to be found
in any other part of the body, except that of the touch or feeling, which is
the lowest and grossest of the rest. There is the Eye, of a singular and most
curious making, which is the instrument of seeing; the very window of this
house, that lets in light to the soul, which otherwise would dwell in a dark
dungeon. It is an admirable thing to consider, how by the wonderful power and
wisdom of God, all colors have his property to caff sorth a resemblance and
image of themselves, which by the air is convayed into the Eye: if this were
well considered and understood, it would be found one of the most wonderful
works of the Creation, setting forth the Creators glory. But ye may conceive it
thus: When a Looking-glass is held before the face, instantly there is an image
of the face in the glass: now the glass cannot frame such an image in it self,
for then it should be there as well when the face is turned away: wherefore it
must be of necessity, that the face does at all times in the light cast forth
an image of it self: and the glass does only hold it by reason of the lead at
the backside, whereby this image is stayed, and not suffered to pass through,
and vanish. And so does every thing that has color, cast forth an image of it
self at all times, which being received into the eye, presently the thing is
seen, and perceived by the eye: which is an admirable thing to consider, that
all things that are; Trees, Plants, Men, Beasts, etc. whatsoever can be seen,
do every way cast forth Images of themselves into the air, and that these are
severally and distinctly conveyed to the eye, and discerned by it.

There are the Ears, whereby we hear, which take in sounds and noises in a
wonderful manner: wherein also the admirable power and wisdom of God
appears, in that one voice issuing out of one mouth should enter in at many
hundred ears: for this must needs be granted, that we cannot hear any voice or
noise, unless it truly enter into our ears; for if the noise could be heard
without such an entrance, then were those open passages needless, which are in
the ears: but these open passages are as needful to let in sounds, as a door is
to let a man into an house: Now one man cannot enter in at many doors at once;
and so one voice remaining one, cannot enter in at many hundred ears at the
same moment; and therefore it must needs be multiplied in the air; and so that
which is but one in the mouth of the speaker, is manifold in the air, and is
taken in by many ears.

There is also the Nose, which is the instrument of smelling, another part of
the body, which serves us both for necessity and delight: it is a means to
prove the wholsomness or unwholsomness of many things which are good, and which
are hurtful to us, and yeildeth delight and refreshment in presenting us with
many pleasing and fragrant smells.

There is also the Tongue and Palate, the instruments of Taste, but especially
the palate or upper part of the mouth, the Tongue having another and more
proper use. This is a sense of greatest use for the nourishment of the body,
and so for the preservation of life; and this also yeildeth abundant matter of
delight and refreshment. Job says, Does not the ear try words, and the mouth
or palate taste his meat? Job 12.11. That is, does it not by tasting, try it?
for God has given this ability to the Creatures, to try what is agreeable to
their bodies, and what is displeasing.

In the last place, the Touch, or Feeling, is may rise again an incorruptible,
immortal, spiritual glorious body; like the body of Christ, at his coming,
through his mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.

SECT. 4.
IV. EVen this earthly frame of the body proves it an hard thing to put off
earthly affections, and therefore care and striving should be used in it. The
body being made of dust, it will return to dust again, not only in the final
dissolution, but also in the present inclination; it now leans to the earth,
and rests on the earth; Man is deeply in love with his own Element, and
strongly tied to it in his affections. It is said of one, that being one of
Three, who demanded of the Orracle which should be chief, and hearing that he
should be the man that first should kiss his Mother, he fell down and kissed
the earth, as accounting it the common mother of all; men are so in love with
the Earth, that they embrace it, and as it were, kiss it in their affections as
a Mother, out of whose womb they had their beginning, although the Oracles of
Gods word condemn this folly, and teach them, that thus doing, they shall be
least in the Kingdom of God, and that this doting love of the world is enmity
with God. Therefore we should pray earnestly to God, that he would change this
earthly temper of our souls into heavenly affections. How needful is it for us
to practice that of our Savior, even to forsake our selves; our selves being
earth, we must renounce our earthly selves, and deny our selves; for though we
could restrain our selves somewhat from outward earthly courses, yet so long as
we keep our earthly affections, our hearts will cleave to the earth. Special
cause we have to study that book of the Wise man throughout, which teaches us
the vanity and vexation of spirit that is in earthly things, and to see and
admire the treasures and riches of Gods Kingdom; that apprehending better
things, we may make better account of these.

SECT. 5.
V. IN as much as God made our bodies, we must yield up our bodies to his
service; for God made all things for himself, says the Scripture. He made not
the body for the Devil, nor for the world, nor for lust, nor for drunkenness,
but for Himself; let us well consider this, and learn to give God his due. The
Idolater will bow with his body to Idols, and say, that he keeps his heart to
God; but he must know, that God made the body as well as the soul; and if he
made all things for himself, then the body as well as any other thing. The
profane person, that abuses his Tongue to swearing, wanton, wicked
discourses, to railing, scoffing, etc. the Adulterer, which sins against the
whole body, as the Apostle shows the Drunkard, who abuses his body to excess
of swilling and drinking; the wanton that abuses his eye to careless wandering,
and opens his ear to vanity; he that pleases his palate* and loves his
pleasures more than God; he that thinks his body given him for no other
purpose, but either to drudge about earthly things, or to ^ast of earthly
delights; even such a one is apt to say, he has a good heart toward God. But
be not deceived; God made this Body for Himself; and therefore we must not
abuse any part of the Body to his dishonor, nor make any member of it an
Instrument of unrighteousness, but to give up the members of our bodies as
Instruments of righteousness unto holiness: let us not think a little pains of
the body too much to bestow in the service of God, in hearing the word, in
prayer, in humiliation, etc. but let us glorify God (as in our souls
especially, so) in our bodies also* for they are Gods as well as our souls.

SECT. 6.
VI. IN that God made the body, care must be used to preserve, and not to
destroy thine own body, or thy brothers: we must not pull down this tabernacle
which God himself has pitched, but must leave it to his disposing, using all
lawful means to keep it up, and to preserve it strong, until he please to
dissolve it: shun intemperancy and excess in things that please the appetite in
meats and drinks, etc. Use those means which God has given thee to repair this
house, which God Himself has builded for thy soul to dwell in. let the life
and body of another be precious in thy sight, and do thy endeavor to preserve
it. And let us know that in some case not to save life, is to destroy, viz.
when there is special means, calling and opportunity to do it; in times of
necessity some means must be used to prevent the famishing of many, therefore
at such times we should freely give without grudging, to the relief of others.
Remember that it is for the preservation of those bodies which God has made.
And let this keep thee from laying violent hands on thine own body: it is a
loud crying sin to destroy another body, because God has made it; but most
horrible to destroy thine own, since God has made it, and has given thee a
special charge to keep it.

Moreover, since God has made the body, let us rely upon Him for the
maintenance of the body: He has made it, and he will keep it: he has given a
mouth, and he will give meat; he has given a back, and he will cloth it: Thus
may a Christian, that has recovered his forfeiture in Christ, reason from the
love and promise of God. And therefore in hard times our wants should be
special motives to drive us home to God through Christ, that being in him we
might assure our selves of all needful supply for the body from his hand that
made it: there is not the poorest among us, but if they would effectually turn
to God, and depend upon him, they should find they have no cause to despair in
regard of bodily helps; they should find him supplying or supporting* and one
way or other providing for them.

SECT. 7.
VII. Has God made thy body upright, and looking up toward heaven? this should
teach thee to mind the things that are above, to be heavenly-minded. It is a
great shame that the body should look upward, and the soul and affections bend
downward to the things of the earth. There is many times an upright body, and
Curva interras anima, a Crook-backed soul leaning toward the earth: so that
whereas the soul should raise the body, and make it the better because of its
Union with an immortal Spirit, it rather pulls it down, and makes it the
worse, the more earthly and fleshly. An earthly mind makes the very posture of
the body raised toward heaven, to become hypocritical and counterfeit: since God
has given thee the body of a man looking upward toward heaven, do not take to
thy self the spirit of a Beast, grovelling on the earth here below.

VIII. Seeing God at the first gave man perfect beauty, in regard both of
temper and proportion: then let all defects or deformities which thou see in
any, not move thee to contemn their persons; but rather to lament the common
misery of man's nature fallen into sin; the fruits whereof do rather appear in
some particular persons in this kind, than they do in some others. And think
with thy self, that by the law of Creation, he that is most deformed, was to be
as beautiful as any that excels most; and he that is most beautiful by the
Fall was as subject to deformity as any other.

CHAP III.
SECT. 1.
MOreover, from the particular parts diverse Meditations may be raised.

I. As the Head is to the Body, so Christ is to his Church. Ephesians. 4.15.16.

1. As the Head is the Guide to the whole Body, so is Christ to the Church:
every member follows the direction of the Head: Christ is the wisdom of the
Father; and He, as he is made unto us an Head, so also is he our wisdom, our
guide and directtour: he is the great Prophet, He by his Spirit reveals the
mysteries of grace, and shows the way of life unto his Members, and all must
(...)

3. Neither does any member despise or scorn another, the eye does not scorn
the lowest member in the body; neither should any one whom God has raised
highest in gifts, calling, place, dignity, wealth, or any other way, scorn the
poorest and meanest in any respect; but rather seek their good, as being
members of the same body.

4. As the principal parts of the body have need of the meanest, so the
greatest in the Church have need of meaner Christians in many respects: if the
whole body were eye, where were hearing? Thus much for the first part of the
first point, viz. the Creation of man's body.

CHAP. 4. Of the Creation of Man's Soul.
I Now come to speak of the Creation of man's Soul; the story whereof is briefly
laid down in Genesis 2.7. And breathed into his nostrills the breath of life, and
man became a living soul. Where you must not conceive, that the Lord did breath
like a man; but the intent of the Holy Ghost (I conceive) is to show, that Man
had another kind of Soul than the Beasts or Birds: they were brought forth out
of the material Elements, but Man, though his Body were drawn out of the Dust,
yet his soul was in a peculier manner given him of God, and not composed of any
earthly, waterish* or aerie substance, but that it was a spiritual substance
immediately created of God: and further, this breathing in of the soul implies
(as may seem) that the soul was not first created without the body, and then
put into the body, but that at once it was both created and infused into the
body.

SECT. 1.
NOw let us here speak a little of the nature of the Soul, and then of its
powers and faculties.

1. For the nature of the soul, it is a spirit, and herein most like unto the
Angels of any other Creature; and though the wise man does communicate this
name to the life of a beast, yet he shows a great difference between these
two sorts of spirits, saying, The spirit of a Man, that goes upward; and the
spirit of a Beast, that goes downward. The spirit of a Beast (or that which
gives it life) vanishes, and dies with the body, being a principle that
rises out of material or bodily substances tempered and composed together: but
the spirit of a man being of an higher nature than any of these gross material
bodies, and not rising out of them, but being created immediately of God the
Father of Spirits, it goes upward: it is presented before the Lord in judgment
after its departure from the body.

2. It is such a spirit as can subsist alone of it self out of the body: so the
Apostle makes mention of the spirits of just men made perfect, Heb. 12. the
Spirits of the Saints now in heaven, whose bodies rest in the dust; and this
shows the excellent matter of man's spirit, far above the life of the beast,
or any unreasonable Creature, that it can subsist, when it is severed from the
body. This shows that it does not depend upon the body, nor was extracted out
of it, but rather that the perfection of the body depends on it: it can live
without the body, but the body without it, rotteth, putrifieth and mouldereth
away into dust. Dust returns to Dust as it was, says the wise man; and the
Spirit returns to him that gave it, Eccles. 12.

3. It is an immortal Spirit: so this very place shows, that when dust
returns to dust; when the body dissolveth, then the spirit lives, and
yields up it self into the hands of God. And so the Scripture shows both in
the case of the godly, and of the wicked; the one shall go into life eternal,
and the other into everlasting punishment.

SECT. 2.
IN the next place let us speak of the powers and faculties of the soul; here I
shall speak first of those which are common to it with other Creatures, viz.
those which they call vegetative and sensitive, which are found in the beasts
and birds. These I call faculties of the soul, although for mine own part I
concieve them not to be properly inherent in the reasonable soul, but rather in
the temper of the body: for the intellectual soul being a Spirit, I cannot see
how these brutish affections (such as many of these are) can be inherent in it;
especially because many of them, as the faculties of attraction, retention,
expulsion, augmentation, etc. are ordinarily exercised, not only without the
command, but also without the knowledge of the reasonable soul, which I know not
how it could be, if they were inherent in it immediately, it being a single,
spiritual and intellectual being. Now these faculties are many which the Lord
has given, and showed his admirable wisdom in them

1. Of the Vegetative part.
There is a nutritive or nourishing property; to which diverse others are
serviceable, as that of hunger and thirst, (which is properly a branch of the
sensitive) yet insensible Creatures, are a servant to the vegetative: for by
these the appetite is provoked to seek for nourishment.

There is a digesting faculty to concoct that nourishment that is received
first in the stomach, then in the liver turning it into blood, then in each
several part turning it into substance in particular. To these also belongs
these three inferior faculties.

Attractive, Retentive, Expulsive.
1. Attractive: whereby every part has a power to draw nourishment unto it
self* so the Head and upper parts of the body have a power to draw blood from
the Liver, which is far below them, as well as the lower parts* And in this the
wonderful wisdom of God is clearly manifested.

2. There is a Retentive faculty, or a power of keeping that nourishment a
convenient time till it may be so wrought upon, and perfected, as to turn into
one substance with the body, and to refresh its parts. But l^st nature should
suck poison instead of nourishment, or digest that into its substance, which is
hurtful,

3. The Lord has added for its farther security and benefit, an Expulsive
faculty, or a power of casting out such matter as is superfluous and
burdensome, and not fit for nourishment; whence come many fluxes from the Head,
and sweats over the whole body; besides those gross excrements whereof nature
is daily ^ased. In these also the admirable wisdom of God is manifested, and
when we enjoy the use of any faculty of the soul, we should glorify him that
made them.

Moreover, there is also a generative faculty or power of propagation, which
God gave to Trees, Plants, Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Men; blessing them, and
bidding them to increase and multiply.

SECT 3.
2. Of the sensitive part.
THere are both the senses and the affections: the senses outward and inward:
of the outward senses somewhat was briefly spoken, when we spoke of those parts
of the body that are Instruments of those senses. The inward senses are
conceived to be three: The Common Sense, The Fancy, The Memory.


1. The Common Sense, which is said to receive the objects of all the outward
senses, and to be seated in the former part of the Brain.

2. The Fancy or Imagination, which works upon those things that are received
into the former, and is thought to be placed in the middle part of the Brain.

3. The Memory, which keeps those things that are received in by the other,
and lays them up as in a treasury, and the seat of this is in the hindermost
part of the brain. And in this, most admirable is the wisdom and power of God,
that certain images of things long since seen or heard, should be laid up in
a corner of the Brain, and there preserved many years, and called to mind,
though they be the resemblances of many thousand several things. Some Memories
are far worse than other, yet even the meanest ordinary Memory is wonderful, if
we did rightly consider, that in so narrow a compass, the shapes and likenesses
of so many several things should be preserved: yea, even this is notable, that
the Images of so many men's faces as one man can remember, should be there
engraven in so small a table, as is the Memory.

SECT. 4.
Of the Affections.
AS for the Affections, they are seated in the heart, and these are many, as

1. Love, which is an affection of the soul, uniting it self to some thing
apprehended as good: for so whatsoever is beloved, Love.
either is good, or seems to have some good in it to him that loves it;
contrary to which is a second affection, sc. Hatred: Hatred.
and that is an affection of the heart shuning and separating it self from that
which is so hated, as supposed hurtful: for though good things are often hated,
yet there is an apprehension of evil in them; and if we speak of the affections
as created of God, then nothing was beloved but that which was truly good; nor
hated, but that which was truly evil. But of the integrity of the affections we
may speak, when we come to speak of the Image of God in Man.

Desire, is an affection of the heart reaching after some good thing which is
absent: Desire.
Contrary to which is Detestation, Detestation.
or abhorring of that which may hereafter happen, being conceived to be evil.
These two may be expressed by hunger and thirst on the one side, and on the
other, a loathing of meat in the Stomach, when the heart rises with dislike at
some thing which as yet is absent, but is tendered to it, or may hereafter be
presented to it. When our Savior told Peter that he would fall into that
fearful sin of denying his Lord and Master, his heart rose against it, and he
detested it: this was not only a simple and mere hatred of it as a thing evil,
which is directly contrary to love: but also a detestation of it, as an evil
that might happen, or was foretold should happen to him, though now he were
free from it, which is an affection contrary to desire.

In the next place is Joy, which is an affection of the heart, pleasing and
resting it self in some good thing Enjoyed. Joy.
In this affection there must be some good, [true, or seeming] in possession,
which does so affect the heart, as to rest it self with some contentment in it:
opposite to this, Sorrow.
is Sorrow, which is an affection of the heart, distasting some evil already
felt. Now I cannot see, how this affection should be exercised in the state of
innocense, because man had no cause of sorrow, unless it may be supposed, that
he knew of the Angels fall and rebellion against the Lord, which is not likely.
Howsoever! the faculty no doubt was then given unto man by the Lord, who
foresaw a world of woe and sorrow which man would fall into; who knew that of
all affections, this of sorrow could not want work, nor be idle for want of
matter to work upon.

There is also Hope, which is an affection of the heart, looking for some good,
or the avoiding some evil that is to come: Hope
for that which a man has already, why does he yet hope for? Contrary to which
is Fear, which is an affection of the heart, Fear.
trembling at some evil to come, or at the loss or missing of some good.

Then there is Courage, Courage,
which is as it were a degree beyond hope, and is a more assured expectation of
some good, or of the overcoming of some evil: contrary whereunto is
Desperation, a sinking of the heart under the expectation of some evil to come.
Desperation.


Anger seems to be an affection mixed of Sorrow and Hatred, which by
Tragedians is sometime called Dolor. Anger.
These I call faculties of the soul, because of their near union with the
spirit of a Man, and because the soul has some government over them.

CHAP. V.
SECT. 1.
BUt the most proper and peculiar qualities and faculties of the soul, are the
Understanding and the Will, and such as are seated in these, or compounded of
these.

The Understanding is the prime faculty of the soul, that guides the whole
man, The Understanding.
and gives light to all hi^ actions,

1. In it there is an act of discerning, whereby it sees into the nature and
qualities of things, knowing both those things more perfectly than the Senses,
which the Senses discern; and other things also which they cannot reach. And
this is that faculty whereby man is become acq^ainted with God his Maker, whom
no unreasonable Creature can discern. God is a spirit, and cannot be discerned
by any bodily senses, but by this spiritual faculty of the soul. By this the
Lord has made man able to search into the hidden causes of things, and to see
him in his works. By this he has enabled him to get the knowledge of Arts and
Sciences, of Trades and Dealings, etc.

2. There is an act of I^vention, by the working of the Understanding, finding
out many particulars belonging to some general, Invention.
and finding out, one by another like unto it. So in matter of Trades, God has
given this power of Invention to the understanding, whereby Trades are
perfected, and new additions of skill and art are added to them; and so in the
learned sciences.

3. There is Judgment, whereby the understanding passes its sentence, and
gives its determination upon things concerning their nature, Judgment.
truth and goodness.

4, There is a power of Discourse, proving one thing by another; this is so;
therefore it is so: the sun is up, Discourse.
therefore it is day: the days are lengthened, therefore the sun is past the
winter solstice, etc. None of these are to be found in any unreasonable
Creatures.

SECT. 2.
The will is another principal faculty of the soul, choosing or refusing freely
good or evil. The Will.
And as the understanding is (as it were) the eye; so the will is (as it were)
the heart of the soul. For although the understanding see never so clearly what
is good, yet unless the Will agree, and give its consent, it is not followed.
The Understanding is like one that gives good counsel, but if the will be
obstinate, it is not followed* He that knows his Masters will, and does it
not, to him it is sin; so that you see, a man may know, and not do. Now in such
a case, a man's understanding agrees with Gods Will; for he both knows what
God will have done, and knows it to be Good. But his Will crosses both the
Will of God and his own Understanding; which is the aggravation of sin, and
increases the Stripes. Now the Acts of the Will are in general two: To Will,
or to Choose. To Nill, or to Refuse.


Now in these two faculties, there are two others seated, as Free Will and
Conscience.

Free Will is a faculty of the mind, whereby the Will without constraint does
willingly choose or refuse what the understanding discovers to be good or
evil; for all the power of man cannot compel the will to embrace or refuse
what it will not refuse or embrace. The outward man may be forced against the
will, the Tongue may be forced, the Hand may be forced, but no Tyrant in the
world can force the Will. And hence comes that unmovable resolution of Gods
Children in the profession of the gospel, even from the invincible freedom of
the will, sanctified by the spirit of God; it is true! it is the spirit of God
is the cause, but the Spirit is pleased to make this use of man's will, and of
that liberty which he himself gave man at his Creation: Again, on the other
side, the will of man may be brought to cover its own inclination, and
outwardly be brought to conform to the constraining powers of others; but the
inward bent of it none can force a contrary way. Again, the will, by
persuasions, by reasons discovered unto it, by better informations may be
inclined to alter* but never violently turned by compulsion: when it is
altered, though the preparatives and motives of its alterations come from
others, yet the alteration it self must come from it self. I speak not now of
God's Act in renewing it by his Spirit, who being the Maker of the Will, has
that power over it, which no Creature can possibly have: yet the Lord will not
compel the Will (for that were to destroy it and make it no Will) but by
sanctifying and new-making it, he makes it willingly embrace that which it
shunned before, and resolutely to reject what it embraced before.

Now although the Fall of Adam did actually take away man's Spiritual life
consisting in the Image of God, and the Holiness of his Nature; yet it did but
forfeit for the present, and not actually bereave him of his natural life, nor
the natural powers of his Soul, by which he lived; so then there is no question
but man in the State of sin has free Will. But the question is, Wherein? I
answer, in things natural and moral, not in things supernatural and spiritual.
In natural things a man in his natural estate has free will to choose or to
refuse; in eating, and drinking; in eating or not eating; in walking or not
walking, etc. So in moral actions, a man in his natural estate may do many good
moral acts, and has liberty of will to do them; as to use abstinence, to
exercise temperance, to shun drunkenness, etc. yet with exception, that many
particulars through custom and company* etc, may be so enthralled to some
lusts, that the exercise of this freedom of will is even wholly smothered in
them, and cannot show it self, but is strongly clogged and kept down: but yet
that which their will chooses, it freely chooses still. But now on the other
side, it has not liberty unto spiritual and supernatural things. It may freely
entertain the use of outward means and ordinances, but it has not free power
to believe aright, to change it self, to purge it self from the stains of
nature; to repent, etc. All these must come from above: None but God can make
his Image in Man, when Man and Satan has defaced it. But if the Son shall make
you free, then are you free indeed. If the Son of God shall by his spirit of
liberty infused into us, deliver us from the thraldom of Sin and Satan, and
renew the Image of God in us, then are we free indeed. This which is, spoken of
free will, does not cross the sovereignty of Gods will, nor the certainty of
his decrees, since man's will is brought about freely and willingly to embrace
what God has certainly purposed; whose purpose being eternal, He did not in
the beginning of Time make such a Creature as should disappoint him of his
eternal purpose.

SECT. 3.
Of Conscience.
IN the next place follows Conscience, about which it seems, that both the
Understanding and the Will are exercised. Conscience.
This is an application of general Rules unto particular Cases, and points of
practice; and this it performs both by the Understanding and the Will; and
that both concerning things not yet done, and concerning things already done.
Conscience by virtue of the understanding judges such and such particular
actions to be good, and such as it ought to practice, because it sees them
agreeable to those general rules of duty and of goodness, which it has already
conceived. Our Savior knew that he must fulfill all Righteousness; therefore
when John was unwilling to baptize him, he applies that General to this
Particular, He must fulfill all, therefore this part of Righteousness. St.
Peter had laid up this general direction that our Savior gave him; Feed my
Sheep; and so his sanctified Conscience made application of it on all
particular occasions. Therefore when a multitude were gathered together
wondering at the miraculous gifts of Tongues bestowed on the Disciples; his
Conscience tells him, now Thou must practice what thy Master has commanded;
and so at that time he gathered some three thousand lost sheep into the fold of
Christ.

In the second place, Conscience by virtue of the Will, Stirs up the
faculties of the soul to practice this particular duty, which is thus found
agreeable to the general rules of duty and goodness. Now in that these things
are not practiced, this comes from that disorder which sin has made in the
soul, and that preposterous confusion of the affections leading Conscience in a
slavish captivity under the power of lust: so on the other side, it is for
evils not yet done: The world promises a fair reward many times, if men will
use foul means to obtain it: if riches begin to trade with the world about the
matter, covetousness (like Judas) says to the world, What will thou give me,
and I will betray my Masters honor, profane his Day, defraud my neighbor,
oppress my poor brother, etc? But now Conscience comes in, and labors to
man the bargain; and having laid up this general rule, That it shall not profit
a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul, it applies this to the
case in hand; therefore it will be a most miserable bargain for me to gain this
which is now proposed with the hazard of my soul. This does conscience by
virtue of the understanding, and then calls up the powers of the will to
help, which withdraws from the thing as unlawful and dangerous, and rises
against it, and disliketh it with reluctance. So Joseph had laid up this in his
heart, that adultery must not be committed, no not in secret, because it is a
sin against the All-seeing eye of God; therefore, when his Mistress tempts
him, he applies this General to the particular occasion, and by the force of a
sanctified conscience bids defiance to her temptations. How shall I do this
great wickedness, and so sin against God? so David having laid up in his heart
that precept in General, Honor thy Father and thy Mother, and knowing that
under this Title of father, was comprehended the King, and other Magistrates:
and then again, Thou shall do no murder: now he happens to come into a cave,
and there meets with Saul, and has him at advantage: Saul sought to murder
him, pursuing him without cause against his own Conscience, who was to succeed
him in his Kingdom, and one that was anointed by the special appointment of
the King of Kings; yet David will not touch him, nor suffer Abishai to fall
upon him, who was ready to have slain him, had David given way to it; for
against all these provocations, conscience cries out, God forbid that I should
lay my hand upon the Lords Anointed; and so prevails notably against all
these motives. So David stayed his servants with these words, not suffering
them to rise against Saul. 1 Samuel 24.7. It is in the original, he clave his men
asunder; it seems his followers began to run together, desiring every one to
lend his helping-hand to dispatch the mortal enemy of their Master David, but
David by the force of an upright conscience, brake through them all, and put
them aside, not suffering them to accomplish their bloody intendment But
another time ye shall see when Nabal had dealt currishly with David's
Messengers, the news of this base abuse came (it seems) somewhat unseasonably
to David, and found his Conscience not well awakened; and so while Conscience
slumbereth, and minds not what is in hand, passion condemns Nabal, and all
his family to present death. And whiles Anger makes an hasty march for blood,
and whetteth it self, as it goes, Abigail meets it upon the way, and with a
well-tempered voice, not so loud and violent as to enrage fury more than
already it was, yet loud enough to awake Conscience; she shows him his
error, and presently Conscience being awakened, sounds a retreat; makes all
lay down arms, thanketh the Instrument by whom it was shaken out of slumber,
and kept from wallowing in innocent blood, or encroaching on Gods Office by
self-revenge. But with wicked men Conscience many times prevails not in such
cases, she cannot be heard; or being heard, is not regarded; Satan, the flesh,
the world stop her mouth.

Now besides all this, Conscience has its employment also about the things
already past: if good, it excuses and acquitteth the party, cheareth,
comfort, and is peaceable, unless misinformed: so in performing good
actions, and so in overcomming sinful temptations; so Abigail tells David,
that when he should be King, he should have no trouble of Conscience for not
shedding blood, if according to her petition he would spare Nabals family,
Conscience should never accuse him for it, but should hold him guiltless. So
you see Psalm. 7. when he was falsely accused by a Benjamite for an evil he never
committed, how boldly conscience pleads his cause before the Lord, and
proclaims him innocent.

Again, for evils done, or good duties omitted, Conscience accuses, yea
sometimes wonderfully rages and terrifieth: it accused David, Psalm. 51. I have
sinned, etc. yea it breaks his bones (as it were) and grievously afflicts
his soul. But when it meets wi^h Judas, a son of perdition; oh, how it
tormenteth him, it drives him out of his Meditations, wherein he might please
himself in the price of blood lately gained; it chaseth him cut of the company
of his fellows, who had been his assistants in apprehending our Savior; i^
drives him into the presence of the Priests, it forces him to accuse himself,
to throw down his money and to hang himself; never ceasing to pursue him till
it had driven him quite out of the world! Now besides this, it records and
keeps a Register and Day-book of men's actions and omissions; which, though
now adays men will not read over by self examination, yet at the last day God
shall open it bebefore the eyes of men and Angels. Thus much for the faculties
of the soul.

CHAP VI.
SECT. 1.
Use 1. HEre by way of Application, we may in the first place take notice of
the soul of man in a special manner, as of one of the principal works of God*
wherein his glory is no^ably manifested. He is the Father of Spirits, who of
himself immediately did bring forth the spirit and soul of man, an excellent
Creature which no sense can discern; the eye cannot see it, nor the ear hear
it, etc. and as it is said, no man has seen God at any time; yet God, whom
none in the world can see; gave being to the whole world, and now governs it:
so the soul, whom no sense of the body can discern, gives life to the whole
body, and governs the body. An excellent Creature it is; endowed with notable
faculties, and we should learn to bless God for every faculty of our souls: we
are too unthankful for all sorts of mercies, but yet more apt to give thanks
(at least outwardly) for things without us, than for those more excellent
things within us* Thus many a one says* I thank God for health, for meat and
drink, etc. that never (not so much as in words) does give him thanks for his
soul, and the several faculties of it. How seldom has God any praise for our
understandings, our judgments, our memories, our reason, wills and affections?
how lame would our souls be without the will and affections? how blind without
reason, memory or understanding? yet how unthankful are we to him that made
them? we should r^ckon these among the chiefest of Gods blessings, next to the
sanctifying graces of Gods spirit, and accordingly show our thankfulness for
them to his glory.

SECT. 2.
II. IN as much as the Soul is more excellent by its Creation than the Body;
this shows that our care should be greater for the soul than for the body.
Nature it self might teach even a natural man to be more careful of the natural
good of the soul, than of the body, which yet is contrary to the practice of
man. You will say the Natural man perceives not the things of the spirit,
neither can he discern them, because they are spiritually discerned. But I
speak now of such natural good things, as tend to the enriching and perfecting
of the soul and mind of man; namely, such knowledge in Arts and Sciences, as
concerns the things of this life. How many do prefer the things of the body
above these? But the principal thing is that which concerns the spiritual
happiness and heavenly perfection of the soul. These things which are the most
excellent endowments of the most excellent part of man, are less regarded and
sought for, than those that are the meanest appurtenances of the body, which is
the meanest part. The least saving grace, being a thing belonging to the
perfection of the soul, is worth more than the whole body; which without the
soul, is but a dead lump of earth. Can a Maid forget her ornament, o^ a Bride
her attire; yet my people have forgotten me days without number, says the
Lord? Ier. 2.32. what a shameful indignity is this to the Majesty of God, when
ornaments of the body, toys, head-tyres, or the like, serving to dress up an
earthly carcass, shall be better remembered than God himself; yea, shall be
remembered when he is forgotten. Thus every thing belonging to the body is
thought of, but the soul is forgotten: the eye must be pleased, the ear must be
tickled, the palate must be delighted; great ado must be made for back and
belly, but where is the care for the soul? we can starve that, yet never feel
any hunger; we can let it pine away, yet never complain of weakness; we can
suffer mortal diseases, most dangerous corruptions to grow upon our souls and
never see our need of spiritual physic. How many a soul is swollen with pride,
and overgrown with vile affections, and yet no care is taken of it, but it is
let alone, as if all were well: yea what deadly wounds do men daily give to
their consciences, by swearing, lying* drunkenness by unjust and indirect
dealings with others; yet all this is esteemed as nothing, no care is used to
have it cured: nay, he that shall desire to cure it, or persuade them from
these desperate courses tending to the destruction of their souls, shall be
hated as an enemy. Our very creation should make us ashamed of this folly, that
all the care is taken for the body framed out of the dust, and the soul is
utterly neglected, which the Lord himself breathed into the body. F^ar not them
(says our Savior, Mat. 10.28.) which after they have killed the body, can do
no more; but fear bim, which can cast the body and soul into hellfire. Yet he
that shall follow our Saviors counsel in this, shall be thought to be a fool
by many men; he that will rather suffer harm in his body, or loss in his goods,
and such things as concern the body, than hazard his soul upon any sin which is
death to the soul, is thought to do it in simplicity for want of wit* whereas
even reason might teach us, that the soul is a thousand times better than the
body, and the misery of the soul incomparably beyond the punishments that can
befall the body in this life. Let us then labor to prevent the everlasting
destruction of the soul, and fear it more than a thousand deaths of the body,
if it could possibly endure so many. Think that a precious thing that weighs
more than the whole earth in the balance of the sanctuary, and the judgment of
Christ. What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world; and lose his own
soul? Oh learn to prize thy soul, a precious Creature, and immortal Spirit; and
make it appear thou make more reckoning of it than of thy body? thy body is
but a small piece of earth, but the whole earth is not able to bring forth, or
yield matter for one soul which is of an higher nature.

SECT. 3.
III. THis should teach us also that the greatest good which one man can do for
another, is that which is done for his soul. The feeding, clothing and
refreshing of another body, is a good work if rightly performed; but the good
which is done to the soul is a better work, as the soul is better than the
body. This therefore should reform a gross folly among us, whereby it is
conceived, that there is no good work in a manner besides that which is done to
the body. It is true! that he who has this worlds good, and yet does no good
in this kind, does not truly perform any other good work; but yet this on the
otherside is a gross error to conceive, that the best thing that a man can do,
is to help the outward man; and that the doing of this is enough to excuse him
from doing good to the souls of others. This is a gross carnal conceit; it is
as much as to affirm, that the body is better than the soul; earth than heaven;
mortality more excellent than immortality; and a lump of flesh more worth than
a spiritual being. Now men are so far from esteeming that best which is done
for the good of the soul, that they account those admonitions and reproofs,
which are tendered to them for this purpose, the greatest signs of ill will,
that any man can show to others: no man is accounted a worse neighbor than he
that will seek to pluck men's souls as brands out of the fire of Gods wrath by
showing them the danger of their sins. If men want for the body* what outcrys
are there made against the hardness of others hearts? men are so hard-hearted
now a days, that they will not give a poor man a bit of bread, they will see
him starve first; and sometimes that is true which is said, though often false.
But on the other side; one is ignorant, he has a blind soul; Another has a
graceless, profane, and unsanctified soul, laden with many sins, in great
danger to perish for ever: but when shall ye hear such a one complain of his
neighbors for hard-heartedness toward his soul, in not pitying his spiritual
misery, in not instructing him in his ignorance. When shall ye hear one of
these complain, oh, I have a neighbor that has knowledge, he knows that I am
ignorant of God; but alas he is hard-hearted, he does not pity my soul! he
will sooner see me damned in my ignorance, than once open his mouth to instruct
me in any matter of salvation. Or when shall we hear one that goes on in sin,
cry out of another in this respect! I have a neighbor sees my soul in a
fearful case, he perceives me to go on in the stubbornness of my heart, and he
knows that the wrath of God will one day smoke against me for it, and yet his
heart is hard, he has no pity upon me; he did never once open his lips to
bring me into the right way, to reprove me for my sin. Nay, if any in zeal to
Gods glory, and love to the souls of such, shall labor to do them good, what
is their answer? meddle with your own business, I shall answer for my self, you
shall not answer for my sin. I pray mark what sensles speeches these be: it is
as if a man should see another fallen into a dangerous pit, where he could not
live without help* and should go to help him out; or to direct one that is
going in some dangerous place in in the dark, where he is like to break his
neck; or to succor one that is in need, and like to starve, and should have
such an answer from him as this? Why do ye trouble me? look to your self, if I
perish, I perish, you shall not perish with me: Why do ye feed my body, if I
starve, it is nothing to you, you shall not be famished by it: No verily, this
help is for the body, and therefore it is welcome at all times; but the other
that is for the soul, that is distasted as unseasonable and troublesome.

SECT. 4.
IV. THis shows us also the greatest harm which a man can do to another, is
that which is done to the soul: men may receive wrong many ways; but the
greatest injury and mischief that one man can do another, is that which falls
upon the soul, the best part. Is not a blow in the eye worse than one upon the
arm? he that wounds thy soul, does he not worse than if he smote thy body?
and yet what deadly malice does one bear to another for a box of the ear, or
some such wrong done to the body, whereas they account them their best friends
that work the greatest mischief to their souls. He that will drink to them when
they have drunk too much already; he that will flatter and humor them in their
sins; He that will entice them unto sin, he is the only friend and good fellow:
whereas indeed such a one is a most dangerous enemy. He that threatens to be
revenged of thee, that says he will have thy blood, that raileth at thee and
slandereth thee, does not hurt thee so much as such a one who seeks to draw
thee into that, or by joining with thee to encourage thee in that which tends
to the destruction of thy soul; such a one endangereth thine everlasting life,
and takes a course to wound thee, so that thou may die for ever. Therefore
when thou hear, that no Drunkard shall inherit the Kingdom of God, and one
pu^leth thee by the sleeve, and another enticeth thee, etc. answer him thus; I
perceive you are none of my friends; what! are ye loath to have me go to heaven?
would ye have my soul perish? would ye seek my destruction? you seek to draw me
into such a sin as will shut me out of heaven. If thou would answer them so
now and then, thou would be well rid of such companions, and not be so much
pestered with these troublesome flies. But most lamentable is the sin of such
in this case, whose care is only for the bodies of their Children, but care
not how they betray their souls; how they leave them in their sins which they
see to grow upon them, and use no means to cure them of these deadly evils. Oh
do not deal with thy child as with thy beast, as if it had only a body to be
fed and clothed, and not a soul to be saved.

SECT 5.
V. Since God did Create our Souls, let us conceive that he made them for
Himself; therefore let every faculty be given up to his service.

1. As for thine Imagination, let it be dedicated to the service of God; let
thy thoughts and meditations be directed unto God and his Word and Kingdom.
The fancy of a man is a working, stirring thing, always meddling with something
or other; now let it be turned toward God and his Word; and when thou find
it busy with other things, call it home and think with thy self, I must go
about my Fathers business: this faculty of my soul must mind him that made it.

So for thy memory; it is God's treasury, he made it, and therefore you must
lay up the riches and treasures of his Kingdom in it, and not the trash of the
world: you must store it with holy instructions and meditations, Promises,
Precepts, etc. out of his word, and not stuff it with idle Tales, wa^ton Songs,
or mere earthly Vanities, and nothings else: This Cabinet of the Soul was not
made for such base uses. When thou come to hear the word, thou must not think
it enough to take it in with thine Ear, that is not the only part which God
made; but labor to lay it up in thy memory, that thou may be rich in all
saving knowledge of the word. A man may have a great deal of money come through
his hands, yet be never the richer, if he spend it idly as fast as it comes,
and lay up none. A man may have many a Sermon entering in at his outward ears,
and yet never prove rich in knowledge, if he suffer all to be lost again, and
treasure up none in his memory.

2 Thy Understanding, that most excellent faculty of the Soul, how carefully
should it be improved, that the Lord may be honored by it; let him have the
best that made the whole. It is strange to think that men should be excused by
ignorance: what is that but to rob God of the principal endowment of thy Soul,
even thine understanding? It is a miserable folly, when men labor for skill in
earthly things, and would be wise every way except in heavenly things, and in
the mean time least of all regard to Know the Lord; as if the top of the Soul,
the Head of the inward man, were made to be a vassal to the earth, and not a
servant to the Lord. Learn thou to know him that made thee, and never think
thine understanding so well employed about any other things as when it is
busied in studying the word of God: frequent those exercises wherein the word
of God is taught, and thine understanding is to be pre^ected. The eye loves
the light, and is delighted with the sunshine; let thine understanding, the eye
of thy Soul, love the light that shines from heaven in the ministry of the
word, and do not turn from it, or neglect it; Let thy delight be in the law of
the Lord, and meditate therein day and night: magnify God who has given thee
this faculty of thy soul, whereby thou might come to be acquainted with him
thy Maker, and think there is none so worthy of thy knowledge, as he that made
thee; this knowledge shall be everlasting: the knowledge of earthly things,
worldly policy, skill in dealings, laws of men, etc. shall perish, but the
knowledge of God is everlasting and immortal, as the soul it self is; yea it
shall be perfected, when other knowledge shall perish.

3. Thy W^ll, wherein the strength of thy soul lies, must be wholly for God;
it must be firmly bent to obey God, and strongly resolved against all
disobedience, flashes, motions, and good moods and fits, now and then arising
in the heart toward God; either in affliction, or when we see some spectacles
(...) mortality, or hear the word pressed upon us, are but slight and weak of
themselves, and soon Vanish, if there be nothing else but these. But the
strength of the Soul lies in the Will when it is sanctified, and firmly
resolved to obey its Maker in all things. When Barnabas saw the good affections
of the new Converts at Antioch, be exhorted them all, that with purpose of
heart they would cleave unto the Lord, Act. 11.23. So David, I have sworn, and
I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments, Psalm. 119.106.
there was a resolute spirit, and such should be the bent of every sanctified
will. The affections may be stirred, and yet may be no more but as a few loose
sticks, which Satan will soon break again, and bring to nothing; but the will,
when it is thoroughly bent and confirmed indeed, it is as a common bond to tie
up all the affections, and to strengthen all: let us therefore pray to the
Lord, that he would give us both the Will and the Deed.

4. The will being thus for God* then labor to stir up the affections, which
are as it were the wings of the soul.

1. Love is strong as death, jealousy is hot as fire; thou should love God
with passionate and strong affections. Oh how I love thy law! it is my
meditation all the day, says David, Psalm. 119.97. Tell him that I am sick of
love, says the Church of Christ. Cant. 5.8. That is an happy soul, that is
sick of this heavenly love. It is not enough to wish well to God and his glory,
and coldly to desire that things might be amended; but the heart must be
carried after him in strong and stirring passions of Love; that as the heart of
a fond lover is passionately carried, and overcome with the love of the person
beloved; so should a Christian Soul not content it self with an ordinary cold
temper of love, but should labor to have it self possessed with fervent
affections, yea to be overcome. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts,
says the Apostle; now that (I hope) will work an affectionate love to God,
when his love is poured abundantly into the heart; this will make a man love
out of a pure heart fervently.

2. This will draw desire after it, which is another affection; oh how the Soul
will pant, long, hunger and thrist for God, if once it fall in love with him,
and be truly joined unto him, having, tasted of his excellency, and found how
Good the Lord is: I have lifted up mine eyes to the hills, says the Psalmist.
Travelers, at the foot of the hill look up to the top; and now oh that I were
there with a wish! so a Christian, in the valley of humiliation, and in the
sense of his own wants, locketh up to God, and his holy Mount: and now, oh that
I were with the Lord! oh that I were near to him, and could more fully enjoy
him! oh that I had more of his Spirit, more of his fullness, more of his graces;
my soul thirsts for the Lord, even for the living God. And when once thou
come to this* how can thou choose but from thy heart loath all sin tendered
or suggested to thee by Satan, the world, or the flesh; if once thou thus
love God, thou will not make league with any enemy of His.

3. Then thou will rejoice in the Lord with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
then the worlds joys will seem poor, heartless, unsavory flashes; and now a
world for my part in that blessed feast of fat things, of wine upon the lees,
of wine upon the lees well refined. No delicates so sweet as the Paschal Lamb,
Christ Jesus; no feast so excellent, as that which the soul makes on him by
Faith. Now I can relish Christ's sweetness in the Word, in the Sacraments, in
private Meditations.

4. And now also must thy sorrow be sanctified, and nothing be so grievous to
thee as that which is displeasing to thy God: thy heart should ache when his
spirit is grieved; all should be godly sorrow, that brings repentance: give
not way to that sorrow for which thou must sorrow again, but to those tears
after which thou shall reap in joy.

5. As for Hope, where should thou cast Anchor, but upon the Rock? there is
the only sure hold that will abide a storm; fasten there, lean not upon the arm
of flesh, cast not Anchor in the Sand.

6. And whom should thou fear, but him that has all power in his hand, all
Creatures that can help or hurt at his command, e^ther to let them loose, or to
tie them up? fear him for his Goodness and Mercy, as well as for his Justice;
that it is too good to be abused, and to be made a patronage to thy sins.

7. Labor to be courageously confident in the Lords goodness toward thee, and
bear up thy soul upon the multitude of his mercies, and his truth that never
fails, above the gulf of desperation.

8. And for thine Anger, let it not be a strange fire of inordinate and
distempered passion, but an holy fire of zeal for the glory of God: oh let it
burn inwardly to consume the dross and corruptions of thy own soul, and to burn
up the stubble vanity of thy corrupt affections, and then let it flame out in
the eyes of the world; that those that hate it, may yet see its light: and then
whatsoever the world speaks or thinks of thee, thou may with a glad heart say
in the presence o^ God; Praise the Lord O my soul, and all that is within me
praise his holy name; bless the Lord O my soul, and forget not all his
benefits, as David does, Psalm. 103.1, 2.

CHAP. 7. Of the Creation of both Sexes.
I Come now to the second point, and that is, that God made both Sexes; Male
and Female, Man and Woman; which is here laid down in general, but more
particularly set forth afterward in the second Chapter from the eighteenth
verse to the end. So that first you see, as was showed before, that the Man's
body was framed out of the Dust, and the breath of life was breathed into him,
as has been showed.

Now in the next place we may observe,

1. The necessity of the Creation of Woman after that Man was made.

2. The manner of it.

3. The conjunction of Both together.

4. A special consequent of the Image of God in both; and that was, that their
nakedness was without shame, being without sin. The first of these is laid
down, Chap. 2. verse 18. and 20. and therein two things are to be noted. 1.
That man was alone. 2. That it was not good for him to be alone, and therefore
the Lord would make him an help Meet for him. 1. He was alone; therefore it was
noted, that when all the other living creatures were brought before him, there
was not among them all, when they were in that best estate of their creation,
any one that was an help meet for him; or fit to be joined in nearest society
with him: There was not any among all the Creatures to which he gave Names,
that did bear the Image of God, and so no fit match for him. 2. It was not good
for him to be thus alone.

Object. But it may be objected, that then all that was made was not very good.

Resp. It was very good when it was perfected, but not whilst it was in hand,
before it was finished: An house is not very good for habitation before the
roof is laid, etc. when it is but an imperfect frame: So man's estate was not
yet perfected, till the Lord had made him an help meet for him; and that was
all done upon the Sixth day, and then the Lord said of all that he had made,
That it was very good. But to the point; It was not good that man should be
alone.

1. Because it was needful that Mankind should be increased for the glory of
God; that as the other Creatures did increase* so men should multiply also, and
bear rule over them. Therefore Genesis 1.28. God said to them in the state of
holiness and innocence, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and
subdue it. Many other reasons there are now since the Fall, for which it is
needful that the Woman should be made, which had no force in the state of
Innocence. But yet,

2. A second may be, that as God needing no creatures, yet did make creatures
to which he might communicate his goodness; so he might be pleased to make such
a creature, as should be suitable unto Adam, to whom he might communicate his
love, and with whom he might take such an holy, undefiled, mutual contentmen^,
as did become the estate of Innocence.

2. In the second place follows the manner of the Creation of the Woman; and
therein,

1. The preparative, which was a Deep Sleep falling upon the man to take away
the present u^e of his senses, that he might not feel any pain in taking away
the Rib out of his side; which showed the Lords tender care over man when he
continued upright, that he would not put him to any pain, no not in such a case
as tended to his special good, that he might have an help meet for him.

2. He took a rib out of his body, and left no breach nor wound in the body,
but closed up the flesh again, and left it whole. And of this Bone he made a
Woman, which should be joined unto him as an help meet for him.

3. The third thing is the institution of Marriage; wherein we have the Lords
act in joining them together, and his enacting that holy law of Matrimony, Genesis
2.24.

1. The Lord brings the woman to the man, where ye see, that God is the great
Match-maker, and He is the Author of Marriage. God brought all the creatures
before Adam, but among them all he found none that was an help meet for him,
and therefore he brought the woman to another end; and in bringing her, did
join her to him in marriage: and Adam on the other side, with a glad and
thankful heart* accepts her at the hands of God; gives her a name answerable
to her beginning, which he alleges as a reason of the name, and of the near
affinity between him and her. This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my
flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.

2. The law of marriage was enacted, verse. 24* where is showed: 1. That the
conjunction between Man and Wife should be most near. 2. That it should not be
dissolved. 3. That it should be between one Man and one Woman.

1. It should be most near: for it should be nearer than that between the child
and his father and mother, which is nearer than any other besides this of
Marriage. Therefore in marriage, the father is said to give his child; so that
now the husband is the wifes, and the wife is the husbands. They must be near
in cohabitation, or in dwelling together; most near in affection, near in a
mutual communion of bodies and goods; so near, that they must be one: even as
the woman was a part of the man being taken out of him, so it must be
conceived, that each man must judge himself one with his wife, and not esteem
her as a person divided from himself; not take her for another, but account her
a part of himself.

2. It must not be dissolved, because they are become one: for a man to fo^sake
his wife, is as if he should pluck an arm from his body, or pull a rib out of
his side; they being by the ordinance of God made one, even as all the members
of a man's body make up one body. Therefore our Savior gives not way to any
divorce, except it be for Adultery, for then the party that commits adultery
does rent it self from that Union wherein they were knit together; every
adulterous act being a division of the Marriage-bond.

3. It must be between one man and one woman; and not between one, and more
than on^. So it is plain; 1. By the Creation it self when the Lord made but one
woman for one man, which is the argument used by the Prophet, Malach. 2.15. and
if ever it had been expedient to have had many wives, it had been then fittest
that the earth might have been more speedily replenished. 2. You see it is
said, That a Man shall cleave to his Wife, and not unto his wives; and that
they two, and not more than two* should be one flesh.

4. The last thing is a consequent of Gods Image in both; which was, that their
nakedness was without shame; the cause whereof, was, because they were free
from sin. Thus much for the opening of these things* I now proceed to
application.

CHAP VIII.
Use 1. THis condemns the folly of those that use to say, that women have no
souls; which though it be a most sottish speech, yet no Opinion is so sottish,
which has not some to embrace it. Howsoever! though men think not so, but
speak it many times in an idle jesting humor, yet is it worthy of reproof in
public; both because it is to be reckoned among those idle words for which
the speaker must give account at the day of Judgment, and also because it is a
notorious lie and falsehood, which no Christian tongue should utter in jest or
earnest. And that which the Apostle speaks in another case, may be applied to
this, That evil words corrupt good manners. But if it were worthy of a
confutation, it were easily showed, that the blessed Virgin began her song of
praise thus; My soul does magnify the Lord, etc. It is said, that Lydia
(another woman) had her heart or soul opened to attend to the word of God. It
is said, that the Woman whose Daughter had a Devil, had a great Faith, which is
always seated in the soul. It is said, that the woman who washed our Saviors
feet with tears, had many sins forgiven her; but without a soul she could not
have sinned, nor have received forgiveness of sins. But some that will take
upon them to carp at Sermons or Catechisms, though themselves have need to be
catechized, will say, it is an idle thing to speak of this: let their wisdoms
know then, that in mine own experience I have found such as could not tell
whether Christ were God or man, or an Angel etc. Therefore there is need that
the plainest things should be taught, and that they which know them should also
know some arguments whereby to stop profane cavilling mouths; but Moses tells
us, that both male and female were made after the image of God, and therefore
both the one and the other had an immortal Soul; both were made Rulers over the
Creatures.

2. This shows God's tender care over man, he would not suffer him to want
that which was good for him: thus tender is his love when sin makes no breach.
This should therefore teach Thee, O man, to lament thy sins, and the sins of
the land, when any evil befalls thee or the land. Had not thou wronged him
by thy sins, as Adam then had not, he would have been as tender over Thee as
over Him. Had it not been for sin, the Lord would have said, It is not good for
man to be punished with famine and scarcity, I will provide him food convenient
for him. It is not good for man to be sick, I will continue health unto him. It
is not good for him to be made a Slave, or a Prisoner, whom I have made Lord of
the other creatures, I will give him liberty. It is not good to bring him under
any affliction, I will keep him free from sorrow. It is not good that he should
die, I will give him immortality. Thus would the Lord have dealt with man* had
not sin confounded that happy peace between God and man complain not then so
much of thy affliction as it is a cross to thee, as of thy sin which is a cross
to God, and which has moved him to bring the cross of affliction upon Thee.

3. In that woman was made to be an Help meet for man at her creation, and at
the first appointment of marriage, this shows, that, So far as she is an
hinderance to him, or neglects to help him, So far she erreth from the right
end of marriage. As she is an hinderance to him in Spiritual things, and a
means either to draw him from God, or to cool his Zeal for Gods glory* to
lessen his care for his service, or to make him more backward in good du^ies,
or to discourage him from a sincere constant course of obedience; so far does
she grievously cross the very rules, the true end and original institution of
marriage. Again, so far as she helps him forward in these things, as she
provoke^h him to grow in grace, and to be more and more fruitful in good works,
so far she shows her self to be a wife, even a wife of Gods making, an help
meet for man; for indeed she is no farther a wife then she is an helper. Again*
So far as by her wilfulness, negligence, or wastful riot she impaireth his
estate, So far she fails of those accomplishments that should go to the
making up of a wife* And, so far as by moderate care, diligence and discretion
she furthereth him this way, so far she approves her self to be a true wife,
that is, an help meet for him; So it is in regard of his true comfort and
contentment every way, sc. of his credit etc. Therefore wives should labor to
be Wives, that is, helps in every respect: for although infirmities sithence
the fall will not permit them to be perfectly helpful in the highest degree, yet
should they labor to do their best in every several kind, wherein they ought
to be helpful.

4. The neerness of the marriage-bond which is showed by the original of the
woman taken out of Man, and the law of marriage enacted by God, whereby they
are become one flesh, should move them both to knit their hearts in most entire
and mutual love, accounting each other, and affecting each other, as a part of
him or her self.

5. This condemns the pride of the whore of Babylon* which accounts the
state of marriage polluted and thinks her shavelings too good and holy to
enter into that order, which yet the Lord thought a fit and helpful estate for
Adam in his first estate, when the image of God shined b^ightly and perfectly
in his Soul without all spot of lust, or stain of corruption.

6. In that nakedness it self was not shameful, until naked Man and woman
became sinful; this should make us not so much ashamed of any thing as of sin;
no meanness of condition, no defects or deformities, no reproaches, of lving
and idle Tongues should make us so ashamed as any sin against God; for shame is
as proper unto sin as the shadow to the Body, and we may call shame the shadow
of sin. For as there is no shadow without some light, yet the shadow comes not
from the light but from the Body; So shame does not follow sin without some
light to discover it, yet the shame comes not from the light but from sin;
there must be either the light of the Word, or of Conscience, or nature etc: to
discover sin before the shame of it (which is its shadow) will appear: and
therefore men that are wholly in darkness and blindness, and come not to the
light, they go on without sense of the shame of sin. And that is the reason why
Men hate the light and those that hold it forth, because it makes their sin
cast shadow, it makes the shame of their sin to appear, which was hidden
before in the dark.

CHAP. 8. Of the Creation of Man after the Image of God.
SECT. 1.
THus much of the second point. sc. Gods Creation of both Sexes: I now proceed
to the third, viz. That God made Man in his own Image, which clearly appears,
both in the story of the consultation between the glorious persons of the
blessed Trinity, and also in the relation of the execution of his consultation
here in my Text. Now for the opening this point, two things are to be
considered.

1. What is an Image in General. 2. Wherein this Image of God in Man
consists.
An Image is such a likeness of a thing, as does bear a special relation to the
thing resembled by it, An Image what it is.
either as flowing from its Being, or framed according to it: so that every
Image of a thing is like unto the thing whose Image it is; but every thing that
is like another, is not an Image of it. Any thing that is of the same color
wi^h another thing may be said to be like unto it, but not an Image of it. But
in an Image, besides likeness, there is required one of these two things;
either that it be expressed by the essence of that whose Image it is, or else
that it be purposely fashioned according to it. In the former sense, none but
the Eternal son of God is the true Image of God the father, as he is called the
Brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his person. Hebr. 1.3.
And so a Son may be said to be the Image of his Father, as Adam is said, after
his fall to have begotten a Son in his own likeness, after his Image. In the
other sense, an Image is that which is made like to another, framed of purpose
to resemble it: So is a picture or a statue made by Art to represent some
person: and such was the Image of God in Man, for the Lord did purposely, as
you see by the consultation, make Man like himself, to resemble him, and to
bear his Image

SECT. 2.
IN the second place I come to show, wherein this Image of God in Man
consists, and what it is.

This was in general, that Perfection which God gave unto Man in his first
Creation, Of the Image of God in general.
for God is a most perfect Being, infinite in all divine perfection: therefore
that perfection which Man had above all other Creatures here below, was the
Image of God in Man. Now this perfection was twofold.

Principal. Less Principal.
Principal in the Soul: this is fully laid down unto us in these two places.
Colos. 3 10. Ye have put off the old Man, and have put on the new Man, which
is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him: and that
Ephesians. 4.24. That ye put on the new Man, which after God is created in
righteousness and true holiness: where we see the several powers of the Soul
had their several perfections; and there is no faculty of the Soul which may
not be made perfect by these, so that in these did the Image of God consist.

Object. But it may be said, that in those two places. St Paul speaks of
regeneration, or the new birth, and not of that old and first Creation in the
beginning.

Sol. It is true! and this makes for our purpose; for the Apostle shows
here, that the Image of God consists in these perfections; now the Image of
God restored by regeneration, is the same which was given by Creation at the
first, and that building which Adam pulled down by his sin, our Savior built
up again by his obedience and mediation. As in Adam all die, even so by Christ
shall all be made alive. 1 Cor. 15.22. That is, Christ shall make up that which
was undone by Adam: there cannot be any thing named for matter of substance
that Adam lost, but Christ restored it, and therefore he is called the second
Adam, and in the comparison between them and the first Adam, it is said, the
first Man Adam was made a living Soul, and the second Adam was made a quickening
Spirit, ver. 45. That is, the first Adam was made a living soul, by Creation,
living the life of nature, by the substance and faculties of his Soul united to
his Body, and a supernatural life too, by the Image of God in his Soul: and,
had he continued in that estate, he should have conveyed the same life, both
natural and supernatural to his posterity: but losing that supernatural life,
consisting in the Image of God, he remained a mere living Soul, and no better,
one that had but only the life of nature left him, arising out of the essence
and natural powers of the Soul and so could only convey this natural life to
his posterity, whose Souls were dead in sin, to whom he could not impart any
quickening virtue, to raise them unto that supernatural life in holiness and
righteousness. But Christ was a quickening Spirit, not only having this
supernatural life in himself, but also quickening those with a new principle of
supernatural life, to whom he is joined by the Spirit: and so he is called a
second Adam, as being the founder of a new generation of Men; for as all Men by
nature do spring of the first Adam, so all Christians by grace do come of the
second Adam, and receive that spiritual life from him again, which the first
Adam received, but lost. Now if the first Adam had continued in his first
estate, and kept the Image of God, there had been no need of the second Adam;
for all Men by their natural birth should have received from him that
supernatural life, together with the natural. But this first Adam having lost
the Image of God, was now but the Author of an imperfect generation of Men,
naturally alive, but spiritually dead; and therefore there was need of a second
Adam, who should be the Author of a new birth, and should give a new, a second,
a spiritual life and Being to those who were naturally dead in trespasses and
sins: so that by this it is plain, that that new Being and spiritual life,
which Christ by his spirit restores to his Members, is that very Image of God,
which God made in Man at the first; and this you see, does principally consist
in knowledge holiness, and righteousness; which are the perfections of the
understanding judgment, conscience, will and affections.

CHAP. 8.
SECT. 1.
1. FOr his understanding: he had all knowledge needful for a perfect Man,
both concerning the Creator and the Creatures: his Creator he knew perfectly;
perfectly I say, not in regard of the object, or person known, who is infinite,
but in regard of the subject, or person knowing: Man's understanding was not
infinite, and therefore could not have such a knowledge of God, as was a full
declaration, and apprehension of an infinite God; but it was perfect in its
kind, and therefore he had so much knowledge of his excellency, as was
sufficient to make him admire him, love him, magnify him above all things* and
so much as was sufficient clearly to direct him in any duty, which by the first
Covenant and Law of his Creation he owed unto him: so that as God knew himself,
so Man had a clear knowledge of God, and therein did bear his Image.

Then had he also a perfect knowledge of the Creatures, sc. of Himself and
Others. Himself he knew both soul and body, and well understood the nature and
virtue of each faculty in the one, and the temper and use of each member, or
parts in the other. And this appears by the knowledge which he had of the
Woman at the first sight; This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; she
shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. He had a perfect
knowledge of all the other Creatures here below, he knew the Trees of the
Gardens, the Herbs, Grass, and all sorts of Plants, and the natural virtues and
properties that were in them: he knew the Beasts of the Field, the Fowls of the
Air, and Fishes of the Sea; and so Adam gave fit and proper names to all Birds
and Beasts: so I doubt not, but he knew the nature, and several kinds of all
Minerals, metals, precious Stones, etc. together with the course and motions
of the Heavens, Sun, Moon, and S^ars. Thus did the understanding which is the
eye of Man's soul, represent the infinite knowledge of God, and bear its Image.
And those things which we call now hidden qualities in the Creatures, were not
hidden from him, and are now covered from us, not in regard of their own
natures, but in respect of our blindness, contrary to that light which was
natural to us in the Creation.

But all this while, Man had no knowledge of evil; he knew not what ignorance
or error meant; he knew not what a stubborn will, an hard heart, a polluted
conscience was: he had no knowledge of the nature of diseases nor of their
remedies; no nor of the cure of sin, nor of the washing away of its guilt and
pollution: Therefore the promise of this new kind of knowledge, made by Satan,
caused the Woman's Ear to itch, and her Heart to long, as imagining her self
capable of some higher perfection, which God had not given her; for this
knowledge concerned not that estate of Man, or did it make for his happiness.

SECT. 2.
II. HIs will was perfectly bent to obey, and cleave unto his Creator, whom he
knew to be infinitely more excellent than all the Creatures, and from whom he
saw he had received all the good and happiness which he enjoyed; he was fully
resolved never to forsake him, knowing there was none in Heaven, or Earth to be
regarded in comparison of him: in every affection of his heart and soul, he did
carry a lively Image of his Maker.

He loved God most entirely, whom he saw to be the greatest good beyond
comparison; and he loved whatsoever was agreeable unto God; and herein he did
resemble God, who loves himself with a most perfect love* and loves
whatsoever is agreeable to himself: he perfectly hated whatsoever was contrary
to God, all manner of sin and transgression, as the Lord also hates it. If he
had any actual desire, it was most holy: but I see not what he could actually
desire in that estate, unless it were the continuance of that happiness which
he had, and that near communion with his God; for he was full already, and had
as much joy, holiness, and happiness, as he was capable of: so that his desire
of good, was not, N. B.
to have it increased, but only to have it continued to him: but he had not the
least desire of any evil; his Joy was wholly in God, who was his happiness, and
in whom he found most sweet and full contentment. He had no matter of grief
within, or without him, nothing that should lessen his joy, or imbitter his
comfort: sin, which is the fountain of sorrow, was not then found in the World.
As for sorrow, he had none actually stirring in him, though an ability he had,
which afterward he had much cause to employ. His trust and confidence was in
God, and he believed that which he revealed to him. So long as he stood firm*
he believed that threatening; In the Day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall
die the Death. And when Satan by his lying suggestion brought him from his
steadfast belief of this Truth, then his Feet were more than almost gone, his
steps had more than well-nigh slipped. But while he remained in his state of
Creation, he believed without doubting; yet had he not actually faith in
Christ, as a Redeemer, which is that grace whereby the Elect in this new
Covenant of the Gospel are saved; for being free from sin, he needed not a
Redeemer to satisfy for his guilt by his Death: yet I doubt not, but that he
had an ability to believe whatsoever God should reveal unto him, and so to have
believed this truth, if it had been revealed. A^ for fear! he was free from all
slavish fears of vengeance or misery, perfect love casting out all such kind of
fear. Yet I am persuaded, that he could not want an holy humble reverence and
submissive respect unto his Maker. Courage he had in perfection, not fearing
all the World, whiles he knew that God was with him. As for Desperation, it was
far from the height of his happiness, who was not subject to the least
distrust. An holy anger, a divine flame of zeal for his beloved Creators glory,
I cannot think was wanting in him, inasmuch as the very Angels are called
Seraphims, or Fiery Spirits. Thus brightly did the Image of God shine in the
Face of Man's Soul at his first Creation, and though he were infinitely unequal
to him, he had not any spot of sin or impurity in him, to make him u^like or
contrary to him that made him. God made Man upright, says the wise Man,
Eccles. 7.29. and so he made him like himself*

SECT. 3.
3. BUt besides these excellencies, he did also otherwise resemble his Creator;
and that is the second thing, the inferior part of Gods Image in Man, and that
in two sorts of things.

1. In things belonging to the Body it self. 2. In things without his Body.
1. Of the things belonging to the Body, you have heard before, when I spoke of
the Creation of the Body, sc. the beauty and excellent temper of the Body: for
though the Lord has no Body, being an infinite, and most glorious Being; yet
these things, as they were excellencies, and things that made somewhat for the
happiness of Man, they were in some sort resemblances of the divine glory and
excellency of God: To these I may add also Immortality; for the Body also was
by the goodness of its Maker free from Death, had not Sin made a forfeiture of
his life and breath: And that upright posture of his Body was a fit resemblance
of the Majesty of God that made it.

2. Now, without the Body there were these two things. 1. The sweet and happy
habitation, which Adam had in the Garden of Eden, such as now no place with the
greatest cost and art in the World can possibly afford; hereby resembling God,
who has the glorious Heavens for his dwelling place, wherein he does
especially manifest his divine and glorious presence.

2. His Dominion over the Earth, Air, and Waters, with all the Creatures in
them, whereby as an Under-officer, or Deputy, he did represent the Person of
God, who is the Supreme Lord of all.

CHAP. IX.
Use 1. LEarn here then to admire this wonderful Work of God, and to magnify
Him for that admirable perfection which he gave to Man, within him and without
him; in Soul, Body, habitation and dignity, having made him a little lower than
the Angels, and Crowned him with glory and honor. What an excellent Creature
was Man, when he came newly out of the Hands of God, until Satan ^^rred him
with his foul hands. A Body without any blemish, a Soul without the least
defect, without all impurity; an understanding and wit without all dimness, or
dullness; a judgment without error, a memo^y free from leaks o^ failing, an
heart without the least distemper, always carried even, not swayed or stirred
out of place on the one side o^ the other.

2. Learn here not to think God the Author of any sinful disposition in thee:
Remember how he made thee; and condemn thy self, justifying his purity and
holiness, by whom thou wast made upright*

3. Learn to lament thine own misery, who art so far from that perfection which
God gave to Man at the first; look upon thy defects every way, within and
without, and see the fruits of Sin in thy self, and give no rest to thy self,
till thou see thy self new-made again, until thou art become a new Creature,
and have the Image of God restored unto thee: So far as we come short of Adam's
perfection, so far we come short of that which we should be, of that which we
must continually seek for. But you will say, all in the World come short of
Adam's perfection: True and therefore all must strive to grow in grace more and
more, and none must condemn another that goes beyond himself: but yet there is
a great difference in this case, for some are not sensible of their failings;
at least, not so, as to be careful to reform them, but rather dislike those
that give them the best examples, and keep themselves most close to the Rule of
the Word. These have not the Image of God at all restored to them, they have no
part of that spiritual life which Adam had. But others there be whom the Lord
has new-molded, and once again by his Spirit has breathed into them the
breath of spiritual life, who see themselves to come short of that perfection
which Adam had; and mourn, and strive, and pray, and use all holy means and
helps to this purpose, who are willing to be showed, wherein they come short of
this Image of God in Adam, wherein they are unlike unto it, willing to be
reproved by the Word; These have some degrees of his Image renewed in them, and
these strive after farther perfection. But now compare thy self with this Image
of God in Adam before his Fall, and see what thou have to do, how much is amiss
in thee, and must be amended. When a Man has lost a great estate, and by some
means begins to recover again, he will scarce think he has enough, until he
has gotten as much as he had before; he would fain be as rich as ever he was:
Men are too greedy of these things; but as the Apostle says, so say I, Covet
ye the best things. Thou wast rich in Adam, our first Parent had abundance of
riches to leave us; but he committed Treason, and so all was forfeited into the
hands of the Lord. Now we should never think our selves well, until we have
recovered the same degree of excellency which we lost. Thou that think thou
know enough, consider how far thou come short of Adam, who knew the Lord
perfectly; but thou art ignorant of many things in the Word of God, and those
things which thou do know, thou know it very imperfectly. How far art thou
from that full purpose of heart in obeying God, and cleaving to him that was in
Adam? How far from that uprightness, that perfection of holiness, those
Heavenly affections, that strong love to God, that ravishing constant joy in
him, which Adam had? How unsettled are thy affections? How dead is thy heart?
How little art thou affected toward Heavenly things? How far in love with the
Earth, and Earthly things? Therefore think with thy self, in these and these
things I am unlike to God, I bear not his Image, I am contrary to his purity,
and so resolve upon present reformation: And beware thou art not of the number
of those, who instead of the Image of God, do bear the very Visage of Satan:
Oh let all the Children of God labor to be more and more conformed to the
Image of their Heavenly Father; and to become Holy, as he is Holy, that they
may for ever be happy as he is happy.

CHAP. 1. Of the Creation of Angels, and of their Properties.
Colos. 1.16. For by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and that
are in Earth, visible and invisible, etc.


THus much of Visible or Corporeal Creatures: now let us speak something of the
Invisible or Spiritual; where observe, from the Text, that God Created all
Invisible substances. These are called Spirits, or Angels, and all of them (I
conceive) have the same natural Essence or Being, though in regard of their
present moral enclinations to good or evil, there be a wonderful difference
between them.

1. For their nature, they are called Spirits: so the good Angels are called,
He has made his Angels Spirits, Psalm. 104. So the evil Angels are often called
unclean Spirits in the Holy story of the Evangelists; and in that story of
Ahab, 1 King. ult. there is mention made of a lying Spirit. Now in that they
have appeared in a Bodily shape, this is no proof that their nature is not
spiritual: but this they might do, sometimes by the Lords command, sometime by
his sufferance for special ends; for if some excellent Artificers can amaze the
minds of others with strange inventions, and artificial performances, how easy
is it for these excellent Creatures, even of any matter, Air, or Water, etc. to
frame shapes for any purpose?

2. For their Original, here you see they were created, as the Text makes it
manifest, but not as many other Creatures, so as to propagate others of their
own kind; but all those that now are, we suppose were at first created, and
their number shall not be increased to the end of the World: for the Day when
they were created, it is uncertain: some think it was the first Day with the
Light, and that is not unlikely; but we must not speak peremptorily where the
Scripture is silent: howsoever, both Scripture and Reason do prove that they
were made, though the time of their Creation, as well as many other things
concerning them be hidden from us, because not necessary for us to know.

CHAP. 2.
THeir Knowledge is either natural, given them at the first Creation, or
supernatural by revelation from God, or acquired, and gotten by experience:
that they had excellent knowledge at their Creation, there is no question,
being made more excellent than Man, who yet at the first had an admirable
measure of knowledge given unto him. The knowledge which they have of God, and
of his works, is admirable from their very Creation, though yet it is not
infinite: it does not reach to things to come, unless it be indirectly by a
consideration of some things present, thereby collecting what will follow, or
by seeing things in their causes: otherwise they have no certain natural
knowledge of things merely future; for that is the prerogative of God denied to
the Creatures. But besides this, they have a supernatural knowledge revealed of
God unto them, and thus they come acquainted with many things to come, when the
Lord is pleased to give them knowledge of them: So the Angel Gabriel knew that
Christ should be conceived in the Womb of the Virgin Mary, because the Lord had
revealed this to him, and sent him to acquaint her with it: So on the contrary,
the lying Spirit knew that Ahab should fall at Ramoth-Gilead, because the Lord
had revealed so much to him. Besides this, there is no doubt, but that they
have wonderfully increased their knowledge these many years, which have passed
since their first Creation. Consider this, that being Spirits, and not having
their understandings dimmed by any gross Vapors arising from the Body, nor
interrupted in their speculations by any Bodily pains or sickness, nor being
subject to weariness, nor in any sort hindered or disabled by old Age, nor
distracted by seeking necessary supplies for the Body (all which are
impediments incident to Bodily substances;) and besides all these, have had
many thousand Years, wherein to increase their knowledge; it is beyond our
imagination to think to what an height they are grown by this means. The
Apostle shows that the holy Angels did increase their knowledge in the
Gospel, by the Preaching of the Apostles. Ephesians. 3.8. Unto me who am less than
the least of all Saints is this grace given, that I should Preach among the
Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ; that Men might learn, as he says,
Verse. 9. But this was not all; there were Scholars also of an higher form in
the School of Christ, sc. the Angels themselves. To the intent that now unto
Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places, might be known by the Church the
manifold wisdom of God. Verse. 10. This may seem strange, that Angels should
learn of Men; but this we must know, that it was not Paul, nor any mortal Man,
that of himself could teach these immortal Spirits any knowledge which they had
not: but it was the Holy Ghost himself* who is infinitely above Men and Angels,
that spoke by the Apostles to the Angels, and out of the Mouths of Men, did
teach these glorious Spirits. But there is a great difference in the end of
this knowledge, in Angels and Men: for Men must learn the mysteries of grace,
both that they may believe and be saved, and also that they may admire, and
magnify the riches of Gods grace in the work of Redemption. But the Angels do
not learn this, for their own Redemption, who never fell into Sin, and
therefore need no pardon, but that they may glorify God, and rejoice in the
Salvation of the Elect. And as God the Son did choose to unite to himself, not
the Nature of Angels, but of Man: So God the Holy Ghost did choose rather to
speak by Men to the Angels in this mystery, concerning God the Son, (being God
and Man) than by the Angels to Men.

Now there is no doubt, but the evil Angels also do learn the Gospel-mysteries,
which they also believe, and tremble: they are constant hearers; and it may
well be thought, that there is never a Sermon which is likely to bring any
danger to their Kingdom, but that some of them are present, though for no good
intent: yea, when they hinder others from learning, yet they learn themselves,
though they never mean to practice. And as the Angels, good and evil, have
increased their knowledge in the mystery of Christ; So (I doubt not, but) they
have done the like in other things by their long experience. Now ye must not
think there is an essential or natural difference between the good and evil
Angels, though they differ exceedingly in regard of moral good or evil, no more
than there is between good and evil Men. Peter and Judas were both Men, though
the difference were great in their ends, and in their dispositions.

CHAP. 3.
NOw I come to speak briefly of both these sorts apart: and first of the good
Angels (such as all were at the first;) for, as for the evil Angels, they are
not so by their Creation; and therefore as they are evil, they are not to be
reckoned among the Creatures: we may safely say, that God made no Devils; for
though he made those Creatures which now are wicked Devils, yet he made them
not Devils, but Holy Angels, excellent and glorious Spirits; but I shall not
speak of them here. Now for the good Angels.

1. Consider their perfection, which is both of Nature, and of Grace. The Lord
at the first gave them an excellent perfection of Nature, whereby he made them
good, perfect, and complete according to their kind, so that they wanted no
excellency, which belonged to created Spirits, and perfect intellectual
Natures: So doubtless they had naturally admirable power and strength given
them, as appears, Psalm. 103.20. Bless the Lord ye his Angels, mighty in
strength. One Angel invadeth a whole Camp of Soldiers, and in one Night
slays 185000 Men: their agility, speed and quickness is extraordinary; how
swiftly does the Wind fly through the Air, but these Spirits are far more quick
and active; and therefore the Cherubins are described with Wings, and so the
Seraphims also; yea, they are called a Flame of Fire, in regard of their
inflamed love to God. No doubt, they had a fullness of all perfection answerable
to their Natures, Power, Knowledge, quickness, perfect holiness, love to God,
joy in him unspeakable and glorious; and especially a most happy habitation in
the glorious presence of God, and Kingdom of Heaven. To this natural
perfection which all Angels had at first, and which the good Angels still have,
we suppose must be added a perfection of free Grace, whereby the Lord was
pleased to confirm some of them in their first estate, leaving some to
themselves, as he might justly have done all: for although the Lord did give
natural perfection unto all, yet he was not bound in justice to add his grace
of confirmation unto all or any; for that which is of grace, cannot be a due.
This I doubt not* was done in and through the Son, though not through his
Incarnation; not through him as made Man: for as God the Father made all things
through his Son; so he does all his works through him, and especially this work
of confirming the blessed Angels in their happiness; and therefore in this
respect he is the Head of the Angels also.

II. The number of the Angels is exceeding great: the Scriptures makes mention
of many thousands, and there are multitudes employed for the good of the Church
in all parts of the World. Howsoever! the number of these Stars of the third
Heaven (the blessed Angels) is as uncertain to us, as the number of those Stars
which are in the second Heaven: we must therefore leave it to God, as one of
his concealed secrets, who tells as well the number of the Angels, as of the
Stars, and calls them all by their proper Names.

III. As for the Office and employment of Angels, it is:

1. To attend on the Lord, and give him praise: I am Gabriel that stand in the
presence of the Lord, said the Angel, Luke 1. So in the Vision of Isaiah, the
Angels stood with their Wings, covering their Faces, and singing before the
Lord, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, all the Earth is full of his glory.
Isai. 6. So in Luke 2. the Angels join together in praising the Lord, and in
many places of the Revelations.

2. To go at the command of God: and so they are called Angels, that is,
Messengers: and the Angels both in the Hebrew and Greek are called Messengers:
so Angels were sent to Abraham, to Lot, to the blessed Virgin, to Zachary, to
our Savior: they are ready at a b^ck; as soon as the Lords pleasure is known
unto them, they fly at a word.

3. To defend the Church: He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep
thee in all thy ways. Psalm. 91.11, 12. They shall bear thee up in their hands,
lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a Stone: So the Angels defended
Elisha, against the Host of the Syrians; and there were more with him than
against him. Doubtless, the Church of God, and particular Members of it, do
receive great assistance, and protection from the holy Angels: and that (as I
conceive) not only in regard of outward* but also in respect of spiritual
Enemies. For I cannot conceive, but that the good Angels should as well suggest
good thoughts, as the evil Angels do evil thoughts: and as a Man has his own
corruption, and the temptations of the evil Spirits on the one side to draw him
into sin, so I am verily persuaded, that he has the graces of the holy Ghost,
and the assistance of the holy Angels, to help him against sin, and to stir him
up to obedience. And as Satan prevails not in tempting us to sin, unless our
Corruptions join with him: so I conceive, these holy Angels prevail not usually
in provoking us to good, unless the grace of the Spirit shall make their
persuasions effectual; these things we may conceive by Analogy, considering the
practices of evil Angels. And it may be thought, that those restraining
thoughts, which many times do bridle the rage of the wicked, so that it
breaks not out against the godly, even then when they have intended, and
begun to attempt mischief against them, are cast into their minds by the
Angels. -- As for the godly, I am persuaded, they are many times directed
strongly, by the secret suggestions of the Angels, for the avoiding of dangers,
and the obtaining of good: but whether every particular Christian has one
particular Angel, I cannot so well resolve you, though I know some there are,
that understand that place of our Savior, Mat. 18.10. to imply so much; where
Christ speaking of young Children, says; I say unto you, that in Heaven there
Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven. And here, by
the way, you may observe a special charge which the Angels have of Children,
helping those which are most helpless: and for my part, I am resolved, that the
Angels do especially guard young Children against a multitude of dangers, that
they are apt to fall into; yea, that they stand about our Beds, and keep us
sleeping; then especially defending us when we are most subject to danger.

4. Their Office also is to execute God's Judgments: so did an holy Angel on
Senacherib's Army: so did two holy Angels on Sodom and Gomorrah.

CHAP. 4.
Use 1. HEre meditate upon this excellent work of the All-sufficient Creator,
who being an Eternal Infinite Being, made these Immortal, but finite Spirits,
most like to Himself of all the Creatures that he made; therefore he rather
chooses to call himself by the name of these Creatures [ a Spirit] than by any
other; although indeed he is more properly called Jehovah, a Being in general,
than by the name of any Creature in special.

2. Admire him who has so many glorious Angels to attend him, whereof the
least is far more excellent than the greatest Earthly Monarch: admire his
Majesty, ^ho has so many thousand glorious ministering Spirits. Admire his
Goodness, who notwithstanding the multitude of these, is yet pleased to take
poor Men into his service; yea into the number of his Children, to partake of
his Inheritance for ever. Think then, if God call me to his service, it is for
my good, he needs me not. He that has thousands of Angels ready to do his
meanest service, needs not a Worm of the Earth to do his work.

3. In that these Angels are Spirits, and without Bodies, you may be assured,
that the spiritual delights and contentments are of all other the most
excellent: for the Angels have sweeter delights than all the Earth can afford;
and yet no delights of Eyes, of Ears, of Taste, Feeling, Smelling, etc. Nothing
whereof the Flesh is sensible; yet these have most abundant fullness of joy.
Labor therefore to get above these dull, earthly, sensual delights, and to
feast thy Soul with those sweetest, purest, highest contentments of the holy
Angels, in enjoying God, and walking with him, so shall thou have thy
Conversation in Heaven.

4. Moreover, let the perfections of the Angels teach thee humility of spirit:
let their knowledge keep thee from being proud of thine; let their holiness
make thee bewail thy pollutions; their speed and readiness make thee to lament
thy backwardness: And as thou prayest, so endeavor to do the will of God on
Earth, as these holy Angels do it in Heaven: do it readily and willingly, as
they do with winged affections: do it heartily and sincerely, as they: do it
universally in all things, and do it spiritually in the power of the spirit, as
these blessed spirits, who have no flesh at all to dull them in the work of the
Lord.

5. Let the hope of their society in that glorious Kingdom stir thee up to
seek this Kingdom; Oh that blessed day, when I shall for ever keep company
with so many glorious Spirits: let me despise all fleshly companions in
comparison of them.

6. Again, being Creatures, they are not to be worshipped; See thou do it not,
says the Angel to St. John: yet must they be reverenced, as the most excellent
servants of God, full of admirable graces; and especially we must reverence
them in carrying our selves at all times publicly and secretly, as becomes
such as will keep company with the holy Angels: so says St. Paul; the Woman
must not carry her self in unseemly manner, contrary to modesty, Not come with
her Head uncovered into the Congregation, because of the Angels, for they are
present in the Church Assemblies.

7. We must take heed (as not to grieve the blessed Spirit of God) so not to
grieve these his Ministering Spirits, who as they rejoice at the conversion of a
sinner, so they abhor the obstinacy of a sinner going on in his sins. Do
thou not do those things among thy sinful companions which thou would be
ashamed to do in the sight of some grave and sober Persons? How dare thou
then do them before the Angels? Nay, why art thou not ashamed to do them before
the very face, and in the presence of God?

8. Be thankful for that Protection which the Lord gives thee by these; and
with a thankful heart, bless Him for this Guard in thy Journeys, upon the way,
in thy Bed when thou sleep, in many sudden dangers; and believe assuredly,
that thou receivest much good by their means, which thou do not take
particular notice of, that thou escapest many dangers by their help, which thou
never fearedst.

FINIS.
