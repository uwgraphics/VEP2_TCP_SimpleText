2. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under
the earth. Thou shall not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them; for I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth Generation of them that hate me, and
showing mercy unto thousands, of them that love me, and keep my Commadments.

3. Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

4. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. Six days shall thou labor,
and do all thy work: but the Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in
it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
manservant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor the stranger that is
within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the
Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

5. Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long in the land,
which the Lord thy God gives thee.

6. Thou shall do no murder.

7. Thou shall not commit adultery.

8. Thou shall not steal.

9. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbors.


M. What do thou chiefly learn by these Commandments?


S. I learn two things, my duty toward God, and my duty toward my Neighbor.


M. What is thy duty toward God?


S. My duty toward God is, 1. To Believe in him; to Fear him, and to Love him
with all my Heart, with all my Mind, with all my Soul, and with all my
Strength. 2. To Worship him, to give him Thanks; to put my whole Trust in him,
to Call upon him. 3. To honor his holy Name and his Word. 4. And to serve him
Truly all the days of my Life.


M. What is thy duty toward thy Neighbor?


S. My duty toward my Neighbor is to Love him as my self, and to do to all
men as I would they should do unto me. 5. To Love, Honor and Succor my Father
and Mother; to Honor and Obey the King and all that are put in Authority under
him: to submit my self to all my Governors, Teachers, Spiritual Pastors and
Masters, to order my self lowly and reverently to all my Betters. 6. To hurt no
body by Word or Deed; to bear no Malice nor Hatred in my Heart. 7. To keep my
Body in Temperance, Soberness and Chastity. 8. To be true and just in all my
dealings; to keep my hands from picking and stealing, 9. And my Tongue from
evil speaking, lying and slandering 10. Not to covet nor desire other Men's
Goods, but to learn and labor truly to get mine own Living; to be content and
to do my duty in that state of Life unto which it shall please God to call me.

of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilat, was Crucified dead and
buried; he descended into Hell: the third day he rose again from the dead; He
ascended into Heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty:

goodness, to send his Grace unto me and to all people; that we may Worship him,
Serve him, and Obey him, as we ought to do. And I pray unto God, to send us all
things that be needful, both for our Souls and Bodies. And that he will be
merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins. And that it will please him to save
and defend us in all dangers Ghostly and Bodily. And that he will keep us from
all Sin and Wickedness and from our Ghostly Enemy; and from Everlasting Death.
And this of his Power he can, and I trust he will do, of his mercy and goodness
through our Lord Jesus Christ: and therefore I give Praise and Glory to him,
and say, Amen.

cannot perform them?

bound to perform. 1 Cor. 7. 14.
