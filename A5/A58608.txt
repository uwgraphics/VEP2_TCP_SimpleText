A DECLARATION OF THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES, Concerning Their Proceedings, in
opposition to the late unlawful Engagement against ENGLAND.

EDINBVRGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most excellent Majesty,
1648.

A DECLARATION of the Committee of Estates concerning their proceedings in
opposition to the late unlawful Engagement against England.
THe manifold dangers to Religion, to the Kings Majesty, to our Laws and
Liberties, and to the Peace of these Kingdoms are so manifest, that they
cannot be hid from any, who will not wilfully shut their eyes against a clear
light, and the remedies which we have taken in this extremity will, we doubt
not, be judged by all men of common equity and understanding, to have been most
necessary for preserving Religion from ruin, and our Selves from slavery and
oppression; Yet to prevent misinformation and misconstructions, we have thought
fit to publish a short narration of the Causes of our late undertaking to rise
in Arms, of our proceedings by way of Treaty with those that joined in Arms
for the late engagement against England, and of our Resolutions for settling
Religion, and the Peace of this distracted Kingdom, and strenthning the Union
betwixt the Kingdoms, which are the best foundations of Honor and happiness
to the King, whose throne we desire may be established in Righteousness.

When we look back upon some proceedings in our neighbor Nation, though there
we see that the work of Reformation has been much obstructed, and many things
have been done of which we cannot approve, and wherewith God was highly
displeased; yet we find the Fountain and Spring of all our troubles, mainly to
arise at home, from the craft and malice of our natives and Countrymen. For
notwithstanding the Right Honorable Houses of the Parliament of England, had
offered by their Commissioners to remove all differences which had arisen
betwixt them and Us, and to do what ever was just and Honorable for the
satisfaction of this Kingdom; And further, had declared their readiness to
join with this Kingdom in the Propositions agreed on by both Kingdoms
presented to the King at Hampton Court, for the making such further proceedings
thereupon as should be thought fit for the speedy setlement of the Peace of
both Kingdoms and preservation of the Union according to the Covenant and
Treaties. And further, to give satisfaction in all things which should be
judged necessary for the Peace of both Kingdoms, not intrinching upon the
particular interest of the Kingdom and Privileges of the Parliament of
England; yet many of this Nation having entered into a sinful Association, and
wicked combination, did join together in Arms under the command of the Duke of
Hamiltoun, for pursuance of an unlawful Engagement against our Neighbor
Nation of England, contrary to the ends of the solemn League and Covenant, the
manifold admonitions and exhortations of all the faithful Ministers of the
Gospel, the warnings and Declarations of the Commission of the General
Assembly 1647. As likewise against the unanimous proceedings of the late
General Assembly in this year 1648. against the Judgment and Protestations of
many members of Parliament, who have been most constant in the Cause, and to
preserve the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and generally against the minds and
judgments of all the well-affected in the Kingdom. And further, brought over
from Ireland some Regiments of the Scots Army to join with them in this
Engagement, contrary to the Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms of the seventh of
July, 1642. And having joined in an unlawful Association with the Malignants
of England, did employ some of them to surprise and take the Garrisons of
Berwick and Carlisle, (and yet professed openly before the World they were
ignorant who had done it) contrary to the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms,
and the Treaty of the 29 of November 1643. And when by miserable and cruel
oppression of the people of God in this Kingdom, they had gathered together a
numerous Army, they took possession of the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle,
and in a Hostile manner entered into our Neighbor Nation, where the Lord of
Hosts poured forth his Wrath and Indignation upon them, for their lies and
hypocrisy, as was before threatened by many of the faithful servants of God in
this Kingdom.

While these men were invading England, the Earl of Lanrick and others engaged
in the same design, stayed at home to oppress this Kingdom, and under a
pretense of raising a Guard for the Prince, did begin a new Levy of Forces,
whereby they might be able to send supply to their Army in England if need
were, but principally to bear down the godly and welaffected in this Kingdom,
and force upon them unlawful Bands and Oaths, which they devised to be
Ingines and Snares to compel men to make Shipwreck of their consciences, by
joining with all their wicked ways, or in case they refused to take those
accursed Oaths, and subscribe their Bands, that then they might not only be
incapable of all public trust, but be esteemed and used as enemies to
Religion, King and Kingdom, and so every way to oppress all honest men in
their persons, Estates and Consciences, as nothing was to be expected from
their Government to these who desired to fear the Lord, and adhere to their
first Principles, but Slavery and ruin; for they having adjourned the
Parliament till March 1650. Had assumed to themselves an arbitrary Power, that
in the mean time they might rule at their pleasure, and make such alterations
in the Kingdom as they thought fit. Upon news of the defeat of their Army,
they did give out Commissions to prime Incendiaries, and encouraged such as
were eminent and active in the Rebellion, under the conduct of James Graham,
late Earl of Montrose to rise in Arms, and sent directions to the Forces under
the command of George Monro, which had invaded England, but were not present at
the fight, and other Officers and Soldiers who escaped from it, to return to
this Kingdom, that so by their conjunction with the Forces lately raised, they
might have a new Army on foot to prosecute their former design, and to
tyrannize over this Kingdom, as is evident from their letters of the 28 of
August sent to the Earl of Marshall, Vicount of Dudhope, Clerk Register, and
George Monro (ten days after the defeat of their Army in England) wherein
speaking of the Engagement, they declare their Resolution to recruit their
Regiments, and to hazard their Lives and Fortunes, and all that was dearest
unto them for carrying on against all opposition whatsoever that pious and
loyal Service, and that they and many others of this Kingdom did intend not to
live and outlive it: By all which, and many other their like proceedings
expressed in the Declarations of the General Assembly and their Commissioners,
it is sufficiently evident that Religion has not only been endangered, but
the whole work of Reformation in these Kingdoms for these ten years past has
been very near to be wholly overturned, our Laws and Liberties almost
destroyed, Authority weakened, the person of the King put in hazard, and his
restitution (which they pretended) rendered more difficult, and endeavors used
to break the Union and peace betwixt the Kingdoms, and to continue (so far as
was in their power) a lasting War betwixt this Kingdom and our neighbor Nation
with whom we are joined in Covenant.

This being the true estate of affairs, We did find it most necessary for us
to join in Arms together against these Covenant-breakers and their Adherents,
who had invaded England, and were disturbing the peace of this Kingdom (and who
under a specious pretense of seeking the Kings Honor, Freedom and Safety, were
seeking their own Honor and base private ends, and have made the Kings
condition harder then ever it was before) this course being the only means
which was left us whereby to endeavor the preservation of Religion, our native
Country, and the Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and our own consciences
being ready to condemn us if we should sit still and suffer Religion to be
ruined, England to be further provoked (by detaining their Garrisons) and this
Kingdom to be enslaved and brought under the yoke of a perpetual bondage.

When we had put our selves in a posture for our own defense near Edinburgh,
the Earl of Crawford, the Earl of Lanerk, George Monro, and other Commanders of
the Forces joined with them, having marched to Inneresk, sent unto us some
Articles upon which they desired to Treat, for removing all differences betwixt
us; but these Demands being very unreasonable and inconsistent with Religion,
the Covenant and Treaties betwixt the Kingdoms, We refused to admit them to be
the subject of a Treaty; yet were content if they had any other thing to
propound which might conduce to the settling of Truth and Peace according to the
Covenant, to appoint some from us to Treat with the like number authorized by
them, at any place equally distant from both Armies, Whereupon they professed a
readiness to have all differences ended by a Treaty that an intestine War
might be prevented; but they assigned so short dyets for us to return our
Answers about the necessary circumstances to be agreed on before a Treaty could
begin, as the time was elapsed before we could be well conveened; and then they
took the advantage of marching away, whilst we continued in our Quarters in
expectation of a Treaty, by which means they gained the pass at Sterling, and
surprised our forces there, killing some, and taking others prisoners when they
were in security, being advertised that there was a Treaty betwixt us: All this
notwithstanding, so desirous were we of the peace of this almost ruined
Kingdom, as passing over all the provocations given unto us; We readily
entertained all proffers to Treat: And upon the 14. of September, Commissioners
on both sides met at Woodside, together with some Ministers and Elders from the
Commission of the Kirk, but after three days debate, that Treaty (during which
their Army was grievously plundering the Country) produced little else but
delays, they refusing to accept of any conditions without rewards for their
service, Liberty to transport the Irish Forces in a body to Ireland, security
for their Lives, Estates, Honors, Fortunes and places, and assurance that none
who had been accessory to the late Engagement should be questioned either by
us, or by the Kingdom of England for any thing done by them in relation
thereunto, which was impossible for us to grant without involving our selves in
the guilt of the Engagement, and giving occasion of quarrel against us to our
neighbor Nation, in whose names we could promise nothing without their advice
and consent. And here we cannot but remark, that these Lords and others, who in
Parliament and otherwise, pretended so great a zeal for his Majesty's Honor,
Freedom and safety, yet in all their demands to us in this Treaty, they never
made the least desire of any thing for the King, but were ready to close an
agreement with us when ever they could get satisfaction in what concerned their
own Honor, Freedom and Interest.

So soon as we understood that the Forces of the Parliament of England were
come to the Borders, for pursuit of the common Enemy, and reducing the
Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle, We wrote a Letter from Falkirk to the
Commander in chief of these Forces, and sent two from us with instructions to
acquaint him with the estate of our affairs, particularly our proceedings in
the Treaty, and to assure them that we would contribute our utmost endeavors
for the restitution of the Towns of Berwick and Carlisle to the Parliament of
England to whom they do of right belong: In return whereunto we received from
Lieut. General CROMWELL a Letter to this purpose, That upon the defeat of the
Forces of the Duke of Hamiltoun they had received in command to prosecute the
Victory until the Enemy were put out of a condition or hope of growing into a
new Army, and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle were reduced, in pursuance
of which commands they had resolved to advance into Scotland with their Army
for obtaining their Garrisons, and that the common Enemy might be the sooner
brought to a submission to reasonable conditions, withal engaging themselves
that so soon as they should know from us that the Enemy should yield to these
things we had proposed to them, and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle were
delivered, they should fortwith depart out of this Kingdom: after receipt of
this Letter, We sent some of our number with power and instructions to do their
utmost endeavor for obtaining the Towns of Berwick and Carlisle to be
surrendered to him for the use of the Honorable Houses of the Parliament of
England, and to represent our earnest desire and firm resolution to preserve
inviolable the Union betwixt the Kingdoms according to the Covenant and
Treaties; and since they had resolved in obedience to the Commands laid upon
them, to send Forces into this Kingdom for pursuing the common Enemy; therefore
to desire that these which should be sent, might be such as would give no
offense or scandal to the Ministry and well-affected in this Kingdom.

Upon the 18. of September some propositions were sent unto us from those at
Sterling, to which we returned an Answer upon the 20. And after a new meeting
at Kirklistoun with Commissioners from them, Articles of agreement were drawn
up and subscribed by the Commissioners on both sides, which are now published
in Print: In all which proceedings we have studied to set before our eyes the
Honor of God, and the good of Religion, the preservation of our Laws and
Liberties, and of the Union betwixt the Kingdoms. And to the end it may
further appear to this Kingdom and to all the World, that no sinister end or
worldly design for self-interest, has stirred us up to this course, we do
declare.

First of all, that we have both matter of deep humiliation before God, and
thanksgiving to him when we consider his gracious dispensation toward us, in
preserving a remnant from following the evil courses of the time, and that he
was pleased so soon after a great defection and backsliding in the Land, to put
us into a condition to resist the Force and fury of our enemies, whom neither
Christian duty in so clear a Sunshine of the Gospel, nor natural affection to
their native Country, could restrain from horrid impieties and intolerable
oppressions. And we do freely acknowledge that it had been just with the Lord,
to suffer us to lie still under that Yoke of Bondage, which we had wreathed
upon our necks with our own hands, by compliance with Malignants and Malignant
courses, not trusting the Lord with his own work, and resting on his strength,
but following the rules of carnal policy, whenever we were brought into
straights. It is the desire of our Souls that for the future we may amend, and
it shall be be our constant study with Gods assistance, to avoid the rocks on
which we were ready to split, that we may neither upon the one hand put
confidence in the Arm of flesh, and other worldly advantages when things are
prosperous, nor upon the other, comply with the enemies of the cause when we
are low, but in all estates and conditions, to put our trust in God Almighty
the Lord of Hosts, who also is only wise to give Counsel.

Secondly, that whatsoever Power God has already, or shall hereafter put into
our hands, we shall improve it for settling and propagating Religion, and
promoting the work of Reformation according to the Covenant, and in particular,
to have the Liberties of the Kirk ratified, which have been many ways
encroached upon and violated, as is particularly instanced in the Declaration
of the General Assembly.

Thirdly, to vindicate and establish the liberty and property of the Subjects,
who have been most grivously oppressed in their Consciences, Persons and
Estates.

Fourthly, that we shall endeavor the Kings Majesty's restitution to the
exercise of his Royal Power, as soon as he shall give security for settling
Religion in the manner expressed in the desires of the late Commission of the
Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things as shall be found
necessary for the Peace and safety of the Kingdoms.

Fifthly, That the late unlawful Engagement against our Neighbor Nation of
England, with whom we are joined in League and Covenant may be disclaimed, and
disavowed by the Supreme Authority of this Kingdom, it being most destructive
to Religion, and to the Peace and Happiness of these Kingdoms.

Sixthly, To strengthen and confirm the Peace and Union between the Kingdoms,
which the Malignant Party has so much endeavored to break and dissolve.

Seventhly, That we shall endeavor to Purge out of all the Judicatories in the
Land, Malignancy and Profaneness, and use all other good means that Justice
may be equally and Impartially administered to all the Subjects in the Kingdom,
and that a more effectual course may be taken throughout the whole Kingdom
then heretofore, for punishing and suppressing all Profaneness, Malignancy and
Impiety.

Eighthly, All means having been used with great industry, to get Malignants
chosen to be Commissioners to the last Parliament, and to prepossesse men's
minds when they came to the Parliament, from which as a Fountain have issued
all our troubles and distractions. That we will faithfully endeavor to have a
free Parliament, consisting of such Persons as have not been accessory to and
furtherers of the late Engagement, for which end, we do again hereby require
that in the election of Commissioners from Burghs and Shires to the Parliament,
the rules and directions set down in our Acts of the 22 of September last, and
the fourth of this instant Month of October, may be punctually observed
througout the Kingdom.

And we call the searcher of hearts to record that these are our real and true
intentions, and that we do not, nor shall by the Grace of God pursue any
private ends or interests of our own. And we trust, the Lord our God who
knows the sincerity of our resolutions, who has also had mercy upon us, and
has begun to do so graciously for us, will assist us herein until his work
shall be accomplished.

And now last of all, since it is agreed upon in the Treaty, that all questions
and differences about Religion, be referred to the determination of the
General Assembly or their Commissioners, and that all Civil questions and
differences be referred to the determiniation of a Parliament which is to sit
down before the Tenth of January next; We do exhort and require all and every
one of the Subjects within this Kingdom, to live Peaceable and quietly, and to
wait patiently for the determination aforesaid, but in case any shall not rest
satisfied with, or shall resile from the said agreement, and shall continue, or
rise in Arms, or Levy any Forces without warrant from the Committee of Estates
as it is now constituted, consisting of Persons not accessory to the late
Engagement. We do declare that they shall be esteemed enemies to Religion, the
King and Kingdom, and punished as wilful disturbers of the Peace of the
Kingdom.

Mr. THO. HENDERSON.

FINIS.
