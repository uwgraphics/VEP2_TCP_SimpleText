A New Song,
to the Tune of, the Granadeers March.
COme my Lads let us March away
let Drums beat and Pipers play
I think it a twelvemonth every day
Till the Rebels are Confounded
Their projects now we will defeat
were their force Ten times as great
Armed with justice we will them fight
tho with the fiends surrounded.
We Will drown Argile in the raging Sea
Bring Rampant Monmouth to his Knee
and Cuckold Gray to the Triple tree
with a number of Lay Elders
We Will dress the whole Phanatick Crew
some we will Roast and some we will stew
but the best will make the Devil spew,
I Will hold a hundred Guilders.
Methinks I see them trembling stand
gazing toward the Irish Land
expecting every hour a band
of hearty Loyal Fellows
But faith we will quickly make them know
we value not so mean a Foe
we have never a boy shall strike a blow
but a Traitors death shall follow
We now resolve t'extirpate all
every Root and Branch shall fall
that dos but smell Phanaticall
We Will have no more this trouble
Since we have been so often abused
the Devil a Rogue shall be Excused
with Tales we will be no more amused
their power's but a Bubble.
FINIS.
