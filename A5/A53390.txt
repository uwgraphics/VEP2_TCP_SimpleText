The ORANGE.
1
GOod people I pray
Throw the Orange away,
It Is a very sour Fruit, and was first brought in play
When good Judith Wilk
In her pocket brought Milk,
And with Cushings and Warming-pans labored to bilk
This same Orange.
2.
When the Army retreats
And the Parliament sits
To Vote our K -- the true use of his Wits:
'Twill be a sad means
When all he obtains
Is to have his Calves-head dressed with other men's Brains,
And an Orange.
3.
The sins of his Youth
Made him think of one Truth,
When he spawl'd from his Lungs, and bled twice at the mouth,
That your fresh sort of Food
Does his Carcass more good,
And the damned thing that Cured his putrefied blood
Was an Orange.
4.
This hopeful young Son
Is surely his own
Because from an O -- it cried to be gone
But the Heretics say
He was got by Da --
For neither K -- nor the Nuncio dare stay
Near an Orange.
5.
Since Lewis was Cut
From his Breech to the Gut,
France fancies an open-arse delicate Fruit;
We wiser than so
Have two strings to our bow
For we have a good Q -- that is an open-arse too,
And an Orange.
6.
Till Nanny writ much
To the Rebels the D --
Her Mother, good Woman, never owed her a grutch
And the box of the Ear
Made the matter appear,
That the only foul savor the Q -- could not bear
Was an Orange.
7.
An honest old Peer
That forsook God last year,
Pulled off all his Plasters, and Armed for the War;
But his Arms would not do,
And his Aches throbb'd too,
That he wished his own Pox and his M -- s too
On an Orange.
8.
Old Tyburn must groan,
For Jeffreys is known
To have perjured his Conscience to marry his Son;
And D -- s Cause
Will be tried by Just Laws,
And Herbert must taste a most damnable Sauce
With an Orange.
9.
Lobb, Pen, and a score
Of those honest men more
Will find this same Orange exceedingly sour;
The Q -- to be seized
Will be very ill pleased,
And so will K -- Pippin, too dry to be squeezed
By an Orange.
