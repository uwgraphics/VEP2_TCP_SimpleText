REASONS Against Establishing an East India Company, With a Joynt-Stock
exclusive to all others.
First, SUch a Company would be a great Monopoly, which has always been justly
Odious in the Eyes of the Law; for there would be in such a Case but one Buyer
of all the English Manufactures sent to India, and but one Seller of the
Commodities from thence.

Secondly, This will give such a Company opportunity to buy the English
Commodities cheap, and to sell the Foreign imported Commodities dear, both
which are to the Detriment of England. But on the contrary, the more Buyers
there are of English Commodities, and the more Sellers of Foreign, the first
will be sold the dearer, and the latter the cheaper: And to have Foreign
Commodities cheap, and our own dear, will by all Men be allowed to be our
Advantage.

Thirdly, If all were admitted to Trade thither, the Trade would be much
enlarged, the Industry of particular Persons would find our more Places of
Trade, (when themselves shall reap the benefit of their own Acquisitions) which
a Company with a Joynt-Stock will not be enduced to do, because they can get as
much by a small Trade as by a greater.

Fourthly, It seems against Common Justices, and the Birthright of
Englishmen, to exclude any of them from so great a part of the Trade of the
Nation, and that Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, Hull, Yarmouth, etc. should not
Trade to the East Indies from their own Ports as well as from London,

Fifthly, The Dutch do indeed Trade with a Joynt-Stock, but they give Liberty
to their own Subjects to Import all sorts of East India Goods into their
Country from England, or any other parts, except India: Whereas by the Act of
Navigation, no East India Goods may be brought into this Kingdom but directly
from thence. So that it will be in such a Companys Power to make us pay what
they please for their Imported Commodities, without any Remedy against it,
which makes it plain that the Subjects of England will then be in a far worse
Condition than those of Holland are under their Company.
