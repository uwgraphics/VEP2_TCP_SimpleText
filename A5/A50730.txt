PHIL. FERNELEY. Cler. Parliam.

May it please your Grace;
IT was truly said, in Numero, Pondere, and mensurae Creavit Deus omnia; His
Majesty, Gods Vicegerent intending a new Creation to this poor Kingdom, (for
who knows not the Chaos we have been involved in) has assembled these
Honorable persons that now attend your Grace, in Numero, representing the
Commons of this Kingdom, in Pondere qualifyed with judgment and experience to
treat and advise about the weighty Affairs thereof; In Mensura, according to
their mite, offering to his Majesty measure pressed down, and running over: This
Assembly have commanded me, (O that I could wave this word command, my own
inclination leading me to the ready performance of this duty,) but I must not,
I have received their command, a strict one, they have left me no discretionary
Latitude, they have entrusted me with a rich jewel to present your Grace, and
only recommended the moduling the case unto me: and this under a limitation
too; For rhey know that Logic sits at the forge and hammer, Rhetoric at the
file and polishing, and this in favor of the Laws they have forbid me, knowing
I ought not to practice in that mystery wherein I have not served out my time;
and though this be una, it is not unica ratio, for truth, and such a truth as
must be stamped by the authority of that House, they judge according to the
rules of Herauldry, it must be emblason'd in a plain co^t: Next Sir, the House
in this address follows not the tract of common principles; For, that beauty of
the universe we behold, arises out of jarring Elements, D^^c^rs concordia
^aetibus apta est; the most ravishing Harmony is composed of discords; But when
this House raises structure, the noise of a hammer must not be heard in the
building; when they set a lesson it must be perfected out of unisons: Nemine
contradicente is the Key of our descants, and by a Nemine contradicente I am
commanded this day to publish to your Grace, a, Dicite Jo Paean, and Jo bis
dicite Paean.

Welcome, welcome, welcome Great DUKE is the Anthem appointed by the House of
Commons for this great Festival; This is multum in parvo, and according to that
rule veritatis syllabas oportet esse breves: This is above the task of a single
tongue, Non mihi si centum lingu is centum oraque. No, so many faces as attend
your Grace, are the volumes in which this record of welcome is enrolled; Flesh
must be the Parchment, and blood the Rubric to register this day, without
Errata's, or any Index expurgaterius:

Our Prayers were, you might come, Our enquiries were, when will he come^ Our
joys must be complete to welcome you now you are come.

The Laconisme of Caesar's letter I have heard admired, who wrote veni, vidi,
vici; But Sir, You may write much shorter, and much truer, vici only, for so
forcible an operation has Your virrues, that many worthy persons this day, of
whom you could not write either veni or viai, have entertained an Honorable
contest who should first resign the devotion of their services to your
Commands; so that I may say, Hoc, Caelo commune tibi est, dux magne, deisque
Distantem influxu posse serire tuo.


I remember I thrice repeated your Graces Welcome; there is more of Logic than
Rhetoric in it, for there are three Estates concerned in it; The Lords
Spiritual have welcomed you into the bosom of the Church: The Lords Temporal
have welcomed you into the bed of Honor, The Commons do welcome you into the
recesses of their Hearts, perfumed with Loyalty to his Majesty, and with
submissive affection to your Person; What hinders then, But it be Enacted, But
here I want expression when I consider the divided passions of our Sovereign in
giving the Royal assent.

May it please your Majesty, you must either deny your self or deny us, and you
have rather denied your self, then you would deny us: you are contented though
under some impatience to want his Grace, rather then we should want him under
^spair: Th^n since we have the Royal assent, let your Gr^ces welcome be
Enacted, not by a temporary act, but to continue to us and our posterity.

But what a crowd of ingredients compound the present consistencie of our joys,
and even these have their just advantages; The Sun breaking forth from an
imprisoning cloud returns with a coveted light, and we are taught many times to
inhance the value of former enjoyments by their absence; this weakness of our
judgment being recompenc't with an improvement of our affection: Thus Sir,
when we considered you exiled from whatsoever might have yielded you a
sublunary satisfaction; when we consider you divorc't from your Lady, whom
Grace and Nature had fitted to transmit your Name and Honors to future ages,
in an issue like to you both; when we consider you ravished from those large
haereditary territories conveyed through the channells of ancient, pure, and
Noble blood; and not only thus divorc't from Rachel, but exposed to Leagh, to
a bleer-eyd condition, and for what crimes? your virtues were your crimes: This
is the imprisoning cloud; But now to behold you breaking forth with Rays,
Rays reflected from the solar aspect of his Majesty, Rays that awaken and
call up the sleeping virtue in the roots of the several interests in this
Kingdom, Rays that guild the Church, Rays that we doubt not but will
segregare heterogenea, burn up schisms, Heresies, and congregare homagenea,
wedde doctrine and discipline; Rays that warm the civil Government, Rays not
contracted to the Cedars of Lebanon, but proportionably influencing the lowest
shrubs, what return for such general benefits, then the general
acknowledgement of all the Commons in this Kingdom.

But Sir, in the Van of particulars, your care of that Religion professed in your
Mother Church opens our arms, and Encircles you in Embraces as fast, and
durable, as those with which you Embraced it: That Religion of which you use to
say; Illa meos, primum quae me sibi junxit, amores
Abstulit, illa habeat secum-servatque Sepulcro.


And had we no other instances of his Majesty's tenderness to this Kingdom,
nor other evidences of his, Religious S^ul this even this single act were
enough to confirm our affections and Loyalty, and to regulate our imitation: We
may well judge his Majesty expects us to write in a Canonical hand, by
sending us over such an Orthodox Copy;

Black mouth Detraction thou that feedest upon the consciences of Kings, and
gnawest the breasts of great Ministers of State, hide thy mouth in the dust;
this day thy Tragaedy bears date: Behold him placed over us by our Sovereign,
upon whom Temptations in the wilderness, in foreign parts, after many days
fasting in a necessitated condition, left no other Impression, then their foam
and malice: And Ireland hearken not unto unwarrantable fears (if any such be)
behold him that in his single Person dared the French Cardinals power, and rage
in rescuing that Illustrious Prince of fresh and glorious memory, the Duke of
GLOUCESTER from the snares laid for his tender years: What may thou not now
expect from him, armed with power, fenc't with Laws, and both designed by the
most religious of Kings, Nil desperandum tali duce and auspice tali:

Thus Sir you arrive to us Commissioned from God, for they that honor him, he
will honor them:

Religion has an unseperable companion, Loyalty: These are like Ruth and
Naomi, wheresoever thou go, I will go, and God having joined them in your
Grace I dare not separate them; This was Ariadnes Clue that led you through all
the Labyrinths and vicissitudes of your life: this has returned you to us with
the same countenance and complexion, Sic oculos sic ora ferebat, as when vou
left us, I wonder at those that wonder at it, for how should the face alter,
when the Hear, and noble parts retain their primitive healthful temper: How can
consumptive impressions seize that body that keeps within it self a feast, a
^east (with reverence I say it,) dressed by Gods one hand, for your good
conscience was a continual feast: God preserved you and reserved you for this
day, therefore your eye must not grow dim or your natural heat decay:

Impregnable Castles and walls of Brass are but Emblems of this single virtue:

The Poets fained that Jupiter, the better to compass his Rapes transformed
himself into several shapes; Fit Taurus, Cygnus, Satyrus, aurumque ob amorem:

Let the Fable go, but the Moral holds, that the usurped powers at home, and
confoederated powers abroad run all those Metamorphoses for the Triumph of a
single Rape upon your Allegiance, and all in vain, If we listen unto the S^ren
air of their Promises and Invitations, they are Swans, if we consider the
merit and weight of them, they are showers of Gold, they learnt the plausible
Dialect from their Father, all this will I give you, if you will fall down and
worship: If we reflect on their menaces, and (which is more) their practices
they appear in shapes more fierce, and antic, then Bulls, and Satyrs: But your
Grace made good by practice what deserves the praises of a speculative fancy,
be pleased to attend it, it is the Epistle appointed by the House for this
present day, Iustum and tenacem propositi virum,
Non civium ardor prava jubentium,
Non vultus instantis Tyranni,
Mente qualit solida, se fractus,
Illabatur orbis Impavidum,
Fereunt ruinae.


Your Grace knew you were a star, of the first magnitude in the guards of
CARLES his wain, and those must not be Erratick, but fixed: Thus you are
Commissioned from the King unto us, and then what shall be said, nay, what must
be done to the man, whom the King intends to honor:

Now be pleased to give us leave to lay aside these general Topics of Religion
and Loyalty, and to recreate our selves with the remembrance of those benifits
we enjoyed under your Graces government:

It was not still musik, or bonefires lighted for Triumph, that ushered your
Grace into your government; No, it was the warlike noise, of Trumpets, sounding
of Drumms, neighings of barbed Steeds, and the screeches of the half-slain that
Proclaimed your entrance upon a stage of blood: And when you were thus but a
Graduate in your Government, you were put upon terms of disadvantage and
necessity to dispute with the Doctors of the Chair, for your enemies wanted
neither dolus, or virtus: And if we who in a direct line partake of the
prudence of your Councels and the success of your sword should be silent, even
England that is but collaterally interested, might, nay, would upbraid our
ingratitude, since the Lords and Commons, assembled in Parliament, there
pregnant with the sense of your merits were humble suitors to his late Majesty
of ever glorious memory as an earnest of his further favors to confer on you
the honor and dignity of a Marquess, and that the rise of that honor might
survive to be at the instance of the Parliament in England, they presented your
Grace with a jewel to be worn upon your breast, the better to direct the
esteem of men to the inward-jewel-by the richness of the case.

Thus we enjoyed in the heat of war, the shades of peace until fatal divisions
among our selves, (and a divided Kingdom cannot stand) rent your grace from us,
and then when the shepherd was smote, how miserably were the sheep scattered?

But when your Grace saw this Royal vessel sinking, you leapt not into the Long
boat to make provision for your one safety: no, you made honorable and secure
articles for those that imbarqu't upon your account.

Many stand here this day that owe a lasting sacrifice to your piety, who
through age, wants, family dependancies, or the like only accompanying your
Grace with their prayers under the L^e of those articles in the continued
violence of those storms, Embayed themselves and their fortunes.

And yet when the flagging sayls carried you unwillingly from this Coast, when
you lost the sight, yet you retained the sense of this Land: Length of time, or
distance of place, could not abate the intensiveness of your spirits for this
Kingdoms good.

It is said that upon the dissection of Q. Mary in order to her embalming,
Callis was found written on her heart: I shall not dispute the truth, but sure
this is, Ireland at your Graces departure was ultimum moriens, and upon your
return Primum venens.

I shall pass by that familiar reception your Grace afforded to the
Commissioners of the General Convention of Ireland, (for the name of it I can
only say, aliquisque male fuit usus in illo) Neitheir shall I mention your
frequent and stedable advices, your constant readiness upon all occasions to
bring them into his Majesty's presence: I forbear your Graces passionate and
repeated Questions, How little Benjamin did? how all things were in Ireland?
whether the old man was liveing? how our fundamental Laws were administered: And
in the conclusion of all, how careful you were to teturn us with our moneys in
our sacks mouths, with his Majesty's gracious Declarations, and Instructions,
so that the addresses from this Kingdom went out like the Bow of Jonathan that
never returned empty.

Witness the address from this House by their Commissioners to his Sacred
Majesty, in reference amongst other things, to that great Bill of Settlement,
(for that adopted title it retains) Sir, I am not this day speaking of his
Majesty, we still praemise, Rex nobis haec otia fecit: of him we say, Omnium
domus illius vigilia defendit, omnium otium illius labor, omnium delitias
illius industria, omnium vacationem illius occupatio; His Majesty is the Spirit
that moves the wheels, and Wear now upon one of the Master-wheels, and happy
is the Kingdom when the wheels moves as the Spirit moves; His Majesty is the
waters of healing, and we applaud a tutelar Angel that stirred the waters, and
helped in this paralytical Kingdom in the crowd of Patients: And here give me
leave to remember the five fold mess of your time that you afforded Benjamin:
Did the morning require your Graces attending in Parliament? IRELAND must be
first served: Did afternoon Committees pray in and to your advice? IREIAND must
be first served; were there particular causes designed for hearing at the
Council Board? you have succesfully employed your mediation that IRELAND might
be first ferved: when clauses and Proviso's were offered to be inserted in that
great Bill, your first care was to see if they were Declaration touch, and held
them up before it, as the E^gle to try the legitimation of her brood, dares
their eyes with the Sun beams; and in the throng of such addresses, I have
observed your Grace in civility to hear all persons, but in justice to see
none; And if upon pretensions of Profit, any intrenchments upon the Declaration
had been offered, your Grace knowing the nature of your Great Masters standard,
wherein a carack of honor, outweigh'd pounds of profit, you endeavored to
transmit the Bill as a seamless coat.

And now Sir, I need not have recourse to any Rhetorical Figure, to make that
great Bill to speak; your Grace may take notice, that as, many days you waited
upon it, so it has to this day waited upon your Grace; It remembers how often
when it was in the Cradle and swaddling bands, you visited it; It remembers
when it was in the state of its minority, and under a Committee of the Council
Board, how faithful and tender a Guardian you was to it: It remembers how
powerfully instrumental you was to give it a body, and now waits until your
Grace by the Royal assent breath a Soul into it.

It is now time to take in my sails, and make ready an anchor, especially
since me thinks I see a cloud rising upon your brow; I know your Graces temper,
that you place your reward as well as your recreation in doing good, and not in
hearing of it being done; But be pleased to remember, it is the Commons of this
Kingdom speak, and then, Vox populi, nay more, Vox populi Dei, is Vox Dei; As
they are the great enquest to present criminals so they are the great records
to preserve virtue and merits: Could your Grace have been contented to have
acted less, my Commission would have been to have (...) less; But it is fit we
give your Grace an Essay of that obedience that so unanimously we devote to
your Commands; and therefore, I shall only add, That as this House most
submissively acknowledges the repeated obligations from his Majesty; so they
look upon this as the fermentation of them all, that he has put those Laws and
Estates he has so graciously bestowed on us, under your Graces Government and
Protection: And that while it shall seem expedient to his Majesty, to continue
us in a Parliamentary way, His Majesty shall find the effects of his great
wisdom and goodness in giving your Grace unto us, a Governor after our own
hearts; That so, as we have been happy in your Grace, your Grace may be happy
in us, and the union of both these, Center in the ever prayed for happiness of
his Majesty, and his other Kingdoms.

FINIS.
