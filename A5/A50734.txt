Sir Audley Mervyns Speech.
Most Great and Honorable Lords,
THe Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, in Obedience to Your Lordships Commands,
according to their ancient Custom and Privilege, proceeded to the Election of
their Speaker: and passing by many persons of signal Abilities, and long
Experience, (for truly that House is furnished with excellent choice,) have
fixed their eye of favor and affection upon me the meanest Member of that
great Assembly; It were ominus they should thus limine impingere, but that they
know such is the prudence and circumspection of that House in the Mannagement
of their Affairs, that they can suffer no prejudice by the disabilities of any
one Person serving and observing their Commands: Thus have I seen a tender
Parent placing one of his little ones before him in the Saddle, and seemingly
intrusting the Raines in his hands, when secretly the Command rested in his
own, (an act evidencing Affection without impeachment of his Care:) I then
offered my aid Prayer, that no further proceedings should be herein Rege in
consulto, and then blushingly led them into such recesses where my ambash't
infirmities had so long secured themselves, (though without drawing of the
Curtains the Scene of my Errors was too too visible.) Were it but to design a
Pilot to a Fly Boat betwixt Dover and Callis, the Consultation were not of much
Importance, but when a Ship of the second rate is to be rigd forth, for a long
Voyage (for all that we know) through Flats, contrary Tides, and we are not
sure of a Trade wind; it is your care (GREAT LORDS,) though the Mariners
hazard their own lives, and Cargazoon with the Pilot of their own choice
Communi saluti Prospicere: I hope to hear the voice of your Lordships to them
saying, O Navis referunt in Mare te novi fluctus
o quid agis! fortiter occupa portum


Wherefore most Honorable Lords, with Confidence equal to my Humility, I beg
that your Lordships would be pleased to give me a supersedeas and discharge
from a burden so disproportiohable to my strength; Give me leave to put off
Readiness Armor before You, and be pleased to lay your profitable Commands upon
the Commons to improve their second inquiry amongst themselves, (there is many
a Saul taller by the head and shoulders then my self hidden amongst the stuff,)
and to present a person, upon whose very appearance in this place, your
Lordships may warrantably conclude this is the Man whom the House of Commons
intends to honor.

Here the Lord Prmiate of Ireland Speaker of the House of Lords declared in a
short, pithy and eloquent Speech the Lords Justices approbation of the Speaker:
who then proceeded.

Most Great and Honorable Lords: I find my aid Prayer over ruled, and a
Procedendo issued: I crave leave to chide my self, I only considered Terminas
ad quem when I appealed to Caesar, and reflected not upon Terminus a quo the
House of Commons: may this hour of this day guide all the days of our
continuance, that the Commons may never present that Prayer unto Caesar, to
which Caesar may not cheerfully say, Amen; Now my Devotion instructs me with a
mannerly Thesis, Obedience is better then Sacrifice: The Voice of your
Lordships Confirmation has silenc't the whispers of my Fears: The Stamps of
Kings pass vulgar Metals beyond their intrinsic value; I humbly submit, and
dutifully welcome this pleasing force; Fax grata est, gratum vulnus, mihi grata
cataena
Me quibus astringit laedit, and urit amor;
Sed flammam extingui sanari vulnera, solvi
Vincula, non possum, si modo posse velim:


And therefore in the first place, (A love principium) I bow my knees, and
raise my Heart to Heaven, that he that loses the stammering tongue, and was a
mouth unto Moses, will fill my heart with wisdom, and my mouth with wise
sayings; And thou O Lord, who stand in the Congregation of the mighty, and
judge amongst the Gods, who have signed the Original Command of this Trust
upon Me, Da Domine quod jubes, and jube quod vis.

Here I might wind up all with those usual and necessary requests in the behalf
of those that sent me, but give me leave to recollect my self. Can I be in this
mount of transfiguration and not say let us build 3 Tabernacles, and put on
this Inscription, Bonumest esse hic; Your Lordships being 3 Persons of Honor,
yet making up the representation of one, and that the best of Monarchs, may
warrant me to apply Ternarius Numerus est facer: Let no man be offended that I
call it a Mount of Transfiguration: Have we not th^se many years been walking
through the Wilderness without a Moses, without an Aaron? Has not our Flesh
been torn with Briars, and our Loins whipped with Scorpions? has not the tale of
our Brick been doubled, and provision of Straw exacted at our own hands? Has
not our Fountains, Fountains of living water been dammed up, or poisoned, and
not a Prophet left to heal the waters, and We in the interim forced to draw out
of Cisterns and muddy pits? Has not the Parliaments of this Kingdom been
carried into Captivity, and our Senators that should be, become Perepateticks
and Pilgrims to titulary Conventions: when we asked for Fish, have not they
Voted Scorpions? and when we have Petitioned for Bread have they not given us
Stones: and is not this place then a Mount of Transfiguration? Has not Our
dread Sovereign Lord the King, (of whom the world is not worthy) been banished
into Foreign Countries, so that he might take up that expression, The Foxes
have holes, and the Birds of the air have nests, but the Son and undoubted Heir
of three glorious Kingdoms, nay the native and lineal King of them had not a
place to rest his head in: but praised be that God that at the same time he
made a hard stone to be his pilow, sweetened his repose with heavenly visions:
and is not this place now a mount of transfiguration? Where were those Regalia
we now behold: that robe of Majesty before Your Lordships, was the Garment for
which they cast lotts: that Sword, of which it may be said, Non est alter
Talis, whose edge was sharpened, and whose point steeld by a Heavenly sanction,
was transformed into a bloody ax, to behead 3 Kingdoms at one stroke; That
single Cap of Maintenance could never fit that Bellua multorum capitum: Thy
Lions O England roated not out of Courage but for Hunger: Thy Lion O Scotland
was not rampant: The Flower-de luces withred; And thy Harp O Ireland, thy
discomposed Hup was hung upon the Willows; But now you hear the Silver strings
of it touched by another David sounding Heavenly Anthems: Glory be to God on
high: Peace unto Men; Glory be to God on high, the Church settled, Peace unto
Men, Your Estates and Liberties secured: and is not this that your eyes now
behold a Mount of Transfiguration?

Draw near You House of Commons, behold a King! Poets faind Caelum and Terra to
be the Parents of Sovereignty, shadowing out to us its Divine Institution, and
Humane approbation: the Nativity of Charles the Second Intitles it self to that
truth, Iam nova progenies Caelo demittitur alto. there is Divine Institution,

It is reported that in that Latitude where the son makes a discontinuance to
his Plea of Governing the World for six Months successively, that the
Inhabitants at the time of his return clime to the tops of the Mountains, and
ravished with his praevius refractions, cry aloud he is coming, he is coming:
But how did his Majesty's Subjects upon the guilding of our Horison by his
happy ristitution make Mountains of men, and built up many Stories high upon
one another Shoulders, How did the lame take up their beds and walk,
Glorifying God, He is come, he is come; there is Humane approbation: Nay, but
behold your King (...): Behold your King, that solar Plannet culminating in the
house of his Exaltation, sitting either Personally or Representatively in his
Parliament. Do you not yet see him, why then feel him: what say your Lives? Do
they not feel the influence of his Metcy; Has not every Chest a Pardon as well
as a Pattent in keeping? What say your Estates, do not they feel him: has not
every Chest a Patent as well as a Pardon in keeping, nay, have not the greatest
part of your Estates in this Kingdom felt his power of creation, raising up
Estates out of nothing? What say your Liberties, do not they feel him; the
Prisons, those living graves have yielded up their dead, an Iron fetters and
shackles about the legs, are Metamorphised into Golden Chains, and Collers of
SS about the neck: But what if his Majesty's Necessities be great, You feel
them not, none shall then share in that sense with himself: True it is, that
the General Convention in this Kingdom humbly presented his Majesty with 20000.
Pound, (but a cluster of those Grapes whereof the Vintage is yet behind,) and
has he not lately returned us 50000. Pounds to pay that Army which secureth
Us: If the Servant that improved his Masters Talent had the Eulogium of Euge
bone serve,, when the Master improves thus the Servants Tallent, shall not We
say Euge bone Domine, Rex Carole secunde: If theer be any yet weaker then
Didymus, that neither seeing nor feeling will raise him up; will you hear your
King: The voice of a King is like the roaring of a Lion, and yet this voice we
never heard, though when he has been amongst the Beasts of the Forests, he is
to be heard in a still voice; If any hot Spirited Disciples move for fire to
come down upon Samaritains (for we have had Samaritains) how gently does he
reprove them: You know not what temper you are of, For I came not to destroy
but to save: Will you hear him speaking in his Gracious Declaration for
Settling of Ireland, (that Systeme of what are transcendent in him, his Mercy
and Justice,) his own hand set that Declaration as the Book. Song for thy Harp
O Ireland to be tuned unto, and by it has improved thee to play broken notes
in a harmonious Concord: who ever saw impatience sit in his Royal brow, but
when he remembered thee O Ireland, when he remembered that thou were mourning
when his two other Kingdoms were rejoicing: with what exemplary wisdom did he
unravel thy complicated Interests, how tenderly did he bind up thy wounds with
his own hands: He did not send his Stick to lay upon the dead Child, but
stretched himself upon it to bring it to life: thy cure was painful, ay and
costly two, to purchase a Kingdom to Us, he gave a Kingdom from himself: But
know great Sovereign, such giving, shall be but sowing seed in fruitful ground,
and Your Subjects hearts shall lade Your Arms with full Sheaves.

I asked one Question, did you see your King? give me leave to add another: Do
you not see the King of Kings, for behold, a greater then Solomon is here: when
God writes, Faith and Duty must be our spectacles to read; I invite you not to
read a Mean Mean Tekel Peers, but Hephzihah and Beulagh, for the Lord
delights in thee, and thy Land shall be married.

Astrologers have made Divinations from the fiery Trigon, and the conjunction
of Saturn and Jupiter as to the condition of Our King and his Kingdoms: bleer
eyd men could you not see when Our King was wrapped up in the swaddling bands of
Majesty, and after Worcester Fight laid in a Manger; Could you not see a Star
over the place, the Wise men did see it, and did foretell that God had snatched
him as a Firebrand out of the Fire, and designed him to be a Crown of Glory in
the hand of the Lord, and a Royal Diadem in the hand of his God; Did you not
see the Pillar of Fire with the bright side lighting the King in his Dangerous,
Wearisome, and dark escape, with the sable side of it to Pharoh and his
persecuting troops? Did you not see the Pillar of Fire by night, and the cloud
by day, guarding his Majesty through Flanders, Germany, Spain, France? Did not
God hide him in the hollow of his hand, and shut him up like a Ioas in his
Temple, or which is more, shut up his Temple in him: warrantably may he be
styled, Defender of the Faith, whose Faith defended him: but here Quid memorem
infandas caedes, quid facta Tyranni
Effera --


How did his Majesty's enemies consult with Satan's rules of Policy to have
destroyed his Body and Soul: corrupt nature under the pressures of long-visaged
necessities, if not restraind by a divine power, will close with the worst of
means that may promise a deliverance; Satan knew that after 40. days Fasting,
and in a Wilderness, was the Critical hour to foment a temptation; One of the
best of men, prayed against adversity, lest he might put forth his hand unto
iniquity; Great and Dread Sovereign, must no Nation be at Peace with England
that would give you a receptien, must your own natural Members be cut off if
they paid but a little sustenance to You their head? It has been so, and its
as true, that France, Spain and Germany, if You would have fallen down and
worshipped, if you would but have exchanged the ancient Apostolic for the Roman
Catholic Faith in Your Title, would have paved the way with their Crowns and
Scepters to your throne: Did not the Serpent say, These engagements were fair
and pleasant, and if you would but taste it, You should be as one of those
Gods; But Sir, you know in whom you trusted, therefore are you not ashamed, You
read, and believed that place I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it
shall be no more, until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him: Thus
(My Lords) We have seen, and We do see, and may we ever see, the King of Kings
owning our King, he has sent us Our King without allay, tried at his own
beam, Heaven toutch.

Now my Lords, give me leave to take a nearer survey of this goodly structure
now before my eyes: Did the beholding of the contracted foundation of the
second Temple draw tears from he eyes of the ancient men, who considered the
Glory and Magn^ficence of the former, and may not this be a day of rejoicing,
when we see our Stakes strengthened, our cords lengthned, an the splendid
uniformity of this House such, that we may say, many have done excellently, but
this excels them all.

In the first and highest place, are your Lordships representing unto us the
best of Kings, CHARLES the second, by the grace of God, King of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland; His Majesty in designing this honor to You, was
of the same spirit with a great King who enjoined -- se nemo prater Apellem
Pingeret --


But your pleasing task is more difficult, You are to draw the picture of a
Kings Soul, one of the vastest Souls this day living: Government is the Soul of
the body Politic; You have done it, and you have done it to the life; I am
glad to see you look up to Heaven with us all, and praise that hand that guided
yours, though your hand held the pensil: We have several lights, and you have
drawn him so, that in what light soever he is placed, he is amiable and
ravishing, and that we all say -- sic oculos, sic ora ferebat

His Majesty knew the Irish Seas run high, and the stearage was not to be put
in foremast men's hands: Few at the time of your Lordships entrance upon the
Government durst take the helm; It was a dark night, a long night, a stormy
night, the wind scant and high, a lee shore; Some Coroners and Constables were
your best Mariners, not a Sherif, not a Justice of Peace (strong ligaments of
English Government) was in this Kingdom: Every man did what was good, or rather
what was evil in his own eyes; for Religion we were Tenants at will: Our
Oracles, the Courts of the Law were shut up, and Your Lordships, who have very
attentive Ears, could hear now and then some picking of Ianus his lock A
Soldiery under great Arreares, and little or no Money to satisfy them, the
greatest part of the Estates of the People unsecured, an universal decay of the
Trade: was not this Kingdom full of combustible matter, and dark-lanthorn
spirits in it to put all into flame? What ticklish ground was this for a
strange and unsteady hand to have adventured a cast on? But your Lordships have
layn near the mark, may you save your own stakes, as you have secured Ours, who
have, and still desire to bett upon Your hands; The Soldiers obedience you
have improved beyond a Gospel praecept, to be content with little or no wages,
and you have so sweetly fixed the planetary worship of God (for did not we
sacrifice under every green tree,) in its own orb moving with that regular
decency, that no sooner the foot is over the threshold, but the tongue says,
sure this can be no other place but the House of God.

Vssah was not excusable for putting his hand forth to relieve the tottering
Ark; though my intention is, and my actions have ever witnessed, nothing is so
dear to me as his Majesty's Interest, yet I know we are to advise de arduis,
not de arcanis Regni; but sure I may say, and ground it upon Vox populi Dei, is
Vox Dei, that amongst the inestimable favors we have received from his
Majesty, this is not the least, that he has been pleased to give us your
Lordships Our Governors (under him,) that are bone of our bone, and flesh of
our flesh, sympathy in sufferings, heightnes not only an Intercession for
relief, but propounds the most suitable remedies for it; Non Ignara mali miseris
succurrere disco,

By your Prudent, Vigilant, and constant care Justice has run down like a
stream, and Righteousness as mighty waters, and we are assured that his Majesty
will receive that satisfaction by You, and We in You, that the ages to come
(premising Rex nobis haec otia fecit), will call You the Repairers of Our
breaches, and the Restorers of our Paths to dwell in: I have no more to say,
but since we see his Majesty here but as in a Glass, You are Glasses without
spots.

Next are placed upon your right hand, the most Reverend, Learned, (and that
which ferments all,) pious Prelates, They have not only Bells to make a sound
in the Pulpit, but Pomegrannets to bear fruit answerable in their lives. When
God compleats a blessing unto a Nation, he restores not only David their King,
but their Teraphim; Sad experience has stamped an observable truth upon a
Proverb, No Bishop, no King: Many years we flourisht under both consenuere
pares: and one fatal blow destroyed them both, una duos nox perdit amantes: It
is observed of the Heliotrop, it opens upon the Suns rising, and contracts it
self upon the Suns setting, whatsoever the Fable is, the Moral is true, Sol
occubuit nox caca sequta est, a sad night when the Screech-Owls laid their
Eggs in the Eagles nests. These are the Golden Candlesticks filled with the
Oil of Spikenard, These are the Spiritual Champions that stand in the breach.
and with Reverence, I may say, combat God Almighty when our National sins
alarm him to vengeance: Hold up their hands and Israel prevails, but if you
will not support them, (have we not found it so) Ameleck prevails: These with a
sacred violence bind up the omnipotent hand, They are Princes that prevail with
God: These are Stars in Gods right hand, mad men: (Pardon me my Lords, I hope
there are none such here, but mad men they are that think to pull a star down, a
star in Gods hand, a Star in Gods right hand; Are you not yet satisfied, when
you had buried our spiritual fathers, and rould a stone upon the Sepulcher, and
seated it, and set guards of Soldiers to watch the Sepulcher, that beholding
their Resurrection this day, you will not confess digitus Dei est hic; Now no
rude hand snatches up the holy Censer, and smoaks Heaven with unhallowed
Flames; This is Aarons rod that eats up the Magicians rods: what is the
affluence of all worldly enjoyments, when we lie under a spiritual famine: Lord
though thou give us the bread and water of affliction, let never Our Teachers
be any more driven into corners: And blessed be thy womb O Church of England,
the superfaetation of thy womb, that has supplied us with such a recruit,
whose faces shine as having talked with God in the Mount: If your Lordships will
have Religion to be a Target to you, be sure you be a Buckler to it.

On your left hand are ranckt the Nobles: of these it may be said, they are
ornamentum belli and firmamentum pacis: their Robes are fit for Counsel, their
Swords for War, they are medium conjungendi tincturas nearly related to the
King in honor to the Commons in their Liberties and Substance, in that
aequidistancy placed as they overshadow not Royalty, nor oppress not the
Commonalty.

Great Peers, I may say of our unsettlement, aliquisque malo fuit usus in illo:
Never had you such an advantage given you to perfume and embalm your memories
to posterity, as to exert your wisdom and courage in this juncture of time:
Blazon your coats destinct, but during this Parliament have one only motto,
Pro Rege, lege Grege: You are rich jewels in your selves, but never so well set
as in this House.

A fence and outwork to the Throne sit the grave and learned Judges, while
these Fortifications are kept in good repair, the Citadel of strength and
Majesty is safe: these keep the perpendicular beams of exalted prerogative,
(but praised be God we fear it not in our temperate zone) from scorching, and
sprinkle such distillations of Grace from his Majesty's Goodness that Our
Liberties Bud, Blossom, Knit, and are in a perpetual Spring Tide; These have
studied upon Mount Ehal and Gerasim, They can denounce and make the nocent feel
the rigor of the Law, and the innocent the blessings of Peace; You are the
Kings feoffees in trust, and the people are the Cestique use: you govern the
two most comprehensive syllables in the World, Meum and Tuum; You are the Lions
supports, Solomon's throne, Iustitia firmatur solium, and nusta est tam misera
servitus quam ubi jus est incertim and vagum.

But stay! I see a glittering Constellation, though of lesser Stars the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, the representative of the Commons of this
Kingdom: These are the Guards of CHARLES Waine, and move upon the poles of
Loyalty and Love: These are no Plannets or Erratick Stars, but such as will
fight in their order against every Sisera: of these Stars it may be said Astra
negunt Homines --

Of these Stars it may be said Sed negit Astra Deus.

In this body politic, the Head cannot say it stands not in need of the Feet,
keep the Feet from stumbling, and we may secure the Head, and all other parts
of the Body from falling: Of these Feet we cannot say, they are like
Nebuchadnezzars image, whose Head was Gold, but the feet of Clay; But We can
truly say of them, How beautiful are their feet that bring us the glad tidings
of peace; Their purses are not tied with Gordian, but True-Loves knots: Some
have their hearts where their treasure is, we have our treasures where our
hearts are, and truly our hearts are so comfortably lodged in his Majesty's
hand, as we are resolved to take our lives in our own hands to assert this
truth: In one word I may warrantably say, Since Ireland was happy under an
English Government; there was never so choice a collection of Protestant fruit,
that ever grew within the walls of the Commons House; Your Lordships have piped
in your Summons to this Parliament, and the Irish have danced; How many have
voted for, and signed to the Returns of protestant Elections, so that we may
hope for, as we pray, that Iaphet may be persuaded to dwell in the Tent of Sem.

Now what remains, here is water, what hinders but we may be baptized: here are
all the promising instruments that can make this Kingdom happy: You have the
best of Kings, the most Religious of Clergy, the most Honorable of Nobles,
the most learned of Judges, the most Loyal of Commons: would you have
protection, seek and find it in the King, would you have Piety your field, and
Honor and plenty your Supporters, and Heaven your Crest, these Spiritual
Heralds will blazon you a Coat of immortality: would you be truly Noble, ask
and inquire amongst the Peers, and you will have choice of Originals to copy
after; would you learn Christian Obedience, and submission to Authority, not
for wrath but for Conscience sake, knock at the door of Commons and it will be
opened to you, and you shall see them building with trowels in one hand
(exercising a profitable industry to support the Wealth, and cement the Peace
of this Kingdom,) and with Swords in the other hand, to defend their David and
their Teraphim.

Most Great and Honorable Lords, I said Bonum est esse hic, but I promised
only to build Tabernacles; I fear I am not only guilty of a purpresture, but
that I have held over beyond my term, I shall leave this Mount of
Transfiguration, and retire into Our Valley, a Valley I hope of Vi^^ons, a
Valley joining to the foot of this Mount; We are two Houses, but both under one
roof: One of the Belgic Provinces gives 2. Earthen Pots floating in the Ocean,
with this Motto Si Collidimur fraugimur. But I trust there shall be no noise of
a hammer in our building: No, Shiboleth must be put to the Question. But the
God of peace grant that we may hold the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
Peace, and establish our hearts in unity one toward another, and in immovable
Duty and Loyalty to our Sovereign and natural Lord the King, for whom we pray,
Serus in Caelum redeas diuque,
Laetus intersis populo Britanno
Neve te nostris vitijs iniquum
Ocyer aura
Tollat hic ames dici pater atque
Princeps:


I have but one word to add in the behalf of those from whom I am entrusted,
that are humble suitors unto your Lordships.

That in respect we are elected here to attend the weighty Affairs that may be
cognisable before us, which will require our united not distracted thoughts,
that neither our Persons, or our Servants, or our Asses that we leave at the
foot of the Mount, (the allegory will hold, for if obedience be better then
sacrifice, we are offering up a sacrifice) may be molested, but that we may be
freed in our persons and goods from all arrests according to our ancient
privileges. In the second places, that since such will be the weight and
intricacy of matters debatable before them, and that Parliamentary truths are
hid as fire in flints, only visible by collision, that we may according to our
ancient privilege have liberty and freedom of speech; it is liberty not
licentiousness we ask for, the moderation and wisdom of that house, desires no
further a legitimation of their language, then what is the natural issue of
sober reason and discretion.

Lastly, that when the nature of their affairs are such, that further
proceedings cannot be until the Golden Scepter be held forth, that your
Lordships upon their humble suit will afford, them (with respect to your better
leisure) access unto you.

But here it troubles me that the consciousness of my own guilt forces me, that
am entrusted with the Orders of that House, to make the first inrode upon them:
Free and general Pardon should be a closing Act, but such have been my errors
already committed, (crimes I would not willingly own,) that I humbly beg your
Lordships Free and General Pardon.

FINIS.
