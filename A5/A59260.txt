A BOOK OF Perspective and Geometry, BEING The ABC, and first degree of all
good ART. THE Learning of which comprehends in it many Notable Arts, needful
and necessary for every Artificer and Workman. For as no Perspective Workman
can make any Work without Architecture, so neither can the Architecture without
Perspective. WHICH PERSPECTIVE IS Inspection or looking into by shortning of
the sight, making it to show further then in effect it is. Which Subtle and
Ingenious Art, being difficult and troublesome to be set down in writing, and
especially the body or model of things which are drawn out of the ground. For
it is an Art which cannot be so well expressed by figures or writings; as by
undershewing, which is done severally, beginning with small things and so
proceeding to greater, till the full Art be perfectly showed. In which is
showed in figures and by reason, as much of Perspective Art, that if the
Workman will, be may declare his conceit or purpose by Reasons and Figures. And
seeing Perspective Art is nothing without Geometry, they are both bound
together, that the Workman may be able to aid and help himself therewith. AND
Forasmuch as the hand cannot effect the understanding of the mind, I shall not
please thereby such as are curious, yet at least I shall help young beginners
that know little or nothing thereof.

This Second Book of Architecture made by SEBASTIAN SERLY, entreating of

THE SECOND BOOK Treating of PERSPECTIVE: IN Which is showed in Figures and by
reason, as much of Perspective Art; that if the Workman will, he may declare
is conceit or purpose by Reasons and Figures.
FIRST, To the end that men by small mattere may attain to greater, therefore
I will begin to show how to shorten a four-corner'd thing, from whence all the
rest shall be derived. Then the Base of this apiece thing, shall be A G,
and the height of the Horison (as I said before) shall be imagined according to
the sight, and that shall be P, whereunto all the lines do run, as the lines of
the sides A P and G P, then at the one end of the Quadrant you must set a
Perpendicular line, which is G H, which done, then draw the Base A G K long
enough, and then out of the Horison draw a Parallel or an Equidistant line from
the Base, as far as you will that the eye or sight shall stand from that which
you will look on; for how much the more you will have the four square thing to
seem shorter, so much further you must go with your sight I from H to behold
the apiece thing. And then, taking H I for the distance, from the point I
to the corner A draw a line, and where the line cutteth through the
Perpendicular line H G, that is on B, there the termination of the shortning of
the four square thing shall be, as you may see in the figure ^. But if you will
make more four squares one above the other, upon the same Horison or point;
then you must draw another lien from the shortning point of the apiece or
Quadrant, to the letter I, and where it cutteth through the Perpedicular line
aforesaid, that is at C, there the second Quadrant shall be cut off, and in
like sort you must draw another line to the point of the distance; and where it
touches the Lead, or Perpendicular line, that is on D, you shall make the
third Quadrant, the same may be done witn E, and so you must go until you come
just under the Horison.

2 The Rule aforesaid is the perfectest, and you may prove it by the line G H,
which is called the line of the Quadrant; but because it is cumbred with a
great number of lines, and so more tedious, therefore the ensuing Rule shall be
shorter, and easier to be done then the other: for when the Base A G is drawn,
and the two side lines make a Triangle A P G, then you must draw the paralells
of the Base and of the Horison long enough; and as far as you will stand from
the work to see it, so far you must set the Perpendiculars I K from the point
G, then you must draw a line from the point I to the point A, and where it
cutteth through the line G P, there shall be the termination of the first
shortened Quadrant; and if you will place more Quadrants upwards from that
Quadrant, you must do as I said before: and although there are other ways to
shorten a Quadrant, yet will I follow this Order, as being the shortest and
easiest to be set down in writing.

3 A Man must also use himself unto diverse distances and grounds, and
therefore you must make the ground following, which is of three Quadrants high,
in this manner. First, you must draw the line A B, as long as the breadth of the
work shall be; which line or base, must be divided into so many equal parts as
are needful, which being all drawn to the Horison or point, then you must
place the distances as far as you defire, according to the Rule aforesaid; for
here is no place to set it in, although it is a length and a half from the
Base, as you see it marked with 1, which Base, because it is of four parts,
therefore the first quadrant contains sixteen small quadrants, which are
found by the line B D, for where that line cutteth through the four lines,
which go to the point, there you must draw the parallel over, that thereby the
sixteen quadrants may be formed: But if you will set other quadrants upon it,
then (as aforesaid) you must draw another line to the distance D, and where
that cutteth through the other lines that reach to the point, that shall be the
termination of the second quadrant, containing in it also four times four
quadrants: The like must be understood of the third quadrant (and more besides
if need be.) But you must also understand, that the lines marked D run all the
distances, as is taught before.

4 If you will make a pavement with great quadrants to be cut or compassed with
fascien, fasen or lists, as you will term them, then upon A B you must devide
the fasen or quadrants and draw them all to the Horison; then you must imagine
the distances as you are raught before: and the line B D being drawn from the
point B to the poina of the distances; then by cuiting through of the
Horisentall lines, it will show the terminations of the quadrants, Fasen, or
Borders. To draw the Paralells, then if you will make the like quadrant
somewhat higher, then you must draw another line to the distances; and where it
touched the Horisontall or Radiall lines, there also you must draw the
Paralells through, so you must also do with the third, and the point of the
distances of these figures stand as far from A, as the line or Base A B is
long: If you will make diverse forms in these quadrants, as Roots, Crosses, six
points, or eight points, I will show the manner of them particularly, because I
will be as brief herein as I may.

5 This figure is a quadrant, containing in it a Root or an other quadrant,
which with the points thereof touches the sides of the uttermost quadrant;
whereby it is but half so great as the uttermost quadrant, as I have taught
you in the first Book of Geometry, and the manner to make this, is thus: First,
you must make a quadrant (as you are taught before) with his distances; and in
this quadrant you must draw two Diagonall lines, and also the right cross
lines, whereby you may easily find the Root, as you see it in the 5 figure. In
this sort you may make the Roots in the other quadrants before set down, that
is, to draw Diagonall and cross lines in them without taking other distances.

6 In this figure there is a cross showed (to make it) you must devide the
lowest line or Base of the quadrant in five parts; of the which five parts, one
part is the breadth of the cross: which bred^h being drawn to the points, the
Diagonall will show you the Parallel lines of the cross, to use where need is.

7 The eight poynted figure you may see in Perspective works in diverse forms,
which forms are all difficult enough: but that I may seek the easiest way so
near as I can in this my writing; therefore I have set down the manner thereof
hereunto annexed, which is very easy, and that is thus: The quadrant being
made in shortning, you must devide the Base into ten-equall parts, and on
either side you shall leave three parts, and in the middle four parts, then the
two lines being drawn to the Horison, you shall find the terminations of the
Parallel lines, by the Diagonall lines, whereby you may close up the eight
corners, as you may see in the 7 figure.

8 The shortest way to place this six cornerd quadrant, in Perspective works,
is thus: When the quadrant according to the Rule aforesaid, is placed in
shortning, then you must make four equal parts of the Basis, whereof two shall
be in the middle, and on each side you must leave one, and then draw the lines
upwards to the Horison or points; then you must draw the Diagonall lines, and
in the middle where they meet together, you must draw a Parallel line clean
through, by the which you shall sinde all the points to make this six cornerd
figure.

9 Now I have showed you how you shall make simple or plain Perspective works
of four corners, of six corners, and eight square corners. Now I will show, now
you shall make them double, that is, that every simple figure shall have his
band. When you have made a plain Superficies of six points, according to the
Rule aforesaid; then as much as you will have the band or fase to be in breadth,
that you must draw upon the Base, and draw that also up to the Horison; and
where the Diagonall lines cut through it, there you must draw Parallel lines
both under and above; and then draw two Diagonall lines more, out of the four
innermost points or corners of the six cornerd Superficies, and so you shall
find your terminations to shut or close up your smallest six points or cornerd
Superficies. Which second Diagonall, Parallel, and Horisontall lines are all
drawn with pricks, for a difference from the first lines, that you may know
them one from another.

10 The like must be done with the eight cornerd Superficies or Perspective
work, for when the same is made within a foursquare, making the Compass of
what breadth you will, according to the rule aforesaid; then out of every point
or corner of the eight square, a small line being drawn to the Center, you
shall find the termination to shut up the innermost eight-square; and then,
when from point to point the lines are drawn, then one square or Compass is
full made. This eight square form may be changed into a round, touching the
middle on either side, or else without over the points for corners; a good
workman may easily draw a Circular shortning round line with his hand.

11 Although I have said before that a man may make a round Circle about an
eight-square, yet for more security you may by this way attain to a more
perfection therein; for that the more points or sides the Circular form has,
the round Compass or Circle will be the fuller. But to make this Figure, it is
necessary to make half a Circle under the Bases, and to devide the
Circumference into as many parts as you will, so that they be even; in this
form the half Circle is divided into eight parts, so that the whole Circle
must be sixteen parts; which being done, you must set Perpendicular lines in
all the parts of the Circumference, as far as to the Bases of the shortened
quadrant, these parts being elevated to the Horison, and two Diagonall lines
drawn in the quadrant, they by cutting through the Horisontall or Radical
lines, will show you the Parallel lines. Then if you will draw a little
Diagonall line, beginning at the middle point of the Base, from the one side
unto the other, and so from the one point unto the other upwards going over the
points, then the forms will be closed, as you see them here; whereby it will
be easy for you to draw a round form with your hand, for it is impossible to
be done with a Compass to make it shorten well. This 11 figure you must be
expert in, and you must also understand it well, and so you must those that I
have before set down, before you proceed further; for they will serve you for
many pieces of work hereafter ensuing, as you shall both see and find to be
true.

12 When you understand the figure aforesaid perfectly, then you must proceed
further, and shut the round Circle also with an edge or border, according to
the breadth that you will have; you must also make the uttermost half Circle,
and the aforesaid parts of the great Circle drawn toward the Center, will come
into the small Circle; the which parts of the small Circle being also set down
in Perpendicular lines with pricks not to darken the other lines, and those
likewise that are drawn to the Horison. Then by cutting through of the
Diagonall lines, you shall find the Parallel lines. To make the innermost
shortning a round or Circle, according to the first example set down, as you
may see; the first round with perfect lines, the second with pricks, as you see
in the 12 figure.

But, friendly Reader, you must not be weary to be long in learning this
Figure, or in making it oftentimes, until you can do it perfectly and
understand it well; for I am sure and certain, that it will be very hard unto
many men, yet without this you cannot do much; and he that can do it well,
shall easily understand and make all the the things hereafter ensuing.

13 It falls out many times that a workman will show a House both without and
within, which to do, he must place the ground in Perspective form, that he
may the surer and better draw that up which he will have seen, and to leave the
rest on the ground; if then you will place a foundation in Perspective manner,
to make it well, you must first set it on a flat form, that out of that you
may draw it into a Perspective form.

To do this, I have set down a kind of open Building, that a man may the
easier conceive it for a beginning, for when a man can do this well, he may
after that place many other and harder things in Perspective form. I need not
to take any great pains to write or show how this shortning should be done,
because it is so easily and so openly placed in the figure that a man may
presently conceive it: for that leading all the lines that go from the corners
and outsides of the flat ground to the Base, which you will make in the
shortning; and the same being drawn up to the Horison, together with the
imagination of the distances; then you may shut or close up the shortning four
square. Then you must draw the Diagonall lines therein, through drawing the
Parallel lines, presently you shall find the way how to form the Columns and
Pilasters; so that it is impossible to fail therein; and especially for those
that do well conceive and understand that which I have set down before.

14 This figure following is somewhat harder then that before, but when you go
from the smallest to the greatest, you conceive things the easier, and
especially he that will learn this Art; he must not leave nor refuse to
exercise any of the Figures before set down, but must use all the diligence he
can to be perfect in them all, and be must also take a pleasure to do them
all, otherwise he that will omit now one, and then another, because he can
hardly understand or conceive them (although I labor and strive at all times
in setting down these Rules to show all difficulties) shall little profit
himself in this Art. The manner how to place this ground in Perspective form,
is easily conceived, without any other Demonstration: for you must follow the
manner or operation of the figure before set down, with this Advertisement,
That the two Diagonall lines evermore direct the work, together with the
Horisontall lines: and although a man may show many forms of grounds that are
to be placed in shortning, yet these two shall suffice for this time, because I
have other things to entreat off: for a skillful workman, by the help of these,
may form others for his purpose; and such as be shall have occasion to use.
And if he will erect any piece of work for a show he must necessarily first
measure the Orthography with the same measure that he measures the ground
withal, and then place it in a shortning manner, as when time serves, shall
be showed.

15 Touching the grounds and other Superficies of diverse forms, I think I have
sufficiently spoken Now I will speak of Bodies which are drawn up out of the
ground: And first, you know that I have taught before, how you should frame an
eight-square form plainly in it self; and then, I have showed how you should
compass this Figure about, with a border or edge: but if a workman will show
an eight-square Figure in Perspective wise, as a Well; then he must first make
the ground, as he is taught before, as high as he will, that the said Well
shall stand elevsted above the ground or foot thereof: there he must make the
same form once again, drawing it to the same Horison; then from all the
uppermost corners or points to the lowest, you must draw Perpendicular lines as
well from the innermost figures, as from the uttermost, whereby the through
cutting eight square bodies will be formed, as you may see in the 15 Figure.

16 I have spoken before of the open frame of a Well with eight points or
corners, which is necessary to be learned, how to make it, before you make the
solid body thereof, as this Figure 16 shows, which is the same that is before
showed, both form and measure, but all the lines which cannot outwardly be
seen, are hidden; and there is as much difference between an open body and a
solid, as there is between the model of a man's body, that is nothing but bones
without flesh and skin; and a living body of a man covered over with flesh
(although it is hidden under it.) And as those Painters are much perfecter that
have seen, and perfectly beheld right Anatomies, then others that only content
themselves with the outward bare show of the Superficies, so it is with
Perspective works; for they that well understand and perfectly bear in mind
the bidden lines, they shall better understand the Art then others, that
content themselves only with the show of outward Superficies. It is very true,
that when a man has sufficiently experimented, practiced, and bears in his
mind these inward hidden lines, then helping himself with the principal, he
may make many perfect things, without using all this labor.

17 For these three figures, every one is drawn out of the fouresquare, in such
manner as I have taught before; and they go all three to one Horison or point
as they should do, or as need requires; by the which figures any man may help
himself in many things, as I have further declared: and he that is perfect in
theses may make all kind of round forms, and without knowing of these he can
do little in round forms. For out of these Figures you may draw a round
Solude or Piramidal Building with Pillars, or without Pillars; and also a round
winding pair of Stayers: for this Figure will show you how to make the Stayers
round, with other things more, and yet not without your own industry, for the
things that by these may be made are wonderful and infinite, so that you wax
not weary, and spare no pains till you are perfect in them, because that the
bowing or Arches of gates and other things will seem hard unto you, as I will
hereafter show you; notwithstanding that they take their beginning altogether
from these.

But if any man that desires to learn this Art, will at the first understand
these figures, as some bluntly will take upon him to do it. I believe
certainly, he will be put to an non plus, and deceive himself; but if by
learning all the former things, he proceeds unto these as well in Geometry as
in Perspective Art: Then, I say, he is of a very gross understanding, if he
cannot understand or conceive these figures, or the figures that hereafter
follow.

These three figures, to speak truth, are but Superficies; nevertheless, if
you draw Perpendicular lines from all the terminations, as well within as
without: then you shall have a through cutting or open body, and the innermost
lines covered, then they will be a Massy body: And wonder not, gentle Reader,
nor let it be strange unto you, though I do sometimes make a long discourse of
some things, for (as I said before) they are not only learned by many words
and great pains, but it is also necessary that they were showed unto some men
plainly by drawing them before them, that they may the better conceive them.

18 The most part of great Rivers or water-falls that fall down from high Hills
or Mountains, by means of tempests with great force and power, when they enter
into a Valley, then sometimes they run out of their Channel, and so much
ground as they then usurp upon the one side, so much they loose again one the
other side; and so does Perspective work in cornerd things, for that as much as
a man loses of the point or corner whereon he looks, so much greater the
other point or comer shows that stands out, which is showed in the figures
18, hereunto annexed.

The Reader must then mark, that the square in the middle signifies the
thickness of a foure-square Column or Pillar, and the border that is without
and goes about it, signifies the thickness or bearing out of the Bases and
the Capital. The figure under this platform is the Base, and the uppermost
figure is the Capital; the manner how to shorten them I will show you, You
must make the Pillar flat before without thickness, and upon it you shall
form the Bases and Capital, making the projecture or bearing out thereof on
either side alike, but you must draw them lightly as the pricks herein set down
do show you: then draw the side of the Pillar which you will have seen toward
the Horison; and having found how thick the decreasing or shortning side must
be, by the rules that are showed in the first part of Perspective work, so you
shall have the the shortning ground of the Pillar, wherein you must lightly
draw the two Diagonall lines long enough through, and from the Bases below,
which is seen in the shortning; you must draw a line toward the Horison, which
you shall also let go down or sink so far, till it reaches beneath the
Diagonall lines, and there shall be the terminations of the shortning Bases:
and thus you see that the Perspectivenesse takes somewhat off from them, that
is, the space between the points, and the full back line; then from the
terminations to the other uttermost point of the Bases, you must draw a
Parallel line under the ground of the Pillars, so long that it may touch the
Diagonall lines, and there you shall find that which is taken of from the Bases
on the one side, and given to them on the other side, and the projecture of the
Bases shows, that the one point is draw inwards, and the other comes further
out, then the uppermost line of the Bases being also to the Horison; then upon
the shortning side by a line you shall find the third part of the Bases below,
and that which is here spoken of the Bases, you must understand the same also
of the Capitalls.

19 These other three Figures are the same which are showed before; the first
were hollow, but these are perfect and solid with all their members, and
although that in the figures before I have not showed how you should form and
frame these members, which in truth would be a very confused and troublesome
thing to set down in writing; therefore I have only showed the first
terminations, that a man may keep them well in his memory, and in these present
Figures I have showed how they show in a man's sight, that you may see the
effect that they work: but from henceforward because (as I said before) it is a
troublesome thing, I will make another form of them with all their members by
dark lines; and then (according to my ability) I will set down the manner how
to find the terminations of the members one after another, for all of them grow
a little one over, or more then the other.

But you must consider, that these Bases and Capitalls on the one side give in
ward, and on the other side bears out, which you must well remember, that you
may first be well instructed herein touching that which you will make. For it
is true, that the Theorick consists in the understanding; but experience is
gotten by practice and right use or handling: Therefore the most notable
Painter Leonardus Vinci, was never pleased nor satisfied with any thing that he
made, bringing but little work to perfection, saying, the cause thereof was
that his hand could not effect the understanding of his mind: And for my part,
if I should do as he did, I should not, neither would I suffer any of my works
to come forth: for (to say the truth) whatsoever I make or write, it pleases
me not, but (as I said in the beginning of my work) that I had rather exercise
in work that small talent, which it has pleased God to bestow upon me, then
suffer it to lie and rot under the earth without any fruit; and although I
shall not please thereby such as are curious, to set down the ground and
perfection of all things, yet at least I shall help young beginners that know
little or nothing thereof, which has always been my intent.

20 For that (as I said before) of Projecture in Prospective work, it would be
great labor and much work to find all the terminations of the parts or
members, and especially because they do always wax greater as they comefurther
outward, as well those which we behold from beneath upwards, as those that we
behold from above downwards; yet I have not spared to make this 20 Figure, and
to form and proportion it with all the members and parts thereof, that you may
the better understand it. In the first figure but one, next to this, I have
showed how you shall find the terminations of the points of the Projecture,
which are made plain without any members; the easier to conceive how things wax
bigger when they come further outward. But now I think that men understand it
well, I will show the means and manner how to find the enlarging of all the
members particularly by themselves, every one according to their greatness or
smalnesse of their Projecture.

And first, You must frame this Base with all the members, and with the right
Projecture thereof, to be without any shortning before, yet you must draw it
lightly with a piece of Lead, or some other thing, as it is showed unto you in
the Figure with pricks; then in the ground or foot of the Pillar you must draw
the two Diagonall lines long enough out, and thereby (as I said before) you
shall find the diminishing and the increasing of the particular parts of the
crests of the said Base, whereas the undermost line or foot of the crests of
the Base, bear much more broader and longer then those that are marked with the
pricks; then at each corner of the Creast of the Base you must draw an upright
line almost as high as the first creast of the Base (although I have done it)
but upon the uttermost point not to comber the work within: then you must draw
the uppermost corners of the first Creast with pricks also, toward the Horison,
which downwards will touch against the two upright lines; and there shall be
the terminations to close or shut up the second great Creast with a full black
line: then draw another black line from the innermost point of the Creast
upwards to the Horison, and there the shortning Creast shall be closed.

And as this Creast or Plinthus is closed and drawn on all sides with black
lines, so you must do with all the other lines of the Base, for when from the
uppermost corner of the first marked Base you draw a helding line to the
innermost corner of the greatest Creast with the black lines, by it you shall
lightly find the terminations of all the parts or members, drawing the corners
of the first Base toward the Horison. And when you have formed all the
innermost corners of the Bases, by the Horisentall line you may easily do the
second, and by the Parallel lines the uttermost of all; although by the lines
of the distances, you may bring the said corners somewhat nearer, as you may
see by the Diagonall lines. But at this time I will not speak of that difficult
or hard work, for he that has any understanding, may herewith help himself.

That which is here said of the Bases, you must also understand of the
Cornices, only that every thing is contrary; and where you set Perpendicular
lines below, which cut through the Horisentall or Radiall lines, so you must
also fall above the Lead lines or Catheten upon the Horisentall lines, as you
may better see it and learn it in the Figure, then it can be expressed by
words: and you must not be afraid or abashed, although at first you cannot
conceive it, for that by practicing you shall in time find it; for it is not
said that a man shall or can learn all things at once in one day: by this
Cornice you may make all Cornices, be they higher or lower, harder or easier,
always drawing every member and part toward the Horison, as it should be done.

21 Although there are diverse manners and ways to place Columns one behind the
other, standing upon one ground in Perspective wise, thereby to make Portals,
Galleries, and other things, yet this hereunto annexed is the easiest.

First, You must make a Pavement with a quantity of four cornerd Quadrants, as
it is also showed in the beginning of this Book, which may be made of such
breadth, as you will: Say that these foure-square stones are two foot broad,
which shall be the thickness of a Pillar: between the two first Pillars beneath
in the breadth, there shall be eight sequare stones, and the height of the
Pillars made of what quantity you will; and they being raised toward the
Horison, then you must draw two several lines over both the Pillars, and then
out of the middle of the first line you must make two half Circles above upon
the flat side before, and devide them in as many parts as you will; which parts
shall be drawn to the Center of the half Circle, standing in the uppermost
line: then out of the middle of the two several lines you must draw the less
half Circle, and all terminations of the flat Arch being drawn to the Horison,
then the first Arch or Gate is made: the other two Pillars upwards shall also
stand eight Quadrants distant from the first Pillars, which will make a four
cornerd place on all sides, containing 64 square stones; and you must do with
this Gate as you did with the first, only (when they are all of one wideness
as these are) you need not devide the Arches again, for the Horisentall lines
of the stones of the first Arch will show you the terminations of all the other
Arches, and also how long the Gallery must be, and how many Arches it must
contain. I have placed no Arches here in the sides, because I would not cumber
you too much at this time; but I will speak thereof hereafter particularly.

The two Doors on each side are both partly covered with the Pillars, but the
wideness of them is of four Quadrants, besides that from the corner of the
Doors to the Pillars on each side there is two Quadrants, as you see the half
thereof; and the other half you must suppose to be behind the Pillars. The
beams above the Arches which bear up the Chamber above, you may guess,
although I write not particularly thereof: I have not likewise set the Bases
nor the Capitalls upon these Pillars, because they should not darken them too
much; but in another place I will also entreat thereof.

22 These 2 Bows or Arches are only made to know how to join their Bases and
Capitalls to them, whereof in two several places I have spoken before, and
showed how they rise on the one side, and fall or decrease in fight on the
other side; that a man may the better learn how to do them: for in truth, if a
man could show it unto you in effect, you would the easier understand it; but
to set it down in writing or Figures as I do, that men hereafter might know
and learn them, it is requisite to entreat of them more at large, and that you
may the better discern and perceive the points of the thin lines from the
other points or corners of the black lines; therefore here I have placed the
point of the distances and the Horison downward; and have placed the Pillars in
other manner upon this ground without Quadrant stones: In this manner set the
breadth of the two first Pillars upon the Base of such thickness as you will,
and draw them inwards, toward the Horison, then you must imagine the
distances, as I have already taught you: and those distances are set on both
sides, and on either point of the distances you must draw a line both toward
the right and left point or corner of each Pillar.

These Diagonall lines will not only show you the thickness of the first or
foremost Pillars when they shorten, but also the thickness of the two other
Pillars which stand inward, which are all marked with pricks (and as I have
likewise said before) that which is here said of the Bases of the Pillars, the
same also must be understood upward of the Capitalls: touching the thickness
of the Bows or Arches underneath, I have showed in the Figure before, how you
must place the Center in the middle of the four crossepoynt lines, to draw the
half Circumference: The apiece or Quadrant above, is as great as that
below on the ground; I need not show how you shall make it, for you see it
plain enough in the Figure.

23 This Figure is like the former, only that the members of the Bases and
Capitalls are added thereunto, thereby to make it more perfect unto you, and to
show you how a thing will stand when it is full made and finished, although I
have showed it before; nevertheless, when a man is perfect therein, then he
may by practice help himself well enough without all this labor; using
discretion and bearing in memory that which he has imprinted in his mind: For
in truth, by this means (I mean the ground) a man may by practice make many
things, which if they be made with discretion, and by a workman will always
beautify the work, as these bows or Arches do, which under are divided with
Quadrants, as you may see them. There are, as you know, first two Centers to
form the Arch underneath, now a wise workman must not always seek for the
perfection of the edge of these Quadrants; but for example, Say that the Arch
underneath is divided into eight parts, whereof six shall be for the Quadrant,
and two parts for the edge or border that runs about it: now you must devide
the space between the one Center and the other, also in eight parts, but they
must shorten or lessen a little, that is, the nether part against the upper;
and then the Compass being set somewhat lower, and made narrower, then you
must draw the uppermost border; and then the Compass being set a little below
the nethermost Center, you must in like sort draw the other edge or border:
after, you must square or devide the Quadrants, leaving the space between both,
once so broad again as the other, which must be drawn up toward the Horison;
and as much as you will make the quadrant sink, you must also draw out of the
last Center with the Compass. And in this manner a man may make diverse forms
and compartments (but as I have said) you must make them all with judgment,
and therefore it is very convenient that a man should be well instructed
therein; for that using only the princicall terminations, you must make the
rest by practice: But I am of opinion, that some rigorous Perspective men will
take hold of these mywords, (to whom I answer) that if they mean I have failed
or done amiss, let them prove what difference there is between saying and
doing.

24 The manner how to make a cross roof of a Gallery or House in Perspective
work, is always very troublesome to show it unto any man; and therefore also,
it is much more troublesome to declare it in writing for men hereafter to
understand it. Nevertheless, because it is very necessary to be known, I will
do the best I can to show it.

First, you must choose the breadth and height of the greatest Arch or Bow that
you desire to make, and then by the distances you must make a perfect shortning
quadrant, and also a less Bow or Arch. The greatest Arch before shall be
divided into eight equal parts, and those parts must be drawn toward the
Horison to the small Arch, which being done, then you must set those parts of
the greatest Arch below upon the Base; and with the help of the Horisentall and
Diagonall lines, you may make a shortning Circle within the quadrant, as in the
other places before you have been taught. The terminations hereof shall be 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, which shall be set upwards beside the great Arch, as you may see it
there also marked with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Without this round below I have drawn the
Paralells with pricks to the wall, and where they end, there you must set all
your Perpendicular lines upright, which are come out of the Parallel lines of
this Circle.

Then you must draw the terminations aforesaid, which are placed above, along
by the Perpendicular lines with lines to the Horison; and where the said
Horisentall lines cut through the Perpendicular lines, which are drawn up from
below, there you must make half a shortning Circle; and that which is marked
on this side with Ciphers, must also be understood to stand on the other, as
you see it in the Figure.

These two half shortning Circles being made, then you must draw a right black
line above out of each of the middles, which are marked 5, and where that
cutteth through the middlemost line, which goes from the greatest Arch to the
Horison, there shall be the terminations and also the middle of the cross
work; and then out of all the terminations of the two half Circles, you must
draw cross lines on the fides, and where every one of them following an
Horisentall, touches the Arch marked 2, 3, 4, there the terminations shall
stand to form the half Circles in the cross, through the which a man with a
steadfast hand from termination to termination shall make a shortning half
round cross with pricks, as both on the right and left hand you may plainly
see in the Figure. In this manner the work should go, although it stood
somewhat out at the fides; but it is better first to print it well in your
memory, before you seek an other form where the Horison stands on the one
side, that then you may the easier make that which is seen on that side.

25 Having showed in cross work on both sides, how you should place the Arches
on the sides in shortning manner, and drawn them up out of the ground, although
that they be single: now will I show you a hollow Arch, and the manner how to
shorten it: But before I proceed thereunto (for it is very combersome and
difficult) first I will show you the Pilaisters that should carry the said
Arches, which Pilaisters stand so plainly in the Figure that I shall not need
to take much pains to write of them. In this Figure I have not made the first
Arch, that I might not darken the sight of the Arches on the sides, which
Arches on the sides, I have also but marked how they shall stand, and are
always drawn out of the apiece quadrant, as you see by the order of the
apiece quadrant, but the hindermost Arch which stands not in the way, I
have drawn fully, and and placed it also in his apiece.

Above in the top or roof, I have made the round form, whereof you may make a
Kettle or Tribunal; and you may also make it thus, when it is so me what sunk.
Touching the four Pilaisters, they (as I have taught before) are found by the
Diagonall lines coming from the point of the distances, and also that each
Pilaister is three cornerd, standing like a three cornerd hook, and on each end
(the Arch rests, whereof there shall be four) two Arches before, and two on
the sides, so that the roof will be right apiece, wherein you may make
cross work or other manner of Roof work. And if you will make other kinds of
works by the same, you must always follow this Rule: Item, where you cannot
well understand my writing, you must help your selves with the Figures, which
Figure also stands open, so that with a little labor, a man may easily
conceive it altogether, although there were nothing spoken of it.

26 Now you see, what way you must follow to place Arches on the sides in
shortning manner: And first, you must think upon the third former manner
Superficies, wherein I have sufficiently showed you the manner how to frame a
round body; but in this Figure I will show it more perfectly. Wherefore a man
must imagine that the round Body lying below in his apiece is made, and
shall serve for the two Bows on the sides. This Body then being made (as I
have showed before) and as you see it better now, you must first set it, where
the Arches begin above the Horison. And the same Perpendicular lines which
stand corner-wise from the middle of the four cornerd body, must be set like
Parallel lines on the right and left sides upwards from the two Arches, there
(as it is aforesaid) to direct the Horisentall lines, as you may see it it
plainly in the Figure. But you must understand, that the two crosses below in
this Body, are the two Centers to draw the stones of the Arches both above and
below, they also signify the Centers of the Bows upon the Horisentall lines
within the Arches.

You must also understand, that the black lines do form the Circumference
without, and the pricks or thin lin as betoken the form within, which is
covered in the Arches; so that the Arches do show through to be made of pieces,
of the which pieces a man may learn to make diverse Compartments underneath in
the Arch. Now when a man can make this Arch well, then he shall not need still
to take all this labor, but by two principal lines helping himself with
pricks, he may frame the Arch; and especially, because that the Arch which
should come before, covers or bideth a great part of the Arches on both
sides; which Arch I have not made here, that I might not darken or shadow the
other shortning Arch. Neither need I write any thing of the Circumferences
above in the top or Roof, (nor the eight corners within) for that in the next
Figure you shall see them; neither will I speak any thing of the Circumferences
in the ground, for they are made (as I have taught you heretofore of all
others) and of the round body below (of the which there has been more said) a
man may make many other things which are not here to be spoken of.

27 To place Pillars with their Arches upon grounds or platformes, I think
there is sufficient spoken before; and whatsoever I have spoken of foure-square
Pillars, is also to be understood of round Columns, for that a man must take
all round things, out of apiece things, as well the Spira of the Base, as
the round of the Capital. He that can make all the Figures aforesaid
perfectly, and particularly this last body, shall help himself well, and not
only to do the like things, but also many more. If I should in this small
Treatise show all that I could set down, it would make a most great Volumn; and
peradventure I should want time to set forth the rest of my Book, which I have
already promised: for there are many things that belong to Building, which need
not to be set down in Perspective work.

Let us now begin to-raise the Building here set down out of the ground, which
before, and on the side is seen, as I promised before to show you.

The shortest and surest way is, to make a ground with many quadrants; and
imagine that it is mere with the Foot, with the Elle, or other measure: but let
us now take every quadrant for two foot, and as before there are four
quadrants from one Pillar to the other, and the Pillar also contains a
quadran, there shall also be four quadrants upward in the length from one
Pillar the other, as you may see it altogether in the Figure.

The Pillars then being set of such height as you desire, then the the Arches
upon them must be made; and the manner how to make them, you may expressly see
in the Figure. And although you cannot see the Arches that are behind them, yet
I have made them here that you may see their terminations; they are in some
places drawn with full black lines, and in some places with pricks.

Above the Arches you must make the Architrave, Frise and Cornice; the
Projecture whereof, you must make as I have said and taught heretofore, that
is, how they make their Corners against the two Diagonall lines, and by the
like rule you shall also make the uppermost Cornice, as you may see in the
uppermost part, where the small Quadrant with the Diagonall lines stand. The
doors that stand under in the Gallery, are each of them two Quadrants broad,
and four Quadrants high: below in the ground there are certain tokens which
show like Nails, which signify the wideness of the windows above the
Cornice; which windows if they stood whole there, then they would be twice as
high as they are broad. The other Nails upwards between the shortning Pillats,
are also the breadth of the shortning Pillars, which (as I said before) are all
four Quadrants high, but they are partly covered with the Cornices. The part of
the Arch which stands at the end, is separated from this Gallery, as the
ground also shows it.

I have here made no Bases nor Capitalls, that the other things might not be
confounded: but you must understand that they must be placed in the work, as is
sufficiently before showed. And by this Rule you may draw diverse Buildings out
of the ground, as in the Figure is showed in diverse forms. The Centers of the
Arches you see them marked, standing all upon one Horisentall line.

28 Now I have showed the manner how to make a Gallery with Arches and Pillars,
with other things thereunto belonging; now by an easier way I will show some
form of Houses that are to be built out of the ground. You must make a ground
or foot work with quadrants reaching long enough upwards, which quadrants must
each of them be reckoned at two foot square.

And first, at the entry of the House there shall be a door of five foot broad,
for that it contains two quadrants and a half in the shortning: and the
height thereof shall be of ten foot, because it is five quadrants high: Her
Pilaisters or Antipagmentum shall be a foot broad, because they contain a
half shortning quadrant; the Frise shall also contain as much: and the
Cornice shall contain so much less, as the under part thereof bearing over
contains, and shall be made according to the Rule aforeshewed. Touching the
part jetting over the door, the Mogdilions or Mutiles, shall stand right above
Pilaisters or Antipagmentum of the door. And that little door upon the jetting,
shall stand right in the middle above the lowest door, and shall be two foot
broad. In the other corner of of this first House, there shall be another door,
the wideness thereof shall be six foot; you may make it round or square above
as you will. But why do I spend my time to set down all these measures, which
you may so plainly see in the Figure; only it is necessary to warn such as are
studious herein, that what work soever a man raises out of the ground,
consists in three principal things, that is, in length, breadth, and height.
The length is of certain Houses or Rooms, containing a certain number of
feet. The breadth consists of Windows, Doors, Gates, Shops, and such like
things. The height consists of Ports, Windows, Jettings, Cornices, Columns,
Roofs, and such like things. But there is yet another, that is, of the
thickness of the Walls, Pillars, Columns, and Pilaisters: The length is taken
from the shortning quadrants, and from thence also you take the breadth. But the
height is taken out of the breadth in the quadrants, which breadth must be taken
from the quadran or half quadran, which touches it on the hithermost side as
it stands: as also from the hithermost door, which is ten foot high, there
you must take the measure from the quadrans, which come to the Paralells on the
nethermost corner or point of the door; for if there you take five quadrans in
breadth, it shall be the height within the Antipagementum. And that which I have
said of these doors, you must also understand of all the other things: The
thickness of the Wall is two foot, for you see it contains a quadrant. The
bearing over of the second House is of six foot, measured upon the ground: the
like also the bearing over or jetting of the first House contains. To
conclude all things, as I have said, rising out of the ground on all sides, I
have set no Cornices, nor any other ornaments in this Figure, that you may the
easier understand it; but a man of ripe judgment and understanding knowing the
terminations, can by by his own invention help himself to make fair
Buildings. And for that I may not spend to much time herein, I will make others
to give you more light therein.

29 The Stayres, degrees or goings up, are very necessary in Buildings, and
therefore I will show diverse kinds thereof, and first I will begin with the
easiest. According to common custom a stayre or step is about half a foot
high, and about a foot broad upon the step; then let the square stones of this
ground be a foot square, therewith we will make a pair of stayres of five foot
high, and three foot broad: at the foot of the ground we will take the measure
of the breadth, which on the right and left sides shall be set in Perpendicular
lines on the Corners of the Stayres, which shall be divided into ten, as the
lines A B show you. Then all the parts of A B shall be raised to the Horison,
and then you shall take nine quadrants upwards in length: and whereas two lines
are set up cutting through the Horisentall lines of A B, there the Corners D C
of the uppermost steps shall be, containing a apiece of the three
quadrants on each side. From the hithermost points of the same upper steps, you
shall draw two helding lines to the lowest steps; against the which the
Horisentall and the Perpendicular lines of the quadrant shall come together and
shut up the Stayres.

These Stayres are shortened on the one side, and the other is plain or profill,
and contains a step less in the height, which makes four foot and a half;
it is also three foot broad, as it is marked under it on the ground. By this
Rule you may make Stayres or degrees as high as you will, and make some resting
places in the way: always taking the measure from the foot of the ground, as
well of the shortning, as those that are upright.

30 The going up being plain or profill makes a great show, and yet are very
easy to set in all places, I mean in the turning, and may serve for many
things, specially in Buildings, where a man going up softly and with ease,
gives the beholders a kind of pleasure to view them, principally in common
places, for that there is a going up on either side, so that upon the one side
men may go up, and one the other side they may go down; and although there
are only but two goings up, yet by this a man by his own invention may devise
others. How these Stayres are made, and with what reason, you may by this
Figure perceive them, although I should say nothing thereof; for as it is said
before, the quadrants are of a foot broad, and the steps half a foot high, and
so the breadth of the step is one foot. The breadth of the Stayres is five foot,
both the first and second: The resting gate contains in wideness three foot,
and is six foot high; which although it seems to be shut, and a small door
opening in it; yet it may be made whole, open, and otherwise closed. The two
sides above the three steps are five foot broad, although here it is but one
foot, because of the narrowness of the Paper. The Perpendicular lines on the
sides, signify leaning places, and they should serve well also to the steps,
but least they should comber the work, I have left them out.

31 Amongst other things which show well in Perspective work, I find that
goings up or Stayres are very seemly, and that the oftener that they turn, the
better they do show; therefore I have made these two goings up turning, which
stand in profill, yet you see the ground and the steps. This first going up is
six foot high, and three foot broad, as you may see it marked in the grounds
with pricks: the resting place between the first and secound going up, is two
four squares long, which is necessary, because of the turning. At the end
thereof you find a Portall, the door thereof is two foot wide, the
Antipagmentum is half a foot on either side, so that the place is three foot
full. The Perpendicular lines on the right side of the plain, signify certain
leanings, which may be made of Iron, Wood, or Stone; the like may be made along
the Stayres both upward and downward, setting a Baluster upon every Stayre: The
height of this rail or leaning, shall be two foot and a half, for so it is
easy to lay a man's hand upon. How these Stayres are made upwards out of the
ground, although it may well be seen by the Figure without declaring it: yet I
will say something thereof, to ease them that are short of memory. The resting
gate or round door under the plainness between the second and the third going
up, is no deeper then to the wall: Above the same door there stands another
going up, of four steps, which to make, I have sufficiently showed; otherwise a
man should continue the ground at the resting door, to draw them up from it.

32 Touching the several kinds of Stayres, I am assured that they may partly
be understood without describing them in writing, and specially the middlemost
which goes up on both fides; and so shall the uppermost also, because it is
raised up from the ground as well as the other, and is six foot broad, as you
may see and tell it on the ground upon the plain stones. The two Arches under
the two goings up are each a foot in thickness, whereby a going down is four
foot within, and is also drawn out of the ground as the rest are. The other
goings up, which you see through the Arches; you may sufficiently perceive by
them how they are made: and so it is with the two of pair Stairs on the left
hand, for from the first steps at the resting door, you may easily see how they
are raised up out of the ground, and above at the end of them they have a piece
of plain ground to come to the other Stayres, which also is drawn up out of
the pavement as the rest are, that is, each step half a foot high, and a foot
broad. But it is hard to measure in so small things, but it suffices that
hereby you may see the manner thereof; and when you make them great you shall
find that they will come well enough to pass. Under the Stayres last named,
there stands also a round door which is five foot wide: upon this ground, and
on these Stayres a cunning Painter might place diverse Figures in several
forms, either standing or sitting upon the Stayres, and lying upon the ground
in shortning manner, and that in this wise: You may place the Figures where you
will with feet, and then take six feet or squares where on they stand, and that
shall be their height, for that it is the height of a common or ordinary man:
this you must observe both before and behind, and in every place. If the
Figure be upon a step, then take the measure of that step whereon it stands,
and make it twelve steps high, which shall be six foot: And is the Figure
lying, do the like; but if it lies in shortning manner upon the ground, then
you must take the length by the shortning quadrant.

33 I have showed many kinds of goings up, but there are other kinds, and he
that is not well instructed in the former will hardly understand these two
which I have here set down. The first shall be winding stayres in four square,
and he that can make these foure-square Stayres, may well make the round
Stayres, for it is all one thing, specially if he uses the Rule before set
down of the round bodies.

The Figure P is the ground of this winding Stayre, but it is much less then
the uppermost to get ground. This four square ground in shortning you must
make half a foot high, which shall be for the first step. Then before at
either end, you must make a Perpendicular line upright, and in it make as many
half feet as you desire to make the Stayres high; you must also place the like
Perpendicular lines between the middle, and the corners: then you must draw the
terminations both on the right and the left sides upward to the Horison, which
must cut through the Perpendicular lines, which are drawn out of the
terminations of the steps; and of the same height that the two cornerd
Perpendicular lines are: and of the same measure you must make the other two
Perpendicular lines between the corners and the middle. Then in the middlemost
termination of the ground you must place an other Perpendicular line, and
devide it also in half feet, as the other Perpendicular line on the side is:
So out of this Perpendicular line of the Centers against the nearest
Perpendicular line beneath on the left hand, you must frame the first step with
two lines: The second step you shall also frame and shut up out of the
Perpendicular line of the Centers in the corner following. Then from that point
or corner you must draw a line to the Horison, which against the second
Perpendicular line will make the termination of the third step, which shall
also be shut above, according to the aforesaid Rule: from that point or corner
of the step you must also make an Horisentall line, which will touch the
termination of the fourth step; which being closed, then you must raise that
corner also to the Horison, and that will show you the termination of the fist
step. And when that step is also closed with lines, then you must draw the
point toward the Horison, which line will show you the terminations of the
sixth step against the hindermost Perpendicular line: and that being also closed
up with lines, then out of the same corner you must draw a Parallel line to the
termination of the seventh step, and not toward the Horison, because it is
another side of the foure-square. Thus you must work round about from step to
step, always following this Rule by the which you cannot fail.

34 That I may not forget to set down all kinds of Stayres, and especially such
as often times fall out to be made; therefore I have made these Stayres,
whereon a man may go up on all sides, whereof the ground stands above on the
right hand, but yet very small. These Stayres must be thus made: First, you
must make a foure-square shortning body of half a foot high, upon this you
must draw two Diagonall lines, and from the corner inwards there shall be a
foot broad left on either side, and the terminations thereof drawn to the
Horison, and so from the Diagonall lines you shall see the corners of the
second step. Now I need not set down unto you how you shall find the lesning
corner of the second step, the which is round about shut up with Parallel and
Horisentall lines: then upon the second plain you must draw two Diagonall
lines, which doing (as I said before) will show you the third step; which also
being closed up with lines, you shall also find the fourth and fifth, with the
like Rules. This Piramides is fantastically framed upon them to fill up the
place. Also I need not set down to what uses these Stayres may serve, for that
the half of them is commonly found in diverse pieces of work, as the Gates of
Palaces, Churches, and other dwelling Houses, and the ascending up to Altars.
By this way also you may make round Stayres, and also Stayres of six or eight
corners, as by their forms I have showed.

35 I have promised the studious Reader by this my labor to show as much of
Perspective work as I can, that he might show his conceit touching Houses or
Buildings in Perspective wise, meaning to set down some simple manners thereof,
as if he should form a single or double ground, thereupon to raise a body, and
therewith mean to make an end. But falling from one work to another, I am
entered into a Laborinth, which peradventure is to far above my reach, which
comes to pass by means of some men that have entreated me thereunto. And
therefore, as I thought at this time to make an end of my second Book, I begin
to handle a harder matter, which Rule is only called an outward foure-square:
nevertheless, it is as well drawn by the Horison as by the distances, as you
may see in the Figure, which shows a right shortning foure-square, containing
in it another apiece, the which also may be formed by the distances
without Horison; some men place the sides of the fouresquare upon the Base,
once so wide again as before. And as you see two like sides of the apiece
over the corner, so are the distances alike marked D. And as much more as you
will have this foure-square to shorten, so much you must draw the distances
from the Horison; and as much as you will that the edges of the foure-square
shall be broad, so many bredths must you draw upon the Base, between A C twice
drawn. All the terminations of this apiece standing above the corners go
all to the distances, and none to the Horison, but only the apiece that
is set therein.

36 Now I have showed, how you should shorten a Superficies, overpoynt, or
outward apiece; here I will show you how to imbosse or bear out the body
thereof with the same Horison and distances also, which body within is hollow,
and you may heave it up as high as you will; but I have purposely left it
somewhat low, that you might see the ground thereof. And by this Figure you may
conceive to how many things this may serve; and also how you may increase or
diminish it, according to skill and judgment. This shall suffice for these
foure-square modells or hollow things; but I will show you how you shall make
them with Creasts or Cornices.

37 This Figure is also formed by the aforesaid Horison, and the like distances
as the other before, only they stand a little nearer: Now to creast this body
both above and beneath, you must imagine the greatness of the Creast, and draw
the same greatness both above and beneath the body; then give the Crests above
their due Projecture, and from those points you must let Perpendicular lines
fall to the points or corners below, whereby you shall have the Projectives of
the Base and top thereof, which must be drawn toward the Distances, and not
toward the Horison. Now you see how the Cornices stand without the
foure-square body: but this is only for Cornices that are made without
members, not to comber you with the shadowing of them, for I will speak of them
hereafter particularly.

38 I spoke before of Cornices without members, which might serve this hollow
Quadran, and how you shall make the terminations thereof. Now in this Figure I
show you the said Cornices with their members, which you may also make in other
manner as it pleases the workman, that is, to make them bigger or lesser, as I
have spoken of other Cornices, always using good discretion and judgment to
choose and make such members therein, as may show well in men's sight. There are
some Cornices which reach so far over, that men cannot see the members thereof
under them; therefore in that case the members are so to be made, that they may
be seemly and pleasant in men's sight.

39 The four Figures aforesaid have their distances equally broad from the
Horison, that is, as much on the one side as the other; but this Figure is of
another manner, so that the Horisentall lines serve both for distances. To
understand it, begin thus: First, the Base A B is made and is placed in four
equal parts, as C D E, the lines C D are drawn on the right hand toward the
Horison, and the lines A C are drawn toward the Horison on the left side,
which form a perfect shortning foure-square; which apiece you see more on
the one side, then on the other. The four points or corners of these
foure-square things, are FGHC. If you devide these foure-square things in two
parts, then you must devide the Base D E in two parts, and the terminations
thereof being drawn to the right side, there you shall find the half of your
foure-square marked with two Stars. But if you will lengthen it another half
foure-square, then draw a termination E to the right Horison, the lines at IK,
the other half apiece, so that these Superficies shall be of two perfect
four corners: And this will serve the ingenious workman for many things, which
I will not here set down for brevity sake.

40 This body hereafter following is raised out of the former Figure before set
down, and is made with the same Horison; which body contains two quadrants in
length, and one quadrant in height, for the line CD is set in Perpendicular
manner upon the nethermost corner, whereon the other Superficies are set: thus
then this body is of two four-squares, I mean two four-squares in length, and
one apiece broad and high. And this body (as I said before) shall serve
for many things: But if you will have more cubits in the length, then lengthen
the Base in so many parts more, and you shall always find the truth hereof.
And if you will make a border or Creast about this body, then you must follow
this Rule aforesaid.

41 But will you make diverse things upon on ground? then it is convenient that
first you make a pavement, as you see it here set down, and thereupon frame
what you think good upon the quadrans, and the less the Quadrans are, and the
more in number, you may the easier frame things upon them. The cross made upon
this ground is only to show you the way and entry thereunto; but for such a
form, you may make a form of a Christian Church as they are now built. The
other form by it, shows a piece of a foundation of a House, but all these
things you may make in a greater form, and set them forth as you will;
sometimes placing the Horisetall lines in such manner that you may see more of
the out sides, but yet the Horisons must stand all of one height.

42 Out of this Superficial Figure aforesaid, I have raised these bodies, to
show how the Horisons of them do stand in the work as well above as below, as
you shall find by experience, and in truth these works which you see over the
points or corners, contain a Book alone by themselves: but (as I said before)
my meaning was to show but three or four Figures of them, yet I will show ten
of them; intending to leave the Student some works, whereof I am well assured:
For that he has more eyes, and more patience then my self, he shall find many
things which I write not of, nor yet set down.

43 Upon this Pavement (as I said) you may form or frame what you will, but in
this Pavement here ensuing, you see a column lying, being eight square, which
is three Quadrants in thickness, and fourteen in length. This eight square
column may be made out of a column of foure-square, as before in another place
is showed; which foure-square you may see drawn in the Figure with pricks, and
the terminations of the eight-square with black lines. But because that this
eight-square column is too much seen on the sides, the readier to make it out
of the foure-square: I have therefore have made an other piece by it, the
which, because it draws nearer to this Horison, is seen more before, then the
other, although not so long; for it is but half so long as the other, as you
may see and tell it in the ground or foot thereof. And if it were so that this
eight square Figure reached nearer to the Horison, it would then be better
seen, yet it would not wholly be seen before, because it stands without the
apiece and corner.

44 These Columns are the same which are before set down, but the other were
hollow, and these massy, whereby an expert workman may find out many things
exercising this way, although there are other means to be used, as Albert Durer
has showed, to look through holes with a thread: There is also another way,
which is drawn out of flat forms which is the surest way, but very troublesome
and hard to describe in writing; wherefore I have chosen this as the easiest
way to be showed. And if I had not undertaken to show other things of more
importance, I would have drawn diverse bodies and houses after this manner: But
for that I mean to entreat of Scenes, and the preparing of places for to show
Comedies and Tragedies, which is now used in this age, and especially in Italy,
therefore I will make an end of these foure-cornerd things, leaving it to
another (as I said before) to set forth more thereof.

A Treatise of scenes, or places to Play in.
45 Because I mean hereafter to entreat of Theaters, and Scenes belonging unto
them, as we use them in these days. In the which Scenes it will be very hard
for a man to show how, and where a man should place the Horison herein, because
it is another thing then the Rule before declared: Therefore I thought it good
first to make this Profill, that the ground by the Profill may both together be
the better understood; yet it were convenient first to study the ground, and if
it so falls out that a man cannot attain to all within the ground, then he
must proceed to the profill to be the better instructed therein. First
therefore, I will begin with the Scaffold before, which as the eyes shall stand
elevated from the earth, and shall be flat, made by the water compass, marked
with C. And the Scaffold from B to A, shall stand heaved up under the same A, a
ninth part of the length thereof; and that standing up behind the seat marked
with an M above it, is the wall of the Hall or other place, against which, or
where this Scene shall be made. That which stands a little distant from the
Wall Perpendicular wise, is marked P, shall be the back or upholding behind of
the Scene, that a man may go between it and the other wall. The termination O
is the Horison. The lines with pricks coming cross upon the water compass
from L to O, where it touches the back P, there you shall place the Horison
only to serve for the said back. And coming forwards to L, this line shall
always be the Horison, for all the Ortograpy of the Houses which shall stand
forwards or outward: But the Seenographies or shortning sides of the Houses,
they must have their Horisons standing further to O. And it is reason, which in
effect have two sides (as these must be built that men may see out of them on
both sides) should happen two Horison lines, this is touching the Profill of
the Scene. But the place which is called Proceny is that which is marked with
P, and the part marked with E is called Orchestra, which is raised half a foot
from the earth; where you see F marked, are the places for Noblemen and Knights
to sit on. And the first seat or step, marked G, are for the Noblewomen and
Ladies to sit on; and going up higher, there must the meaner sort of Nobles
sit. The broader place, marked H, is a way, and so is the place marked E.
Between H and E must sit Gentlement of quality. And from L upwards meaner
Gentlemen shall sit. But the great space, marked K, shall be for common
Officers and other people, which place may be greater or less, according to
the length of the Hall or any other place. And the Theator, with the Scene or
Scaffold, which I made in Vincente, was almost in this sort; and from the one
corner of the Theater to the other, was eight and twenty foot; for it was made
in a place where I had room enough, but the Scene or Scaffold was not so
broad, because it was placed in a lodge. The frame of the seats was all made in
one, as you may see in this Figure. And because the Theater stood in an open
place which had no wall, whereunto it might be made fast, therefore in the
Circumference I have made it sticking out, for the more strength and fastness
thereof.

46 Among all the things that may be made by men's hands, thereby to yield
admiration, pleasure to sight, and to content the fantasies of men; I think it
is placing of a Scene, as it is showed to your sight, where a man in a small
place may see built by Carpenters or Masons, skillful in Perspective work,
great Palaces, large Temples, and diverse Houses, both near and far off; broad
places filled with Houses, long streets crossed with other ways: triumphant
Arches, high Pillars or Columns, Piramides, Obeliscens, and a thousand fair
things and Buildings, adorned with innumerable lights, great, middle sort, and
small, as you may see it placed in the Figure, which are so cunningly set out,
that they show forth and represent a number of the brightest stones, as
Diamonds, Rubies, Saphirs, Smaragdes, Jacinths, and such like. There you may
see the bright shining Moon ascending only with her horns, and already risen
up, before the Spectators are aware of, or once saw it ascend. In some other
Scenes you may see the rising of the Sun with his course about the world, and
at the ending of the Comedy, you may see it go down most artificially, whereat
many beholders have been abasht. And when occasion serves, you shall by Art
fee a God descending down from Heaven; you also see some Comets and Stars shoot
in the skies: then you see diverse personages come upon the Stage, richly
adorned with diverse strange forms and manners of Apparel both to dance
Moriscoes and play Music. Sometimes you see strange Beasts, wherein are men
and children, leaping, running, and Tumbling, as those kind of Beasts use to
do, not without admiration of the beholders: which things, as occasion
serves, are so pleasant to men's eyes, that a man could not see fairer made
with men's hands. But for that we are entered into another manner of Perspective
work, therefore I will speak more at large thereof. This Perspective work
whereof I will now speak, although it be contrary to those Rules which are
showed before, because these aforesaid are imagined to be upon a flat wall: and
this other Rule because it is material and imbossed or raised outward,
therefore it is reason we observe another Rule therein, according to common
custom. First, you must make a Scaffold, which must be as high as a man's eye
will reach, looking directly forward; for the first part thereof which is
marked C. But the other part behind it, whereon the Houses stand, you must
raise up behind against the wall at least a ninth part thereof, that is, you
must devide the plain Stage or Scaffold into nine parts; and then you must
make the Scaffold higher by a ninth part behind: then before at B, which must
be very even and strong, because of the Morisco dancers. This hanging downward
of the Scaffold, I have found by experience to be very pleasing, for in
Vincente which is as sumptuous and rich a Town as any in all Italy, there I
made a Theater and a Stage of wood, then the which, I think, there was never a
greater made in our time, in regard of the wonderful sights that there were
seen, as of Wagons, Elephants, and other Moriscoes. There I ordained, that
before the hanging Scene there should be a Scaffold made by water compass,
which Scaffold was 12 foot broad, and 60 foot long, according to the place
wherein it stood, which I found to be very pleasing and fit for show. This
first Scaffold, because it was right, therefore the pavement thereof must not
obey the Horison, but the Quadrants, whereof on every side were foure-square,
from whence at the beginning of the rising Scaffold B, all the Quadrants went
to the uttermost Horison O, which with their due distances do shorten very
well. And for that some men have placed the Horison of this Sciographies
against the wall right above the Scaffold, whereby it seems the Houses run
all in one; therefore I determined to place the Horison before the door, which
pleased me so well, that I used the same kind of order in all these kind of
works: and so I counsel those that take pleasure in such Arts, to use and
esteem this way for the best, as I will show in this Figure following, and have
also declared in the profill of the Theater and Scene.

And because the preparation for Comedies are done in three sorts, that is,
Comicall, Tragical, and Satiricall; I will first entreat of the Comicall,
whereof the Houses must be made as if they were for common or ordinary people,
which for the most part must be made under roofs in a Halls, which at the end
thereof has a chamber for the pleasure or ease of the Personages; and there it
is that the ground of the Scaffold is made (as I said and showed before) in the
Profill. Therefore C is the first part being the flat Scaffold; and suppose
that each Quadran contains two foot on either side, so shall they upon the
hanging Scaffold before on the Base be also two foot broad, which is marked B.
And (as I said before) my meaning is not to place the Horison hereof against
the back behind in the Scaffold, but as far as it is from the beginning of the
pavement B to the wall, so far I would also that men shall pass behind
through the wall, and so shall all the houses and other things show better in
the shortning: and when by convenient distances you have drawn all the
Quadrants toward the Horison, and shortened them, then you must shorten the
Houses right with the apiece stones, which houses are the great lines
marked upon the ground, as well for those that stand upright as those that
shorten. All such houses I always made of spars, or rafters, or laths, covered
with linen cloth; making doors and windows, both before and in the shortning,
as occasion fell out. I have also made somethings of half planks of wood,
which were great help to the Painters to set out things at life. All the spaces
from the back to the wall marked A shall be for the Personages, to the which
end the hindermost back in the middle shall stand at the least two foot from
the wall, that the Personages may go from the one side to the other, and not
be seen. Then you must raise a termination at the beginning of the pavement B,
which shall be the point L, and from thence to the Horison there shall be a
line drawn, as it is marked in the profill with pricks, which shall be of like
height, and where that touches the hindermost back of the Scene or Scaffold,
there the Horison of that back shall stand, and that Horison shall serve only
for that back. But if you stretch a cord or any other thing to the termination
L, then you may fasten a thread to it, to thrust backward or forward to use it
out of the steadfast Horison, and all the Ortography of the houses before. But
the Horison which goes through the wall shall serve for all the shortning
sides of the houses; and for that men should break the wall, if they would use
all this Horison in gross, which may not be done, therefore I have always
made a small model of wood and Paper just of the same bigness, and by the
same model set it down in gross, from piece to piece. But this way will fall
out hard for some men to understand, nevertheless, it will be necessary to
work by modells and experiments, and by study a man shall find the way: and
for that a man can hardly find any Halls how great soever, wherein he can place
a Theater without imperfection and impediment; therefore to follow Antiquities,
according to my power and ability, I have made all such parts of these
Theaters, as may stand in a hall. Therefore the part marked D shall be the post
scene, and the circular place marked E shall be the Orchestra: round about this
Orchestra shall be the places for the noblest personages to sit, marked F. The
first steps marked G for the noblest women to sit upon. The place H is a way,
so is the part marked I. In the middle between these degrees are steps the
easier to go up.

The places marked K must be made so great backward as the Hall will afford,
which is made somewhat flooping, that the people may see one over the others
head.

47 Touching the disposition of Theaters and other Scenes, concerning the
grounds thereof, I have spoken sufficiently; now I will speak of the Scene in
Perspective work: and for that Scenes are made of three sorts, that is,
Comicall to play Comedies on, Tragical for Tragedies, and Satiricall for
Satirs. This first shall be Comicall, whereas the houses must be slight for
Citizens, but especially there must not want a brawthell or bawdy house, and a
great Inn, and a Church; such things are of necessity to be therein. How to
raise these houses from the ground is sufficiently expressed, and how you shall
place the Horison: nevertheless, that you may the better be instructed
(touching the former of these Houses) I have here set down a Figure, for
satisfaction of those that take pleasure therein; but because this Figure is so
small, therein I could not observe all the measures, but refer them to
invention, that thereby you may choose or make houses which show well, as an
open Gallery, or lodge, through the which you may see another house. The
hangings over or shooting out, show well in shortning work, and some Cornices
cut out at the ends; accompanied with some others that are painted, show well
in work: so do the houses which have great bearing out, like lodgings or
Chambers for men, and especially above all things, you must set the smallest
houses before, that you may see other houses over or above them, as you see it
here above the bawdy house; for if you place the greatest before, and the rest
behind still lessen, then the place of the Scene would not be so well filled,
and although these things upon the one side be made all upon one floor;
nevertheless, for that you place great part of the lights in the middle,
hanging over the Scene or Scaffold, therefore it would frand better if the
floor in the midst were taken away, and all the roundells and quadrans which
you see in the Buildings, they are artificial lights cutting through, of
diverse colors, which to make I will show the manner in the last of this Book.
The windows which stand before, were good to be made of Glass or Paper, with
light behind them. But if I should here write all that I know to serve for this
work, it would be overlong to rehearse; therefore I refer that to the wit and
discretion of those that exercise and practice themselves herein.

48 Houses for Tragedies, must be made for great personages, for that actions
of love, strange adventures, and cruel murders, (as you read in ancient and
modern Tragedies) happen always in the houses of great Lords, Dukes, Princes,
and Kings. Therefore in such cases you must make none but stately houses, as
you see it here in this Figure, wherein (for that it is so small) I could make
no Princely Palaces, but it is sufficient for the workman to see the manner
thereof, whereby he may help himself as time and place serves: and (as I said
in the Comical) he must always study to please the eyes of the beholders, and
forget not himself so much as to set a small building in stead of a great, for
the reasons aforesaid. And for that I have made all my Scenes of laths, covered
over with linen, yet sometime it is necessary to make some things rising or
bossing out, which are to be made of wood, like the houses on the left side,
whereof the Pillars, although they shorten, stand all upon one Base with some
stayres, all covered over with cloth, the Cornices bearing out, which you must
observe to the middle part: But to give place to the Galleries, you must set
the other shortning Cloth somewhat backwards, and make a Cornice above it, as
you see: and that which I speak of these Buildings, you must understand of all
the the rest, but in the Buildings which stand far backward, the Painting work
must supply the place by shadows without any bearing out: touching the
artificial lights, I have spoken thereof in the Comicall works. All that you
make above the Roof sticking out, as Chimneys, Towers, Piramides, Oblisces,
and other such like things or Images, you must make them all of th^n boards,
cut out round, and well colored: But if you make any flat Buildings, they must
stand somewhat far inward, that you may not see them on the sides. In these
Scenes, although some have painted personages therein like supporters, as in a
Gallery, or do r, as a Dog, Cat, or any other Beasts; I am not of that opinion,
for that stands too long without stirring or moving; but if you make such a
thing to lie sleeping, that I hold withal. You may also make Images,
Histories, or Fables of Marble, or other matter against a wall; but to
represent the life, they ought to stir. In the latter end of this Book I will
show you how to make them.

49 The Satiricall Scenes are to represent Satirs, wherein you must place all
those things that be rude and rusticall, as in ancient Satirs they were made
plain without any respect, whereby men might understand, that such things were
referred to Rusticall people, which set all things out rudely and plainly: for
which cause Vitruvius, speaking of Scenes, says, they should be made with
Trees, Roots, Herbs, Hills, and Flowers, and with some country houses, as you
see them here set down. And for that in our days these things were made in
Winter, when there were but few green Trees, Herbs, and Flowers to be found;
then you must make these things of Silk, which will be more commendable then
the natural things themselves: and as in other Scenes for Comedies or
Tragidies, the houses or other artificial things are Painted, so you must make
Trees, Herbs, and other things in these; and the more such things cost, the
more they are esteemed, for they are things which stately and great Persons
do, which are enemies to nigardlinesse This have I seen in some Scenes made by
Jeronimo Genga, for the pleasure and delight of his Lord and Patron Erancisco
Maria, Duke of Vrbin; wherein I saw so great liberality used by the Prince and
so good a conceit in the workman, and so good Art and proportion in things
therein presented, as ever I saw in all my life before. On good Lord, what
magnificence was there to be seen, for the great number of Trees and Fruits,
with sundry Herbs and Flowers, all made of fine Silk of diverse colors. The
watercourse being adorned with Frogs, Snayles, Tortuses, Toads, Adders,
Snakes, and other beasts: Roots of Corrale, mother of Pearl, and other shells
laid and thrust through between the stones, with so many several and fair
things, that if I should declare them all, I should not have time enough. I
speak not of Satirs, Nimphs, Mer-maids, diverse Monsters, and other strange
beasts, made so cunningly, that they seemed in show as if they went and
stirred, according to their manner. And if I were not desirous to be brief, I
would speak of the costly apparel of some Shepherds made of cloth of Gold,
and of Silk, cunningly mingled with Imbrothery; I would also speak of some
Fishermen, which were no less richly apparalled then the others, having Nets
and Angling-rods, all guilt: I should speak of some Country maids and Nimphs
carelessly apparelled without pride, but I leave all these things to the
discretion and consideration of the judicious workman, which shall make all
such things as their Pattrons serve them, which they must work after their own
devices, and never take care what it shall cost.

Of the Artificial Lights of the Scenes.
I Promised in the Treatise of Scenes to set down the manner how to make these
lights shining through, of diverse colors, and first I will speak of a sure
color which is like a to Zaphir, and yet somewhat fairer. Take a piece of
Salamoniack, and put it into a Barbers Basen, or such like thing, and put water
into it: then bruise it softly therein, till it be all molten, always putting
more water unto it, as you desire to have it light or sad color; which done,
if you will have it faier and clear, then strain it through a fine cloth into
another vessel, and then it will be a clear Celestial blew, whereof you may
make diverse kinds of blew with water. Will you make an Emerauld color? then
put some Saffron as you will have it pale or high colored; for here it is not
necessary to prescribe you any weight or measure, for that experience will
teach you how to do it. If you will make a Rubby color, if you be in a place
where you may have red Wine, then you need not use any other thing, but to make
it pall with water, as need requires: but if you can get no Wine, then take
Brasill beaten to powder, and put it into a Kettell of water with Alum, let it
sees, and scum it well; then strain it and use it with Water and Vinegar. If
you will counterfeit a Ballays, you must make it of red and white Wine mingled
together; but white Wine alone will show like a Topaz or a Crisolite: The
Conduit or common water being strained, will be like a Diamond, and to do this
well, you must upon a glassie ground frame certain points or tablets, and fill
them with water. The manner to set these shining colors in their places, is
thus, Behind the painted house wherein these painted colors shall stand, you
must set a thin board cut out in the same manner that these lights shall be
placed, whether it be round or square, cornered of ovale, like an Egg; and
behind the same board there shall be another stronger board laid flat behind
them, for the bottles and other manner of glasses with these waters to stand
in, must be placed against the holes, as it shall necessarily fall out, but
they must be set fast, lest they fall with leaping and dancing of the
Moriscoes. And behind the glasses you must set great Lamps, that the light may
also be steadfast; and if the bottels or other vessels of glass on the side
where the light stands were flat; or rather hollow, it would rather show the
clearer, and the colors most excellent and fair; the like must be done with
the holes on the shortning side: But if you need a great light to show more
then the rest, then set a torch behind, and behind the torch a bright Basin,
the brightness wereof will show like the beams of the Sun. You may also make
glass of all colors and forms, some foure-square, some with crosses, and any
other form with their light behind them. Now all the lights serving for the
colors, shall not be the same which must light the Scene, for you must have a
great number of torches before the Scene. You may also place certain
candlesticks above the Scene with great Candles therein, and above the
Candlesticks you may place some vessels with water, wherein you may put a
piece of Camphir, which burning will show a very good light, and smell well.
Sometime it may chance that you must make something or other which should seem
to burn, which you must wet thoroughly with excellent good Aquavite; and setting
it it on fire with a Candle it will burn all over; and although I could speak
more of these fires, yet this shall suffice for this time; and I will speak of
some things that are pleasing to the beholders.

The while that the Scene is empty of personages, then the workman must have
certain Figures or forms ready of such greatness as the place where they
must stand will afford them to be, which must be made of past-board, cut out
round and painted, signifying such things as you will, which Figures must lean
against a rule or lath of wood, cross over the Scene where any gate, door, or
way is made, and there some one or other behind the door must make the Figures
pass along, sometime in form of Musicians with Instruments, and some like
singers; and behind the Scene some must play on, upon certain Instruments, and
sing also. Sometime you must make a number of footmen and horsemen, going about
with Trumpets, Pifes and Drums, at which time you must play with Drums,
Trumpets and Pifes, etc. very softly behind, which will keep the peoples eyes
occupied, and content them well.

If it be requisite to make a Planet, or any other thing, to pass along in the
Air, it must be framed and cut out of past-board; then in the hindermost and
back part of the houses of the Scene, there must be a piece of wire drawn above
in the roof of the house and made fast with certain rings behind to the
past-board painted with a Planet, or any other thing, that shall be drawn
softly by a man with a black thread from one end to the other, but it must be
far from men's sight, that neither of the threads may be seen.

Sometime you have occasion to show thunder and lightning, as the play
requires: then you must make thunder in this manner, Commonly all Scenes are
made at the end of a great Hail, whereas usually there is a Chamber above it,
wherein you must roll a great Bullet of a Cannon, or of some other great
Ordnance, and then counterfeit Thunder. Lightning must be made in this manner,
there must be a man placed behind the Scene or Scaffold, in a high place, with
a box in his hand, the cover whereof must be full with holes, and in the middle
of that place there shall be a burning Candle placed, the box must be filled
with powder of vernis or sulphire, and casting his hand with the box upwards
the powder flying in the Candle, will show as if it were Lightning. But
touching the beams of the Lightning, you must draw a piece of wire over the
Scene, which must hang downwards, whereon you must put a squib covered over
with pure gold, or shining lattin, which you will; and while the Bullet is
rouling, you must shoot of some piece of Ordinance, and with the same giving
fire to the squibs, it will work the effect which is desired.

It would be overlong if I should speak of all things which are to be used in
these affairs, therefore I will leave speaking of Perspective things.

FINIS.
