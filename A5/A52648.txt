A Narrative of the proceedings of his Excellency the Lord General FAIRFAX, in
the reducing of the revolting Troops.
SOme General account has been given from Burford, of the great mercy of God
vouchsafed this Nation in delivering into our hands, most part of the Mutiniers
that lately revolted from their obedience; a more particular account shall now
be given, of the designs intendments, and ways they were involved in, which
did so greatly endanger the Destruction of this Nation, and of the sequel and
present issue thereof; to the end that all persons, who indeed, and in truth,
and not in word only, bear regard to the welfare of this Land, may themselves
receive satisfaction, and have wherewith to convince others that may have been
seduced or misled.

The grounds and manner of the proceeding of these men that have so much
pretended for the Liberty of the People, have been as follows. There was a
Paper styled The agreement of the People, framed by certain select persons,
and debated at a General Council of Officers of the Army, to be tendered to
the Parliament, and to be by them commended over to the People of the Nation.
It being hoped that such an expedient if assented unto, at least by the honest
part of the People that had appeared for this common Cause to which God has so
witnessed, It would have tended much to settlement, and the composing of our
differences, at least have fixed honest men to such grounds of certainty as
might have kept them firm and entire in opposing the common enemy, and stand
united to public Interest.

The General Counsel of the Army, and the other sorts of men, going then
under the name of Levellers (who by their late actings have made good the same,
which we then judged but an imputation) had (as now it appears) different ends
and aims, both in the matter and manner of their proceedings; That which was
intended by those men was to have somewhat tendered as a Test, and Coercion
upon the People, and all sorts of men and authorities in the Land: That which
these, to wit, the Counsel of the Army aimed at, was to make an humble
representation of such things as were then likely to give satisfaction, and
unite, and might be remitted to men's judgments to be owned or dis-owned as men
were satisfied in their Consciences, and as it should please God to let men see
reason for their so doing, that so it might not be only called, an Agreement,
but through the freedom of it, be one indeed, and receive its stamp of
Approbation from the Parliament, to whom it was ^umbly submitted. Hereupon
those other men took so much dissatisfaction, that they forthwith printed and
spread abroad their Paper, which was different from that of the Army* using all
possible means to make the same to pass, but with how little effect is very
well known, and finding by the Armies Application to the Parliament, that they
were likely according to their duty to stand by and own them as the supreme
Authority of the Nation, They have by all means assayed to vilipend and make
odious that authority presenting them to the People (in Printed Libels and
otherwise) as worse tyrants then any who were before them, (if they did not
answer every unseasonable and unreasonable desire of theirs, or correct their
insolence, and labored likewise to divide and withdraw the Army from their
obedience and to make it hated by the People as the prop of the Parliaments
supposed Tyranny, decrying it also as acting tyrannically, if it did but
maintain a just and necessary discipline, without which it is impossible to
keep any order at all. For if four or five such unlimitted and ungoverned
spirits can by themselves and their Agents disturb the Peace of a Nation what
would an Army do if brought into the same distructive Model?

What their carriage has been toward the Parliament shall not here be
mentioned, but only what they have practiced toward the Army, To disaffect men
of honesty and conscience in the Army. They have suggested that the Parliament
is unfaithful to their Trust, unwilling to settle the Liberties of the Nation,
misplace Officers of Power and Trust, and intend to perpetuate themselves, with
many other such like clamours, the product only of a slanderous spirit; To
such as have an eye to their Arreares and pay, they insinuate that the
Parliament will not consider their hard travel, and service, nor make a just
provision for their satisfaction. And to all they have endeavored what they
can to render the service of Ireland either as unlawful (wherein they comply
with Popish designs) or exceeding difficult and so discourage many, or else to
be post-poned to their fancies of Liberty, as if the Liberties of this Nation
could not or would not be settled without their inspection; and thus by
applying themselves to men of several affections, interests and tempers they
have deceived and seduced some honest men, and fed the discontents and sinful
homours of many.

The course they have taken to divide the Soldiers from their officers
(thereby insnaring and precipitating them into unlawful and sinful
engagements) has been by exercising the same spirit of falsehood, to decry, not
only the Laws of War as tyrannical, but the administration thereof by the
Council of War much more so. Although it be an undeniable truth, that in the
conduct of all the Armies that ever any history did mention, there never was so
little severity exercised by Marshall Counsels, or with more tenderness and
regret in what has been at any time through necessity executed upon offenders.

When they h^d laid such a foundation of Lies and Falsehood (wherein they have
not been inferior, if not beyong those enemi^s we had list to deal with,) and
had thereby occasioned so many of Commissary General Iretons, and Coll:
Scroops Regiments to revolt, and cast off their Officers (an Act not to be
paralelled) and that their business began to grow to an head, they sent their
Emissaries and Agents into all parts (as we have good intelligence) pretending
from one Regiment to another, that each regiment had declared that so by that
Artifice they might draw each to declare, and to the end they might not only
confirm discontents in those Regiments they had drawn into that unwarrantable
course but heighten a resolution in their minds to stand it out: they reported
that the Regiments waiting on the General in this service were so dissatisfied
that they would not stand by him, nor strike a stroke in this business,
although the General has a ground of as much confidence of their resolution
to venture their lives against a disobedience of this nature, as ever they did
against an enemy, of which they gave a sufficient testimony when they came to
the Trial, going on with as much cheerfulness and alacrity as they were wont
to do upon any other Engagement. But by this falsehood and wile they had drawn
in many of them, and made use of it to keep them together: To the forces in
Wales, and the West they gave assurances that the forces about London would
revolt. To those about London, that those in Wales, and the West would do the
same. And to the Forces in the North used they the like Arguments, and
nourished also the distemper of the forces in the South. By these lies and
boastings, laboring to heighten discontents in all places. The knowledge
hereof we have also by a full attestation from the mouths of some conscientious
persons who were deluded with these vile and forged pretenses, and out of
conscience discovered, and since do exceedingly lament and abominate the same.

When the Lord General was come to Aulton in Hampshire, he had intelligence of
the joining of part of the Commissary Generals, and Colonel Scroops Regiments,
making ten Colors, and about 600 Horse, They having disserted all their
Commission Officers (except two or three) marched away to Marlborow, with
intention to make what speed they could to get a Conjunction with Colonel
Harrisons Regiment. The Lord General Marched to Andover, and thence sent Major
White, Captain Scotten, Captain Peuerell, and Captain Bailey, with a Letter to
the Revolters, exciteing their present return to their obedience, with offer
of pardon upon their so doing, or otherwise, to declare to them, he would
endeavor to reduce them by force, and withal giving in charge to the
Messengers, to require a present Resolution and conformity thereunto, and
letting them also know, that he would send a Declaration immediately after them,
which is since published in Print, and entitled A Declaration from his
Excellency, with the advice of his Council of War, concerning the present
distempers of part of Commissary General Iretons, and of Colonel Scroopes
Regiments to undeceive the deluded party, and to leave those excuselesse who
refuse (upon pardon herein offered) to return to their former obedience.

The General intended to abide at Andover until he could receive from his
said Messengers an answer to his Message and commands sent by them, which he
expected and required should be returned next morning. But Major White and the
rest letting his Excellency know, that the said Troopers were marching toward
Wantage in order to a conjunction with Colonel Harrisons Men, His Excellency
Marched the same day being Sunday the thirteenth of May to Theale about four
miles from Reading, and appointed the Rendezvous of his Horse to be next
morning at Inglefield a mile from thence, with purpose to March toward
Abingdon, to prevent if possible the designed conjunction with Colonel
Harrisons men: And in the mean time, his Excellency having received a Letter
from the Revolters, that they would be obedient to Orders from his Excellency,
and come under his protection, His Excellency dispatched Coll. Scroop that night
(being Saturday the 13) to them to make trial of their obedience, but they in
the interim we marched from Wantage to Blagrave, where they expected to meet
Collonell Harrisons men, and abiding there for some time had the Accession of
two Colors of Horse of that Regiment. So that they became 12 Colors in all,
besides Collon: Eyres, with some other straglers and Citizens. At this
Randezvouz Collon: Scroop found them, and here also Major White, and the rest
did with faithfulness and honesty communicate the Generals command offers of
pardon and his Declaration, but they by the increase of number heightened in
their spirits, continued in their contempt and disobedience, slighting Coll:
Scroop, and his message, and preferring the reading of their own Declaration
before the Generals, the Leaders of them and their Agents being unwilling the
same should be published to the rest of the Soldiers, or the Lord Generals
Messenger should have full and free discourse with them: or that his
Excellencies Declaration should be communicated to any but the Agents.

At this Place a principal person amongst them and of the greauest interest,
had two Messages (as he has since ingenuously, and conscientiously confessed)
The one its to be hoped was but a pretense and slander to wit from a Lord
(whose name we forbear to mention) that they should take encouragement, for he
should ere long be ready in the head of 2000 Horse to assist them: the other
was by a Gentleman who seemed to be a person of quality who animated them to
go on with this assurance from a person living in London, that they should not
want money, either for Horses, Arms or other necessaries to carry on their
business.

In this confidence they marched away to New-bridge,
