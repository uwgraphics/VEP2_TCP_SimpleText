The Protestant-FLAYL: An Excellent New SONG.
To the Tune of, Lacy's Maggot; Or, The Hobbyhorse. ^
[1]
LIsten a while, and I Will tell you a Tale
Of a New Device of a Protestant Flayl,
With a Thump, Thump, Thump, a Thump, Thump, a Thump, Thump.
This FLAYL it was made of the finest wood,
Well lined with Lead, and notable good,
For splitting of Bones, and shedding the Blood
Of all that withstood,
With a Thump, Thump, etc.
[2]
This Flayl was invented to thrash the Brain,
And leave behind not the weight of a grain,
With a Thump, etc.
At the handle-end there hung a Weight,
That carried within unavoidable Fate,
To take the Monarch a rap in the Pate,
And govern the State,
With a Thump, etc.
[3]
It took its Degree in Oxford-Town,
And with the Carpenter went down,
With a Thump, etc.
If any durst his Might oppose,
He had you close, in spite of your Nose,
To carry on clever the Good Old Cause,
And down with the Laws,
With a Thump, etc.
[4]
With this they threatened to fore-stall
The Church, and give the Bishops a Mawl
With a Thump, etc.
If King and Lords would not submit
To the Joyner's wit whiles the House did sit,
If this in the right place did hit,
The Cause it would split,
With a Thump, etc.
[5]
Two handfuls of Death, with a Thong hung fast.
By a Zealot who hanged himself at last,
With a Thump, etc.
With a moving head both stiff and stout,
Found by the Protestant Joyner out,
To have at the King and the Laws the other bout,
And turn them both out,
With a Thump, etc.
[6]
Ivi^sibly 'twou'd deal his Blows,
All to maintain the Good Old Cause,
With a Thump, etc.
Would Liberty and Freedom bring
To every thing except the King,
At Monarchy it had a fling,
And took its swing,
With a Thump, etc.
[7]
This Flayl was made of the Newest Fashion,
To heal the Breaches of the Nation,
With a Thump, etc.
If Faction any difference bred,
T'wou'd split the Cause in the very Head,
Till Monarchy reeled, and Loyalty bled,
And were knocked in the Head,
With a Thump, etc.
[8]
When any Strife was in the State,
This Flayl would end the whole Debate,
With a Thump, etc.
Against Arbitrary Power of State,
And Popery which the Zealous hate,
It would give them such a Rap on the Pate.
They must yield to their Fate,
With a Thump, etc.
[9]
It had a thousand Virtues more,
And had a Salve for every Sore,
With a Thump, etc.
With this they thought to have maintained,
The Loyal Tribe, and Royalists braind:
But the Joyner was hanged, and the Flayl was Arraigned
And the Conquest Regained,
With a Thump, etc.
[10]
May Tony and all our Enemies,
Meet with no better fate then his,
With a Thump, etc.
May Charles still Live to rule the State,
And York whom all Dissenters hate,
To be revenged upon their Pate,
By timely fate,
With a Thump, Thump, Thump a Thump, Thump, a Thump, Thump.
