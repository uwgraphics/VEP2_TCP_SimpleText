PROPHECY, Which has been in a Manuscript, IN THE Lord Powis's family Sixty
Years.
1647
ABout the time that I shall be
Joined unto 2 times 3.
1648
And 4 times 10 with 4 times 2
Amongst us shall be great ado.
An Eagles Head that time shall fall,
Scattered will be the young ones all.
Oliver Cromwell
Then shall a Cipher swell so great,
His Name 100 takes the Seat,
And shall do mighty things before
He is removed off the Shore.
1658.
But 10 times 4 with 8 times 6,
Does in another World him fix.
Then quickly after you shall spy,
The Eagle back again to fly,
And shall himself bedeck again,
With Feathers of his Fathers Train.
Then heavy Times shall make men say,
Oft-times alas and welladay,
And wish that they a Death might find,
For something troubles sore their Mind.
Then after all a Cloud shall come,
And almost darken quite the Sun.
And in that time Actions shall be
Chiefly carried on by three.
The Cross, the Surplise, and the Crown,
Strive who shall put each other down.
Great Treachery and Bloodshed then
Shall sweep away great store of Men.
The Lion and blue Flower shall seek
Quite to destroy the Heretic Sheep.
And England shall be hard bestead,
Before the Miter hence be rid.
False Ireland contrives our woe,
But zealous Scotland does not so.
1677
Begin again at 1 and 6,
And 10 times 7 begins these Tricks.
1681
And for a time shall last full sore,
Till you may number 1 and 4.
1685.
And for 4 more it shall abate,
To return in an happy sat.
Then better every day will be,
But no more -- in England see.
1680.
When 8 times 8 and 3 times 3,
With 6 and 1 shall joined be,
Then shall be sacrificed C.
In dust shall lie that arrant Whore,
Disdained of all like to J -- S --
And all her Brats turned out of door.
J. R. shall into Saddle slide,
And furiously to Rome shall ride,
His Principles no longer hide.
The Pope shall have a fatal Fall,
And never trouble more Whitehall,
Nor England's People more inthrall.
And he that chances to survive,
Until the year of eighty five,
Shall see this Land begin to thrive.
O England's wonder, which has never been,
3 Q -- in England shortly shall be seen!
2 D -- shall highly for the Crown contend,
Each shall bring England's Monarchy to end.
B -- shall fall into contempt and scorn,
And Gospel-Angels shall our Church adorn.
If any ask, how this shall come to pass,
The Fox shall ride the Goose, the Goose the Ass.
FINIS.
