The Causes that obstructed the working of the Mines.
And whereas the said Mines have hitherto been unprofitable to the Owners, for
want of a Stock, and of a good Constitution for the Management thereof; and by
reason of unhappy Differences and Lawsuits amongst the Partners, and Five
Years of the said Term granted by the said Sir Carbery Pryse is expired, and
considerable Sums of Money are owing to several Officers, Agents and Stewards,
Miners and Laborers, and to several other Person and Persons, and are
chargeable upon the said Mines; All which has hitherto discouraged the
Partners from raising of a Stock. And forasmuch as the said Partners do now
labor under great Difficulties and Disadvantages in these and other respects.

For removing of all which Obstructions, and for raising a Stock of 20000 l
And whereas the said Sir Humphrey Mackworth taking the Premises into Serious
Consideration; and to the end that the said Mineral Works may be set on work,
and carried on to the best Advantage, has acquainted the said Partners, that
within six Days after the Execution of these Presents (whereby it is intended
the said Trustees and Partners shall Assign and Transfer the said Mines and
Premises unto the said Sir Joseph Herne, Sir William Hedges, Sir Thomas Vernon,
and Thomas Pit, for and during the residue of the said Term of Two and twenty
Years and an Half yet to come and unexpired) (under the Trust and Management
herein after mentioned and expressed.) He, Sir Humphrey Mackworth undertakes
within six days after the Execution of these Presents, to propose an Expedient.
the said Sir Humphrey Mackworth will propose and open to the said present
Partners an Expedient for clearing all the Debts wherewith the said Mines now
stand charged, and for raising the Sum of Twenty thousand Pounds for a Stock
for carrying on the Working of the said Mines, without any Premium or Repayment
of either Principal or Interest, and for paying or securing to such of the said
Partners as shall be unwilling again to become Advenuturers with the said Sir
Humphrey Mackworth, under such Proposals as he shall make, the Sum of Twenty
Pounds for every Share they now respectively have in the said Mines.

The Advantages thereof.
And for as much as it is intended that the said Partners and their Assignees,
who shall become Adventurers with the said Sir Humphrey Mackworth, under such
Proposal as he shall make, shall be thereby delivered from an Arbitrary
Management of the said Mines, and have the Benefit of an equal and fair
Constitution; And also have Five Years added to their Term, which is computed
by the present Steward of the said Mines to be worth, in Reversion, after the
Expiration of the said Term in being, several Hundred thousand Pounds.

And whereas it is thereby intended, That a Stock of Twenty Thousand Pounds,
clear of all Debts paid and discharged, shall be raised, whereby the Interest
of the said Mines and Premises will be advanced to Five times the Value they
were before.

The Consideration.
And forasmuch as the said Sir Humphrey Mackworth does not require or insist
upon any other Consideration for the Premises, but only liberty of distributing
a moderate Share thereof to Charitable Uses, whereof One Moiety will issue out
of his own and Friends Interest and Shares, as an Humble Acknowledgment to
Almighty God for the Great and Wonderful Deliverance of him and his Friends at
Sea: All which is held reasonable by all the said Partners.

The Intent of these Presents.
To the end therefore that the said Proposal may be put in Execution, all
Differences between the said Partners be composed, all Debts and Salaries paid
and discharged, a Stock of Twenty Thousand Pound raised, and the said Sir
Humphrey Mackworth enabled to establish and settle the several Charities herein
and in the said intended Proposal to be mentioned and set forth.
