A LETTER TO Dr. BURNET, From the Right Honorable the Earl of Rochester.
My most Honored Dr. Burnet,
MY Spirits and Body decay so equally together, that I shall write You a a
Letter as weak as I am in Person. I begin to value Churchmen above all Men in
the World, and You above all the Churchmen I know in it. If God be yet pleased
to spare me longer in this World, I hope in Your Conversation to be exalted to
that degree of Piety, that the World may see how much I abhor what I so long
loved, and how much I glory in Repentance in God's Service. Bestow Your Prayers
upon me, That God would spare me (if it be his good will) to show a true
Repentance, and amendment of Life for the time to come; or else, if the Lord
pleases to put an end to my Worldly Being now, That he would mercifully accept
of my Deathbed Repentance, and perform that Promise he has been pleased to
make, That at what time soever a sinner does repent, he would receive him. Put
up these Prayers (most dear Doctor) to Almighty God, for Your most obedient and
languishing Servant,

ROCHESTER.

FINIS.
