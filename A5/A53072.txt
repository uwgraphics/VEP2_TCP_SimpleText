A DECLARATION made by the Earl of New Castle, Governor of the Town and
County of New Castle; and General of His Majesty's Forces raised in the
Northern Parts of this Kingdom, etc.
I Have now by His Majesty's special Command and Commission for some months
last past, resided in the town of Newcastle All which time I have proceeded in
pursuance of the points of my Commission (which were none else but the
preservation of this Town, the County of Northumberland, and the Bishopric of
Durham, and the Liberty of the True Protestant Religion, of the Laws of this
Kingdom established by Parliaments, the Property of the Subjects, Persons, and
Goods, and securing of this Port) with that integrity and tenderness of His
Majesty's Honor, who does passionately affect the safety and Liberty of the
Subjects, in all the particulars above mentioned: That I have great and just
occasion to bless Almighty God for so prospering this his own, and our
Sovereign His Servants work, in my weak hands. As I am confident I have not
yet miscarried in any one particular, wherein by God and His Majesty I have
been entrusted. For whereas in most of the counties of this Kingdom, there are
nothing to be heard but most pitiful, and yet most unpittied complaints of
the Subjects, for the horrible violation of their Churches, and indignities
offered to the service of God, unjust captivating of their Persons, exhausting
of their purses by most racking exactions, plundering and pillaging of their
Houses and Goods, against the Law of God, and the known Laws of this Land;
and all this exercised by a party who pretend nothing but the Religion of God,
the Law of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subject, (and all this is done
under pretense of Parliament power.) Yet (blessed be God for it) all they who
live in these parts under my charge, can with one accord testify, that as yet
they have not tasted in the least degree any of these sharp outrages, either in
their possessions, Persons or Goods, from that party in who^ they had little
reason to put any trust, if by my Forces they had not been kept under: Nor yet
can any of that lawless party aver, that by any Forces of mine, or indeed
any force at all, they have suffered under such wicked veaxtions, as they of
their own side in all places where they have had power, have used toward
these who have continued in Loyalty and Obedience to His Majesty. And farther,
that His Majesty's Port and Haven; has to his great benefit, and the comfort
of all his good Subjects who adhere to him, been so secured as that now it
remains as entirely at his Majesty's devotion, as ever it did in times of
highest peace and tranquillity.

But it has not pleased God, That our Neighbors in Yorkshire, and the
adjacent Counties should enjoy the like calm, which has moved many of the
Prime Noblemen and Gentlemen of the County of York, to remonstrate unto me
their sufferings, which they endure from Sir John Hotham his son, and many
their seditious and outrageous Accomplices, and to desire my aid for the
redressing of them, and repressing their tumultuous oppressions, before they
shall swell to that height, as it cannot stand with the safety of the Persons
and Estates of His Majesty's good Subjects in Yorkshire, to make any
expressions of their Loyalty and Allegiance to His Majesty, unless by some of
my forces they be speedily comforted and relieved.

I having seriously weighed the purport of my Commission, and finding it not
only consistent with, and agreeable to the same; but knowing well His Majesty's
sacred Intention and constant Resolution to secure the Lives and Liberties of
his Subjects by all means which he can compass: I have now resolved to assist
His Majesty's distressed Subjects in the County of York with competent Forces;
and yet to leave this Town, and the two other Counties under my Charge, so
strongly guarded, that their former security shall be no ways discontinued or
intercepted.

And therefore I do by these presents, desire all his Majesty's Loyal Subjects
of the County of York to take these particulars into their serious
consideration, and I expect credit to be given to them.

First, that I come not into their County by Intrusion, but by Invitation; and
that from those Noblemen and Gentlemen, whom by long experience, they have
known to be their soundest and sincerest Patriots, and who have promised me in
their names a cheerful reception, their utmost assistance, and absolute
obedience to all my Just and lawful Commandments.

Secondly, I do solemnly promise, That I come free from the least intention of
pillaging and plundering any of his Majesty's good and loyal Subjects, or of
exacting any thing from them which shall be against the Privileges of a free
Parliament, the known Laws of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject.

And thirdly, That I intend by my Forces to vindicate you from the violent
incrochment and oppressions made upon you in any of these particulars, by those
who to their own lawless ends, abuse the sacred name of Parliament.

And fourthly, That I shall (during the time of my abode amongst you) do
nothing of moment, but by the advice and consultation with those Noblemen and
Gentlemen, who have been Solicitors to me in your behalf; and when it shall
please God to give a happy consummation to those great businesses for which I
intend to come amongst you, I shall retire my self and forces out of your
County, with much more cheerfulness then I conducted them thither.

And now I desire to give satisfaction both to you of Yorkshire, and all other
true Protestants of this Kingdom, why I have been necessitated to take under
my command and conduct diverse Popish Recusants in these Northern parts.

First, It was not his Majesty's intention, nor the intention (for any thing I
know) of any in authority under him, to admit any of them into this service,
if the way had not been chalked out unto His Majesty, and his Ministers, by
these very men; on whose Forge this objection was hammered: Let the muster
Roles of that Army which is named from the Parliament be perused, and then it
shall appear plainly, that the mannagers of that Army do exactly and
distinctly know, that they now have, and for many months have had great
numbers under their pay, both English, French and other Nations, whom at the
time of their enrolement (and ever since) they did know to have been professed
Papists: whereas by the contrary, it is notoriousley known, that before this
course was taken by the other party; his Majesty and his Ministers did not
admit to, nor continue any Soldiers in pay, who were suspected to be that way
inclined, or did refuse the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; not that His
Majesty thought it unlawful for him so to do, or that he did not hold his
Recusant Subjects, to be as strongly obliged by the Laws of this Land for the
defense of his Person, and the Liberty of Parliaments, and Laws of this
Kingdom, as any of his Protestant Subjects; for if the Kingdom stood now
under the fear of a Foreign Invasion, is it to be conceived, that the
Recusants of this Land were by the Laws of the same obliged to adventure their
Lives and Fortunes in defense thereof? Sure the great confusion which is now in
this Kingdom is of as fearful a consequence as any foreign Invasion possibly
can be, and therefore the Recusants are so far from being disobliged, as they
stand deeply obliged for giving their assistance in this time of extremity, if
they shall be required; But His Majesty was very cautelous and tender in this
point, and certainly would not have looked toward it, if the other Party had
not first assumed that liberty to themselves, from which by the Law of the Land
he saw himself no way barred.

If there be no bar in Law against it, then let us examine these pretended
grand inconveniences, wherewith (as they allege) it is attended: Sure the
wisest Heathen Emperors that ever were, did admit into their Armies whole
Legions of Christian Soldiers, whose fidelity they relied much upon, though
the Emperors themselves blasphemed that God whom those Christian Soldiers
adored, Look upon Christian popish Emperors; did Charles the fifth, that wise
and Warlike Emperor, refuse the service of any of the protestants of Germany
in that Army wherewith he made War upon the Protestants? No, but cherished all
such of them as he did conceive to stand for the Majesty and Liberty of the
Empire: Look upon Protestant Kings and Princes; did Henry the fourth the late
French King, while he was yet a Protestant, reject the assistance of those many
French Papists, who spent their lives in asserting his Crown, and approveing
their Allegiance to him: Or did blessed Queen Elizabeth of most precious
memory, upon whose aid and advice that great King did principally rely, go
about to persuade him to dismiss all his popish Subjects out of his Army? and
yet it was well known, that She was the greatest Patron and prop of the
Protestant Religion in the whole world. Do our Neighbors of the United
Provinces reject the auxiliary Regiments under the pay of the French King,
because many of them (if not most) are Papists, so long as they are secured of
their fidelity to them? the point then will not be of their Religion, but
whether they may be trusted in point of fidelity and Allegiance.

But they do allege in that point, they are not to be trusted, since they
refuse to take the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy; It were to be wished, that
those blessed times had been perpetuated to us, in which it had continued a
good distinction, though not between ill Papists, yet between Jesuited
Papists and Protestants, the taking or refusing of those two Oaths; but we
have lived to see, that these two Oaths (to the intolerable scandal of the
Protestant Religion) are indeed taken by some who call themselves Protestants,
but most manifestly violated; and refused to be taken by some Papists, and yet
the tenor of them kept by those refusers.

Our Saviors question in the Gospel was, Whether of the two was the better
Servant, He who said he would do what his Master bid him, but did it not: or
he who said he would not do it, but yet did it. this latter, by our Saviors
approbation, was the better Servant: It is easy to be applied: has not His
Majesty, and all the World reason to think that those Recusants who upon
weak, yet seeming strong grounds unto them, refused to take the Oath of
Allegiance, and yet at this time perform the contents of it, are far better
Subjects and (in this point) far better Christians, then all those
Protestants who have taken this Oath, and yet at this time practice quite
contrary to that which is contained in it? and not only to what is contained in
it, but to what is contained in the last Protestation, which they themselves so
magnified, and in it did so expressly aver the defense of the Kings Person
and Dignity; so that the tumultuous Petitioners who came riding to the
Parliament through the Streets of London, with that Protestation in their hats,
seemed too honest and good Subjects, like men standing upon several Pilloryes
with Papers in their hats, carrying in them their crime and condemnation for it.

And besides, it is well known, That there are other Recusants in England
besides the Popish, and those are such, who will not communicate in our Service
and Sacraments as they are established by the Laws of this Kingdom; and yet
some of these are admitted to sit in either House of Parliament; though,
contrary to the order of Parliament, they have not received the Communion. And
how many hundreds be in the adverse Army, of Anabaptists, Brownists, and other
Sectaries, who by the Laws of this Land are reputed far more dangerous
Recusants, and do incur by the same Law, far heavier punishments then
ordinary Papists do; for they being convicted are to abjure the Land and
Kingdom; whereas Papists incur only personal or pecuniary mulcts, if they
be not Priests or Jesuits, or harbourers of them. If one would truly learn
the damnable Doctrines of these Recusant Separatists, and foresee how, upon
their own ground and Tenants, when they shall have power to put them in
practice, they will attempt the cutting of throats of all Landlords and
Magistrates, and will maintain, That it is against the Law of God for any Man
to hold an Estate by Law or Birthright; but only according to Merit and worth.
Let him read the Commentaries of John Sleidan a Grave and Wise Historian, who
in the life of Charles the fifth, has excellently set down their lamentable
Tenants and Tragedies, broached and Acted by them about the beginning of the
Lutheran Reformation, and is now in English, and goes under the name of, A
warning for England.

To conclude, I wish from my heart there were Recusants of no kind in this
Kingdom; I am resolved, as I have lived, so to die in the profession of the
true reformed Religion, as it now stands established by the Laws of the
Land, and as it was professed, and practiced in the purest times of peerlesse
Queen Elizabeth, and for these few Recusants under my Command, I shall use all
possible care, that they do nothing against the Laws of this Kingdom, for I
have received them, not for their Religion, but for the Allegiance which they
profess to so gracious a King: whom I pray God to Protect, and long continue
amongst us, and let all good People say, Amen.

FINIS.
