THE Pope's Comment UPON THE TEN Commandments.
The PREFACE.
There Is one LAWGIVER able to destroy,
But save Believers in Eternal JOY.
The Words which CHRIST has spoken shall us judge,
And from Gods Laws his JUDGMENTS will not budge.
Popes make LAWGIVERS new in every Age,
Who multiply new LAWS upon the Stage.
But this Distinction shows they disagree,
They all can kill, yet none can save but HE.
God's Law is perfect, Men's Laws are not so;
God's Laws are just, whether to Friend, or Foe.
God's Law (once made) for ever does endure?
Men's Laws repealed, new made, and never sure.
Commandment I.
GOd's Laws allow no GODS but Onely-One;
Popes make more Gods than Stars, or Days are known.
Yea, Sun, and Moon, and Stars adored be;
Is there a DAY from Adorat'on free?
Popes ALMANACKS are cloyed with Red Names,
Which (thus adored) their VOTARIES enflames:
Although (already) Places are so scant,
SIMON and JUDE they crowd in One, for want.
All Saints together jumbled in one Day;
All Souls another, unto whom they pray.
Yet They (poor fools) commit all sins to have
A canonized name when in the Grave.
Godfathers, and Godmothers, Bishops, Kings,
Images, Pictures, Crosses, and such things:
Mother of Christ's four Brothers; Sisters all;
Popes (VIRGIN-QUEEN of HEAVEN) her install.
Who next but MOTHER CHURCH? that Scarlet WHORE
Catholic, Common, Churches Sons adore:
Yea FATHERS of the Church (of the fame Blood;)
And HUSBANDS (too) of that incestuous Brood
But that which is than all the rest most strange
THEMSELVES they call the Church, and Sexes change.
Though the sublimest Church, and God of all,
Is there GOD-POPE, and every CARDINAL:
BELL-CHURCHES also built of Brick and Stone;
Thus (when they please) they All, or Any own.
But how came POPES this Power all to have?
Forsooth! their FATHER-DEVIL them it gave.
The Devil offered Christ once to bestow,
All Kingdoms (with their Glories) here below,
Which he refused: But since to Popes are given
All Kingdoms of this World, and KEY of Heaven.
Alas! CHRIST knew not how to cringe and bow;
POPES can do All, and all adore them now.
Poor Soul! Christ had not Pride enough to bring
MAJESTY due unto one earthly KING.
POPES give more Titles, Glories, in one Day,
To all those Kings who only them obey,
Than CHRIST Himself did ever here assume;
And over Kings, or Caesar's, did presume.
Commandment II.
GOD blasts all Worships but his own with Evils,
POPES command all to Angels, Men, and Devils.
Popes make both Gods and Worships more and more;
Popes make GODMAKERS to increase their store.
Popes make PRIESTS, BISHOPS, CARDINALS; and They
Make WAFER GODS by Thousands in a Day.
Those IDOL-GODS must all adored be;
Yea, WAFER-FLESH, and BLOOD (unseen) must see.
A Task too hard for Bal'ams ASS to endure;
Though God gives Eyes, men have no seeing, sure.
Saints worship GOD in Psalms, and Hymns, and Songs:
They in all Gestures; also unknown Tongues.
And when they come their PA-GOD-POPE before,
KINGS kneel to kiss the SLIPPER of the whore:
Drunk with the Wine of Fornication;
Kings reel into their own Damnation.
Their WAFER-GODS with Latin-Charms they hallow,
Which People (thousands) in a Moment swallow.
The Three-crown'd-little-HORN here does enter;
To change both Times, and Laws he does adventure
Blaspheming God, and wearing out the Saints;
The WITNESSES to kill he never faints:
And in the Streets their Corpse lie in dead Letter,
The NATIONS see them, but are not the better.
Mornings and Evenings are their WITNESS read,
But Hearers (like the WITNESSES) are dead.
For though Gods Doctrin's read once, and again,
They hear the Word of God, but obey MEN.
For with his MARK the BEAST so domineers,
That all Gods words pass thorough both the Ears.
When PRIESTS (found perjured Traitors) hanged are,
They worship RELICS of their Blood and Hair:
Cart-loads of CROSSES, Mary's Gown of Silk;
Rags, Nails, Bones, Stones, and Mary's VIRGIN-MILK.
'Twould Horses tire, Legions of Saints to read;
With all their IDOL-PRAYERS to the Dead:
Yet that they may their Time in Worship spend,
Their BEADS and CROSSES round can have no End.
IDOLATRY, God pardons not a whit,
But every Eye, and Ear makes Judge of it:
Yea every Hand is EXECUTIONER;
God bids no wife, nor Son, nor Daughter spare.
Kings, Princes, Prophets, Nations, must not escape,
God makes it as a VINTAGE of the Grape.
Five Midian-Kings, and Kingdoms were destroyed,
And PHINEAS his Priesthood so enjoyed.
Yea, two and thirty Kings, and Nations,
Were all destroyed with their Stations.
Who are they then more merciful than GOD?
They spill the Child, because they spare the ROD:
Choosing IDOLATERS to rule, and kill,
All NON-IDOLATERS at their own Will.
GOD (therefore) sends IDOLATERS to kill us,
Because we kill not THEM as God does will us.
Commandment III.
GODS NAME IN VAIN; Christ bids SWEAR NOT AT ALL:
POPES command ALL to swear, both great and small;
Swear must both rich and poor; both bond and free,
None must escape (this) MARK of CRUELTY.
With the right hand held up this MARK is took;
Swearing (unknown) Contents, and kiss the BOOK:
It Is the BEASTS Mark, the fatal MARK of HELL,
Without which none may freely buy, or sell.
On this Beast's MARK are founded all their LAWS;
This Beast's MARK also WORSHIP overaws
All Popish-Courts have OATHS at their command;
Without an Oath no POPISH-COURT can stand.
In Popish-Courts no JUSTICE can be had,
But what with OATHS, and SACRAMENTS are clad.
And though by OATHS Conspiracies are made
Yet they allow FALSE-SWEARING as their Trade.
For so Demetrius-Art comes in by Stealth,
By CRAFT of Oaths they know they get their Wealth.
All PAPISTS cast away Gods Laws, and then
They swear, and only Keep the Laws of Men.
Can men believe for this the LAND must mourn?
Yea must (for OATHS) lie wast and all forlorn?
O brave-soul'd-QUAKERS! who all OATHS withstood;
In spite of Laws, of Prisons, Famine, Blood:
And yet can live in Peace, and Trade, and gain,
Thus proving SWEARING-OATHS to be in vain,
He that will swear, will lie (the Proverb says)
He that will lie, will swear (both of like Faith.)
What Is more than YEA, or NAY, Christ says is EVIL;
Whence comes all SWEARING then but from the DEVIL?
Used to ensnare the CONSCIENCE of the Just,
To plot all TREASONS, or deceive all TRUST.
Commandment IV.
GOds SABBATH is the SEVENTH-DAY of Rest,
Which GOD did hallow after SIX, and blessed.
POPES (more than all the Six) the SEVENTH profane,
And (in its stead) the FIRST DAY do ordain.
Rest ( God commands) when we have labored SIX;
Popes do (before all Labor) REST prefix.
God makes the DAY from Even unto Night;
Popes from the Morning to next Morning-Light.
GOD links sev'n days in Weeks (as in a Chain;)
POPES break all Times, and Weeks, and Links as vain.
Men therefore blush not to blaspheme, and say,
CHRIST was the CHANGLING, and did change the DAY
Thus (breaking Gods own Law) make CHRIST a Sinner,
And of all SABBATH-BREAKING the Beginner.
Yea, because Christ of Sabbath Day is LORD,
To change it therefore he does thus accord:
Supposing him (as PRODIGALS) to spend,
Or lose, or change his BIRTHRIGHT to no end.
The Father (thus) and Son are set at Odds,
(As Heathens fancy of their IDOL-GODS:)
As if the Father ended with Creation,
Or Jesus were confined to Salvation:
And both of THEM at strife which greater were,
Or which of THEM did best deserve the CHAIR.
If all these fail, then every day is holy,
Which to make good, their CHURCH maintain this Folly.
No wonder then their Almanacks they gild;
With glutted Names of Saints and Angels filled.
Or else their Wits must (with the WORLD) go round,
And so ONE Day is either lost, or found.
Fools (as they are) not heeding how the SUN
Does carry on the DAY since he begun.
Here some do Joshuahs-Sun (slily) object;
Others on Hezekiahs do reflect:
But Ioshuahs SOLSTICE was computed then,
And Hezekiahs Sun turned back again.
For Prophets (with the People) the Suns Race
Did so direct, that SABBATHS keep their place;
But then (at last) who can tell which is which?
Though Jews, and Turks, and Popes may unbewitch.
They all three witness which of these should stand,
Since each does bring the SEVENTH-DAY to hand.
TURKS keep the SIXTH, prove SEVENTH not yet come:
POPES keep the FIRST, the Seventh's lost at Rome.
Thus JEWS (alone) do still the SEVENTH. keep.
A PETER did between too SOLDIERS sleep;
And CHRIST between two THIEVES was crucified;
So 'twixt the SIXTH and FIRST, the SEVENTH'S decried.
Commandment V.
WIth PROMISE God has crowned this FIFTH Command,
As these few Lines may give to understand.
Honor thy PARENTS all with HONOR due,
That in thy Land thy Days may not be few.
The POPE cries CORBAN, serve the Mother Church,
And give her ALL; leave Parents in the Lurch.
But yet of Parents all GOD is the FIRST,
SONS that obey not him, are Sons accursed.
For HE is Parent of all Parents; HE
Before all Parents must obeyed be.
Father of Fathers; King of Kings most high;
GOD lives for ever, but all MEN must die.
And yet the Pope does proudly arrogate,
He Is GOD of GODS; at least Gods SURROGATE:
And by Christ's Rule greatest to be of All,
Servant of Servants He himself does call.
He takes the Title of a cursed CHAM,
He acts the WOLF in Title of a LAMB.
The Son of MARY was both GOD and MAN;
The POPE is neither, is He DEVIL then?
If Kings and Parents then will be obeyed,
Let them serve God themselves, or be afraid.
If SONS and SUBJECTS know not which to obey,
Ask Conscience GOD or MAN, which will it say?
Commandment VI.
THou shall not commit MURDER (says the Lord:)
But I may (says the POPE) I have the Sword.
It Is the Priests Office for to kill, and slay
Of Sacrifices Thousands in a Day.
By Jacobs Sons Sechem, and Sons all slain:
Meroz was cursed that wore the Sword in vain.
The Levites Execution did with SWORD,
On Brethren, and on Friends at MOSES Word.
How should we HERETICS suppress if we
Did not use Poisons, Swords, and Treachery?
Were It not for Oaths, and Swords, and penal Laws,
Our CHURCH would starve with Magpies and Jackdaws,
And Churchmen might (as idle) go pick Straws.
GOD says his Blood that shed Man's shall be shed;
Both POPES and KINGS do pardon without Dread.
But this Command brings JUSTICE to the Bar;
Did Gods Command Gods Justice ever mar?
To reconcile them both, the SCOPE comes in,
Whether it were for GOODNESS, or for SIN.
It Is sin to do what GOD does once forbid;
It Is Goodness to obey what God does bid.
It Is JUSTICE then whom God commands to kill;
It Is MURDER (without God) Man's blood to spill.
If Princes bid us murder, kill, and slay,
The Quest'on then is new which to obey:
SAINTS, or IDOLATERS, the OBJECTS be,
Which we may kill, or we may let go free.
GOD kills IDOLATERS, of SAINTS takes care;
POPES kill all Saints, Idolaters they spare.
Commandment VII.
ADULTERY forbidden is by God;
And FORNICATION must feel the Rod.
Lasciv'ous Words, and Gestures, Looks of Eye,
Gods written-Word does in the Heart epsy.
Unvoluntary DREAMS do Man defile;
How pure is God! How impure Man and vile!
All Lust (therefore) and Sin for to prevent,
God ordains MARRIAGE sufficient.
But Popes more holy far, and far more pure,
All BIBLES curse, and will not them endure.
They forswear Marriage, as most profane,
Catholic STEWS they rather do maintain.
Yet for the Vulgar LAITY such stuff
As solemn Marriage is good enough:
And for them made a holy SACRAMENT,
Whence PRIESTS (as one of seven) gather Rent.
Licenses, Weddings, Child-beds, Christenings,
Churches, Whoredoms, Divorces profit brings.
But Popes, Priests, Cardinals, and Orders holy,
Forswear all MARRIAGES as costly Folly.
Theirs is a far more frugal SACRAMENT,
They swear a single Life of more Content.
Their LUST they satisfy with little Cost;
Without a TAMAR Onans Seed is lost.
They sometimes get into a NUNNERY,
And there increase their sworn VIRGINITY.
By which means there is no want of VIRGINS Milk,
To be adored with Mary's GOWN of SILK.
They sometimes WIVES absolve, and then they meet
Two SACRAMENTS together in a SHEET.
Sometimes young BOYS and GIRLS they sanctify
In exercising their VIRGINITY.
And yet to be more chaste and Innocent,
Their Chastity's on harmless TURKEYS spent.
Now to conclude, God does allow DEGREES
Of keeping this COMMAND, and they are these.
First (which is rare) a Life ANGELICAL,
An EUNUCH (truly) EVANGELICAL;
TO CHRIST an EUNUCH wedded as was PAUL.
Next MAN and WIFE whom GOD has joined in ONE,
As was in PARADISE-PERFECTION.
Lastly POLYGAMY Gods Word connives,
Only to HUSBANDS; never unto WIVES:
Unless the Husband's gone, or Husband's dead,
Then WIVES are given to another Bed.
All other Mixture (painted never so well)
If they repent not, God condemns to HELL.
All White-sheet, Money Penance cannot hide
Black SODOMY, nor WHOREDOM of the Bride.
Gods holy Eye will pardon no such Evil,
They all came (from) and must go (to) the Devil.
Commandment VIII.
STeal not (says GOD) unless five, or four fold
Thou shall restore; if poor thou shall be sold.
Tush (says the POPE) all this is too much Pity,
And that (the Proverb says) will spoil the City.
THIEVES (if they live) may live to steal again,
And so all rich Men gather Wealth in vain.
Hang up the Thief, then he can steal no more,
Let WIFE and CHILDREN beg from door to door.
Hang Thieves, confiscate all their Goods to ME;
To terrify, starve their POSTERITY.
JEWS did but plunder Mutton, Beef, or Meal;
Now Treasures, Crowns, and Kingdoms men dare steal.
Rich men had rather LIFE than MONEY lose;
(If put to choice) they rather Death would choose.
Besides; this was the old way of the JEWS,
Which is not lawful (now) for us to use.
Wealth answers All; GOD-MAMMON of this Life,
For whom all KINGDOMS have a constant strife.
But if that Men do covet to obtain
Their OWN; and Thieves restore it back again;
They guilty are of the same THEFT as They,
And both may hang together in a Day.
The reason's plain, as all men now may see,
For THIEVES did steal from Them, and They from ME.
Commandment IX.
GOD says that thou false Witness shall not bear,
Much less commands he any for to swear.
Such as the WITNESS is, such is his WORD,
In spite of OATHS, of HECTORS, or the SWORD.
WITNESS can go no further than his Eye,
Or Ear, if Tongues of Speakers do not lie.
None are Gods WITNESSES who speak not true;
LIES are but for the DEVIL, and his CREW.
Alas! how then could Popish-Plots take place,
If swearing LIES did not the TRUTH outface?
Popes IRISH-EVIDENCE would be in vain,
If swearing Lies could not those Lies maintain.
And they Ten Thousand WITNESSES and Ten,
Have all in readiness to swear like Men.
Implicit Faith, and blind Obedience,
And Merits of the CHURCH deprive their Sense.
MILLIONS there are that care not what they say,
Or swear, or do, or suffer in a Day!
Nay, how would JUDGES know what Course to steer,
If swearing Lies in LAW refused were?
The POPE might all the Kingdoms gain by LAW,
Could He but all their Jurors overawe.
JEZEBEL Naboth's Vineyard had not got,
Had She not BELIAL-WITNESS in the Plot.
Dissenters (thus) from CHRIST all others mock,
And bring the POPES Dissenters to the Block.
Commandment X.
THOU SHALL NOT COVET; it is the ROOT of EVIL;
It never came from GOD, but from the DEVIL.
Covet no Neighbors Servant, House, nor Wife;
Nor ought of his that may engender Strife.
COVETOUSNESS, the DROPSY of the MIND;
They more desire, and not enough can find.
Though all they ask they have, yet not content;
The Mind's unsatisfied; discontent.
More WORLDS from Alexanders wish, debarred;
King AHAB pined for Naboth's Vineyard.
That dumb GOD MAMMON living without Lungs.
In rich men's Hearts, and gives to all men Tongues:
A GOD that can do naught, and yet makes MEN
Do all things, which to write affrights my Pen.
The Price of Souls (which they to make all even)
Join HELL (with Wealth to boot) to weigh down Heaven.
FATHER of POPES, begetting CARDINALS,
And KINGS that are most rich, most happy calls.
Yet Skin for Skin (says Satan) what men have
(If sick) they freely give their Lives to save.
But covetous (although in perfect Health)
Will rather part with LIFE, than part with WEALTH.
What profit (JESUS says) the WORLD to gain,
And so expose the SOUL to endless pain?
POPES (to be sure) agreement make with HELL,
And with the KEYS of HEAVEN live too well.
Yet to the GODLY God has ever sent,
Both FOOD and RAIMENT to their own Content.
But what Content can proud POPES ever have,
Who seek all KINGS and KINGDOMS to enslave?
Who claim both HEAVEN, HELL, and PURGATORY;
Yea, PARADISE, and all supposed GLORY,
Go on (ye mad-brain'd PAPISTS) boast your POPE,
'Twere well your TORMENTS ended in a ROPE.
Finis coronat opus.

AN APPENDIX OF THE Sovereign and Dreadful AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE.
BY many Kings and Parliaments (in Print)
Are BIBLES published: To be a stint
For all Men's ACTIONS, what to say, or do;
To learn what is (truly) wise, and good, and true.
Here Kings, and Beggars learn SALVATION,
Or else are doomed to DAMNATION.
For God sends strong DELUSIONS to all those,
Who LIES do love, and will Gods TRUTH oppose.
All LAWS approved are, that with it join;
All LAWS are void that from it ought purloin.
For by this Word of God this WORLD is doomed,
When MEN, and Men's RECORDS are all entombed.
In that great Day when POPES and KINGS shall call
To Mountains on their trembling Joints to fall.
The WORD of GOD for ever does endure;
The WORDS of Men are Changlings; never sure.
The WORD of GOD made Heaven, Earth, and Sea;
When POPES, or KINGS, can make a Whale, or Flea;
Then will I quest'on whom I ought to obey,
Whether the Word of God, or what Men say.
God's WORD so perfect, that it makes a Man
Perfect to all good Works which naught else can.
Gods WORD so perfect, none may to it add,
Nor yet diminish; for both GOD forbad.
He that does add, PLAGUES to him added be;
And he that takes away no LIFE shall see.
No MEN, nor ANGELS, other Word may preach;
Or else accursed be, that so will teach.
What TRAITORS then are They who without SHAME,
Do preach DAMNATION to another BLAME?
Who act INJUSTICE with so high a Hand,
As if INJUSTICE were by Gods COMMAND.
When Treasons, Murders, Plots, and Perjuries;
When LIES must pass for TRUTH, and Truth for Lies:
When MASSACRES go on in MASQUERADE,
As if all tolerated in a SHADE;
Then cursed are THEY who without Fear, and Dread,
Against the WORD of GOD dare act, or plead.
Contra SCRIPTURAS nemo CHRISTIANUS.

Aug. Magna est VERITAS, and praevalebit. As the great SHIBBOLETH the BIBLE is,
For CHRIST to try who are, and are not HIS.
