A most excellent Ballad of S. George for England and the Kings daughter of
Egypt, whom he delivered from death, and how he slew a mighty Dragon. The tune
is, flying fame.
OF Hectors d^^ds did Homer sing
and of the Sack of stately Troy
What grief fair Hellen did them bring,
which was sir Paris only joy.
And with my pen I must recite
S. Georges deeds an English Knight
Against the Sarazens full rude,
fought he full long and many a day.
Where many Giants he subdued
in honor of the Christian way
And after many adventures past
To Egypt land he came at last
And as the story plain does tell
within the Country there did rest
A dreadful Dragon fierce and fell
whereby they were full sore oppressed,
Who by his poisoned breath each day
Did many of that City ^lay,
The grief whereof did grow so great
throughout the limits of the land
That they their wise men did entreat
to show their cunning out of hand
which way they might this Dragon stroy
That did their Country so annoy
The wise men all before the King,
framed this matter in continent,
The Dragon none to death might bring,
by any means they would invent
his skin more hard then brass was ^ound
that sword or sp^ar can pierce or wound.
When this the people understood
they cried out most pitiously
The Dragons breath infected their blood,
that they in heaps each day did dye
Amongst them such a plague it bred.
The living scarce could bury the dead
No means there was as they could find
for to appease this Dragons rage
But by a virgin pure and kind,
whereby they might his fury swage
Each day he should a Maiden eat
For to allay his hunger great.
This thing by art the wise men found
which truly must observed be
Wherefore throuhout the City round
a Uirgin pure of good degree
Was by the Kings Commission still
Took up to serve the Dragons will
Thus did the Dragon^ very day
a Maiden of the Town devour,
Till all the Maids were w^rn away
and none were left that present hour,
Saving the Kings fair Daughter bright,
Her Fathers joy and hearts delght.
Then came the Officers to the King
this heavy message to declare,
Which did his heart with sorrow sting
she is quoth he my Kingdoms heir
O let us all be poisoned here,
Ere she should dye that is my dear
Then rose the people presently,
and to the King in rage they went
Who sa^d his daughter dear should dye
the Dragons fury to prevent,
Our daughters all are dead quoth they
And have been made the Dragons prey,
And by their blood we have been blessed
and thou have saved thy life thereby
And now in justice it does rest,
for us thy daughter so should dye
O save my daughter said the King,
And let me feel the Dragons sting,
Then fell fair Sabrine on her knee,
and to her Father then did say,
O Father strive not thus for me,
but let me be the Dragons prey,
It may be for my sake alone,
This plague upon this Land was shown
It Is better I should dye she said
then all your Subjects perish quite
Perhaps the Dragon here mas laid
for my offense to work this spite,
And after he has sucked my gore
Your Land shall feel the grief no more.
What have thou done my daughter dear
for to deserve this heavy scourge,
It is my fault as may appear
which makes ye gods our state to grudge
Then ought I die to stint the strife,
And to preserve thy happy life.
Like madmen then the people cried,
thy death to us can do no good,
Our safety only does abide
to make thy daughter Dragons food.
Lo here am I, I come quoth she,
Therefore do what you will with me
Nay stay dear daughter quoth the Queen
and as thou art a Uirgin bright.
Thou have for virtue famous been
so let me cloth thee all in white,
And crown thy head with flowers sweet,
An Ornament for virgins meet.
And when she was attired so,
according to het Mothers mind,
Unto the stake then did she go,
to which they did this Uirgin bind.
Who being bound to sta^e and thrall
She bad farewell unto them all.
Farewell dear Father then quoth she
and my sweet Mother meek and mild,
Take you no thought nor w^ep for me
for you may have another child,
Here for my Countries good I Will dye
Which I receive most willingly,
The King and Queen with all their train
with weeping eyes went then their way
And let their Daughter there remain
to be the hungry Dragons prey.
But as she did there weeping lie
Behold St. George came riding by,
And seeing there a Lady bright
fast tied to the stake that day
M^st like unto a valiant Knight
strait unto her did take his way
Till me sweet maiden then quoth he
What person thus abused thee.
And low by Christ his Cross I vow
which here is figured on my breast
I will revenge it on his brow
and break my Lance upon his chest,
And speaking th^s whereas he stood
The Dragon iss^^d out of the wood
The Lady that did first espy,
the dreadful D^agon coming so
Unto St. George aloud did cry
and willed ^i^ away to go
Here comes that cursed fiend ^uoth she,
That soon will m^ke and end of me
St. George then ^^ing round about
the fiery Dragon soon espied
And like a Knig^t of courage stout
against him he ^id fi^^cely ride
And with such bl^ws he did him greet
That he fell under his horse feet.
FOr with a Lance that was so ^^^ong,
as he came gaping in his ^ace
In at his mouth he thrust it long
the which could pierce no other p^ce
And there within t^is Ladies vie^
This dreadful Dragon then he sle^.
The savor of his poisoned breath
could do this Christian Knight no ^arm
Thus did he save the Lady from death
and h^me he led her by the Arm
Which when Ptolomy d^d see
There was great mirth and melod^
When as the famous Knight. Saint G^rge
had slain the Dragon in the field
And brought the Lady to the C^^r
whose sight with joy their hearts^ld
He in the Egyptian Court then stad
Till he most falsely was betrayed
The Lady Sabrine loved him well
he counted her his only joy,
But when their love was open kn^n
it proud to Georges great annoy
The Morocco King was in the C^rt
Who to the Orchard did resort
Daily to take the pleasant Air
for pleasures sake he us'n to wal^
Under a wall whereas he heard
St George with Lady Sabrine tak
Their love he revealed to the King
Which to St George great woe did ^ing
These Kings together did devise
to make the Christian Knight a^ay
With Letters him Ambassador
they strait way sent to Persia
And wrote to Sophy him to kill,
And Traitorously his blood to spill
Thus they for good did him reward
with evil and most subtily,
By much vile means they did devise
to work his death most cruelly,
While he in Persia abode
He quite destroyed Each Idol god.
Which being done, he strait was call
into a Dungeon dark and deep
But when he thought upon his wrong
he bitterly did wail and weep.
Yet like a Knight of courage stout,
Forth of the Dungeon he got out
And in the night three horsekeepers
this valiant Knight by power slew
Although he fasted many a day
and then away from thence he flew
On the best Steed that Sophy had
Which when he knew he was full sad
Then into Christendom he came
and met a Giant by the way
With whom in combat he did fight
most valiantly a Summers day,
Who yet for all his ^ates of steel
was forced the sting of death to feel.
From Christendom this valiant Knight
then with warlike Sould^ers past
Uowing upon those Heathen Lands
to work revenge which at the last
E^r thrice three years were gone and spent,
He did unto h^s great con^ent,
Save only Egypt Land ^e spa^^^
for Sabrine bright her only sake,
And ere his rage he did suppress,
he meant a trial kind to make.
Ptolomy did know his streng^h in field
And un^o him did kindly yield
Then he the Morocco King did kill
and took fair Sabrine to his wife
And after that contentedly
with her St George did l^ad her life,
Who by the virtue of her chain
Did still a Uirgin pure remain
To England then St George did bring
this gallant Lady Sabrine bright
An Eunuch also came with him,
in whom the Lady did delight.
None but these three from Egypt came
Now let me print St Georges fame.
When they were in a Forest great
the Lady did desire to rest
And then St Ge^rge to kill a Dear
to feed thereon did think it best
Left Sabrine and the Eunuch there
While he did go and kill a Deer
The mean time in his absence came
two hungry Lions fierce and fell
And tore the Eunuch presently.
in pieces small the truth to tell
Down by the Lady then they laid,
Whereby it seems she was a maid
But when St George from hunting came
and did behold this heavy chance
Yet for this lovely Uirgin pure
his courage then he did advance,
And came into the Lions sight
Who ran at him with all their might.
But he being no whit dismayed
but like a stout and valiant Knight
Did kill the hungry Lions both
within the Lady Sabrines sight
But all this while sad and demure
She stood there like a Uirgin pure
Then when St George did truly know,
this Lady was a Uirgin pure
His doleful thoughts that ere was dumb
began most firmly to renew
He set her on a paltry steed,
And toward England came with speed.
Where he arrived in short while
unto his Fathers dwelling place
Wherewith his dearest Love he lived
when fortune did their Nuptials grace,
They many years of joy did see
And led their lives at Coventry.
