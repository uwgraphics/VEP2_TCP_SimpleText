To the Honorable Colonel JOHN GORGES, Governor of the City of Londonderry,
and the Castle of Cullmore in IRELAND, My duly honored and dearly beloved
Brother.
SIR,
NOW you have wrested the following Lectures out of my hands, I do but fairly
leave them there, whence I cannot recover them. So that this which I prefix, is
not so properly a Dedication as an Abdication. I must confess I never knew you
guilty of Extortion but in this Act.

I loath their Cunning, who by debasing and disabling, secretly design to raise
the price of their own labors: And do it this way, (...);
(...) (as the Orator speaks, though somewhat in another case) with much more
Artifice, then professed Hucksters do. But verily these Sermons (being
preached, by such an one as I do really account and know my self to be, in my
constant weekly course upon the Lords Day, and indeed a great part of them
twice a day, when I had no Assistant with me, having besides the Wednesdays
Lecture on my weak shoulders, and many other Ministerial Employments, not
without frequent Avocations and diversions, which in so great a place are
unavoidable) will be adjudged by discerning men unfit to have appeared to the
world, in such a way as this is. And herein I shall heartily agree with them.

Now seeing you alone are faulty here, I Dedicate the Book and Blame to you:
And, if the Sword of wounding tongues be bent at me, as being troubled with the
Epidemical distemper of the Times, an itch of being seen in public; you ought
in justice to step in between, and say as Nisus in the Poet, Virg. lib. 9.
Aeneid^s.
Me, me, adsum qui feci: in me convertite ferrum. And, I am confident you will
be my Compurgatour in this, that no Opinion of any thing in these poor labors
worthy of the Press has had any Influence on this Publication.

There is besides an apparent disadvantage, which I am very sensible of, Mr.
A^th. B^rges.
viz. That in this Tract I follow One of so great Accomplishments: who being
next the Light, and of a far more perfect Stature then my self, must needs cast
back a shadow on me: Unless I be so far behind him, that his shadow will not
reach me. But if it do, I shall (as Jonah in another case) rest very quietly in
that shadow.

The Subject handled is a choice and precious One, as any in the Book of God
without Exception. This Prayer being as it were a little piece, that dropped off
from the heart of Jesus Christ (as once Eliahs Mantle from his body) as he was
taking leave of his Apostles and the World together. When He was even going
forth to suffer, He (Swan-like) sung this dying Song, and poured out this
precious Prayer, being about to pour forth his very blood and life with it. And
this he did not for his Apostles only then about him, but for us also: even for
us, who should in aftertimes believe through their words. A man would think
our blessed Savior, when He had such a Task to undergo, and such a business to
dispatch, should have been wholly taken up with the preapprehension of his
instant Death and Passion: That this should have detained or diverted Him from
other thoughts; especially from taking care of such poor Worms as we are. But
that when he was drawing near to such a Conflict with the Wrath of God, and the
Indignities and Wrongs of men, He should have us in his heart: That our dear
Friend, who loved us and gave Himself for us, should think of us, and pray for
us, and speak of us to God the Father with so high affection when his own Soul
was heavy to the very Death: Such a Prayer made by such a Mediator, at such a
time as that was, must needs be worthy of the choicest and exactest Observation
of the Church in every Age to the end of the world.

Some Antiquaries tell us of the Diptyches, Lindan. Annot. in Liturg. S. Petri.
page 39.
much in use in the Primitive Church: Which were two leaves or tables bound
together, on the one of which was a Commemoration of diverse famous and renowned
Worthies departed in the Faith of Christ; and on the other a Commemoration of
the like Personages yet alive. Much Honored Sir, Joseph. Vicecom. Obfervat.
Ecclesiae. Dae Missae Apparatu. Tom. 4. lib. 7. cap. 17.
I shall present you here with a new sort of Diptyches, the Tables more exactly
answering one another. The one containing a Commemoration of a dying Christ,
and showing how He prayed on Earth: In which you may also see what is contained
in the other Table; and how he prays for us in Heaven, who ever lives to make
Intercession for us. So that if you desire at any time to know, how Christ
persues the business, and pleads the causes of his poor Church at the right
hand of his Father, you shall do well to have recourse to this Chapter, which
may be very fitly called a Counterpart of our Saviors Intercession.

And truly, for my own part, I must freely and ingenuously profess, that I had
never known so much of Christ and of his tender Care and Love of poor sinners,
had I not studied these Emanations and Effluxes of his precious Soul, had I not
seen his Breast open in this Chapter, and the Names of the twelve Tribes
transcribed out of the Breast Plate of the Typical into the heart of the
Typified High Priest. Fox Act. and Mon. ad Annum 1558.
And as the Queen of England sometimes said, That if they opened her when she
was dead, they should find Calais written on her heart: So when I had the
happiness to open Christ in this Prayer, (though with a most unskilful hand) I
found the Church engraven deeply on his Heart, and saw such things as cannot be
uttered. The Lord give you and me to know more of that Love which passes
knowledge, and to return more Love to Him, who prayed for us, and dyed for us.
We may easily exceed in loving other things and persons. We may love more then
we are loved, we may love more then we should love. But here our hearts may
take their full swing, there is no fear of over-loving Jesus Christ. For as
Bernard sweetly speaks of our Love to God, Bern. De diligendo Deo.
Modus Deum diligendi est sine modo diligere: The same may I as truly say of
our Love to Christ; The measure of loving Christ, is to love him out of
measure: So has he loved us,.
and so should we love him.

There are especially two great Boons which Jesus Christ begs of his Father for
Believers in this Prayer: That they may be one here, and that they may be in
one place hereafter. This Nation seems not to be under the dint of the
Influence of this Prayer at this time, in which the Lord has suffered such a
spirit of Division (a spirit that our Savior never prayed for) to possess his
own people: So that his Body lies a bleeding, the members being miserably rent
into pieces. He bled indeed sufficiently upon the Cross in his Natural Body,
but there was suddenly a Consummatum est to that. When will there be a
Consummatum est to this, in his Mystical Body? When will Christ say, It is
enough? When will the stream of blood that ran there, stop this which runs
here? When will there be an end of these (...), these after-afflictions of
Christ, which now he is sat down at rest on the right hand of the Father,
pursue him thither, and will not suffer him to be quiet in his glory?

It Is true, the Body of our Savior in these Nations, bleeds not now by cruel
Persecutors hands, as it has done in former Ages, blessed be the Lord for
ever. But, which is more unnatural and doleful, Bella per Aemathios plusquam
Civilia campos. Luca^. lib. 1.
it bleedeth by it self: one Member bleedeth by another; one member bites and
devours another, and it seems they will do so, until they be devoured together.
Though Jesus Christ has made them nigh to God, and nigh to one another, by his
blood, as the Apostle shows at large, Ephesians. 2 12, 13, 14. This Cement (woe
alas!) this rich and costly Cement will not hold. A trifle, a Conjecture, a
suspicion, an opinion, a notion raised by Art and fancy will do more to
sever, then the blood of Christ to soder. All the wit, and art, and skill, that
God has given men for better purposes and higher ends, is now laid out by some
to make or to maintain parties. Bern. in Ca^^. Sermon. 33.
I will not say as Bernard does, Omnes amici, and omnes inimici; omnes
necessarii, and omnes adversarii; omnes domestici, and nulli pacifici. But
surely it is much at this rate.

Now the God of Peace himself give us Peace always, and by all means. And
Jesus Christ the Prince of Peace, who does so often and so importunately beg it
of his Father for his people, as you may see in this Chapter, give us to reap,
in our days, the blessed fruits of this Prayer: That they that are but one
Body (according to the first branch of our Saviors Prayer) may have but one
Heart and one Soul in that Body, that there may be no Schism in the Body. And
they that are to be in one place (according to the second Branch) may keep in
one way to that place, that they may not fall out by the way, so far at least
as to divide, to part Companies, and part ways; that they may neither fail of
coming in the end to one place; nor lose the benefit and comfort of one
another Company and sweet Communion in the way thither.

And in that blessed place I hope ere it be long to meet you. And though the
Sea divide us each from other for a little time on earth, (...) for an hours
space, and that in face or sight, and not in heart, as the Apostle speaks:
(...). 1 Thessalonians. 2.17. Facie non Cord. Ambrosian.
yet through the red Sea of the blood of Christ, leaving all our sins behind us
(as Israel the Egyptians) drowned there, and dead upon the shore of this world,
we shall pass on to the Heavenly Canaan, where Jesus Christ our Head is, and
where he prays so earnestly that we may be. Amen, Amen.

Now in the mean time till we get thither, because I find by many warnings,
that I am like to go before you and prevent you, as the Apostles phrase is, I
put this Book, such as it is, into your hands. And as our Savior, when He was
no more in this world, as his own expression is, being as good as gone already,
did leave behind him this Divine Prayer, as a Memorial of his tender Love to
all his people: Sic parvis componere magna solemus. Virg. Eclog. 1.
So (if it be not odious to compare things of so vast a disproportion) I shall
desire to leave behind me (who am even going too) this my unworthy Exposition
of the same Prayer, as a Memorial of his dear respects to you, who is resolved
to live and dye

Your most affectionate Brother And humble Servant, in, and through, and for
Christ, George Newton.

AN EXPOSITION WITH NOTES Unfolded and Applied On JOHN 17.
JOHN 17.1. These words spoke Jesus, etc*


THE Words of such a friend who is likely to continue, take not so deep
impression as his who is dying or departing. The last farewell of such a one as
is dear in our affections is most observed, and best remembered. A secret
winning and commanding power accompanies such parting passages; and hence our
Savior Christ was frequent in them, when he was ready to be offered up, and to
be finally withdrawn from his disciples. They who left all for him; must needs
be very much dejected to be left by him; And therefore he was wise and merciful
to give them Comfort while he was among them, and to dispatch them down a
Comforter from heaven when he was departed from them. Upon the first of these
he spends no less then four chapters, all tending to confirm and fortify their
hearts against the bitter trials and afflictions which they were to meet
withal when he was gone. And this he does by speaking to them, and by speaking
for them. Both ways he seeks to strengthen them; by speaking to them in a way
of consolation; by speaking for them in a way of supplication. The first of
these he ends with the foregoing chapter, the latter he pursues in this; which
I intend (with Gods assistance) to go through withal; as I shall have ability
and opportunity. And therefore in the entrance of this chapter it is said with
reference to those which go before, These words spoke Jesus, These words he
spoke to his disciples in a way of consolation. And then immediately is added
what he spoke for his Disciples in a way of supplication. These words spoke
Jesus, and lifed up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father the hour is come, etc.

So that this Chapter which I am to handle is the Lords prayer. From the
beginning of it to the end, nothing but the Lords prayer. Not the Lords prayer
which he taught us, but the Lords prayer which he made for us. Not that which
he propounded to us, as our pattern; but that which he presented for us, as our
privilege.

Whether this were the very prayer which he uttered in the garden, when he was
in an Agony, is much disputed. Some think it was the very same for substance;
and that it is set down more largely here, by John then by the rest of the
Evangelists, because none of them were present, when Christ made that prayer,
but he took Peter, James and John with him, as you may see, Mark 14.33. But
this is but a mere fancy. For in the first verse of the following chapter, it
is manifest that Christ went not to the garden till he had ended this prayer,
John 18.1. When he had spoken these words, that is, the very prayer we are
entering on, He went forth with his Disciples over the brook Cedron; where was
a garden, into which he entered. Nor is it probable that our Evangelist, if he
had given us the sum of that prayer, would wholly have omitted that which was
the main petition in it, and which is so exactly mentioned by all the rest of
the Evangelists, Father if it be possible let this Cup pass from me. Of which
we have not the least hint in this Chapter: Besides it is to be observed, that
our Savior made that prayer in the garden lying prostrate upon the earth, as
you may see, Mat. 26.39. He fell upon his face and prayed: Whereas the prayer
we are now about to handle, was made, with face and eyes erect, and lifted up
to Heaven.

These words spoke Jesus, and lift up his eyes to Heaven, and said, Father the
hour is come, etc.

So that this prayer of our Savior was evidently, and unquestionably made,
before his coming to the garden of Gethsemane, just as he was about to go
thither. He had been swan-like singing out his dying song in the ears of his
Disciples, for the space of three Chapters, and speaking many things to comfort
them, being at the point to leave them. And having finished what he had to say,
he shuts up all with this prayer, These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his
eyes to Heaven, and said; which having ended, immediately away he goes, and is
betrayed; As you may see in the beginning of the following chapter.

You see then what a Subject we have now to handle; A prayer, and a prayer made
by Christ, the great High Priest, the Advocate and Intercessor of his people,
and the last public, Solemn prayer that he made with his Apostles, and
Disciples, just as he was about to suffer. He took his last farewell of them in
this prayer, and therefore you must think it was a Spiritfull, a zealous, and a
pithy one. When he was going to be crucified, he took his leave in a long
oration to them, which having done, he prayed among them, and so left them. And
truly such a prayer made by such a one as Jesus Christ, at such a time, and on
such an occasion, and among such a company, must needs be heavenly and
ravishing, and therefore will deserve our best intention, both in handling, and
in hearing. Christ was in heaven in his thoughts and his affections, when he
made it, These things spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said;
The Lord in mercy grant that we may be in heaven, while we hear it.

To make way to the handling of it, I shall consider three things; First, the
transition to it. Then Secondly the gesture, and the carriage of our Savior in
it. Thirdly the substance, and the matter of it.

First the transition to it, from the former chapter, These words spoke Jesus,
these words expressed in the long discourse before.

Then Secondly the gesture, and the carriage of our Savior in it, he lifted up
his eyes to heaven while he made it.

Thirdly the substance; and the matter of it, and it is wholly for the Church,
either for himself the head of the Church, in reference, and with relation to
the Church, or for the members of the Church First, for himself the head of the
Church, he desires glorification, Father glorify thy Son, in the first verse
of the chapter, and this in reference and with relation to the Church, as is
apparent at verse 24. That they may behold his glory. Then Secondly, for the
members of the Church, he desires confirmation, and that either for the
Apostles and Disciples then about him, the members of the present Church; Or
else for those who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of
the Church to come.

In the first place he prays for the Apostles and Disciples then about him,
the members of the present Church, who were already called and sanctified, at
the sixth, and following verses, whom God had given him out of the world, I
pray for them (says he) I pray not for the world. In the Second place he
prays for those who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of
the Church that was to come, ver. 20. and so on to the conclusion of the
Chapter, Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe
in me through their word.

So that this prayer of our Savior Christ you see, is very full. It is for
himself the head of the Church, And it is for the Church which is his body, of
which alone he is the Savior and the Intercessor. It is for the present
Church, it is for the Church to come. It is for the Apostles and the Ministers,
the officers and teachers of the Church. And it is for the ordinary members of
the Church, who believe through their words. So that whoever appertains to
the Church, let him live in what time he will, be he of what condition or
estate he will, he has a share in this prayer.

We must begin with the transition to it, These words spoke Jesus. These words,
what words? the words in the three Chapters next before, all tending to
establish his Apostles and Disciples, which the Evangelist relates exactly for
the comfort and confirmation of the Church of Christ, even to the worlds end:
and having done with the relation, he shuts it up with this, These word spoke
Jesus, and so goes onward to his supplication. The point apparently suggested
to us here, is this.

DOCTRINE. The words that Jesus spoke are very fit to be commended to the
choicest observation of his Church and people.
And here they are so carefully, and so exactly gathered up by the Evangelist,
and knit together in a chain, every Link of which is precious. And having laid
them all together, he writes this under them, These words spoke Jesus. q^d.
Take heed that you observe, and mark them well, they are the words, not of an
ordinary man, but of the blessed Son of God, the great Prophet of the Church.
These words were breathed from the lips of Jesus Christ himself, and therefore
see that you take notice of them, and value them accordingly. These words spoke
Jesus; indeed the sum and substance of the four Evangelists is but the history
of Jesus Christ, of his words, and of his actions, and therefore Luke reduces
all that he has written in his Gospel to these two heads, Acts 1.1. The former
Treatise have I made O Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach.
His treatise (as you see) consisted of these two things, either that which
Jesus did, or else that which Jesus spoke; So that his sayings (as you see) are
very memorable and remarkable, being by special revelation and direction of the
Spirit put in writing, and so left upon record for the instruction and the
consolation of his people to the worlds end. You may observe what care is taken
to gather up the words of Jesus, as they dropped from him upon all occasions,
that none of them might perish and be lost; by which it is apparent they were
things of worth and use, and fit to be preserved for posterity. And it is noted
to the praise of Mary, that she kept his Sayings when others lost them, yea she
kept all his sayings, and she kept them in her heart, that was the Cabinet in
which she put them, when others valued them as things of nothing, and looked
upon them but as loose words; And therefore she is set in opposition to them,
John 2.5. They understood not the sayings which he spoke to them, but Mary kept
all these sayings in her heart. She laid them near her heart as choice things.
It was the promise of our Savior Christ to his disciples, and one of the last
he made them, and therefore certainly it was a precious one, that if they
should forget the words that he had spoken to them, he would dispatch them down
his spirit out of heaven, and this should be one great part of his business
with them, to mind them of such words of his as were slipped out of their minds,
Ioh. 14.26. The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost shall come, and he shall
teach you all things, and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I have
said to you.

By which it is apparent that the words which Jesus spoke are very fit, etc.
And this will yet appear more fully and distinctly to you, if you consider but
these three things: First whose the words were. Then what the words were.
Thirdly, the manner how the words were spoken.

of the Church. The author of them, if you look no further, will purchase them
so much credit. They are the words that Jesus spoke, as you have in my text;
And shall that which Jesus spoke, any thing which he delivered, be thought
unworthy of the notice of his people? Why what was Jesus, that the words that
dropped from him must be so highly valued, and esteemed? My brethren, if you look
upon him upwards, with relation to the father; or if you look upon him
downwards, with relation to the Church, you will see enough for this, on all
hands.

1. If you look upon him upwards, with relation to the father, you will see
reason why his words should be Commended to the choicest observation of his
Church and people. He is the fathers own son. But you will say, wise fathers
have very often weak children. But Jesus Christ is so his fathers son, that he
partaketh with him of his wisdom, it is poured out into him in abundance. And
therefore he is sometimes called the wisdom of the father in the abstract, as
see, 1 Cor. 1.24. Jesus Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. And if
he be so very wise you may be sure he spoke wise words, and wise words are
worth the marking. In him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
Col. 2.3. And out of question what he brings forth is of the treasure that is
hid in him.

2. But in the next place, if you look upon him downwards, with Relation to the
Church, you will see further reason why the words that Jesus spoke, should be
so exactly noted, and so carefully observed. As he is the fathers wisdom, so he
is made to us wisdom, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Cor. 1.30. His father has
appointed him to be the great Prophet of of his Church. The great preacher, the
greater revealer of his truth and will to men, and therefore out of question he
can speak well, and his words are worth the marking. You may be sure the father
would not send out such a Prophet to the Church as were not worth the listening
to. No, no, God has anointed me to preach, faith Christ himself, Luke 4.18.
not appointed me to preach, but anointed me to preach, endued me with
abilities and gifts for that office, God who in former times (says the
Apostle) spoke to the fathers by the Prophets, has in these latter days
spoken to us by the Son. He was designed, you see, to be the spoksman for the
father to the world, to tell them what his mind is, and to preach the Gospel to
them.

We that are ordinary preachers of the Gospel, we that are underlings to Christ
in this business, must be enabled with some competent ability in this respect,
or else we are not fit for this work. And therefore when our Savior sent out
his disciples, he promised to give them wisdom, and a mouth; that is, matter
and expression, Luke 21.15. wisdom within, together with a mouth to utter and
to bring forth that wisdom. To show that both of these must go together in a
preacher of the Gospel. I know there is a latitude to be admitted and allowed
in this regard, but yet a competent ability to speak so as the people may be
edified by it, is indisputably required. And if the under-ministers of Christ
must have such a faculty, how great ability then must their Master have? Who
was designed to be the great Preacher, the great Prophet, and (as the Apostle
styles him) the chief Bishop of our Souls. And if he had such a transcendent
faculty to speak, then certainly the words he spoke are fit to be commended,
etc.



1. The words of Jesus, for the matter of them, commonly were Gospel words.
Such were the words to which my text alludes, in the three chapters next
before, full of nothing else (my brethren) but Gospel-sweetness,
Gospel-Promises, and Gospel-consolation against approaching troubles and
afflictions, these were the words that Jesus spoke. Christ in a sense (my
brethren) was the first, and certainly the chiefest preacher of the Gospel;
this great Salvation, at the first, began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
confirmed afterward by them that heard him, Heb. 2.3. And hence the Gospel,
(as you know) is called Christ's saying, John 8.51. The Law was the fathers
saying. God spoke these words. The Gospel is the Sons saying, This was spoken
by the Son. And hence says Christ in the fore-alledged text, if a man keep my
saying he shall never see Death. So that the sayings and the words of Jesus are
very fit to be considered: For his; you see, are Gospel-sayings, and Gospel
sayings are worthy of all acceptance, as the Apostle tells you, 1 Timothy 1.15.
Indeed Law-Sayings are not so readily attended to, and entertained. You know
(my brethren) on mount Sinai, at the giving of the Law, there were thunderings,
and lightnings, and terrible voices, and the event, and issue was, the people
fled, and would not hear, they were not able to endure the noise. But
Gospel-sayings on the other side allure affection, and invite attention. Upon
mount Tabor where our Savior was transfigured there was a shining Sun, a
bright cloud, a gentle and a pleasing voice, and the Disciples said, Edificemus
Domine, Let us build here, etc.

2. And as the words of Jesus for the matter of them were Gospel-words, so for
the efficacy of them, they were saying words; and so in that respect, the words
that Jesus spoke are very fit to be commended etc. The words that I speak,
says our Savior to the Jews, are spirit and life, John 6.63. they are so in
their operation and effect, they give Spirit, and they work life: And who would
not attend unto, and entertain such words as these are? His saying, if it be
received and kept, will surely save a man from death, yea, from eternal death.
We may depend upon it, he binds it with a strong asseveration, which he repeats
twice for the more Surety, John 8.51. Verily verily I say unto you, if a man
keep my saying, he shall never see death Death is not visible, the meaning is,
he shall not be annoyed and hurted by it; as you have the like Expression, Jer.
5.12. We shall not see sword nor famine. And should not such words be commended
to the Church, and embraced by the Church, as save from death, and bring
eternal life with them? The setting down of which upon Record in holy
Scripture, and leaving them to aftertimes, has been the life of many souls,
and will be yet of many more in every age, even to the worlds end.

If you consider in the last place, as whose the words were, and what the words
were that Jesus spoke, so the manner how he spoke them; you will see further
reason yet, why they should be commended, etc. For this you may depend upon,
Never man spoke like him. It is the attestation that is given him, John 7.46.
Which coming from his enemies, the officers that went to take him, is of the
more validity, Never spoke man like this man. Grace was poured into his lips,
as the expression is, Psalm 45.2. to show us that the grace there mentioned, is
a gift of utterance, and a faculty of speech whereof the lips are instruments.
They are the lips that form the words we speak, and bring them forth to those
that hear them; and hence this gift of utterance which the Psalmist calls a
Grace, is said there to be poured into the Lips of Jesus Christ.

There was a stream of holy eloquence continually flowing there, which
sometimes even drowned them that heard him. He spoke with power and authority;
his words had the command of men's affections, so that he carried them where he
pleased. Indeed he carried them beyond themselves in wonder, and astonishment,
to hear him speak sometimes as he did, Mar. 1.22. They were astonished at his
doctrine, not only at the matter of it, though that were admirable too, but at
the manner of delivery, For he taught them as one that had authority, and not
as the Scribes. And Luke informs us that all men bare him witness, and gave
testimony to him, he was so famous and renowned for this gift of his; and
wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth, Luke 4.22: You
heard but now that grace was poured into his lips, and here you see, that grace
was poured out of his lips. God poured it in, and he as freely poured it out,
so as the people wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth.
Such were the words that Jesus spoke, and such words you will say, are very fit
for choicest observation, and attention. The gift of eloquence (my brethren)
calls for audience, especially such heavenly and Holy eloquence as Christ's is.
And thus much shall suffice for Confirmation, etc.

Now is it so (my Brethren) that the words that Jesus spoke are very fit to be
commended, etc. The words that I speak are Spirit and Life, John 6.63. Oh (my
beloved) I beseech you let every one of us be far from giving way to any mean
account, or slight thoughts of any words that Christ spoke; Let us keep up our
observation, our estimation, our admiration of them to the very highest. It Is
true (my Brethren) we should carefully attend, and duly mark all Scripture
words, For all the Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 1 Timothy 3.16. And
all the Scripture is profitable for our selves, for Doctrine, for Correction,
for Instruction, to make the man of God perfect, as it is added there in that
place. But the words that Jesus spoke are the choicest part of Scripture, and
therefore must have choicest observation. Never man, and what if I should say,
never inspired man spoke like to him, they came not fully home to his measure:
They had the spirit indeed, and so had he, but he received not the Spirit by
measure as they did. He was anointed with that oil above his fellows; though
not without them, yet above them, as the chief Prophet, and they the
under-Prophets of the Church. And therefore when we read, or hear, or meet with
any words that Christ spoke, let us take special notice of them, let us fix and
dwell upon them, and let them rest and dwell in us. Let the words of Christ
dwell in us Richly, let us have an eye to mark them, an ear to hear them, and a
heart to keep them, as Mary had, of whom it is observed that she kept all his
sayings in her heart. How carefully did the Apostle keep that which our Savior
spoke, though it be no where mentioned in the Gospel, and wishes other men to
do so too, Acts 20.35. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is
more blessed to give then to receive, and so he minds the Corinthians in a
special manner of that which Christ himself spoke with his own voice, not by
the Ministry of others, 1 Cor. 7.10. To the married I command, and yet not I,
but the Lord, not I as an Inspired Apostle, but the Lord with his own mouth
when he was conversant upon the earth: as if the words that dropped immediately
from his lips did challenge singular regard. And such regard, my brethren, let
them have from us when we meet with his prayers, his sermons, his sayings, let
us set Asterisks in the Margent, and the finger of a hand to point them out to
special observation. Let us write under them, as the Evangelist does in my
Text, These words spoke Jesus*

Its true (my brethren) we have not the happiness as some have had in former
times to wait upon the Lips of Jesus Christ, nor to hear the graci^ words that
dropped thence: yet we may hear him in a sense at this Day^ ^e may hear him in
his word, and in his Gospel, and there may be Parta^ of these streams of holy
Eloquence which flowed from his mouth* and (...) may hear him in his faithful
Ministers, concerning whom the Lord him^^^f has said, He that hears them,
hears me: And out of question, that Injunction of the father, yet takes hold
upon us, This is my bes^ed Son, hear him. Hear him in his writing, and hear him
in his Messen^ers, although you cannot hear him in his own person. And
therefore I beseech you let us hear him, and let us hear him so, as to be
obedient to him. Let us remember what a dreadful curse there is gone forth
against the men that will not hear this Prophet, which will assuredly take hold
upon them, Acts 3.23. Every Soul that will not hear that Prophet, shall be
destroyed from among the people. It was a dangerous thing (you hear) to refuse
to hear Moses: He that despised Moses Law was to die without mercy. But it is
much more dangerous to refuse to hear Christ, there is a sorer punishment for
such, as it is added there, Heb. 10.28. It went very hard with those who
re^used the word that was spoken by Angels (that is) the Law that was delivered
by the Ministry of Angels. But if we refuse the word that was spoken by Christ,
(that is) the Gospel, and do it finally, there is but one way with us, we are
gone without recovery. For if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast (for the
execution of it) and every transgression and disobedience, etc. How shall we
escape, if we neglect so great salvation, which was spoken by the Lord! And
therefore I beseech you let us hear this great Prophet; if we hear him not, we
die, and that without mercy too. But if we hear him, and obey him we shall
live, and that for ever. The words that he speaks are spirit and life, and if
we keep his sayings, we shall never see Death.

John 17.1. And lift up his eyes to heaven and said.


AND thus of the transition to our Saviors Supplication, These words spoke
Jesus.

The manner of presenting it to God the Father, or if you will, the carriage of
our Savior in it, comes now in order to be handled. He lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and said. And here you have his gesture, and expression. His gesture
first, he lifted up his eyes to heaven while he made it. And in the next place
his expression, he did not meditate, or think it only, but he said it, his
Prayer was not mental only, but it was a vocal prayer, He lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and said.

As for the first of these (my brethren) it was usual with our Savior to pray
with eyes erected, and lift up to heaven; as I might give you many instances
out of the Scripture. And out of question it proceeded from the zeal and
earnestness of his affections, and from the fixedness, and the intention of his
thoughts, he being as it were, withdrawn from the earth, and from those lower
things, and wholly taken up to heaven, while he prayed. He was no longer here
below, no, he was above with God, while he was exercised in this duty.

Indeed it is observed of the Publican, that he was contrary to Christ, in this
regard, viz. in the external gesture of his body. Our Savior prayed, as you
have heard, with eyes erected, and lift up to heaven; The Publican with eyes
dejected and cast downward to the earth, and yet this carriage also seems to be
approved, Luke 18.13. The Publican (says the Evangelist) would not lift up so
much as his eyes to heaven, but smote his breast, saying, God be merciful to
me a Sinner. And truly both these gestures have their use in prayer, the one to
manifest a repentance, the other to declare our faith. The one to show that we
are cast down in our selves, the other to discover that we are raised, and
lifted up to God. But it became not Jesus Christ to pray in such a posture as
that wretched creature did, because he had no sin in him, and consequently no
shame, nothing to cast him down or hinder him from looking up with boldness,
and with confidence to God the Father. And hence he prayed not like the
Publican in a dejected way, but lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said.

That leads us to the second thing considered, Christ did not meditate, or
think his prayer only, but he said it. His prayer was not mental only, but it
was a vocal prayer, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour
is come, and so on: Its true indeed that as a man may say, and yet not pray, he
may utter good petitions, and speak a form of Specious words to God, and yet he
may not pray indeed, so as to find acceptance and success with God: So on the
other side, a man may pray, and yet yet not say, that is, not use the voice at
all, nor utter any words to God in prayer. And therefore it is said of Moses,
that he cried to God, when he was silent. And the Apostle speaking of the
Spirit tells us that he makes request to God sometimes, with sighs and groans,
that are not, yea, that cannot be expressed, Romans 8.26. So that a man may make
request to God without expression, as well by meaning as by speaking: And
therefore it is added in the following verse, God knows the meaning of the
Spirit, that is, he understands it, and accepts it. David prefers the
meditation of his heart, as well as the petitions of his mouth, Psalm. 19. ult.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart, etc. And therefore
in another place, he says of God, Lord, thou have heard the desire of the
humble, Psalm 10.17. So that you see that Prayer is not tied to the expression
of the tongue; For even Ejaculations that are swift, and sudden wishes darted
from the heart to God, the inward anhelations, thirstings, longings,
meditations, meanings of the Soul, are honored in the Scripture with the name
of prayer. Such mental prayers we have cause to think our Savior sometimes
offered to his Father when he was alone.

But here his prayer, it should seem, was vocal, he uttered it aloud that his
Apostles and Disciples who were about him, at that time, might hear it. He
lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said.

Now, this you see the Holy Ghost takes special notice of, as a remarkable, and
a memorable thing. He does not only tell us, that our Savior prayed, and what
his prayer was, from the beginning of it to the end. But he acpuaints us also
with the manner, and the circumstances of his prayer. He shows us what his
gesture was, he tells us how he placed his eyes, and how he used his voice in
prayer. These things may seem but small matters, and we may look upon them as
petty, inconsiderable things: But wherefore does the Holy Ghost so carefully
take notice of them, and set them down in writing for the Church, unless they
be of some weight, and some consideration? Methinks he intimates thus much to
us.

DOCTRINE. That there should be Consideration had, not only of the matter, but
even of the circumstances, the very gesture, and the utterance of a prayer.
The Spirit of God, you see, does not let pass such things as these, no, he
observes them exactly; And therefore surely, so should we too. He sets them
down for our use, and there is somewhat to be learned from them; For whatsoever
things are written, are written for our learning, as the Apostle Paul speaks.

And therefore it is usual in the Scripture, not only to express the prayers
that the Saints have made, and that Christ himself has made, but also to
describe their outward carriage, and behavior in them, which shows that there
is something even in that too. Sometimes our Savior Christ is noted to cast
himself prostrate upon the earth in prayer, as you may see, Mat. 26.39. he fell
upon his face, and prayed. And sometimes to look up to heaven, as you have it
in my text; So also when he raised Lazarus, John 11.41. he lifted up his eyes;
and when he healed the deaf man, he looked up to heaven, Mark 7.34. Sometimes
he only sigheth to himself in prayer, and we hear of no expression in the
sore-alleadged text. He Sighed, you must conceive in some petition which he
then put up to God, and said to the deaf man, Epphatah, be opened. Sometimes he
utters words also, which are audible to others, as I might give you diverse
instances out of his story in the Gospel.

So for the Saints, sometimes we find them represented sitting, as holy David,
2 Samuel 7.18. Sometimes standing up, as, Neh. 9.2. and sometimes kneeling in
their Prayers, as that is very usual in the Scriptures. Sometimes we find them
speaking words in prayer, and sometimes using meditation only, as David so
divides his prayer in the fore-alleadged text, into the words of his mouth, and
the meditations of his heart, and prays that both may find acceptance with the
Lord, Psalm. 19. ult. And all these ways the holy Ghost takes special notice
of, and leaves upon record for our instruction, by which he teaches us that
there should be consideration had not only of the matter, but even of the
circumstances, etc.

What then, it may be you will ask me, do our gestures, or does the manner of
presenting our requests to God, the outward manner with the voice, or
otherwise, fall under the command of God? Are we expressly bound to pray in such
a posture, in such a way, or manner of expression? Do these external
circumstances appertain to Gods worship?

I answer, No, in no case, the difference is wide between the bodily exercise,
and the Spiritual service. We are not under any ceremonial Law that binds us to
an outward circumstance, to a place, or to a posture, as the Jews of old were.
And yet there should be due consideration had, not only of the matter, but even
of the circumstances, etc. and that especially upon these two grounds. For,

These outward circumstances may in case promote the spiritual service. Daniel
was exact in this, even in his chamber, and it is carefully recorded, Dan.
6.10. He kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed. He prayed three
times a day, and still he was in this posture. And it is noted of our Savior
that he kneeled down and prayed, Luke 22.10. and this was in Private too. So
that he did it not with reference to others; and therefore a most eminent and
worthy man observes, that undoubtedly he saw he needed it himself: And if that
be admitted, assuredly we need such helps and furtherances much more.

These outward circumstances if they do not further, yet they express my text,
our Saviors lifting up his eyes to heaven, discovered where his heart was. And
therefore, humble gestures are especially required in public worship, because
God will be honored in the sight of others, yea, they are sometimes put for
all his service, Romans 14.11. As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to
me. And seeing hypocrites in matter of the worship and the service of the Lord,
are always ready to pretend they have as good hearts as the very best;
Therefore the Lord is wont to call so often, and so earnestly for the external
Service of the body, and that in the new Testament as well as in the old, as
you may see that place for instance, 1 Cor. 6.20. Glorify God (says the
Apostle there) and that not in your Spirit only, but in your body also, which
is Gods.

etc. Then,

First it serves to let them see their error, and mistake, who utterly neglect
such things as these are; who take no notice of their outward carriage in such
holy duties, but rather look upon it as a thing below the observation of a
Christian, who should be wholly, and entirely taken up with their spiritual
service; And yet as you have heard, the Holy Ghost takes notice of a gesture, a
cast of the eye in Prayer; and sets it down in white and black, we need not
doubt, for our information.

I must confess the great defect is on the other side, men are employed so much
about the form, the surface, and the outside of religious duties many times,
that they neglect the main business; Their thoughts are exercised so far about
the gesture of their body, the composure of their words, the framing of their
voices, and the like, especially in public prayer, that they have no regard at
all to the inward and spiritual service. The outward work is infinitely more
easy, and there is much more ostentation in it: And hence it is that the
greater part of men are wholly taken up with that which they themselves can do,
and being done, procure them most applause from other men.

But yet their placing all in forms, and outsides, and minding nothing else in
holy duties, does not justify at all our running off to the Extreme upon the
other side. No it is possible that even as hypocrites and rotten-hearted
wretches may be so intent upon the outside, that they have no regard unto the
inside; So on the other side the holiest and sincerest Christians, may be so
intent upon the inside, that they have no regard at all unto the outside. They
may so far look after the affection, and the zeal, and the devotion of the
heart (which is indeed the main thing to be looked to) that they may have no
thought at all of the External circumstances of their prayers, the gesture, or
the manner of their utterance, which are Considerable notwithstanding (as I
have made it plain enough) and therefore to be wholly careless of them is a
failing, yea though it should be in the best of Gods people.

you from having your especial eye on that whereon the eye of God is most, when
you are making your approaches, and addresses to him. I mean the carriage of
the soul and spirit, the inward fervor and humility, affection, and devotion of
the heart, without which all the rest is worth nothing; But yet let not the
gesture of your bodies, the utterance of your voice in prayer be utterly
neglected by you, concerning both of which, because I find them in my Text, I
shall give you some directions.

As for the gesture of your bodies, I shall commend these few things.

We are not bound to all the self-same gestures, which were in use among Joshua
and the Elders when they were routed at the Siege of Ai, and came before the
Ark of God to pray, they rent their clothes and put dust upon their heads,
Joshua 7.16. And Hezekiah when he came into the house of God to pray, at the
time when Senacherib besieged Jerusalem, he rent his clothes, and put on
Sackcloth, Isa. 37.1. And this they did, not that these fashions were
appropriated to the worship of the Lord, but because they were in use in those
times and those places, to express their grief by; So in the self-same place in
Joshua, they fell down to the ground upon their faces when they prayed. And so
did Jesus Christ himself, as you may see, Mat. 26.39. Not that this gesture was
peculiar to this piece of service, but it was taken from the civil usage of the
Country, because this was their way of showing reverence to superiors, as you
may see, Ruth 2.10. And therefore we do well and suitably to the directions and
examples of the Scripture, that we take up such gestures only in our prayers as
are usual in our Country, to express our sorrow and dejection, or else our
civil reverence and respect by.

Those reverend gestures which we use in prayer should be most observed

But thirdly this must be continually heeded both in public, and in then the
means; and must be more regarded then the means. I must not use the means but
for the end, so far as they are serviceable to the end. And much less, must I
use the means aganist the end.

etc. It were far better that the gesture came short of the heart, then that
the heart, etc. It is not good to compass God about with lies, mere shows do
never please in his service.

This for the gesture of your bodies when you pray: A word or two for your
direction touching the use, or the omission of the voice in prayer, etc.

He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said.



But yet, if other circumstances will permit, in which your Christian prudence
must direct you, use your voices. We shall observe it to have been the usual
practice of the Saints to speak in prayer, yea, in private prayer, as our
Savior did, Mark 10.39. God made the tongue as well as other members of the
body, and therefore will be served with this, as well as them. And so the
Prophet David praised God with the best member that he had, which some expound
to be his tongue. And therewith bless we God, says the Apostle James 3.9. It
is sometimes a quickening to the heart, and stirs up the dead affections to
greater fervency, and zeal, which by continuing in a mental supplication would
be apt to languish and decay; It keeps in the heart from wandering, by binding
it to give exact attendance on the tongue, to furnish it with matter and
expression; whereas in mental prayer, it is more apt to slide away, and run a
roving unobserved. Howbeit here I shall not peremptorily prescribe; in certain
cases to omit the voice is more expedient, and therefore I shall shut up all,
and leave it to your Christian prudence to direct you, to pitch upon that way
and method of presenting your requests to God, which ye will find most to
conduce to the affectionate, spiritual and heavenly performance of the duty.

And thus of the transition to our Saviors supplication, together with the
manner of presenting it to God the Father, both his gesture and expression.

Proceed we now to enter on the Prayer which he makes; and here I shall take
notice only of these two things, the Object of it, and the parts of it.

The Object of it, or the Person whom he presents it to, you see, is God the
Father: or to come a little nearer, God his Father, so he styles him in the
entrance of his Prayer, Father, the hour is come, etc. and the same phrase he
uses all along, as you shall see, if you survey it from the beginning of it to
the end.

Indeed, he gives him once the attribute of Holy, and once the attribute of
Righteous Father, but this is still the appellation that he uses, and from
whence he never varies. If he calls him any thing, he calls him Father. And in
this notion he considers him, while he is putting up his prayer to him; and
therefore this you see (my brethren) is the first word that he uses, when he
sets himself to pray, Father, the hour is come, etc. I make these addresses to
thee, as a Father, I look upon thee as a Father still, while I am pouring out
my prayer to thee; and therefore he reviews the appellation ever and anon, on
all occasions; so that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. God is the Father of the Lord Christ, and so he apprehended him, and
looked upon him, when he was making his Petitions to him.
The point, you see, has two branches: First, God is the Father of the Lord
Christ; then Christ did look upon him as a Father, and apprehend him as a
Father, when he was making his Petition to him.

God is the Father of the Lord Christ; I shall not waste away my time Mat.
3.17. Lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son: Me thinks he
seems to point him out, to special observation, This is he.

Sometimes our Savior on the other side acknowledges, and owns the Father, and
this is very usual upon all occasions.

But how is God the Father of the Lord Christ? or in what sense does he call
him Father here? no otherwise then we do? this will need a little opening.

To clear it to you in a word or two, you must consider, that God the Father
has two sorts of sons, either he has sons made, or else he has sons
begotten. He has sons made, and that both by Creation and Adoption. First, he
is said to be a Father by Creation; and thus he has a kind of universal
Fatherhood to all the Creatures. And therefore the Apostle styles him, the
Father of all, Ephesians. 4.6. He is in this regard, the Father of our bodies, and
the Father of our Spirits; The Father of our bodies mediatly and virtually
Created, in the loins of Adam. The Father of our Spirits, immediately, and
actually infused by himself; with this distinction only, that there are men,
who, under him, are the Fathers of our Flesh; but he himself alone is the
Father of our Spirits, as the Apostle lays it down, Heb. 12.9. And in this
sense, he is the Father of the Angels, who were immediately framed, and created
by his own Almighty hand, and therefore are called the sons of God, Job 1.6.
This Fatherhood of God (as I have said) is universal, and all the Creatures
have a share in it; so that even all of them may call him Father too, as well
as we, and use the Prophets words, Mal. 2.10. Have we not all one Father? has
not one God created us?

And thus, our Savior as a Creature, has an interest in the Fatherhood of
God. And here he has an Interest above others, though not an interest without
others, For he is the firstborn of every Creature, as the Apostle Paul speaks,
Col. 1.15.

And as this Father has his Sons made by creation, so he has Sons made by
Adoption, by which a remnant of Mankind are set apart, out of the free and
undeserved Grace of God, to be the children, and the heirs of God.

And here I see not, why our Savior Christ, as Man, should not come in for one
of the Adopted Sons of God; for one (I mean) above the rest, though not for one
among the rest; so that he has his Privilege in this regard, as the Apostle
intimates, Ephesians. 1.5. God has predestined us to the adoption of Children by
Jesus Christ. Perhaps the meaning may be this, first he has adopted Christ as
man, and as a creature, and then he has adopted us by him, as part of Jesus
Christ, and as Members of his body.

And as this Father has his Sons made, both by creation, and adoption: so he
has his sons begotten, and his sons born; for both of these expressions we
shall find in Scripture. He has begotten us, says the Apostle Peter, 1 Pet.
1.3. Of his own will begat he us, Jam. 1.18. And whosoever loves him that
begat, loves him that is begotten, 1 John 5.1.

And thus, our Savior also is begotten of the Father; and here he has his
privilege, and his pre-eminence as well as in the rest; For he is the
first-begotten of the Father, Heb. 1.6. when he brings in the first begotten
into the world: herein he is above Men, yea he is above Angels: For unto which
of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day, etc. And when he
brings in, etc, he says, And let all the Angels, etc.

Its true, that even we that are his Children are begotten, as Christ is; he is
begotten from eternity, but we in time. He is begotten so that he partaketh of
his substance, and of his very essence, that begets him: We are indeed
partakers of the Divine nature, but not by communication of the Essence of God,
but by participation of the properties of God. He is begotten of the Father
personally taken, whereas none of us are so. Its true we are the Sons of God,
begotten by an Act without, but we are not the Sons of God the Father (taken as
distinct from both the other persons of the Godhead) begotten by an act
within, as Christ is. He is begotten by a proper and peculiar act of God the
Father, in an unspeakable communication of the Essence of the Godhead from the
Father to the Son, which we are better able to admire then to express; for as
the Prophet says, who can declare his generation?

And this for clearing of the former member of the point, God is the Father of
the Lord Christ.

Now for the second, that Christ did look upon him as a Father, and apprehend
him as a Father when he was making his Petitions to him. You see it evidently,
and demonstratively in my Text. This is the appellation that he gives him in
this prayer, all along, as I have noted to you heretofore. Its true, that God
is frequently in Scripture styled the God of Christ, as see the place, etc.
Psalm. 45.7. God even thy God; and Christ does sometimes call him his God, as
John 20.17. I ascend to my God, but to the best of my remembrance he never
calls him so in prayer. He comes not to him by the name of his God, but by the
name of his Father, that is the sweet, and precious name that he delights to
call him by, when he is pouring out his prayers to him.

I shall add no more for proof, the point is plain, God is the father of the
Lord Christ, and so he apprehended him, etc.

Is God the Father of the Lord Christ? this then may serve for sweet I ascend
to my Father, and your Father. My Father, but so that he is yours too: first
mine, and then yours. My interest indeed, in this respect, is somewhat higher
and above yours, but it is not without yours: nay, to say truth, my interest is
for yours. God is my Father that he may be yours in me. Oh my beloved, what
melting joy and comfort is here for every member of the Lord Christ, in regard
of this relation; I give you but a hint in three particulars.

First, being the sons of God in Christ, we may be sure that he will Thou art
my son, this day, etc. Ask of me, and I will give thee. Psalm. 2.7. and this our
Savior Christ himself professes, John ^1.4. and as the Father always hears his
son Christ, so he does always hear his Sons in Christ. And truly, if the first
be once admitted, the latter follows unavoidably. For Christ the eldest Son is
intercessor for his brethren; in all their regular requests he never fails to
put in with them: so that they cannot be denied, unless he be denied too;
Christ and they must either stand or fall together.

Secondly, being Sons of God in Christ, we may be confident he Heb. 1.2. And as
Christ is the Son and Heir of God, so we are sons and heirs of God in Christ:
there is not a younger brother of us. Thou art no more a servant but a son,
Gal. 4.7. And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. If Sons of God
through Christ, then Heirs of God through Christ too. If we be sons, then also
heirs, Romans 8.17. yea we are heirs of all as Christ is; and therefore it is
added presently, Heirs of God, joynt-heirs with Christ. Jesus Christ as
Mediator, is not Heir to any thing, but we are joynt-heirs, and have a
joynt-right with him; there is an Inventory of our riches, 1 Cor. 3.21.

Naomi laid Ruths child in her bosom, Ruth 4.16. so God lays his children,
Isa. 4.11. and that is certainly a safe place. And as the Eagle spreads her
wings over her young, and carries them upon her wings, Prove. 32.1^. so God
throws his children under the wings of his protection, and carries them above
the reach of danger. This is very sweet comfort; be your troubles what they
will, you have a Father that is able to secure you, that is very tender of you,
that has set a guard upon you, Heb. 1. ult. Psalm. 34.7.

John 17.1. Father the hour is come.


IS God the Father of the Lord Christ? And consequently Christ the Son of God
the Father?

Why then I say, as the Apostle, He is the Lord of all, Gal. 4.1. He is not a
servant in the house, but a Son over the house, Heb. 3.6. And therefore he must
be obeyed, and served, according to the Psalmists Exhortation, Psalm. 2.11.
Serve the Lord. Well then, my brethren, let us think of this, and let us
hearken to that Counsel and advice of Christ himself, Take my yoke, my service
on you. Brethren let me engage you all this day for this Lord, and his service,
let me persuade you to receive him for the Lord your righteousness. Not to call
him Lord only, but to take him for your Lord, and to use him as your Lord, and
to yield him all that service and obedience which the name calls for.

Ah, my Beloved, let us not do in this regard as the greater part of Christians
in name and in profession do. Let us not wear the badge and cognizance of Jesus
Christ, and say, he is our Lord and Master, and the like; and in the mean time
never do his will, nor take any pains at all in his service: For this is but to
deal with Christ as the perfidious Jews did, to put a purple robe upon him, and
to bow down before him, and to call him, Hail Master, and in the self-same
breath to buffet him, and spit upon him. But as we call him Lord, so let us
carry and demean our selves toward him as our Lord and Master, and let us
yield to him that obedience which is due to him.

And to this end, let us consider what engagements lie upon us to draw us, and
to hold us to the service of this Lord: which I shall briefly lay before you as
motives to persuade.

the image of the invisible God, says the Apostle, Col. 1.15. The first born
of every creature, that is, the Lord of every creature, for the first born is
Lord of all. And why the Lord of every creature? You have the reason in the
following words, For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth. All things were made by him, and therefore it is fit that
all should serve him. Nay, my Beloved, they were not made by him only, but they
were made for him too, as it is added there in that place; all things were
created by him, and for him. By his power, and for his use. And therefore if we
be not useful to him, if we do not serve him, we cross the very end of our
creation. The brutish, and unreasonable creatures serve him in their kind and
measure, and therefore David says, that all things serve him. But we are bound
to serve him much more, because in our Creation we received more from him. He
made us Lords of all his creatures, ^^at we might have no Lord but him. He made
the whole creation to be serviceable to us, that we might be the more engaged,
and the better able to be serviceable to himself; that we might serve him for
it all, that we might serve him with it all. He put all things under us, and
truly we are bound the more (my Brethren) to be under him, and subject to him;
he made us men, he gave us reason, which he gave not to other creatures; the
greater reason have we to obey him, and to improve our parts and gifts in his
service. Indeed we cannot chose but see that it is all the reason of the world,
that as we have all from him, so we should use all for him.

The next is an engagement of Redemption which binds us to the service Pet.
2.1. He purchased us (my Brethren) us I mean, that are his own, at a very dear
rate, and therefore it is just that we should serve him; especially since it is
evident that this was his intention in his purchase. He bought us out of Sins
and Satan's hands, not that we might be absolutely free from all commands, but
that we might be his servants. He gave himself for us, says the Apostle Paul,
Tit. 2.14. that was the purchase that he made, a very dear one you will say: He
gave himself for us: to what end? that he might reedeem us from all iniquity,
from the dominion and power of sin. And what now, are we masterless? And are
the reins upon our own necks? Now mark what follows presently, And purify us a
peculiar people himself; a people to himself to serve him, and to do his work,
and to be very earnest in it too; and purify to himself a peculiar people
Zealous of good works; And so being free from sin, we are not left at large (my
Brethren) but we became the servants of Christ, Romans 6 22. This was the End
that he intended and propounded to himself in our Redemption; he dyed for us,
that we which live, should henceforth live no longer to our selves, but to him
that dyed for us, 2 Cor. 5.15. He has performed the mercy promised, he has
remembered, etc. he has saved us from, etc. Luke 1.74. What, that we might from
henceforth be our own men, and live at liberty, and walk according to our own
wills? Oh no (my Brethren) but on the other side, that we might serve him, who
has saved us, in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives.

The third is an Engagement of Covenant-obligation; we are his Covenant from
him, we are Covenant-breakers with him. Indeed we that are born of those that
are in Covenant with him, are born his Covenant-servants in a sense: For such
as the condition of the Parent is, (Beloved) such is the condition of the
child, as to outward privilege, and as to outward duty too. And hence it is
perhaps that David says to God, Psalm 116.16. O Lord, says he, I am thy
servant. My servant, might the Lord reply, Why how so? why says the Psalmist,
I am the son of thy handmaid. So we whose parents were within the Covenant,
were born to Christ in some respect, for we were born within his family, and so
(to outward view and cognizance) belong to his household.

But this is but an outward thing, some of us have gone further yet, and made a
Covenant with the Lord to serve him, we were in Covenant all of us with sin by
nature, and so with death and hell we were at an agreement too. But some of us
have utterly dissolved that Covenant, and entered into Covenant with the Lord
Christ. We are bound, let us obey, now we have made this Covenant with him, we
are the more engaged to serve him, and the greater is our sin if we run away
from him.

Is God the Father of our Lord Christ? The greater is his love to us, that he
should give Christ for us. If he had given but a servant, or a friend, it had
been much that he should part with either of them for an enemy; but that he
should give us his son, his own begotten son, to shame, to punishment, to death
for us; here is love, and here is mercy with a witness.

The Evangelist (me thinks) knows not which way to express it, and therefore
leaves it to the largest heart, and the vastest understanding to guess at it,
John 3.16. God so loved the world. So, how? I cannot tell you, it swallows up
my apprehensions and expressions: And therefore I must leave it to your selves
to think of it, and reach after it.

And truly (my Beloved) did we weigh it well in our advised and deliberate
thoughts, we should be carried out beyond our selves in an Ecstasy of wonder.
What (my Beloved,) that when the Father had but one begotten Son by nature, and
one that was so well like him, the very picture of his Father, etc. one whom he
loved dearly, in whom his very soul delighted, that he should give him forth
out of his bosom for such wretches as we are? That he could not spare his Son,
that he might spare his Enemies; behold what love the Father has declared in
this! Here is love to be spoken of, and to be wondered at in all ages. And thus
far of the uses of the former member of the point. Proceed we now to make some
application of the latter.

Is it so (my Brethren) that as God is the Father of the Lord Christ; So Christ
did apprehend him as a Father, and look upon him as a Father when, etc. Then
let us also apprehend him so, and look upon him so, who are the sons of God in
Christ, when we come to God in prayer: Let us present our supplications to him
under the notion of a Father, as Christ did; Christ is in this respect our
Pattern and Example, whom we ought to follow. We are required, you know, to be
followers of Christ, viz. in all his imitable actions, and this is one of those
actions. We ought to walk as he walked, and to pray as he prayed. And therefore
as his manner was to pray to God himself in this language, to come to God as to
a Father: So he has taught us also so to pray in the very same language, to
come to God as to a Father, as he did, Mat. 6.9. After this manner pray ye, Our
Father which art in heaven. So that we have in this, you see, the Precept and
Example of the Lord Christ; his Precept in the cited place, and his Example in
my Text. And therefore let us learn this lesson of him, since he is pleased to
teach us both ways, both by Precept and Example. When we are making our
addresses to the Lord in prayer, let us endeavor to apply unto our selves the
love and father-hood of God in Jesus Christ. Let us not satisfy our selves
with a general persuasion that he is a gracious Father to all his sons and
daughters in the Lord Christ. But let us strive for a distinct and a particular
assurance that he is our own Father, that he is so to us in special, and that
we are among the number of his children. That we may look upon him so, and
confidently call him so, when we are pouring out our prayers to him, and so
expect the love and mercy of a Father from him.

And to this very End, as the Apostle tells us, The Spirit of the Son is sent
abroad into our hearts. To what End? Why, to make us cry Abba Father, Gal. 4.6.
That is to make us pray to God, as to a Father, while others come to God as to
a stranger, with whom they have no acquaintance, and to whom they have no
relation. So that you see, we have not only the Precept of Christ, and the
Example of Christ, but we have also the Spirit of Christ, that we may pray in
this manner: And therefore in this Faith and confidence, the Saints of God have
prayed in Scripture. So did the Church, as you may see, Isa. 63.16. Doubtless,
say they, thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel
acknowledge us not, thou art our Father. It is repeated twice you see, and
bound with an asseveration too, to show the strength and certainty of their
assurance: And in the same persuasion we find them praying in the following
Chapter, in Verse. 8. But now Oh Lord thou art our Father, we are the clay, and
thou the Potter, we are the work of thy hands: And in the same assurance also
let us pray, when we are making our addresses to the throne of grace, let us
apply our selves to God as to a Father. The benefit and profit of it will be
very great, as I shall represent it to you in a few particulars, which you may
look upon as Motives to persuade.

This assurance will make us bold and confident in our approaches to we have
boldness, we have access with confidence to God, Ephesians. 3.11. And this was that
which heartened up the Prodigal, and filled his languishing and fainting heart
with resolution, I will arise (said he) and go to my Father: he had been long
debating, it should seem, and ruminating on the business in his wavering
thoughts: His late miscarriages, no question, were a great disheartening to
him, so that he knew not what to do. But at last he comes to this, I will arise
and go to my Father; he is my Father, and I am his own Son, and there is pity
and compassion in a Father to a Son, at least to a returning Son, though an
unworthy one, as I have been: And therefore let my faults, and my
discouragements be what they will, I will arise, and go to him: And truly while
we apprehend the Lord to be a Judge, and not a Father; or if a Father, not to
us, but other men, we find but small encouragement to come to him. But when we
look upon him as a Father, yea, as our Father, in the Lord Christ, this makes
us come with boldness to him. This causes us to delight in the Almighty, and
not to look divertedly, but to lift up our face to God, as Job speaks.



Can a woman forget her child, and not have compassion on the Son of her womb?
says the Prophet, Isa. 99.65. Can she deny him when he begs and hangs about
her? It is possible she may; there may be such a mother in the world, but God
is no such Father. No, he has infinitely more compassion on his children. Oh
what a matchless and unconquerable ground of hope is here, to those that have
this sweet assurance that God is their Father! What man is there, who if his
son asks bread (says Christ) will give him a stone, or if he ask a fish will
give him a Serpent? though the poor child perhaps cannot distinguish the one
from the other: If ye then being evil; know how to give good things unto your
children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to them that
ask him?

Children, so the Lord pittieth them that fear him, Psalm. 103.13. They are
without blame before him in love, Ephesians. 1.4. Though they have many failings,
yet he does not blame them; so great is his love to them, when they look upon
their prayers, and find this fault, and that fault, (as truly they have cause
enough) the comfort is, that God finds no fault; he says that it is well done.
And thus he dealt with holy David, as himself observes, Psalm 77.2, 3. He was
in such distress, that he was troubled to remember God; his very heart was
overwhelmed within him: a poor prayer you may think that any man could make in
such a case as that was: And yet that very prayer found acceptance with the
Lord; as he shows in that place, I cried unto the Lord (says he) in the first
ver. of that Psalm; and mark what follows, he gave ear to me. And thus when we
do bungle at his service, the Lord is apt to take it in good part, if we do but
what we can; and that because he is our Father; which if it be considered,
cannot choose but be a very great encouragement and comfort to us. But you will
interpose and say, perhaps here is encouragement indeed, and precious comfort,
if we can come to God in prayer with this assurance, that he is our Father: but
how shall we attain to this assurance? What are the evidences that we may rely
upon in this particular, which if we find them in our selves, we may be
confident to speak to God as to a father; we may be bold to cry Abba Father to
him?

I shall lay down a few, and make them as distinguishing, and clear as I am
able, to help you in this great business.

If God be your Father, and you be his children, you are very Philip, John 14
19. He that has seen me, has seen the Father also.

And truly we that are the younger sons of God, though we be not so like him,
yet we are very much like him. And therefore we are said to be renewed in
knowledge after the image of him that created us, Col. 3.10. And the new man is
said to be renewed after God in holiness, Ephesians. 4.24.

And are you thus conformed to God? do you bear his Image? so that every one
that sees you, and observes you, may judge who is your father: Are you holy as
God is? and are you merciful as God is? and are you perfect in desire, and
endeavor, as your Father that is in Heaven is perfect? do you love your
enemies? do you bless them that curse you? and pray for them that despitefully
use you? that you may show your selves to be the children of your Father, who
makes his Sun to shine, his rain to fall upon the evil and the good, Mat. 5.44.
are you freely merciful, lending and doing good to those where there is nothing
to be hoped for, but unkindness for your good will? that you may make it to
appear you are the children of the highest, who is kind to the unthankful and
unkind, Luke 6.35. These are good evidences of your interest in the
Father-hood of God. But if you be profane, and vicious, and cruel, and
unmerciful, as the greater number are; I may say to such as you are, as once
our Savior to the wicked Jews, You are of your Father the Devil, and his works
you do.

Abba Father, Romans 8.15. So that if we be Sons, we have this Spirit poured out
upon us.

But you will say, that every one almost pretends to the Spirit; and it is
evident that many are deceived in this particular. How shall we know
infallibly, whether the spirit which we think we have, be the spirit of the
Father, yea, or no? Why (my beloved) the Spirit of the Father i^ an active
Spirit, where it is, it leads men even where it will, it carries them, and
guides them in its own way.

And as many as are led by this Spirit, they are Sons of God, Romans 8.14. Well
then, thus far we are clear, if we be the Sons of God, as we have his spirit,
so we are led by his Spirit; we walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.
The flesh calls, and the spirit calls, This is the way, walk in it. The flesh
would have us follow it, the spirit would have us follow it. And the event is
this, if we be the Sons of God; we leave the flesh, and go after Gods Spirit:
We walk not after, etc. So then, if you would know whether you be the Sons of
God, examine whether you be guided by his spirit, yea, or no?

And this may be discovered by the course you take, and by the path in which
you walk. Gods Spirit guides and leads you always in the way of God, which is
prescribed and chalked out before you in the word of God. And this is clearly
and expressly taught us, in that alledgement of the Covenant mentioned, Exodus
36.27. I will put my Spirit upon you, says the Lord to his people. And what
shall this Spirit do? it shall cause you to walk in my Statutes, and to keep my
Commandments, and do them. It shall not give you new directions; it shall not
show you new ways, and new paths, other then those which are beaten out in
Scripture, but it shall cause you to walk in my Statutes. If then you err, and
wander from the ways of Gods Statutes, and walk on in your own ways, as the
Apostle speaks of the Gentiles: the way of your own hearts, which of your
selves you choose and follow; your ways of drunkenness* uncleanness,
profanation of Gods holy day, etc. if you walk in the way of Cain, a way of
cruelty and malice, and run greedily after the error of Balaam for a reward, as
Jude speaks, ver. 11. A way of covetousness and unlawful gain you are not
guided by the Spirit of the Father, but by the spirit of the wicked one, which
rules in the children of disobedience.

But if you keep the ways of God, the ways of truth, and love, and holiness,
and peace; the way that is so evilly spoken of by lewd, profane and vicious
men; And are no sooner swerved from it in the least degree, but you are crying
to the Lord with Moses, Lord show us thy way: with David, I am gone astray,
Lord seek thy servant; enquiring of your brethren to direct you, and striving
to get in again; you are guided by the spirit of your father, and may be
confident that you are the sons of God.

If God be your Father, and you be his children, you are a company of singular
and choice people: As you are like your Father, and consequently like your
brethren too: so you are unlike other men: you dwell alone, and are not like to
other people. And as the sons of Kings and Nobles, differ from the sons of
other men, they have another kind of garb, and habit, and behavior: Even so
the Sons of God, the King of Kings, do manifestly differ from the children of
the world. The Lord has singled them, and drawn them out, and put them in
another way; so that they are men of wonder in the world, their ways are of
another fashion. And this declares them to be the children of the High God; he
owns them only upon this condition, as you may see, 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. Come out
(says God) and be ye separate, and I will be a father to you, and you shall be
my sons and daughters, says the Lord God almighty.

Now (my beloved) are you thus come out and separated from the world? which
lies in wickedness, as the Apostle speaks; have you left your old haunts, your
old courses, your old Companions and Associates with whom you ran out formerly
to the same excess of riot? are you accounted gazing stocks, and wonders to the
world, because you are so different from them in all your ways? And can you say
in the uprightness of your hearts, that this your singular and holy walking, is
not in show, and in hypocrisy, but in sincerity, and truth? you may assure
your selves, you are the sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty.

But if you walk according to the course and fashion of the world, if you be
carried down the stream with the times, and with the places where you live; if
you have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, hear what the
Apostle says, 1 John 3.10. you have discovered whose you are, and to whom you
appertain. By this the children of God are manifest, and the ch^ldren of the
Devil. He that does not righteousness is not of God: he is none of Gods
children.

If God be your Father, and you be his children: you have a dear affection to
those who are his children, as your selves are. There is a tender Love, a sweet
agreement between you and your fellow brethren. If any difference fall out,
then say as Abraham once to Lot, Let there be no strife between us, for we are
brethren, Genesis 13.18. Let brotherly love continue, Hebr. 1.12. And the defect
of this affection, on the other side, is an apparent evidence of non-adoption,
as you may see, 1. Joh. 3.10. he that does not righteousness is not of God
(says the Apostle) the meaning is, he is not the child of God, and he that
loves not his brother: what think we then of those, whose sons are they, who
hate and trouble and disquiet those, who are indeed the Sons of God, and work
them all the woe and mischief they can, and that because they are so like God,
because they bear the image of God, and the clear impressions of his Holiness
upon them? If they will know their pedigree, they are the Children of the
Devil; they are the seed of the old Serpent, between whom and the woman's seed,
the Lord has put an unreconcileable and Endless Enmity and Opposition. And
therefore let not such (while they continue in this way of opposition to the
Saints) presume to come to God, and call him Father. For if they do, they fall
into the sin of Ananias in another way, Acts 5.4. they lie to God. And they
have cause to fear that he will even strike them dead before him.

But if you find within you working and warm affections to your
fellow-brethren, if your hearts be mightily and vehemently carried out to such,
and that because you see the Image of your Father shining in them, and even as
God is, even such are they in this world; They are so like him whom you love
transcendently, and incomparably more then all the world besides, that you
cannot choose but love them, and affect them dearly too, for his sake, and in
reference to him: So that your delight is in them, yea all your delight is in
them: You find no pleasure, or complacency in any other Company but such as
theirs is: I say (my brethren) if you love them thus, and upon this account, it
is a comfortable sign that God is a Father to you, and you may look upon him as
a Father, when you are making your petitions to him.

John 17.1. The hour is come, etc.


ANd thus far of the object of our Saviors prayer, or the person to whom he
presents it to, and that as you have heard, is God the Father.

Proceed we to the parts of it, which have been noted to be two according to
the paties whom he prays for. In the first place he prays for himself the
Head of the Church. And in the second place he prays for the inferior Members
of the Church.

First, For himself the Head of the Church, he desires glorification; Then for
the Members of the Church he desires confirmation: and that for the Apostles
and Disciples then about him, the Members of the present Church: or else for
those who were after to believe by their word, or to be called by their
preaching, the Members of the Church to come: as I have showed you formerly,
when I drew up a short Analysis, or resolution of the whole Chapter.

We are at this time to begin with that part of our Saviors prayer which
concerns himself; In which you may take notice with me of these three things:
the rise of it, the matter of it, and the reasons of it.

The hour is come.

Father, glorify thy Son.



At this time I shall fasten on the first Particular, the rise of this Petition
of our Savior, from whence he takes occasion to present it to his Father: The
hour is come.

The hour is come; What hour is come? the hour in which the Father had decreed
and fore-appointed to glorify his Son Christ: that hour was come, and
therefore he desires his Father to execute his purpose now, seeing this was his
own time.

But you will say, the hour which was now at hand, was the hour of Christ's
Passion, in which he was abased and humbled, as you may see he was betrayed
almost as soon as he had done this prayer. And how then could this be the hour,
in which he was appointed to be glorified of the Father?

To this I answer, that Christ was glorified in some respect, even while he
suffered, he triumphed upon the Cross, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Col. 2.15.
blotting out the handwriting that was against us, and took it out of the way,
nailing it to his Cross; And having spoiled Principalities and Powers, he made
a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it, that is in the same Cross.
The word that the Apostle uses there, alludeth to the fashion of the Roman
Conquerours, whose manner was to lead their vanquished Captives bound before
their Chariots in a glorious way, the people gratulating their heroic acts and
Victories with loud and joyful acclamations. Our Savior having spoiled
Principalities and Powers, did somewhat Analogical to this, and hence the terms
by which those ancient Roman Triumphs were expressed, are attributed to him,
(...), he made a show of them openly, that is, he brought them to extreme
dishonor, and made them spectacles of ignominy and reproach, and gazing-stocks
of shame, to men and Angels: and this he did upon the very Cross. Its true that
to a carnal Eye, this was the place of his humiliation; but to an eye of faith,
it was the place of his triumphant Exaltation. The world sees nothing but
dishonor in the Cross of Christ, but they that are enlightened, see the great
work of man's redemption finished there, sin and his kingdom broken there, and
the Devil vanquished, and led captive there, to Christ's eternal honor, and
their eternal ignominy and confufion. So that even with respect to this, (this
time of suffering on the Cross) our Savior Christ might say, The hour is come,
Father, glorify thy Son.

Or if you look a little further, to the time of his ascension and entrance
into glory, that hour was not far off; and that perhaps our Savior Christ
might aim at in my Text. However, this is evident, that that which he desires
here, he prays may be effected, and accomplished in his Fathers time. And this
he makes the ground of his Petition, Father, the hour is come, the time which
thou have fore-appointed to glorify me in; And therefore I beseech thee do it
now; thou have a time for this great work of thine, and this is the very time,
the very hour, the hour is come. Were it not so, I would not seek it, or desire
it of thee, but seeing this is thy season, now Father glorify thy son. So that
the Point suggested here, is this.

DOCTRINE. God has his time to do his Actions in, and he should not be desired
to do them any other time.
First, He has his times to do his actions in, that is the first thing in the
Point. He has his hour, a certain set and fixed season for any business that
he has to do: he has a time for works of Justice, and you see that place for
instance, Jer. 51.33. It is time to thresh her (says the Lord of Babylon.) And
so their feet shall slide in due time, speaking of ungodly men, Deuteronomy. 32.35. He
has his time for works of Mercy, as it is observed of Joseph, Psalm. 105.18,
19. his feet they hurt with fetters, he was laid in irons, until the time which
God had fore-appointed came. And as soon as that was come, the Lord so ordered
things, that the King sent and loosed him; the Rulers of the people let him go
free, as it is added there in that place. And hence the Lord is said to wait in
Scripture that he may be gracious, as in that known place, Isa. 30.18. Now he
that waits to do a thing, looks for a fit time: Thou shall arise and have mercy
upon Sion; says the Psalmist, Psalm. 102.13. For the time to favor her, yea,
the set time is come; so that you see God has his time to do his actions in.

Now for the second Member of the point, He should not be desired to do them
any other time. This is apparently suggested in this Petition of our Saviors
in my Text. Father, the hour is come, now glorify thy Son: q. d. If thy
appointed season were not come, I would not seek to have thee glorify me at
this time: I would not have thee do it for me now, unless this were thy hour;
But since the constituted hour is come, Lord, bring thy purpose into act and
execution. Our Savior is in this our pattern, whom we ought to follow. And
hence the Saints in their Petitions have left God to his own time, and sought
for mercies from him in his own season. As Daniel, when he found by books, that
is, the Book of Jeremy, and other Books, that the appointed return of the Jews
out of the Babylonian thraldom and Captivity was near at hand, he set himself
to seek the Lord at that time, Dan. 9.3. And David in the fore-alledged Text,
he prays for mercy to be showed to Sion. But when? when the set time was come.

I would not spend my time in the further confirmation of so clear a truth. Let
me but add two Reasons; God has his time to do his actions in, and he should
not be desired to do them any other time. For, First, Let our desires be what
they will, he will not be prevailed withal to do them any other time. Or
Secondly, if we could prevail with him, it were not best that he should do them
any other time.

Let our desires be what they will, God will not be prevailed withal, to do
his works in any other time then that which he has fore-appointed and decreed:
so that it were a vain and idle thing to labor to divert him from his own
season. We that are men, are often turned from our purpose; we do not that
which we resolve to do, or else we do not act it then when we resolve to do it,
because our resolutions alter; we are persuaded and convinced that some other
season will be better. But God for his part is not changeable, he is not as man
that he should lie, nor as the son of man that he should repent; Numb. 23.19.
That he should so repent as man, by changing of his mind, or varying from his
former resolution. And this is that the Psalmist beats upon, Psalm. 102. He
observes all other things and persons in the world, and finds that they are
variable and inconstant, they are on, and off again; But as for God, he finds
it otherwise with him; though they be changeable, he is not so: No, says the
Prophet there, thou art the same; and what does he infer upon it? why therefore
all the good, and all the mercy that he has resolved upon, with reference to
his people, he will accomplish in the set time. Thou shall endure O Lord (says
he) and that for ever. And what follows? Thou shall arise, and have mercy on
Sion, for the set time is come.

God has his set time to do his actions in, and he should not be desired to do
them any other time; because if we could prevail in such a case, it were not
best that he should do them any other time. He always pitcheth on the fit,
best, and the opportunest seasons for his Works: As he has his times for them,
so those times are the best times, whether they be Works of Justice, or of
Mercy. And hence the season and opportunity in which he does them both, is
styled the due time. For Works of Justice, their feet shall slide in due time;
Deuteronomy. 32.35. For Works of Mercy, in due time you shall reap, if you faint not:
Gal. 6.9. We that are men do usually mistake our time, we miss our opportunity:
Man knows not his time, says Solomon, Eccles. 9.12. and therefore he is
snared in an evil time, that falls suddenly upon him: He knows not the good
time, and therefore he is snared in an evil time, that comes upon him suddenly,
as a snare upon a Bird, in which he is entangled, and involved, and so is
disappointed of his purpose. But it is not so with God, he knows his time, and
fixes on it, so as none but he can do it. And hence is that Expostulation, Jer.
49.19. Who will appoint me the time? q.d. whoever does it, will be very much
mistaken: The time which I appoint is best, and none can do it like me: and
therefore certainly if we were able, it were not best to turn him from it, nor
to prevail with him to do his work in any other time. This shall suffice for
clearing of the Observation; proceed we now to Application.

And this may serve for Reprehension in the first place to check and Father,
the hour is come, now glorify thy Son: now show mercy to thy Church; now
execute thy wrath upon the persecutors and oppressors of the Church: No, he
must do it presently, whether his time be come, or no: they have not so much
patience and humility to wait upon him, and leave him to his own time: they
cannot tarry for him one hour. This was the Mistake of Mary; she would needs
direct our Savior when to work his Miracles, before his hour, or time was
come. John 2.4. And we poor Creatures are so saucy, and so bold sometimes, to
tell the Lord when he must show us such a favor, when he must give us such a
mercy: if he delay, and if he linger beyond the time that we appoint him, we
are gone, we cannot wait upon him any longer: We send for his assistance, as it
were by Post, and prescribe the Lord a day, as the Bethulians. And so upon the
other side we appoint him when to deal against the enemies and persecutors of
his people. We set him down a time, and we order him a season to wreake his
vengeance, and his wrath upon them. But what says God? to me belongs
vengeance and recompense. This is a business that belongs to me, it
appertains not to you to meddle with it. Their feet shall slide in due time;
for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon
them make haste. We are so earnest many times, that we would have him strike
them presently, and tread down all his enemies that rise against him, and his
cause and people; and take an order with them out of hand; But God is of
another mind, he designs another time, and we do very ill to go about to turn
him from it.

It is a bold intrusion on the property of God, on that which appertains and
belongs to him in the fore-alledged text. A snatching of the times and
seasons out of his hands. And it is a high presumption; for while we carry
matters thus, we do at least imply that we are wiser then the Lord, that we can
choose out fitter seasons for the accomplishment of his designs then he does;
which is a Blasphemy to be abhorred and trembled at by every Christian.

Father, when the hour is come, do this or that against thy Enemies, do this or
that for thy people; but still let us comply with his time, for the performance
of any thing that we desire of him. And this because in many cases it may seem
to linger, and we may be apt to faint, I shall briefly set before you two or
three Considerations, to uphold your hearts till your fathers hour comes.

Isa. 30.18. Why are you so impatient then? Why should not you be well
contentted and pleased to wait as well as he? Shall all the waiting be on his
side, none of yours? see if this be good reason.

the foundation deep and low, that he may raise the frame of mercy and
salvation which he means to build upon it high and firm, that it may never be
removed again.

Let us consider if the hour of mercy linger, that the fault is in our selves.
Israel, Will you never be made fit? when will it once be? We have such strong
Corruptions in us that they will not be subdued: we have such proud and
stubborn hearts that they will not be brought down; So that if God be long
about us, and if he keep us under hand, we have cause to thank our selves and
the perverseness of our own hearts.

Let us consider that the fathers hour will come, in which he will show Sion.
The needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor fail
for ever, Psalm. 9.18. Though he hide himself, yet he will be a Savior
notwithstanding; And therefore this let us depend and settle on, let us keep
our hearts to this, with the poor afflicted Church, Isa. 25.9. Lo, this is our
God, we have waited for him, and he will save us; we will be glad in his
salvation. You see how confident she is, she stands not upon Ifs and Ands. It
is not peradventure, or it may be, or the like, but he will save us, and we
will be glad, etc.

The more the fathers hour lingers, the greater mercy it will bring with Psalm.
90.15. That Proclamation is remarkable, Isa. 40.1. Comfort. etc. comfort ye my
people. It is repeated twice you see And why so? The reason is annexed, she
has received at the Lords hand double for her sins, she has had double
sorrow, and therefore now she shall have double comfort.

And thus far of the rise of that part of our Saviors prayer which concerns
himself, the ground on which he takes occasion to present it to his Father: The
hour is come.

Proceed we to the matter of it, or the things which he desires of the Father;
and this is that he may be glorified. Father glorify thy Son.

There is no difficulty considerable in the words. To glorify is properly to
make glorious. But usually and in the ordinary acceptance of the Scripture, to
Render glorious in the eyes of others, whether it be thing or person. And this
is Evident by that which Christ desires of his Father, under this expression.
He had abased himself you know, and made himself of no reputation, as the
Apostle Paul speaks, Phil. 2.7. and now he prays the Father, that he would
advance him, and honor him again, that he would show him forth in Luster and
in Splendor to the world. And that because the time of his abasure and
humiliation was now drawing to an end, and the time of his advancement and
exaltation was at hand, Father the hour is come, Glorify thy Son.

Now this petition of our Savior intimates at least the Fathers purpose to
glorify his Son, etc. That he was resolved upon it, and the hour in which to
do it: both upon the thing, and time. The hour is come in which thou have
decreed to glorify me, and therefore I beseech thee Father, do it now,
fulfill thy resolution and intention. The hour is come, glorify thy Son. So
that the point apparently suggested here is this.

DOCTRINE. It has been the Design and purpose of the Father, to glorify his
Son Christ.
The Fathers resolution appears in the Sons Petition. For that which Christ's
desires, the Father wills. Indeed he has declared himself in this particular,
that he would have him honored with the self same honor, the same for nature,
and the same for measure, which belongs to him, John 5.23. That all men should
honor the Son even as they honor the Father. And therefore he himself has
honored Christ exceedingly, as you may see in the first Chapter of the Epistle
to the Hebrews, almost from the beginning to the end. For that is the
intention, and the purpose of the whole Chapter. God has in these latter days
spoken to us by his Son, whom he has made heir of all things, by whom he also
made the world, who is the brightness of his glory, and the express, etc. being
made better then the Angels; for unto which of the Angels said he at any time,
Thou art my Son, etc. And again when he brings, etc. And of the Angels he
says, he makes his Angels Spirits and his Ministers a flame of fire. But of
the Son, he says, Thy throne Oh God is for ever, etc. And to which of the
Angels said he at any time, Sit thou on my right hand, etc. you see the scope
and drift of all is to advance and set up Jesus Christ transcendently, not only
above other Creatures, but above the very Angels: and the Apostle tells us to
the same effect, that God the Father exalted him, for that is the expression,
Phil. 2.9.

Now this design and purpose of the Father to glorify his Son Christ,
appears evidently diverse ways, which I shall briefly set before you.

Michael the great Prince, Dan. 12.1. Sometimes King, his King, Yet have I set
my King says God the Father, Psalm. 2.6. You see this is the name he gives him,
and it is written on his thigh and on his vesture, that he that runs may read
it, Apocalypse. 19.16. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Sometimes he calls him
God, as you may see in the forealledged place, Heb. 1.8. Unto the Son he says,
(the Father says,) Thy throne, Oh God, is for ever and ever. And sometimes
Lord, not Elohim, or Adonai, which name is frequenlty applied to men, but Lord
Jehovah, which name is proper and peculiar to the Living God only, and which he
seriously professes that he will not give to any other, and yet this name he
gives to Jesus Christ, Jer. 23.6. And he would have us call him by it too this
is the name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah (so is the expression there)
the Lord our righteousness. So that no marvail that the Apostle tells us that he
honored him in this respect exceedingly, transcendently; he has highly
exalted him. How so? And given him a name above every name, that at the name of
Jesus every knee should bow. According to the Counsel of the Psalmist, Psalm.
45.11. He is thy Lord, and worship thou him. And hence it is that the Apostle
says, he is made so much better then the Angels, as he has by inheritance
obtained a more excellent name then they.

It appears that God has a design to honor Christ, as by the names This is my
beloved Son, Mat. 3.17. take notice of him, this is he: So in another place,
Behold my Servant, Isa. 42.1. There look upon him, and observe him well, and
see if any of you have such a servant as I have. In the Old Testament the Lord
was wont to call himself the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob; he was honored by those names, the Lord their God that brought them
out of the Land of Egypt. But now in the New Testament, he calls himself the God
and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ; as you may see that place for instance,
Ephesians. 1.3. I might give you many more; the God that brought again from the
dead the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus striving to exalt him, and to set him up, that
the eyes and thoughts of men might be taken up with him.

3. It appears, etc. By the place in which he sets him, and that is Solomon, by
the holy Ghost himself, as a great honor which he did his Mother, 1 Kings
2.19. He sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the Kings
Mother, and she sat on his right hand. This honor God has done Christ, as
the Apostle tells us, Ephesians. 1.20. He raised him from the dead, says he, and set
him at his own right hand, in heavenly places. That is, he set him above all
other things or persons, in the next place to himself: And therefore it is
added presently, he set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above
all principalties, and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is
named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come: this is very great
honor.

It appears that God has a design to honor Christ by the authority All power
is given to me both in heaven and in earth: not some, but all power: The father
judges no man, says our Savior, but he committed all Judgment to the Son,
John 5.22. He has done in this respect, as great men sometimes use to do: if
they have any title, office, or place of honor, they are contented to convey
it over to their eldest Son, that they may credit him, and raise him to esteem
and reputation in his Country: and it delights them as much to have him
honored as themselves. Just so has God the Father done by Jesus Christ; The
Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son. He will be
Judge no longer by immediate execution, but he has made his Son the Judge of
all the world; And why so? that he may compass the design of his, for
glorifying of his Son Christ, That all men should honor the Son, as they
honor the Father, as it is added in the next verse. And as he has (in the
sense that we have said) resigned up his judiciary power abroad to Jesus
Christ, so the private Government of his family at home. He has made his
eldest Son the Lord of all, he has set him over his house, Heb. 3.6. The Son
of God has got a match, though a poor one, I confess, and now the Father gives
up the housekeeping wholly to him. And hence says the Apostle Paul, Ephesians.
3.14, 15. I bow my knees unto the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the
whole family in heaven and earth is named. The whole family of heaven and earth
is named from Christ, whether the upper family of heaven, or the lower family
on earth, whether the Church triumphant or the Church militant, it is Christ's
family and Christ's Church, and Christ's household. God you see, has two houses,
and yet he does not govern one himself, and leave the other to his Son, he
commits the government of both to Jesus Christ; that he may be all in all, that
he may be the more honored.



And that you may the better see the honor that is done to Jesus Christ, in
that he has these three great Offices altogether in his hands: I shall
represent it to you in a few Particulars.

Adam.

And he must do all this alone, there must be none besides him, none with him.
No, he must tread the wine press of his Fathers wrath alone. By once offering
of himself, he must perfect for ever them that are sanctified. The Lord has
given us no other King to subdue our enemies, and to get peace for us; No other
Priest to satisfy his wrath, and to obtain Grace for us. No other Mediator
between God and man either of Redemption, or Intercession; either of Redemption
to purchase grace, or of Intercession to sue out that which he has purchased;
All lies on Jesus Christ, you see, that he may be all in all, that all the
glory may redound to him.

As whatsoever good is purchased for the Church is procured by him Heb. 1.2. He
had good news to tell the world, and he sent his Son with it. He sent Moses
with the Law, which was a Message full of terror; Moses was good enough for
that. The Gospel was a Message full of sweetness and full of Comfort, and
Christ must have the honor to reveal that to the world. Indeed my brethren
whatsoever good we know of God, or of his favor and good will toward us, or
of the work of our redemption, and reconciliation, and atonement, all comes
out by Jesus Christ. Christ is the only Prophet of the Church; and if we ask
the question which the Psalmist mentions, Psalm. 4.6. Who will show us any good?
The answer must be, None but Jesus Christ can do it, or those that are sent out
by him with his Message, and in his Name.

As whatsoever good is purchased for the Church is procured by The grace of God
is shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Titus 3.6. As all
comes by his means, so all goes through his hands. And therefore he is said to
have received gifts for men, Isa. 68.18. God does not give his gifts directly,
and immediately to men himself, but Jesus Christ receieth their endowments for
them of the Father, that of his fullness they may all receive. He is the
Treasurer of his Fathers grace, that every one may come to him. God has
exalted him to be a Prince to his People, and so to give them as a King (as
once Araunah said to David) in a Magnificent and Royal way. And this he has
done to advance him and to make him glorious, that as all comes from him, so
all may be ascribed to him.

It appears that God has a design, etc. as by the offices in which he puts h m
with gifts, and graces, and abilities, that he may go through with them with
credit, as we use to say, both to the honor of his Father and himself. He is
the head of the body the Church (says the Apostle) Colos. 1.17. And to this
end it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness as it is added there
in that place.

It appears that God, etc. in that he makes the fullness of the Godhead dwell
in him; Others are Partakers of the divine nature but he is partaker of the
Divine Essence. Others are Partakers of the properties of God, but he is
partaker of the Godhead it self. Others are partakers of the grace of God, but
he is partaker of the God of grace. And therefore the Apostle says not, that
in Christ dwells (...), that is the Divinity, but (...) that is the Deity. In
him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, Col. 2.9. Not that the
Godhead is confined, or circumscribed within the narrow limits of our Saviors
flesh, or that his body is co-extended with the Godhead, as Ubiquitaries
dream. But the Godhead dwells in Christ, as Bernard speaks, not Vmbrative, not
by external signs and shadows, and tokens of his presence, as once he dwelt in
the material Temple; not effective, by the powerful operation of it, not only
by the Graces of it, as it dwells in the bodies of his Saints, who therefore
are called the Temples of God; But in him dwells the Godhead bodily, that is,
it is really united to the humane nature, to the body of Jesus Christ, And
herein Christ has no Peer. It is a high and unmatchable honor, which no other
Creature is capable of, by which he is advanced above all other things and
persons in the world besides.

John 17.1. Glorify thy Son.


etc. that he might make him some requital for the abasures and indignities
which he suffered in the world.

A great part of our Saviors passion (my beloved consisted in the great
dishonor that was done to him, and in the scorn, and the derision, and the
contemptuous usage which he suffered, even from the vilest, and the worst of
men. If you survey it in the Gospel story, and lay it altogether, all the
affronts, and jears, and taunts, and uncivil imputations that were put upon
him, you will admire that the glorious Son of God should ever stoop so low for
our sakes: yet this he did for the accomplishment of that great work, to which
he was appointed by the Father: And therefore God in recompense has set him up
again, and raised him to the height of dignity and glory.

And that he did it on this very ground, we learn from the Apostle Paul, Phil.
2.7, 8. and following verses. He made himself (says the Apostle there) of no
reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and being found in fashion
as a man, he humbled himself; And what of this? why therefore God has highly
exalted him, exalted him, and exalted him highly, as it is added in the next
words, therefore because he was abased.

And hence our Savior uses this as an enforcing argument when he desires to
be glorified by his father, viz. Because he had been formely dishonored, and
brought low. For this is clearly intimated in the words, John 17.4, 5. I have
finished the work which thou gave me to do, and now, O Father, glorify me
with thy self.

The works of Christ were some of Ministry and service, and abasure in the
office of obedience and suffering for the Church; and some of power, and
majesty, in the protection and exaltation of the Church; and those were to
foregoe these. He ought to suffer and so enter into glory, Luke 24.26. There
was a necesse in it, a necessity of Gods decree who had appointed, and designed
it to be so, of Gods justice which must be satisfied by obedience, before he
would be pacified with men, or in the person of their head and advocate advance
them to his glory. Of Gods word in the prediction of the Prophets, who had
fore-shewed, and prophesied that it must be so. And hence says Christ in the
forecited text, I have finished my work, the work of my humiliation, and
therefore now I pray thee glorify me with thy self. Let my exaltation follow.
I should not look to be exalted if I had not first been humbled. But seeing I
have done the service, let me have the recompense: since I have undergone the
one, let me be raised to the other.

It has been the design, etc. that he himself might be glorified by it.

Brethren, the Lord in all his works (I speak it reverently) is a self-seeker,
he seeks himself in every thing he does, and it is very fit he should, because
there is no end above himself, nor better then himself. And if we had no higher
end (my brethren) then our selves, we might seek our selves too. In all his
actions, he has an eye upon his own glory. And so he has in this which we are
speaking of, the exaltation, and advancement of his Son. And therefore with
this Argument our Savior urges this desire of his, Father glorify thy Son.

Why should I glorify thee (might the father say) what shall I get by it? Thou
shall get honor by it (says our Savior) and therefore I beseech thee to
glorify me upon this account; Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee. I cannot glorify thee much in this abasure, and contempt; but
if thou glorify me once, it shall come back again upon thee by reflection; I
will be sure to honor thee again; And therefore I beseech thee do it for thy
own sake, and in relation to thy own glory.

Now is it so, my brethren, that it has been the design, etc. then certainly

Great men cannot endure (you know) to be crossed in their wills, or hindered
of their purposes; and how think you, will the great God endure to be
affronted, and opposed, and crossed in such a thing as this is? From all
Eternity he has determined with himself to glorify his Son Christ, he has
had it in his heart from everlasting, he has resolved he shall be honored;
and that not by men alone, but by the very Angels too, those eminent and
glorious Creatures. It is the Fathers pleasure that it shall be so, as the
Apostle tells us, Heb. 1.6. When he brings in his first begotten into the
world, he says, and let all the Angels of God worship him. Not serve him, and
obey him only, but worship him with divine, and with religious adoration, which
is the height and top of honor, with the same honor that belongs to the
Father, as Christ himself expresses it, John 5.23. And if he must have honor,
such transcendent honor from the very Angels, must he not have it from
inferior creatures, who are far below Angels? Yes, Gods expects it, that at
the name (that is) the power and authority of Jesus, every knee should bow, not
of things in heaven only, but of things in earth too, that is, not of Angels
only but of men. So that you see the father looks for this at our hands, he
looks we should do honor to his Son.

He says as in the Parable, They will reverence my Son. Though they have
slighted and abused other messengers that I have sent among them, yet they will
surely reverence my Son. It is impossible they should be so unworthy to contemn
my own Son. And what then do we think of those who dishonor and contemn him
notwithstanding? will the father who has sent him to this End, that he might
be honored, take this well at their hands, to be thus crossed in such a great
design of his by wretched men? To see his own begotten Son despised, and
scorned, whom he has done so much to honor? Why, you will say, what need you
be so earnest upon this particular? Who does dishonor Jesus Christ? Who does
despise him, or contemn him? do we not all acknowledge him to be our Lord and
Savior, and the like? yes we do all acknowledge him in words, indeed we call
him Lord. But many of us buffet him, and spit upon him in the very same breath.
There are abundance of us (my beloved) who in name are Christians, who do
exceedingly dishonor Jesus Christ, whatever their pretenses and protestations
be, and I will show you briefly who they are.

John 1.11. He came unto his own, his own friends, his own Kindred, his own
acquaintance, his own nation, yea people of his own Country: But though they
were his own, they would not own him nor embrace him. He came unto his own, and
his own received him not. And so he comes to these men, and that with
obsecrations, and entreaties too, and they clap the door against him, and
shamefully g^ve him the repulse. They tell him in effect that he may go to
those that need him, and look after him, or care for him. For their parts, they
will none of him, then which there cannot be a viler, or more ignominions usage
in the world.

They that despise and slight the blood of Christ, they dishonor Christ Heb.
10.29. they throw him down, and tread him under foot, as if he were but dust,
or dung, or some such base unworthy thing, which is the horriblest contempt
that can be. They tread under foot the Son of God, while they account his blood
an unholy thing.

But who accounts it so you will demand? Why they that use it so, do in effect
account it so, and truly there are multitudes of such among us. When ordinary
blood is shed, as the blood of any beasts, you know, we make no reckoning of
it, we look not after it, we spend not any thought upon it, it is shed and
there is an end. And verily my brethren, there are many who make no more of the
blood of Christ himself, then if it were but common blood, then if an Ox, or
any other beast were slain, and so account it an unholy thing. They never think
upon it, unless it be to swear by it, they never meditate upon the end for
which he shed it, or the use which they ought to make of it. He shed his blood
for us (says the Apostle) that we should live no longer to our selves but to
him that died for us. And yet how many are there who live wholly to themselves
notwithstanding all this, who seek themselves, their own ends, their own
things, and not the things of Jesus Christ?

He loved his Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and
cleanse it, Ephesians. 5.25. that he might wash it in his own blood. Apoc. 1.5. And
yet what multitudes are here among us, who are not cleansed, or washed to this
day, but tumble in the Kennel still, wherein the swine of this world wallow?
and so they make the Son of God, as much as in them lies, to suffer and to die
in vain, they spill his precious blood upon the ground, as if it were of no
value: Christ shed his blood to this end that his people might be holy, and
they will be impure still, and wallow in their lusts still. They care not what
become of it, let it be shed in vain for them, they reckon not. Oh what a high
contempt is this to Jesus Christ! These men as the Apostle speaks, tread
underfoot the Son of God, they trample on him in Disdain; and put him to the
greatest shame that can be.

They that despise and slight the spirit of Christ, dishonor Christ himself;
the Comforter the holy Spirit is the messenger of Christ, he is instead of
Christ to his people, he represents him absent to the soul. And therefore he is
said in Scripture to be with them, in that his holy Spirit is with them. Behold
I am with you always, viz. by my Spirit to the end of the world, Mat. 28. ult.
I will not leave you comfortless says Christ to his Disciple, I will come to
you, John 14.18. he means not by himself, but by his Spirit. So that when the
Spirit comes, Christ comes; and therefore it is added presently, At that time
you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. So that if
this sweet Messenger of Jesus Christ, who is to us instead of Christ, be
ill-entreated by us, it is apparently a very great indignity to Christ himself.
And yet how often do we damp the holy motions of this Spirit in our hearts?
When good desires and gracious purposes are raised and kindled there, how often
do we smother them and put them out again? how frequently do we misuse him, who
comes with counsel, and with comfort, and with grace, from such a choice and
precious friend as Christ is? How do we slight the seasonable caveats that the
spirit gives us, either for our information, or else for our consolation, and
what is this upon the matter, but to despise and slight Christ?

Paul's expression is, 2 Cor. 5.20. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, we
pray you in Christ's stead; and they that injure or dishonor those that are for
Christ, and that are in Christ's stead, must needs dishonor Christ himself. Our
Savior is express and plain for this to his Apostles, Luke 10.16. He that
despises you despises me; and he that despises me, despises him that sent
me. q. d. My Father sent me, and therefore he that despises, me despises him.
And I send you, and therefore he that despises you, despises me: I shall say
little of this Argument, for fear of misconstruction, I shall but leave it to
your selves to judge whether Christ be in this respect despised and
dishonored, yea, or no. Whether he be abused in those whom he has sent, whose
labors he has blessed, and to whom he has given the seals of their Ministry,
I hope they will not much complain to any, but to Christ that sent them, and if
he be resolved to bear it, I make no question he will give them grace and
strength to bear it too, and to profit much by it.

Heb. 6.9. if they fall away, says he, they crucify the Son of God afresh,
and put him to open shame. A servant looks upon it as a shame and a
disparagement if he be put away: So if a Servant leave his Master (if the
reason be not known) it is some disgrace to him. Men are very apt to think that
he is a hard Master, that he is faulty in some kind or other, and that he deals
not well with those that serve him. And so when men forsake the service of the
Lord Christ, they make the world believe that he is an ill Master, that there
is better wages, and more content and satisfaction to be had in the service of
sin then the service of Christ; And is not this a great dishonor to him? And
yet how many are there in these latter times, who bring disparagement to Jesus
Christ by this means, and make his service despicable in the eyes of others?
How many have withdrawn from Jesus Christ of late, given over waiting on his
holy Ordinances, and left performing of those duties to him which they were
wont exactly, and constantly, and duly to discharge. They talk of Christian
Liberty, and this they take to be from the service of Christ, whereas it is
indeed from the service of sin: And so they are more loose, and careless, and
remiss, and negligent then they have been in former times. These men disgrace
Christ, whom God has set himself to honor, and so they cross him in his great
design.

Now, I beseech you, think upon it, you that dishonor Christ, in any of the
ways forementioned, or in any other way, let it be what it will: Remember that
it is the purpose and design of God to glorify his Son Christ; and what then
will become of you, who thwart with him, who seek as much as lies in you to
hinder him from execution of that which he is so intent upon? Will he take it
at your hands? Nay, if he send his Son among you, and say, as in the Parable,
Luke 20.13. They will reverence my Son, and you upon the other side, neglect
him and contemn him, and abase him every way, he will be out of patience with
you, to be thus crossed by wretched men; he will certainly destroy you, he will
make you know the price of slighting and despising him, whose honor is as dear
and tender to him as his own.

Is it so, that it has been the design, etc? Then be we all exhorted to Judge.
5.23. and therefore let us seriously consider what our duty is, and let us set
up Jesus Christ, and glorify him to the utmost of our power.

And here I shall propound two things, which I shall orderly pursue; First, let
us advance his glory, when it is without our own: and Secondly, let us advance
his glory, when it is against our own.

Let us set up his glory when it is without our own, when we have no they may
be set up together, when they advance and raise themselves in raising and
advancing him, they are very well content. As this was Jehues case, you know,
his interest and Gods did meet, in rooting out the Line of Ahab, so that he
seemed to be zealous for the Lord of Hosts, when he was zealous only for
himself, and for the greatness and the glory of his own house. But when the
glory of the Lord comes single, and alone, and naked to them, so that they have
nothing to quicken and encourage them to such a work, to such a duty, but his
honor only; as for their own part, they are like to get disparagement among
the greater part of men, and to be disgraced by it, they will not stir, they
will do nothing in such a case as this is. A Magistrate it may be will be very
earnest in taking course with those exorbitancies and abuses which dishonor
Christ, as long as he himself may attain to honor by it, and be applauded
every where for his integrity, and zeal, and courage, and uprightness. But when
he meets with scoffs and taunts on every side, when he comes to be affronted
and disgraced, and blasted for his forwardness, and to be looked upon as a
pragmatical, and busy man, he thinks it better to give over and be quiet. A
Minister, it may be, will be painful in his Calling, very diligent in
Preaching in season and out of season, while he may be commended and admired;
but when he misses his expected honor and applause, he is like a becalmed Ship
at Sea, and stirs no longer then the breath of people drives him. And so a
private person, it may be, will be very holy and precise, very constant, and
very diligent in duty, very exact in waiting on the Ordinances, and the like,
as long as those things gain him reputation and esteem with those to whom he
would approve himself. But when they come once to be looked upon as matter of
disparagement, and when he is disgraced for them, he has done with these
courses.

These men do glorify themselves, and not Christ, at least they glorify him
with relation to themselves, and make his glory but a means to the attainment
of their own; so that their utmost end is really their own glory; so that
however it may seem, they do not truly join with God in the accomplishment of
this design of his, touching the glorifying of his Son Christ. Now, I beseech
you, my Beloved, let us not be like these men, let us advance the Son of God
single, let us set up his glory when it is without our own.

John the Baptist was much cried up among the people, as if he had been the
Messiah: Many men, if they had been in his place, would have nourished these
conceits, and taken to themselves those foolish attributions: But he is so far
from this, that he endeavors every way to put them off from him, There comes
one after me, who is mightier then I, the latchet of whose shoo I am not worthy
to stoop down and unloose, Mar. 1.8, 9. I indeed have baptized you with water,
but he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost. q.d. You question whether I be
Christ or no, and thus you magnify me, and applaud me, and attribute that to
me which indeed belongs to Christ. But I must tell you plainly, I am not the
Christ (as in another place he does) I am no body to him, I am not worthy to
unty his shoes, to do the meanest Office that belongs to him: And for the
Ministry, my Art is outward, and not to be compared with his, I indeed baptize,
etc. And in another place he shows the very same temper, John 3.30 He must
increase, but I must decrease. q.d. It must be so, and I am very well content,
so he increase, and so his glory grow, I care not though I wane and wither in
my honor, and in the reputation and esteem which I have among the people.

So the Apostles, when the people ascribed the Miracle which they had done to
them, how did they shake away this honor from them? Acts 3.12. Ye men of
Israel, why look you so earnestly on us, as if by our own power or holiness, we
had made this man whole: no, God has done it to glorify his Son Christ, in
prosecution of this great design, as it is added there in that place.

And when was Paul in such a heat, as when the people took Barnabas and him for
gods, and would have offered sacrifice unto them? Act. 14.13. When they heard
what was done, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying
out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? you think us to be Gods, but we
are men of like passions with your selves, and preach unto you that you should
turn from these vanities, unto the living God. You see they labor to advance
the Lord, by taking off those high conceits which the people had of them.

Now I beseech you my beloved, let the same mind be in us that was in these
men. Let us not regard a jot what becomes of our honor, so the design of our
God go forward touching the glorifying of his Son. And let us say as Jacob in
another place, So Christ be glorified, we have enough. You that are in any
office, do not consider with your selves how you may carry matters, so that you
may be commended and approved, for moderate, and meek, and quiet men; but how
you may extirpate sin, which dishonours Jesus Christ, and root out evil doers
from the City of the Lord: and if you be abused for this, if loose contentious
people tax you, and run out upon you; if Drunkards in their Ale make Songs upon
you, do you despise the shame as Christ did, so you may bring him any glory?

So we that are the Ministers of Christ, let this be our endeavor to advance
and set up Christ; let us study such a way, and follow such a course as will
glorify him most, though it redound not to our own honor. Let us not make
this our aim, how we may carry matters, so that we may be admired and
magnified, that we may be accounted eloquent and learned, and the like; but
that the people may be edified, and that they may be won to Jesus Christ: That
way of preaching, be it what it will, which serves best to these ends, let us
endeavor after, yea and though it should be prejudicial to our own glory,
though it should eclipse us. What says the Apostle Paul, 2 Cor. 4.5. I preach
not my self, but the Lord Jesus Christ. It is not my intention to set up my
self, that I may be looked upon, that my abilities may be applauded and
admired; no, I regard not though I be concealed, though I be hid among the
crowd, so as Jesus Christ appear, so as the affections and thoughts of men be
set on him, so he be represented to the people in his glory: I preach not my
self, but the Lord Jesus Christ, and my self your servant for Jesus his sake.
And so for private Christians, let us seriously consider what the Lord expects
from us, and how intent he is on this business, and let us strive to serve him,
and be instrumental to him in this great design of his. Let us make this our
work and business, how we may glorify the Lord Christ, become what will of our
esteem and reputation in the world. And this, because it is a hard lesson, I
shall excite you to the learning and the practicing of it, with a few motives.

All things were created by him, and for him, says the Apostle, Col. 1.16. As
they were created by him, so they were created for him. Now a thing may be made
either for the need and convenience, or else for the honor and glory of him
for whom it is made. As great men in their houses, have been always wont to
have some things for use, and others for pomp. Now Jesus Christ made nothing in
the world for need; he needs not us for any thing that we can do; for he was
absolutely full and perfect, and complete, before we had a being in the world;
or had it not been so, undoubtedly he would have made us sooner, he would not
have remained so long without us. So then he made us for his glory, that was
the end he aimed at in our Creation: And therefore it concerns us to see that
we answer this end, and that we glorify the Lord Christ: Or if we do not so;
first, our sin is very great, we sin against the great, the utmost end of our
Creation: And secondly, our danger is very great, and we are in extremest
peril of destruction. Any thing that is unusefull, or unserviceable to the end
that it was made, is fit for nothing else but ruin. We make a fire to warm us,
and to dress our meat, but if it fall a burning of the house, we put it out if
we be able: A hatchet or a knife is made to cut, but when it comes to have no
edge at all, so that it will not do the business that it serves for, we throw
it by into a corner, and provide another. A Potter makes a vessel to keep
liquid things, but if it have a crack, or hole in it, so that it will not serve
for that purpose, he even dashes it in pieces. So Jesus Christ has made us for
himself, his own glory; but if we be unserviceable to this end, and if he find
we do not glorify him, but dishonor him, and shame him, he will break us with
a rod of iron, and dash us in pieces like a Potters vessel. We will not serve
his turn, nor the end for which he made us, and therefore he will cast us away;
for what shall he do with us? If any of us have an instrument that is very
useful to us, we will be very chary of it, and very careful that we do not
lose it; but if it be of no use, we reckon it of no value, yea many times we
break it, or we burn it in a passion, and there is an end of it. So Jesus
Christ will deal with us my Brethren; if we be serviceable to the end for which
he made us, he will keep us, and preserve us: But if we be unusefull to him, or
if we do not glorify him, he will ruin and destroy us.

bring to him, you shall have it back again, and that with profit and
advantage. If you honor Jesus Christ, he will do as much for you, he will
honor you again; it is his Promise, and he will be faithful in it, 1 Samuel
2.30. Them that honor me, I will honor. Men are exceedingly, and almost
universally deceived in this particular: they think the ready way to honor, is
to set up themselves, and to brisle their plumes, to strut and swell, and
swagger in the world; to take all ways that they can think upon, to make
themselves seem great and honorable in the eyes of others; but in the mean
time they neglect Christ, they take no course at all to advance his glory.
Alas, these men are quite out, if they would have true honor, their business
and their work must be to set up Christ, and then he will be sure to set up
them again. If we take care to honor him, he will take care to honor us; if
we do the one of them, we need not doubt to trust him with the other. So that
you see my Brethren, if we would be honored and esteemed, we have no more to
do but only this, to glorify the Lord Christ, to magnify him, and to make him
great, and then he is engaged to take care of our esteem and credit in the
world. But on the other side if we dishonor and despise him, let us do what we
can to raise our selves, and get our selves a name, it shall be all to no
purpose, when all is done he will cast ignominy and contempt upon us, as he
tells us in the fore-alledged Text, They that honor me, I will honor; and
they that despise me, shall be lightly set by.

Consider with your selves how you will gratify (if I might express it

John 17.1. That thy Son may also glorify thee.


SO we have done with the two first particulars considered in our Saviors
Prayer, so far as it concerns himself, the rise of it from whence he takes
occasion to present it to his Father, together with the matter of it, or the
thing which he desires of the Father, That he may be glorified.

And we are now arrived at the third and last, the Reasons with which he
presses, and enforces this request of his, and they are many, and of great
importance. The first is taken from the end, why he desires to be glorified,
or to have glory from the Father, viz. that he might be enabled to bring glory
to the Father; Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee.
The second Argument is drawn a congruo, from the congruity; it was but meet and
congruous that he should be glorified, or that he should have glory from the
Father, seeing he had power from him. He had received power from him, and
therefore it was fit that he should have glory too; for power and glory ought
to go together: And therefore on this ground our Savior urges it, you see;
Father glorify thy Son, as thou have given him power over all flesh.

As thou have given him power, so be prevailed withal to give him glory too,
the concomitant of power. The third is drawn from the deserving Cause: Christ
had glorified the Father, and therefore thinks himself worthy to have glory
from the Father; I have glorified thee on earth, I have finished the work which
thou gave me to do: And now, O Father, glorify me with thy self, and so on.

At this time, I shall pitch on the first Argument, with which our Savior
presses this request of his, and it is taken from the end, why he desires to
have glory from the Father, viz. That he may be enabled to bring glory to the
Father, Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee.

Me thinks he seems to intimate he could not glorify him much in the condition
he was in at present, he was in such a state of ignominy, and abasure, and
contempt, in relation to the world, that he was not capable of bringing in the
Father any considerable honor, while he remained in this case: And therefore
he entreats the Father to raise him, and advance him, that he may do as much
for him again, Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son also, etc.

So then as we have formerly observed, that it is the Design of God the Father
to glorify his Son; so hence we may observe,

DOCTRINE. That it is the desire of Christ to have glory from the Father, to
this end, that he may bring glory to the Father.
You see he begs it only upon this account, Father glorify thy Son: What, that
he may detain and keep it to himself? No, that he may return it to the Father,
That thy Son also may glorify thee.

If thou will glorify me, thou shall be no loser by it; no, thou shall have it
back again, and that with profit, and advantage too; thou shall be glorified by
me; I will not keep the glory which thou layest out upon me in my own hands,
but I will give it up entire, and undiminished to thy self again: It is not for
my own sake that I beg it, but for thine.

There were some rays of glory which God was pleased to dart forth upon the Son
in his condition of abasure: and if you mark his carriage in the Gospel Story,
you shall find that he was always careful to make them to reflect on God
again. As when he did his Miracles, which was a means to set him up (you know)
in the eyes of all that saw them, he was extremely cautious that the honor
might be rendered to his Father. And hence he was not wont to do them in his own
name, nor in appearance by his own power, though both were suitable enough to
his condition, being God as well as Man; but in the name, and by the strength
and the assistance of the Father. And therefore when he raised Lazarus, he did
not seem to do it of himself (though that he might have done as God) but lift
up his eyes and prayed his Father, that he would show himself in that business,
that so the glory might be his, John 11.42. and adds, that he did it for the
peoples sake that stood by, that they might know that God had sent him. That
they might understand that he performed such works as these, as one that was
subservient to the Father, in them, and that was sent out by him. And therefore
he is always minding them on all occasions of his Mission from the Father, that
so if any thing praiseworthy did appear in him, or were done by him, it might
be rendered and ascribed to the Father. The sixth of John is full of such
insinuations; I come (says he) to do the will of him that sent me, and not to
do my own will, at ver. 38. And in another place he tells them that he honored
not himself, but his Father honored him, Ioh. 8.54. He honors me, and I
honor not my self; I do not keep his honor to my self; but I honor him
again, with which accords that expression, John 13.31. Now is the Son of man
glorified: and what follows, and God is glorified in him.

So that you see the Son takes glory from the Father, to this end, that he may
bring glory to the Father.

And it is very congruous that it should be so, because as Man, and Mediator, I
have finished the work, said he, which thou gave me to do, Joh. 17.4. q.d. I
have approved my self a faithful Servant to thee, I have done thy work, and I
have done it fully and completely: And he is often speaking of his being sent
out by the Father, and that to do his will, and not his own, his work and not
his own, to signify that he was in the state and the condition of a servant to
the Father. Now a servant must not seek his own honor, but the honor of his
Master. As he must do his Masters will, his Masters work, and not his own; so
he must do it for his Masters ends, and not his own. If his Master set him up,
he must improve it to his Masters commendation: And so our Savior Jesus Christ
being as Man and Mediator in the condition of a Servant to his Father, it was
his duty in the execution of his Mediatorship to aim at his Masters glory, to
do all things for his end, viz. his glory. Or otherwise in doing his Fathers
work, his Fathers will, he might even serve himself, and not his Father. If any
honor did accrue to him in the performance of his Office, he was bound to
ascribe it to the Father; it was his duty as a servant so to do, and so
accordingly he did, and this was one ground of it, why he did no otherwise
desire to have glory from the Father, but that he might bring glory to the
Father.

He will not give his glory to another. But here is the business now my Brethren,
when he gives glory to the Son, he does not give it to another, but himself.
And so the Son when he gives glory to the Father, he does not give it to
another, but himself. They are so absolutely one in all respects, as God, that
the glory of the one is the glory of the other: And therefore it is said that
God is glorified in the Son, John 13.31. Mark that expression, Not by the Son,
but in the Son; for he is glorified in that the Son is glorified. The glory
that may seem to be imparted to the Son, darts back again upon him by
reflection; it is doubled by this means, and consequently he is not a loser by
it, but a gainer. If he glorify his Son, his Son also glorifies him; so that
no marvel if there be such an exchange of glory continually between the Father
and the Son, and putting of it always over to the other. That place is very
notable to this purpose. John 12.28. if it be read as some have rendered it, and
the Original will fitly bear; says Jesus Christ, Father glorify thy Name; the
Father answers by a voice from Heaven, I have glorified thee (not glorified it,
as in our last Translation, but) glorified thee, and I will glorify thee
again; the Son he prays not, Father glorify me, but thy self, thy own name,
Father glorify thy name: the Father answers not, I have glorified my name, my
self; but, I have glorified thee; Neuter sibi, uterque alteri gloriam
attribuens, as one notes upon the text. The Son desires the Father, that he
will glorify himself, and not him; the Father tells the Son that he has
glorified him, and not himself; or if you will, that he has done what he
desires; he has glorified himself in glorifying him: so that the one is
glorified in the glory of the other.

Learn of me, for I am meek: Learn to be as I am, learn to do as I do: So be
you followers of Christ in this thing, and do you learn of him, when you desire
or seek for any thing at Gods hands, any place, or any gifts that will advance
or set you up among men, that you desire it for no other end, but this, that
you may glorify the Lord with it. It is a usual thing with many of us; we
would get up into some place of dignity, we would have extraordinary parts and
gifts, we would be eminent in knowledge, and in grace; we would have God to
honor us with these things, and we are very earnest and importunate with him
about it; but can we say in the uprightness of our hearts, as Christ does?
Father, we pray that thou would honor us with these things, that we also may
glorify thee: That by this means we may be capable of bringing thee the more
glory. It is not to set up our selves that we desire this dignity, or these
accomplishments in any kind, but that we may advance thee. Do we not know that
we desire such things as these too many of us, merely for our own ends, for the
attainment of our own glory, that we may get our selves a name, that we may be
accepted, and reputed, and esteemed? Do not our hearts accuse us, that we have
such low aims as these are? Now I beseech you, my Beloved, let us conform our
selves to Christ in this particular; any thing that we desire that will be
honorable to us, let us desire it in reference to Gods glory: if we would have
more knowledge, and more grace, and more ability to holy duties, let it not be
to this end that we may be some body among the Saints, and that our names with
David's may be much set by: If we would have more wealth, and more power, let it
not be that we may strut and swell, and swagger in the world: but that if God
shall honor us in this regard, we also may glorify him, that having had such
honor from him, we may bring the more to him.

And truly, if we seek it to this end, we have the greater hope to speed with
God in our Petitions, and to obtain the gifts and blessings that we seek for,
and that upon a double ground which I shall briefly set before you, as
inducements to persuade.

If we desire that which will honor us, that we may honor God with Pet. 5.5.
He will not have his gifts to be the stales and prostitutes of our corruptions,
the oil to feed our base humors.

If we desire that which will honor us, that we may honor God with it is not
to be proud, or to lift up himself with it, but to advance and lift up thee.
Poor soul, he thinks he never honors thee enough, and therefore he would fain
have more grace, that he may bring thee more glory: Come I beseech thee, set
thy treasure open, and give him out a large share, for thou thy self will be a
gainer by it: If thou honor him, he will also glorify thee.

David did, Not unto us, I say again, not unto us, but to the name of God be
all the glory. It was he that wrought all our works for us, that put all those
gracious words into our minds (the matter was not of our own invention but of
his suggestion) that did all in these duties. We labored, we confess, but yet
not we, not we only, not we chiefly, but the grace of God that was in us. And
therefore when these Crowns of honor shall at any time be set upon our heads,
let us with the four and twenty Elders cast them down before the throne of God,
acknowledging with them, that unto him alone belongs honor and glory and
praise: And we should be the more cautious of arrogating any of this honor to
our selves, which indeed belongs to God, because he is so infinitely jealous of
his glory: he has professed it is a thing that he will never part withal; he
will not give it to another; so that if we presume to keep it when it comes
into our hands, we shall be losers by it in the end, the Lord will certainly
recover it upon us to our own shame. There is a sad example of it in proud
Herod, who being much applauded and admired by the People for a certain Speech
he made to a popular Assembly, insomuch that they cried out, The voice of God,
and not of man; because he gave not God the glory, which the people gave him,
he was eaten up of worms, and died a very ignominious and base death. Well
then, the glory that is given us by men, in any case let us be sure to give to
God, that we may say to him, not much unlike as Christ does, Thou have
glorified us, and we have glorified thee. And thus of the first Argument with
which our Savior presses and enforces this request of his, which has been
taken from the end why he desires to be glorified, or to have glory from the
Father.

The second follows now in order to be handled, and it is a congruo, from
congruity; it was but meet and congruous that he should have glory from the
Father, seeing he had power from him. Father glorify thy Son, as thou have
given him power over all flesh.

The force and vigor of this second Reason of our Savior (as I take it) lies
in this, That power and glory ought to go together. He looks upon it as a
reasonable thing, that he that is endued with power, should be adorned with
glory. And hence he knits them both together in the Lords Prayer by the
connective particle, the power and the glory. So here he had the power, and
therefore thinks it fit that he should have the glory. He tells his Father, that
he had received power from him, and therefore it was congruous that he should
have glory from him. And on this ground he presses it in this Petition to his
Father, q.d. As thou have given me power, so be prevailed withal to give me
glory, Father glorify thy Son as thou have given him power over all flesh.

Three things we have to be considered in the words. 1. The thing in it self
with which our Savior is invested and endued, and this you see is power over
all flesh. 2. The means by which he comes to be invested with it, viz. by free
donation and dispensation from his Father; he had this power because his Father
gave it him, As thou have given him power over all flesh. 3. The end for which
he was invested with it, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou
have given him.

Begin we with the first particular, the thing it self with which our Savior
is invested and endued. And here you may take notice in the first place of the
nature of it, and in the next place of the measure and extent of it. First you
have here the nature of it, suggested in the name our Savior gives it, (...)
power. And then you have the measure and extent of it, it is not over some, but
over all flesh, As thou have given him power over all flesh.

As for the first of these, my Brethren, you must know that there are two sorts
of power. There is either (...), or (...), either potentia, or potestas: Or to
be plain, either power of ability, or power of authority. Power of ability, by
which he that enjoys it, is enabled to do things de facto: Power of authority,
by which he that enjoys it is enabled to do things de jure. This latter is
apparently intended in my Text, As thou have given him, says our Savior, not
(...), but (...). Our last Translation reads it power; it would have been more
clear and easy, if they had rendered it authority: as thou have given him
authority over all flesh.

Now this authority you see is of a very large extent, it is over all flesh.
You must conceive it over all mankind. It is a usual form of speech, as I
might give you diverse instances out of the Scripture: God looked, and behold
all flesh had corrupted his way, Genesis 6.12. The corruption there is sinful, of
which no other flesh is capable, but that of mankind only: So Luke 3.6. All
flesh shall see the salvation of God: And in this sense you are to apprehend
the same expression in my Text: Father glorify thy Son, as thou have given him
power over all flesh; over all humane flesh, or the whole race of Mankind.

And this authority you must conceive him to enjoy and exercise, as he is Man
and Mediator of the Church; for that Authority which he enjoys as God, he had
from all eternity as coequal with the Father. He had it not made over to him
by the Father; no, it was his own original, and primitive, and native right,
together with the Father. Whereas the power intended in my Text, is that which
he received by way of dispensation, and donation from the Father, As thou have
given him power over all flesh: You see the meaning of the Words, the Point is
clear.

DOCTRINE. That all mankind is under the authority of Jesus Christ, as he is
Man, and Mediator of the Church.
His Jurisdiction, as you see, is of a very large extent, no creature is
exempted from it; he rules over all, as David speaks, Psalm. 103.19 And he is
king of all the earth, Psalm. 47.7. He has dominion from sea to sea; and from
the river to the ends of the earth, Psalm. 72.8. His Father (the Apostle tells
us) has set him over the works of his hands, Heb. 2.7. You must conceive it
over all without exception; and has put all things in subjection to him, as it
is added presently: So that you see, my Brethren, there is nothing left that is
not under his dominion. He has advanced him far above all principality, and
power, and might, and every name, not only in the present world, but in that
which is to come, and has put all things under his feet, Ephesians. 1.22. And in
another place, His Father loves him, and has put all things into his hands,
Joh. 3.35. These two may seem to clash and interfere, he has put all things
into his hand, and he has put all things under his feet: But the fence and
meaning is, he has put all things of one sort into his hands; conceive it, all
his people and his friends, concerning whom our Savior says, No man can pluck
them out of my hand. He has put all things of another sort under his feet:
conceive it, all his enemies, concerning whom the Father says unto the Son,
Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy foot stool: So that
you see apparently, Christ has an universal Jurisdiction; he has all things
in his power, under his dominion: some things in his hand, to honor them, and
some things under foot to shame them: Some things in his hand to keep them, and
some things under feet to tread upon them, and to ruin them for ever. If any
were without the verge of the authority of Jesus Christ, the Kings and Princes
of the earth might seem to have the strongest plea for this exemption: But God
has made him his firstborn, higher then the kings of the earth, as you may
see, Ps. 89 27. Not higher in regard of dignity of nature only (for so the
Angels, as you know; are higher then the greatest earthly Princes) but higher
in regard of Jurisdiction too; and hence he has that name upon his vesture
written in great Capitals, Apoc. 19.16. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: So
that the point you see is fully proved. That all mankind, etc.

Now to unfold the point a little to you, that you may see it in the latitude,
and in the full dimension of it: There is a twofold power of Jurisdiction or
Authority, which Jesus Christ as Man and Mediator of the Church is vested with,
and exercises over all flesh. A Legislative power, and a Judiciary power: A
Legislative power to give Laws; and a Judiciary power, to execute the Laws that
he has given.

Laws to all flesh. And hence it is, that the Apostle styles him the Lawgiver,
Jam. 4.12. and that exclusively; he tells us, that here is but one, and that is
Christ. There is one such, and no more; the universal Legislative power is in
himself alone, and not in any other, either with him, or besides him: It is his
own prerogative, it is a flower of the Imperial Crown of heaven which he
communicates not to any other, to give Law to all flesh. And hence the Law is
said in Scripture to come out of Zion, as you may see that place
fore-instanced, Isa. 2.3. for out of Zion shall go forth the Law, which is the
Seat of Christ's Kingdom: It is not said to be imposed on Zion only, to be
restrained to Zion only, but out of Zion to go forth to all flesh: Because our
Savior, though he be King of all the earth, yet he keeps his Court in Zion, in
the Church; there is his place of residence, and thence he dates and sends
forth his Royal Proclamations, and Edicts, Witness our self at Zion.

Now Christ by virtue of this Legislative power of his, gives Laws both to the
outward and the inward man. Both to the members, and the conscience, and that
without restraint of all flesh.

Christ has an universal Legislative power, a power of giving Laws to Gal.
6.2. Bear you one another burden, and so fulfill the Law of Christ, that is,
the Law of love; for that, my Brethren, is the Law of Christ. A new Commandment
give I unto you; Novum quia renovatum, A new Commandment give I unto you, that
you love one another: And what is love but the fulfilling of the Moral Law, as
the Apostle speaks? And yet this same Apostle speaking of this Law of love,
calls it not the Law of nature, but the Law of Christ, Bear ye one another
burden (which is a special act of love) and so fulfill the Law of Christ: So
that the Moral Law you see, my Brethren, is the Law of Christ: and therefore he
is pleased to own it, and to call it his Commandment, John 15.12. to fortify
it with his own authority (as in the Sermon on the Mount) and to impose the
precept of it on the people.

And that this Moral Law is universal, and extends to all flesh, appears by
this, that it is not imposed alone upon the members of the Church, but on the
very heathen too, upon the Kings and Princes of the earth, as you may see,
Psalm. 2.2. The Kings and Princes of the earth set themselves, and the Rulers
take Counsel together against the Lord and his Christ, saying, Let us break
their bond^ asunder, and cast away their cords from us, that is the Precepts
and Commandments, not of the Gospel only, but also of the Moral Law: Which is
the Law of nature, and obliged not the Jews alone, but all the Nations of the
world: So that no marvel though they both conspire together to rid themselves
of these bonds. The Heathen rage, the people of the Jews imagine, the Kings and
Rulers (not of Jews only, but) of all the earth, stand up and say, Let us break
these bonds asunder, and cast away these cords from us. These bonds and cords
which are imposed and laid upon us all, with which we all of us do find our
selves restrained and bound, that is, the Precepts and Commandments of the
Moral Law: So that you see, Christ by his Legislative power gives Law to all
flesh, as to the outward man, and to the Members.

Paul tells us, Romans 7.14. not only in the nature of it, but also in the
subjects of it. It takes hold upon the souls, the spirits, and consciences of
men: It captivates their very thoughts, 2 Cor. 10.5. And herein Jesus Christ is
singular, and manifests such authority as no one exercises but himself. Its
true, that men do oftentimes give Laws unto the outward man, and to the members
in politic and civil things, and then they do it too as Christ's Vicegerents
and his Deputies, they do it under him, and by authority from him. But it is
Christ, and he alone that gives Laws unto the Conscience in holy and religious
things. He delegates the former power to Magistrates, who in the same respect
are styled the Ministers of Christ: But this authority he makes not over to any
of the sons of men: And yet he exercises this authority over all the sons of
men, so that there is not one of them exempted from his Power.

Acts 10.42. where he is styled the Judge of the quick and dead. Its true that
other Judges in the world can judge the quick, they can deal well enough with
those that are alive; but if they die, they are gone out of their hands for
ever. But Jesus Christ is Judge of all flesh, quick flesh, and dead flesh,
Judge of quick and dead too. Death cannot rescue men out of his hands; no, my
Beloved, he can pursue them to eternity, and follow them into another world,
and there can execute the rigor of his wrath upon them to the very utmost.

And as he is the Judge of all persons, so he is Judge of all cases: All
judgment is committed to him, not some, but all judgment, Job 5.22. whether
the case be manifest and open, or whether it be hid and secret, all is one,
Christ is Judge of both these; and this is singular to Jesus Christ. Men can do
nothing in a case that is absolutely secret. If a murder be committed, and
nothing be discovered any way; no, not so much as by a circumstance, or by some
grounds of strong suspicion, what can an earthly Judge do? He knows the Law is
broken, but yet he cannot execute the sentence of the Law, because he is not
able to discover the Offender. Now Jesus Christ is not to seek in such Cases.
To him all things are naked and uncovered. And therefore he brings every work
to judgment, and every secret thing, Eccl. 12.14. And the Apostle tells us of a
day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to his
Gospel, Romans 2.16. So that you see no flesh can escape his judgment, let the
man be what he will, and let the cause be what it will.

Now this Judiciary power of Christ's consists of two things; in passing
sentence upon all flesh; in executing the sentence after it is past. A word or
two of these in order.

Christ has the power of passing sentence upon all flesh. All mankind must
all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 2
Cor. 5.10. there to receive their last doom, either of absolution or
condemnation. Sometimes he passes sentence on them in the Court of Conscience
here, he seals up men's condemnation to them, and makes it to become a certain
thing: They are condemned already, in themselves, and there remains nothing
to them but a certain looking for of judgment, as the expression is, Heb.
10.27. And on the other side, he seals up men's absolution, he seals Pardons
to the conscience: This he has power to do, and this he does sometimes on
earth, Mat. 9 6. The Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins. At utmost,
in the last and dreadful day, all the dead both great and small, appear before
him, and receive a sentence from him, either the one way or the other, as you
may see, Apoc. 20.12.

And as he has the power of Passing, so the power of Executing Sentence James
4.12. There is one Lawgiver, (says he) And what can he but give the Law? yes,
he can execute the Law too: and therefore it is added presently, Who is able
both to save, and to destroy: to save those that are acquitted by the Law, and
to destroy those that are condemned by the Law.

Sometimes he executes his sentence partly here: The works of some men go
before to judgment, (as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Timothy 5.24.) Christ
punishes the wicked, and rewards the Godly in this present world; but the full
retribution of them both, he keeps and reserveth to the day of his appearing,
when both of them shall have their full reward. Behold I come quickly, and my
reward is with me, (says our Savior) He sends not his reward before him, he
leaves not his reward behind him, but brings it with him, to dispense it when
he comes: And then he will discover it to all the world, that he has power
over all flesh, for he will then dispose eternally of all flesh, either in
heaven or in hell.

John 17.2. As thou have given him power over all Flesh.




You believe in God, (says he to his Disciples) believe also in me, John 14.1.
And therefore the Apostle tells us of the Law of faith, and sets it in
opposition to the Law of works, the Moral Law, as you may see, Romans 3.27. Now
the great thing which this Law of faith requires, is, the receiving of the Son
of God upon the terms that he is offered in the Gospel, as you have been often
showed. And it requires it on the greatest penalty, even everlasting
condemnation, which is as certain to the unbelievers, as if it had already past
upon them. He that believes not, is condemned already, John 3, 18. And yet
alas, how many are there who submit not to this Law of faith; who though Christ
be proposed and tendered to them in the Gospel, though he be even forced and
pressed upon them, though Christ command them to believe, yet they will not be
obedient! Indeed if he had no authority to impose this Law upon them, they had
reason to stand out: but God has given him power to do this, yea, he himself
requires the very same thing. This is his Commandment that we should believe in
the name of his Son Jesus Christ, 1 John 3.23. so that you see (my Brethren)
this is the Commandment of the Father, and this is the Commandment of the Son,
both join in this Law; and therefore they are deeply to be censured, who are
refractory to so great a Law as this.

And that it may the better work and take upon them, I shall show them, first
the sin, and secondly the danger of their disobedience.

It is a sin indeed to violate the Law of works which the Apostle styles Moses
Law, because it was delivered by the hand of Moses: But it is a greater sin to
violate the Law of faith, and that both with relation to the Father and the Son.

First for the Father, it is an horrible indignity to him; it is the basest
undervaluing and despising of his love that can be; he gives his Son out of his
bosom, to suffer shame and death for poor Creatures, and having done it, he
sends his Messengers to mind men of the danger they are in without Christ, and
to exhibit and propose him to them as the means, the only means of their
salvation: and as endeavoring to overcome men with his goodness, he does in
love and pity beg them, and beseech them to accept of it; And what is the event
of this? why (my beloved] when he has abased himself so low, and stooped so
much below himself as to become a suitor to them to receive his Son, they carry
matters so as if he stood in need of them; as if he came to make a motion to
them for his own advantage; as if he knew not what to do, if they should refuse
his Son. Is not this good usage? that when he has descended so in ways of
mercy, they should shake him off, and tell him in effect, that his proffered
wares stink, and that they do not need him, nor his Son neither: he may go
offer him to them that have a mind to him.

Oh what abuse of love is this! Oh what an high indignity! what an unsufferable
provocation! even to incense the Lord so far, as to cause him to resolve that
he will never stoop so low again; that he will never prostitute his Son again
to the disdain and the refusal of a company of base unthankful men; that he
will make them rue the time that ever they contemned this mercy to them.

Then for the Son (my Brethren) in the second place, it is an high affront to
him, and so in that respect a great sin. It cost him dear to purchase and
obtain remission and salvation for a company of lost creatures; indeed his
dearest life, his dearest blood. And is it not an horrible indignity to slight
and to despise so great salvation? to trample under foot the son of God: to
scorn such rich and precious mercy? yet this all unbelievers do, if not in
their intention, yet in the issue and event. Truly their sin in this respect,
is greater then the sin of Devils, whose nature Christ has not assumed ( he
took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham) for whom he
never suffered, and to whom he was never offered; They will have something to
excuse themselves withal, something to plead before the Lord in the great and
dreadful day. Al^s, may Devils say, there was no possibility of our recovery;
there was no Mediator between God and us, to purchase and obtain our peace;
there was no pardon tendered to us; but you had the eternal Son of God to dye
for you, (for you mankind) to shed his blood, and to lay down his life for you;
and yet when all was done, and when he came and brought a pardon to you, sealed
with his blood, and besought you to accept of it, you even shut him out of
doors, you would not look upon him, nor receive him; you baffled him, and
dodged with him; Ah, (my beloved) what heart if it be truly touched, can hold
from breaking under the sight and sense of such abominable and prodigious
wickedness as this is?

for how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation! Heb. 2.3. There
will be no enduring of it, it will be infinitely heavy; it will be easier for
Turks and Pagans in the day of judgment then for such wretches. Alas poor
souls, that as if their condemnation were not deep enough already, the
incarnation, and the passion, and the offer of a Savior, the richest mercies
in themselves, that ever were bestowed upon the Creature, should accidentally
increase it. That Christ should die and shed his blood, to sink men deeper into
hell, then if he had not died at all (for this is the event and issue of it)
this is a lamentable thing indeed.

Romans 13.10. and he that loves another has fulfilled the Law: see the eighth
verse of that chapter: in which respect our Savior Christ himself divides the
Law into these two Commandments: Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and the neighbor as thy self: what then? it may be you will say, Does
Christ by his authority impose the moral Law on men, the ten Commandments of
the Decalogue? The Law of faith is his indeed, but is the Law of works his too?
Yes the Law of works is his; for he requires works as well as faith. And the
faith which he bestows upon his members, works by love. And love is his own
commandment, so he calls it, John 15.12. This is my Commandment that ye love one
another. Indeed he rules his Subjects by the Moral Law, that is, the precepts
and commandments of it are the Statutes of his Kingdom. Its true, when it was
first delivered to Adam in the state of innocence, it came to him but in the
hand of the Creator only; But it comes to us (my Brethren) in the hands of the
Redeemer, and of the Mediator Jesus Christ, who was typified by Moses at the
delivery of the Law, the second time upon Mount Sinai, Gal. 3.19. And hence the
precepts of it, are styled not the bonds of God only, but the bonds of Christ
too; Psalm. 2.2. Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords
from us. The Gospel all men yield, is Christ's; he is in a peculiar way the
author of the Gospel, and therefore it is called the word of Christ. Now the
Commandments of the Law, are all of them revived in the Gospel. The whole of
what the Law requires, is for the manner and measure of obedience exacted also
in the Gospel; there is no duty which the Law enjoins, but it is taught us in
the Gospel. The Gospel teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to
live soberly, and righteously, and godlily in this present world: Titus 2.12.
soberly toward our selves, righteously toward our Brethren, and piously
toward our God.

And these Particulars apparently involve and comprehend all the Commandments
of the Moral Law from the beginning of it to the end; There being nothing in
the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, interdicted, or required, but may be
reduced to one of these three heads.

So then you see my Brethren, not the Law of faith only, but the Law of works
too, is Christ's Law; or if it be not Christ's Law, it can be no Law at all; The
Father judges no man, but has committed all Judgment to the Son. And
consequently he that violates this Law of works, resists the authority of
Jesus Christ, and the power with which he is invested by his Father to give Law
to all flesh.

And yet alas how many are there who live in the resolved, and the constant
breach of all the precepts and commandments of the Law of Christ, who in their
practice daily break these bonds asunder, and cast away these cords from them,
who are not subject to the Law of Christ nor indeed can they be! If it be
pressed home upon them, to bind them to the good behavior, and to restrain
them from their sinful and ungracious courses, they are out of all patience. If
the commands of Christ be laid upon them, to hold them fast to duty and
obedience and to abridge them of their carnal liberty, if they be told they
must no take their old courses, but they must hear and pray, and fast, and
sanctify Gods holy day, and live strictly, they will be very much incensed;
The Law of Christ is too severe and strict for them, it curbeth and abridgeth
them too much, and therefore they will shake it off from them; And as the
Lunatic who was restored by our Savior to his reason, brake all the bonds and
cords with which they bound him, so these unreasonable Creatures deal with
Christ's Law; nothing will hold them to obedience. Let him lay what command he
will upon them, they will surely break it, that they may live at liberty, and
walk according to their own humors. Yea, sin in such by the Commandment
becomes exceeding sinful, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 7.13. Not by way of
declaration (for that is not the purpose and intention of the place) but by way
of Irritation; When the Commandment labors to lay hold on sin, to bind him,
and to chain him up, then sin begins to lay about him, to struggle for his
liberty, and so by accident to be the more sinful. When we press home the
precepts of the Law, and urge them hard on wicked men, as there are some that
yield themselves up to the binding power and to the obligation of it: so there
are others that stand out against the Law, and they are much the worse for it,
and become the more vicious. What? bind and curb, and limit them? tell them
that they must not swear, and they must not be unclean? They will not be
restrained and hampered; they! no they will swear the more and drink the more
and be unclean the more. They are resolved with the rebellious Jews, we will
not hear, we will not do but we will do as we have done; I will fetch wine, and
we will fill our selves with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day,
and much more abundant. Well my beloved, if any of you be at this hand, hear
but a few particulars before we part.

Consider Christ is infinitely tender of his Authority, and of his Law. Mat.
18.5. He had as lief that Heaven and Earth should come to nothing as that his
Law should be dissolved. And judge you then how great their provocation is, who
violate and break the precepts of it day by day, as Sampson did his green
cords, as if they had no strength or force at all in them. Could they set
Heaven and Earth on fire and consume it into ashes, they could not anger Christ
so much, nor vex him as they do by this their cursed violation of his blessed
Law. And there is extraordinary peril in the wrath of Christ; If once he be
incensed there is very great hazard, and hence says David, Psalm 2. ult. Kiss
the son least he be angry, and you perish.

Gal. 3.10. There Is not a curse contained in the book of God from the beginning
of it to the end, but such a man lies open to it, and if he persevere without
repentance, he shall be sure to feel it to his pain. Well then, my brethren,
you may perhaps out-stand the precept, but are you able to out-stand the
threatening? You may decline the duty, but are you able also to avoid the curse?
Here Christ commands, and you reply, We will not hear, we will not do: But
when he shall pronounce the sentence of the Law upon you, in the great and
great dreadful day, will you reply We will not bear, we will not suffer? Will
you tell him to his face, We will not go to hell, we will not be condemned by
the Law, as you have told him here, We will not be obedient to the Law? Alas it
is not all men's scorns and haughty looks, it is not all their pride and
sturdiness that will prevail at that time. No, no, the haughtiness of men shall
be brought low, and Christ alone shall be exalted in that day.

Romans 14.11. As I live, says the Lord, that is, the Lord Christ as you may see
by the coherence, every knee shall bow to me, willingly, or by compulsion. If
it bend not willingly, I will make it bow, or break. Christ will be King though
the earth be never so unsteady, and the haters of the Lord shall be subject
unto him. How? shall his haters be his Subjects? yes they shall be subject to
him either one way or another. For though they be not subject to his grace,
they shall be subject to his power. They that will not be ruled by him, shall
be broken by him. We read of some that break his bonds asunder, Psalm. 2, 3. but
presently he breaks their bonds asunder. If they be good at breaking, Christ
will fall a breaking too. He will break them with a rod of Iron, and dash them
in pieces like a Potters Vessel. The authority of Christ, as it has some that
stoop to it, so it has others that oppose it. And such are they of whom we
read, Luke 19.19. His Citizens hated him, and sent a message after him to tell
him to his teeth we will not have this man to rule over us. They were in haste,
they could not tarry till he came about again, but they must send this saucy
Message after him. But see now what becomes of these men, and whether it be all
as they will, ver. 27. But these my Enemies that would not have me to rule over
them, bring them forth and slay them before me.

Oh think on this, you that will not be ruled by Jesus Christ, who when his
will is manifested to you, and when you are acquainted with the Laws and
Statutes of his Kingdom, regard it not at all, but make light of all this. Oh,
be advised to be wise and serve the Lord. Kiss the son, he has authority, and
therefore do him fealty, least he be angry and you perish.

Is it so that all mankind is under the authority of Jesus Christ? they are
mistaken then who think that some men are exempt from his authority and from
his Legislative power, and that they are not bound to the obedience of the Laws
he gives. I am very apt to think that Infidels and heathens who never had the
Gospel preached to them, who never heard of Jesus Christ, are no way bound to
the obedience of the Law of faith, so that they sin in not believing in the
Lord Christ, and taking him to be their Savior whom they have no means to
know. The Law of faith (I mean of justifying faith) the Commandment to believe,
is not a natural, but a positive Law, and consequently promulgation is
absolutely necessary to the obligation of it. But the Decalogue, the Moral Law,
the Law of works, is written in the heart of man by nature, and therefore
binds all men to obedience.

Yea, but say some, believers are exempted from the obligation of it; the
faithful are not bound to the obedience of the Moral Law. Its true I must
confess they are not bound to the obedience of it so as to be justified and
saved by this obedience. They are not bound to the obedience of it so as the
condition of a Covenant of works. But they are bound to the obedience of it so
as to testify their faith and love, and thankfulness, and service to the Lord
Christ, who has imposed this Law upon all flesh, so that all men, yea even
believers, are under the commanding power of this Law.

Yea, but it will be said by some, that Jesus Christ has made us free, Gal.
5.1. And this they think, and teach to be even from the obligation of the Moral
Law.

True, Christ has made us free indeed, but from the servitude of sin, Sol.
not from the service of himself; and from the Law of sin as the Apostle calls
it, Romans 7.23. not from his own Law. Why should we think that Christ has shed
his blood to free his people from the obligation of his own Law? Indeed my
Brethren, if the Moral Law, the Law of love, the Law of works, were not the Law
of Christ, as the Apostle calls it, Gal. 6.2. I should be easily persuaded to
believe his people are exempted from the binding power of it. It seems
reasonable that his members should be freed from any Law but that which he
himself gives. But the commandment of the Moral Law which is fulfilled in love,
is his Commandment, John 15.12. strengthened with his authority, delivered in
his hand and name to men, and who can think that he should not impose his own
Law, upon his own people? Mark that of the Evangelist, Luke 1.74, 75. He has
saved us from our enemies and from the hands of all that hate us. that we might
serve him who has saved us, in holiness to God, and in righteousness to man;
which is indeed the sum, and substance of the Moral Law. So that the liberty
which Christ has purchased for his people, is liberty to keep, not liberty to
break the Law; and that is liberty indeed, as David thinks, Psalm. 119.32. I
will run the ways of thy Commadments, when thou have set my heart at liberty.

To say it in a word my Brethren, there is a twofold liberty, a twofold
freedom, the one enjoyed under sin, and the other under Christ. Under sin we
are free to do any thing but good; under Christ we are free to do any thing but
evil. Of the first sort of freedom speaks the Apostle Paul, Romans 6.20. When you
were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness; and of the second
faith the same Apostle in ver. 22. of that Chapter, Being the servants of God
ye are free from sin. Well then our Savior Christ has brought us from the
former to the latter sort of freedom, so that we are at liberty from sin, and
not at liberty to sin. We are at liberty to serve him, and obey him and to keep
his Law.

Romans 6.19. where he tells them ye are not under the Law, but under Grace. And
if believers are not under it, why then how are they subject to the obligation
of it?

Sol.
To this I answer, that believers are not under it respectively to the coaction
of it, for they willingly obey it. They are not under it respectively to the
severe exaction of it, for they are delivered from it; it comes to them with
Evangelical allay, and Gospel mitigation. They are not under it respectively to
the malediction and the condemnation of it, for they are not accursed, they
shall not be condemned by it.

But they are under the commanding and the binding power, the obligation of it
notwithstanding, because from this they are not neither can they be delivered.
For if you look upon the substance of the Moral Law, it is an everlasting, an
eternal Law, as David calls it, Psalm. 19.7. It shows what is good, and what
is evil in it self, and in its nature. So that the things that are commanded
there, are not good because they are commanded, but are commanded because they
are good. And so the things that are forbidden, they are not evil because they
are forbidden, but are forbidden because they are evil. And hence this Law is
never charged (as the Law of the forbidden fruit, and as the Ceremonial, and
Judaical Laws) no, it is steadfast, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Heb. 2.2. (...),
the word that was spoken by Angels, that is, the Moral Law that was delivered
by their Ministry, is steadfast. Indeed this Law, the Law of nature, was written
in the heart of Adam in the state of innocence, and Christ intends not to
blot out any thing that was engraven there, but promises to write it out again
more fairly (for it was much obliterated by the fall) in the hearts of his
people. So runs the tenor of the New Covenant, Ier. 31.33.

The last Objection that I shall insist upon, Tim. 1.9. The Law, says the
Apostle there, is not given to the Righteous. And if it be not given to them,
why then it seems that it belongs not to them any way.

To this I answer that the Apostles purpose is not that the righteous are not
under the command and obligation of the Law; for mark it, Sol.
Adam was exactly righteous, and yet it was a Law to him even in the state of
innocence it self.

But this is that which the Apostle means; the Law is not given to the
righteous so as to force him to obedience, so as to be against a righteous man.
It is not given for his hurt and condemnation. He does not say (...), Lex non
est lata, but (...) Lex non est posita; which intimates an action or a plea
against a man. So that the Moral Law is not the action or the plea of God
against a righteous man to bring him under judgment, and to oblige and bind
him over to damnation. And so it is the same in sense with that which is
delivered by the same Apostle in another place, speaking of such as are guided
by the spirit, and express the fruits of it in their lives and conversations,
Gal. 5.23. He does not say to such a one, but (...) against such there is no
Law. Indeed the Moral Law, so far as it is against believers, is not imposed
but removed by Christ. He has blotted out the hand writing of Ordinances that
was against us, that was contrary to us, and took it out of the way; nayling it
to his Cross, Col. 2.14 even the hand writing of Moral ordinances, so far as it
is against us, and contrary to us, Christ has taken out of the way. It is
against us in the rigor; and in the curse and malediction of it, and
consequently, so far it is taken off by Christ in relation to believers. But it
is not against believers in the commands and precepts of it requiring them to
love God and serve God, etc. No, these things suit with their spirits, they are
written in their hearts, and therefore they are not destroyed, but rather
strengthened, and confirmed by Christ.

Is it so that all mankind is under the authority of Jesus Christ, under
Colossians, Col. 2.20. In the foregoing verse he sets forth the authority of
Christ; and shows that he is the head and ruler of his people, and presently
comes in with this Interrogation, and why, says he, are you subject to
Ordinances? by which he does not mean the Laws of God, but the decrees, and
constitutions and commands of men. And so himself explains it afterward in the
succeeding words, that by those Ordinances he intends nothing else but the
Commandments and doctrines of men. As if he should have said, if you be under
the authority of Jesus Christ, Why are you subject to the Ordinances and
commands of men?

What then, does the authority of Jesus Christ, from obedience to any
ordinances, or commands of men? and are they to be subject to him so, that they
be subject to no other governors or rulers in the world? Is the authority and
power of Magistrates dissolved by this means?

be ye not servants of men, be ye not subject to the ordinances and commands of
men: he does not mean it absolutely, as if we ought not to be subject to them
any way. It was not his intention to bring in such confusion, and such Anarchy
into the world. For in another place he tells us, that we must needs he subject
to the Magistrate, Romans 13.5. And the Apostle Peter's Exhortation goes a little
further, and is a little more large, 1 Pet. 2.13. Submit your selves to every
ordinance of man, and that for the Lord sake; And it is necessary that we
should do so, says he; for so is the will of God, verse 15. of that Chapter.

These two do seem apparently to contradict and clash with one another. Be ye
not the servants of men, and Ye must needs he subject to men; be ye not subject
to the ordinances and commands of men, And yet submit your selves to every
ordinance of man; and therefore I shall clear it in a word, or two, both with
relation to the outward man, and to the conscience.

For the outward man, that ought not to be subject to the Injunctions and

There are other Laws of men which concur with Christ's Laws, commanding that
which they command, forbidding that which they forbid; As when Christ forbids
to swear, and when the Magistrate forbids to swear too; when Christ forbids us
to profane the Sabbath, and when the Magistrate forbids us to profane it too;
There is no scruple touching such commands as these; for here the Magistrate
and Christ do close, and therefore in obeying one of them, we obey the other
too.

But when the Laws of men do contradict the Laws of Christ, forbidding that
which they command, commanding that they forbid; when their Injunctions clash
with his, we ought not to subject our selves to them. The authority of Christ
is the greatest in the world: his Father (as you have it in my text) has given
him power over all flesh. And therefore he must rather be obeyed then any
fleshly power, if once they come in competition, and if they cannot be obeyed
together, in such a case as this, my brethren, when the same thing shall come
to be commanded in the Law of Christ, forbidden in the Law of man, and so upon
the other side, we have a certain rule to walk by, Act. 5.29. It is better to
obey God then men, in such a case we cannot be the servants of men, because if
we be so, we cannot be the servants of Christ; for in obeying them, we throw
off the authority of Jesus Christ.

And as we ought not to subject our outward man to the commands of Mat. 15.9.
They were but constitutions and commands of men, and yet they vented them for
Doctrines, and imposed them on the Conscience; This they ought not to have
done; or if they did so, they ought not to be yielded to in so doing. We ought
not to be subject to the commands of men, upon such terms as these are. The
Lord complains of this in Israel as a grievous sin, for which he thunders out a
heavy doom against them, a Judgment so remarkable, that it should come the
next step to a miracle, because their fear to him was taught by the precepts of
men, Isa. 29.13. For this the Apostle chideth the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 11.^0. Ye
suffer if a man devour you if a man bring you into bondage, which is not meant
of the enthralling of the outward man, but of the captivating of the
Conscience, in the chains of humane constitutions and decrees, which these
deceitful workers mentioned in the former verses jugled on upon it. Well then
since Christ has such authority upon us, let none of us subject our Conscience
and our faith to men; let them not be Lords of these, for they belong to Christ
and him only. He suffers magistrates indeed to rule without, over the outward
man, but he alone must rule within over the conscience. If any go about to take
command on that, or to give Law to that, you must stand fast in the Liberty
wherewith Christ has made you free, as the Apostle counsels you, Gal. 5.1.

Is it so that all mankind is under the authority of Jesus Christ? Then James
4.12. There is one Lawgiver (says he) that is able both to save, and to
destroy. And what of that? Who art thou that judge another? What authority
have thou to pass sentence on thy brother? you are both under the power, and
the authority of Jesus Christ, and therefore let him judge you both, and do not
you judge one another.

Why you will say, may not one man judge another without any derogation from
the authority of Christ? yes, if he do it by authority from Christ, and
according to the rules prescribed by Christ. So one man may judge another and
condemn another too, having received power from Christ in the Church, and
Commonwealth. But if one man judge another of himself, without any Lawful
power, and without any real ground, if one man judge another in or about such
things as are reserved to the authority of Christ, as secret things and the
final state of men, and such like, it is a prejudice to the authority of Christ
and to the power which God has given him over all flesh.

And yet, how usual is it with men to judge, and censure one another, when they
are not called to it, when they have no right to do it, when they have no
sufficient ground for it? They will judge the hearts of men, they will judge
the ends of men which are known to none but God, having neither evidence nor
warrant for these censures. If they be out with any man, presently he is an
Hypocrite, a rotten-hearted wretch, and what not? if he do any doubtful action,
they will be sure to construe it the worst way; if he do any action clearly
good, then he has ill ends in it, nothing can escape their hard censures. Nay
some will pass their doom upon the final state of men, which none but Christ
himself can judge of. Now, I beseech you, (my beloved) consider whose authority
you violate in this, and whose office you assume. Remember, Christ has power
over all flesh; he is the Lawgiver, who is able both to save and to destroy;
who knows whom he will save, and whom he will destroy: let him judge all, and
do not you judge one another.

John 17.2. As thou have given him power over all flesh.


Dearly beloved, avenge not your selves. Take heed that you be neither overcome
of evil in your passions, Romans 12. ult. nor render evil for it in your
actions, 1 These. 5.15. There are not many sins to which we are so mightily
inclined, as we are to this, nor which we are so hardly able to resist. And
truly I am much afraid, that in the prosecution of the great affairs of this
time, there is in many too much of the private grudge, and self-revenge, who
make the public cause a cover for their own malice. Now, I beseech you, (my
beloved) let us not study to avenge our selves on any man, but let us lay aside
all self-respects. If we have been abused and wronged by any, let us forgive
them, and forbear them, (as the Apostle Paul exhorts) Col. 3.13. Forgiving one
another, and forbearing one another, if any man have a quarrel against any.
There is much in that Text: forgiving one another in regard of inward malice,
and forbearing one another in regard of outward revenge. And that not only in
conceited and imaginary, but in true and real wrongs: For so the Greek word
(...) rendered quarrel or complaint imports: Not a quarrel picked or raised
upon no ground at all, but justa conquerendi causa, (as Zanchius reads it) a
just occasion of complaint. So that when we are injured, so as the abuse is
evident and clear, it is our duty to forgive and to forbear: And that who ever
offer the abuse to us, let him be what he will, if any man have a quarrel
against any, of what condition or degree soever, none exempted, yet we must
forgive still, and we must forbear still.

And this because it has a world of difficulties in it, I shall set on with a
few Considerations.

Consider you entrench on Jesus Christ, in self-revenge, invade his proper
Psalmist intimates in his petition: Psalm. 94 1. O God to whom vengeance
belongs, O God to whom vengeance belongs, show thy self: he speaks it there
exclusively, vengeance belongs to him, and none but him: To none but him
originally, primitively, though he make over power to execute it, to his
Deputies and Vicegerents: who though they cannot do it of themselves, and by
their own authority, yet they may do it as the Ministers of Christ, (as the
Apostle Paul intimates, speaking of the Magistrate) Romans 13.4. He is the
Minister of God, (says he) and an avenger. A Minister of God, and by that
means, by virtue of his deputation a revenger, to execute wrath on him that
does evil. So that when our abuses are unsufferable, and when they wound the
name, or the estate so deep that they are not to be born, if we go to the
Magistrate to right us, and avenge us, we go to Jesus Christ in him, because he
has appointed him, and set him up for that purpose. But if we avenge our
selves, we wrest the sword out of the hands of Jesus Christ, and do as much as
in us lies, to dis-invest him of that power which God has given him over all
flesh. And with this argument it is that the Apostle Paul disswades them from
self-revenge in the fore-alledged Scripture, Romans 12.19. Dearly beloved, avenge
not your selves, and why so? because in so doing, you enter on the right of
Christ; for it is written, vengeance is mine, it is not yours, no, it is mine,
and I will repay it, either by my self, or by my ordinance.

By self-revenge, as you invade the right of Christ, so you stay and hinder
Paul expresses it in the forecited Scripture, Romans 12.19.) He would avenge
you, and you would not suffer him, but you will do it with your own hands. He
offers to step in and right you, and you will not give him the place; no, you
justle him aside by a revengeful righting of your selves. And therefore it is
just with him to leave you to your selves in this business: and truly this
among the rest, may be the cause why many men lie under such unsufferable
wrongs; why they are so abused and oppressed without any remedy; why Christ
forbeareth to avenge them, because they will not give him way; they will get
into the seat, they will be meddling with his office and authority, and
therefore he stands by and looks on. As therefore we desire that he that has
authority to right us, should put to his own hand, let us acquit our hearts and
hands (as much as it is possible) of self-revenge. I say to every one of you,
as Solomon, Prove. 20.22. Say not I will render evil, I will revenge; but wait
on Christ, and he will save you.

Paul having dissuaded us from wrath which tends to revenge, Let not the Sun
go down upon your wrath, adds this immediately in the succeeding words, neither
give place to the Devil, Ephesians. 4.27. And is not this a fearful thing to justle
Jesus Christ aside, that we may let the Devil in? to make room for such a guest
as Satan is, and that by putting Jesus Christ by? For it is Satan (my beloved)
that makes such work in men's hearts, and stirs them up to such unwarrantable
practices as these are.

Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah, (says the Lord) by
taking vengeance, what follows? I will take vengeance upon Edom, Ezech. 25.12.
If Christ come in and find his family together by the ears, he will be in a
rage too, and he will take an order with them altogether. Manasseh against
Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, and they together against Judah. And
what is the event of these contentions? why the Lord is against them all. For
all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still:
Isa. 9.21. He deals with us, (my Brethren) as we deal with others: with the
froward (says the Psalmist) thou will show thy self froward, Psalm. 18.25. If
we be unjustly froward to our Brethren, he will be justly froward toward us: If
we lay on upon our brethren, he will lay on upon us.

Let these considerations keep us from revenge: And because it is a very hard
thing to forbear, especially when opportunities are put into our hands; For if
a man find his Enemy at an advantage, will he let him go free? 1 Samuel 24.20. I
shall give you two directons which will be very helpful to you, to cause you to
abstain from self-revenge: First, you must put away those carnal Lusts: and in
the next place you must put away those carnal reasons, which incline you to
revenge.

Whereas there is strife among you, (says the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians)
are you not carnal? 1 Cor. 3.3. Is it not very manifest that there is much
corruption, much flesh in you? It may be you may think it to be otherwise; but
mark what the Apostle says, Jam. 4.1. From whence come wars and fightings
among you? whence is it, that it is but a word and a blow? an injury and a
revenge? whence is it? why hence it is, will some men say; I am so troubled and
molested, I am so wronged and abused, that I cannot suffer it: No, no, (says
the Apostle) thou art very much deceived; it is thy pride, self-love, envy,
passion, that are the true and real causes why thou can not hold thy hands:
from whence come wars and fightings among you? even from your lusts; If there
were no wars within, there would be no wars without. If these corruptions and
unruly lusts within were thoroughly mortified and subdued, these outward
provocations would never cause such hot contentions as they do.

You must put away those carnal reasonings that incline you and provoke Abraham
did, when there was like to be some difference between him and his Nephew Lot:
Its probable he was assaulted with such thoughts as these; What will thou yield
and stoop to him? it is his duty to submit to thee; shall Lot thy Nephew have
his choice of all the Land, and thou his aged Uncle be content to take the
boys leavings? But Abraham hearkens not to such suggestions. So Moses, when he
was contemned, vilified, and set at naught, no doubt he had his passions in
him, though he were a meek man, and they were apt enough to work, and stir, and
secretly to egg him on to this or the like purpose, What, will thou suffer such
a gross abuse? shall they go smooth away with such a bold affront, and base
indignity, as this is? No, let them know that they have mis-behaved themselves
toward their betters: But Moses patiently allays and stils such thoughts as
these, and meekly puts up all without distemper. I might exemplify in David,
when he was abused by Shimei, who was his Subject, and that in such a base,
unworthy, and unsufferable way: no doubt he had his inward risings, and he had
one at hand that was an end to take revenge for him: and yet he calms all, we
hear no more but this, Let him curse, etc.

So when our thoughts begin to work apace in any injury or provocation that is
offered to us, and to tell us strange things, let us smother and suppress them:
let us consider that, and think on that which may provoke to love, and not to
malice and revenge.

Is it so, that all mankind is under the authority, etc. Then surely we to kiss
the Son, to do him homage, lest he be angry, and we perish. We labor, (says
the Apostle) that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. And why
so? For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, as it is added
in the next words, 2 Corinthians. 5.10.

The time is coming when he is to sit upon us, and to judge us, and to dispose
of us for ever, either in heaven, or in hell; and therefore it concerns us
infinitely to please him in the mean time, that he may be propitious to us when
that time comes. We pity such a malefactor, who being shortly to be tried
before an earthly Judge, upon a point of life or death, does rather take a
course to anger and provoke him, then appease him; and yet so desperately
foolish are a multitude of men, who strive not to approve themselves to Christ,
nor to be accepted of him, before whose judgment seat they must appear to be
acquitted or condemned: And so according to his doom, to live or die, and that
for ever.

Oh but think upon that last and dreadful day, remember at whose mercy you must
stand, and so endeavor to demean your selves, that whether you be present in
the body, or whether you be absent from the body, that both in life, and death,
and judgment, you may be accepted of him.

etc.

John fall down at the presence of an angel? did Faelix tremble before Paul,
when he did but discourse of Judgment? Did the Officers and Soldiers of the
Jews fall backwards at the voice of Christ? and that while he was in a state,
and condition of abasure? What will ungodly wretches do, when he shall come in
Majesty and glory, to pass sentence on them? when he shall be revealed from
heaven with his mighty Angels, etc. what can they look for in that day, but
eternal condemnation?

etc. How will they melt upon him, think you, when they see him? This is he
that died for me, that shed his blood for me, they would look through him if
they could: and how can they expect but that he that died for them, should
absolve them, and acquit them? Assuredly my brethren, he that has power over
all flesh, will never hate and destroy his own flesh, nor condemn his own
members. No it is well for them that this power is in Christ's hands: for now
they may be confident that he will save them, that he will give eternal life to
them. And thus far of the first particular considered in the words, the thing
it self with which our Savior is invested and endued, and this you see, is
power over all flesh.

The second follows now in order to be handled, The means by which he comes to
be invested with it, viz by free donation from his Father. He has this power,
because his Father gave it him; As thou have given him power over all flesh
(...), as thou have given. He says not, As thy Son has taken power over all
flesh, as he has entered on it, and assumed it to himself; But as thou have
invested and endued him with it. By which he shows apparently, that he comes to
it by his fathers act, and by his Fathers gift, and not by his own intrusion,
as thou have given him power over all flesh.

So that hence I might observe,

That Jesus Christ did not intrude himself on the authority with which he is
invested over all flesh, but was admitted to it freely by his Father.

He did not take this honor to himself, as the expression is, though in
another case, Heb. 5.4. but it was put upon him. See Psalm. 2.6. Note 3. But
this I do but point at in my passage by.

Proceed we to the third and last Particular considered in the words, viz. the
end for which he is invested with this vast authority. That he may give eternal
life to as many as God has given him.

So that you see, (my Brethren) here is giving upon all hands: The Father gives
the Son, that the Son may give to others: The Father gives to him power, that
he may give to others life.

First, Let us look upon this end in general, before we take it into parts. And
here let us consider, whether this be the only end for which the Father gives
the Son power; whether he have no other aim in putting this authority upon him
over all flesh; but only that he may bestow eternal life upon his own people;
what need he have so large authority for this end? Authority over all flesh,
that he may give eternal life to some flesh, to the least part of flesh, to as
many as God has given him, who are comparatively but a small number. What use
has this authority in reference to other flesh, to whom he does not give
eternal life, if this be all the end of it?

For clearing of this, (my Brethren) you must know that this is not the only
end, but it is the chief end; for it is very manifest in Scripture, that the
authority of Jesus Christ, as it extends to all flesh, so it is exercised one
way or another upon all flesh. It is bestowed upon him by his Father, as well
that he may give eternal death to some, as eternal life to others. And so
accordingly he executes this power, and this authority of his, as well in
passing sentence of condemnation upon unbelievers, as of salvation upon
believers. In judging some (and that the most of men) to death, as well as
other some to life. The Father (says our Savior) has committed all judgment
to the Son: judgment as well of condemnation, as of absolution. So that the
giving of eternal life to as many as God has given him, is not the only end of
the authority of Jesus Christ: but it is the main end, the prime end, the chief
end. This end is principally in the eye of God, and Christ; the other end is
not considerable in regard of this. And therefore that is not so much as hinted
at, you see; but this is clearly and expressly mentioned. As who should say,
This was the end indeed, for which his Father gave him power over all flesh;
this was the thing he chiefly aimed at, that he might give eternal life to as
many as God had given him.

So that the Point to be observed, is this.

DOCTRINE. That the authority of Jesus Christ, with which he is invested over
all flesh, is chiefly for the benefit and the salvation of his own People.
It has another end indeed, but this is the great end; he has it not so much
for the hurt of wicked men and unbelievers, as for the good of his Members. Not
so much to destroy them, as to save these. And hence his Father who gave him
this authority, gave him such a name withal, as shows us why he took upon him
this authority as man: why he became a Priest, a Prophet and a King, as you may
see, Mat. 1.21. Says the Angel there to Joseph, speaking of the Virgin Mary,
She shall bring forth a Son, and thou shall call his name Jesus: And why so? to
show the end for which he came into the world, for he shall save his people
from their sins. Not so much to destroy ungodly men, as to save his own people:
In which respect his Father would not have him called (...) a Destroyer (the
name imposed upon the King of Locusts mentioned Apoc. 9.11. though he be so to
many men, yea to the greatest part of men, whom he will punish with everlasting
destruction; But Jesus, a Savior: its true indeed that Christ is set (as that
is the Expression, Luke 2.34.) that he is appointed by his Father for the fall
and rising again of many in Israel: as for the rising of believers, so for the
fall of unbelievers. But this is but by accident, and besides the main
intention either of God in sending, or of Christ in coming. He does not cause
the fall of such as perish directly, as he does the raising of such as are
saved by him. And this is not obscurely mentioned in that place which is
parallel to this, Isa. 8.14. He shall be for a Sanctuary, (says the Prophet
there) that is the main end which he serves for, to be a place of refuge to
his people: and therefore that which follows is added with a But, as coming in
upon the by, besides his purpose. He shall be for a Sanctuary, but for a stone
of stumbling, and a rock of offense to the house of Israel: and many among them
shall stumble, and fall, and be broken. Though he be in himself a Sanctuary,
yet this shall be the issue and event to some men: Indeed he came into the
world to save sinners, (as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Timothy 1.15.) not to
destroy Sinners. Its true that Sinners are destroyed by him, but this was not
the end of his coming. God did not send his Son into the world, (says the
Evangelist) Ioh. 3.17. to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be
saved.

And so our Savior (Christ himself professes, John 12.47. I came not to judge
the world, but to save the world. And therefore if you look upon his story, you
shall find that he was frequently employed in works of mercy, of helping, and
of saving people every way; but when his hot Disciples would have the
Samaritans destroyed by fire from heaven, you know he would not hear of it. You
shall observe that he absolved and acquitted many in the days of his flesh, Be
of good cheer, your sins are forgiven you. But whom did he condemn, or whose
sins did he bind upon him? No not the woman that was taken in adultery, yea in
the very act, to show how much this was besides his purpose. And therefore when
he delegated his Authority to his Apostles, you may see the drift of it, Mat.
28.19, 20. It was to bring in his Elect to him, that they might be saved by
him, having told them that all power was given to him both in heaven and in
Earth. Immediately by virtue of that power, he gives them their Commission,
that they should go preach the Gospel, and convert men to the faith, and
baptize them in his name. He does not say to them, as God does to the Prophet,
Ier. 1.10. I have set you over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out,
and to pull down, and to destroy: but I have sent you to the Nations, to teach
them, and to save them, Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.

So that the point you see is fully proved.

That the authority of Jesus Christ with which he is invested over all flesh,
is chiefly for the benefit and the salvation of his own people.

And it must needs be so, as I shall make it evidently and demonstratively to
appear to you; For,

First, His very Mediatorship is chiefly for the benefit and salvation of his
He suffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved Kings for their sakes: and
therefore he is called the King of Saints, Apoc 15.3. True, he is King of all
the world, his power is over all flesh, but this Authority of his relates
especially to his people. He is peculiarly the King of Saints: yea when he
walks in ways of wrath, and judgment, and revenge toward his Churches
Enemies, he does this as the King of Saints, with relation to the Saints. And
hence those Sin^ers in the fore-alledged Text behold him in that act of pouring
out the vials of his wrath upon the Beast, they look upon him as the King of
Saints: And therefore they applaud him by no other name, but this, they pick
and cull out this to magnify him by. They might have said, Just and true are
thy ways, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Christ, O Emmanuel, or the like. But they make
choice of this Expression, just and true are thy ways, O thou King of Saints.
To intimate that he did execute those judgments upon Antichrist, and his
Adherents, not as King of the world so much, but as the King of his people; and
for the better government, the greater ease, and peace, and quiet of his
people. His aim was not so much at the destruction of his Enemies, as at the
relaxation of his Church. He did it not so much out of hatred to the wicked, as
out of love to his people. I deerly love my Saints, whose King I am; and they
are not to be preserved in tranquillity, and peace, they will be always vexed,
and troubled, and diisturbed, unless I take this rigid course with such
incorrigible wretches as these are.

that he might give eternal life to as many believe in him.

etc. must needs be chiefly for the good and the salvation of his own people,
and not so much for the destruction of the world, because he is invested with
it by his Father, out of love to mankind; and that which is done in Love, must
needs be for a good end. God did not send his son into the world, and put such
power upon him, out of hatred to it, but out of pity and compassion to his own
chosen; God so loved the world, that he gave his own son, John 3.16. he did it
out of much love, and the End is answerable, that whosoever believes in him,
should not perish, but have life everlasting; (as it is added in the next
words) This is annexed you see that suits with love: whereas if he had done it
that unbelievers might be ruined and destroyed, if that had been his main
intention, it had proceeded from another principle, a principle of wrath and
anger. But this he disavows in the succeeding verse, God sent not his Son into
the world to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be saved. And
that God did not send his Son, and give him power over all flesh out of hatred
and displeasure, but out of favor and good will, and so by consequence, his
aim must be especially and chiefly at the good of his people.

The authority, etc. must needs be chiefly, etc. because he exercises He must
reign, till all those enemies be under foot, 1 Cor. 15.25. till they be utterly
subdued. And then when this is done, when there is none to trouble, or molest
his people any longer, when he has past the sentence of eternal condemnation
on the wicked, and sent them packing unto hell, and seemed to say unto his
Saints, These Enemies which you have seen to day, you shall see them again no
more for ever; when he has cast out every thing that offends, that is
offensive to his people, and made an everlasting separation, between the wicked
and the godly: when he has cast the wicked into the Lake that burns with fire
and brimstone which is the second death; and given eternal life to all his
people: when he has done them all the good that they are capable of, and when
there is no further use of his authority for their advantage, he even yields it
up to him that gave him power over all flesh 1 Cor. 15.28. By which it is
apparent, that he took this power upon him principally for his peoples sake.

Is it so, that the authority of Jesus Christ with, etc. is chiefly for the
Zion be joyful in their King, (as the Prophet David speaks) Psalm. 109.2. how
should the members of the Church triumph and be exceeding glad that they are so
well provided! that they have Jesus Christ to be their Sovereign! that they
have such a Governor as he, who manages his whole authority for their profit
and advantage! This is a joyful thing indeed, The Lord reigns, says the
Psalmist, Psalm. 97.1. and what does he infer upon it? Let the Earth rejoice,
let the multitudes of the Isles be glad of it. And truly we that are the people
of the Lord of this Isle, (as well as other Isles and quarters of the world)
have reason to be glad of this, that Christ rules, and that we are his
Subjects. We are afraid continually of new storms, and new troubles, but here
is our comfort in the midst of all this, that the rains of government are in
the hands of Jesus Christ, who is a King for our sake, who is invested by his
Father with authority, yea with supreme authority, such as none can overtop,
for our good, and for our safety. We may apply the Prophets speech, Isa. 33.20.
Look upon Zion, the City of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a
quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the
stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be
broken: But the glorious Lord will be to us a place of broad rivers. And why
so; For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver; the Lord is our King,
and he will save us. So that however we be rent and torn with sad divisions,
however we be shaken with continual fears; yet when we look to Jesus, and
consider, Is not he out Lawgiver, and is not he our Judge? is not the supreme
authority in his hand? we may conclude that he will save us, that he will do us
good, and that because he has received his power and his authority for this
End.

John 17.2. That he should give eternal life to as many as thou have given him.


etc. chiefly for the good, etc. Then let the Ministers of Jesus Christ be
hence directed, and advised how to use the power, which they have received from
Christ. As God has sent the Son, so Jesus Christ has sent his Ministers and
his Ambassadors. It is his own expression to his own Apostles, John 20.21. As
my Father has sent me, so I send you. And as God has given power to Jesus
Christ whom he has sent, so Jesus Christ has given power to his Ambassadors
whom he has sent. And therefore it is added presently in the fore-alledged
Scripture, whosesoever sins ye remit, they be remitted, and whosesoever sins,
ye retain, they are retained. You must conceive it either in the preaching of
the word, or else in the administration of the censures of the Church. And this
is that which the Apostle calls the power which Christ has given him, 2 Cor.
13.10.

Now all that have this power from Jesus Christ, are here directed how to
manage it, and what use to make of it. It is apparent they must use it to the
very same end, to which Christ does use his; For even as Christ has his
Commission from the Father, so they have their commission from Christ. And even
as Christ has his authority from the Father, so they have their authority from
Christ. And therefore even as the authority of Christ is managed chiefly for
the good, and the salvation of his people, so must they manage theirs too for
the very same end; they must not aim at the destruction, or the hardening of the
people, they must not preach the Gospel to them for such purposes as these;
though this by accident, be the effect sometimes. No, they must make this their
business, how they may save themselves, and them that hear them, how they may
bring about the conversion and salvation of the people, how they may draw in
souls to Jesus Christ, and make proselytes for heaven; this ought to be the
great thing which they aim at. It is true, they must be sons of thunder now and
then, as well as sons of consolation: They must preach the Law sometimes, as
well as the sweet comforts of the Gospel: They must threaten men sometimes with
wrath, and hell, and eternal condemnation: But then they must do it so as
wishing that these things might might not come upon them, but rather that they
might avoid them: They must threaten them with wrath, that they may fly from
the wrath to come: and they must threaten them with hell, that they may escape
the damnation of hell: They must preach the Law to them with Gospel-purposes
and Evangelical intentions: They must send out the avenger of blood to dog them
at the heels, that they may fly to the city of refuge: They must use sharpness,
now and then; it cannot be avoided: But it must be for the same end which the
Apostle speaks of in the fore-alledged place, 2 Cor. 13.10. where he minds
the Corinthians, that in case he must use sharpness according to the power the
Lord has given him, he has authority from Christ to do it; but mark in the
succeeding words to what end, to edification, and not to destruction: According
to the power the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.

And therefore it is very notable, that when our Savior Christ had said to his
Disciples, All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth, and having put
a part of this autho^ity and power of his on his Apostles, he does not bid them
to go out and preach damnation to the people, but go and preach the Gospel to
them, and baptize them that they way be saved: And the Apostle speaking of the
execution of this power in the administration of the censures of the Church,
says, he would give a foul offender up to Satan, for no other end then this,
even for his good and his salvation, 1 Cor. 5.3, 4. I have already judged
(says he) concerning him that has so done this deed, with the power of our
Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver him to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh,
(the carnal part) that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord.

So that when we threaten judgment, when we retain the sins of men, when we
give them up to Satan, either in preaching, or in Church Censures, when we say
of any person, Take him Satan, our aim must be that Christ may have him, that
his corruption may be mortified, and that he may be saved by this means. And
therefore let the Ministers of Jesus Christ have this continually in their eye,
how they may reach this great end. Let all his underofficers in the
administration of the power which Christ has put upon them drive at that, for
which Christ received his, that they may bring his people to eternal life, as
you have it in my Text.

Is it so that the authority of Jesus Christ with which, etc. is chiefly etc.
Then let us apprehend it to be so, and let us look upon it so, when he is
executing this authority and this judiciary power of his upon the enemies of
his people, even to their utter ruin and destruction. When he destroys his
Churches enemies, when he consumes them that they may not be, (as this he does
sometimes by virtue of this power which God has put into his hands, and we
have seen it in these latter days) let us consider that he does not this so
much for their hurt, as for the good of his people. That his aim is not so much
at the destruction of the one, as at the preservation of the other. When he is
laying on upon them with his keen and glittering sword, let this be our
meditation, Now Christ is doing something for his poor people.

And this the Saints of old have done; And therefore David, or whoever else it
be, that is the author of Psalm. 136. recording many judgments of the Lords
which he had brought upon the Churches enemies, makes this the running verse
between continually, For his mercy endures for ever. He smote all the first
born of Egypt, For his mercy endures for ever. He overturned Pharaoh and his
Host in the red Sea, For, etc. He smote great Kings and slew famous Kings, as
Sihon King of the Amorites and Og, etc. For his mercy endures for ever. A man
would think he should have rather said, he did such things as these, because
his anger and his wrath endures for ever. What mercy was it for the Lord to
slay Kings and to destroy Nations? truly it was none to them that were
destroyed, but it was sweet and precious mercy to them for whom they were
destroyed. And Christ would have it known that in the execution of his
vengeance on the wicked, he has not an aspect so much upon the misery he
brings the wicked to; no, his thoughts are taken up with the mercy and the love
he manifests to his people; And when he lays about him, and slashes down the
enemies in heaps, he seems to forget the hatred that he bears to them, and to
think of nothing else but mercy, mercy to his Saints, Thus I kill them and
destroy them, because my mercy, etc. And therefore let us learn to look upon it
so, to have such thoughts and apprehensions upon such occasions.

And that the rather, because there is an inconveniency in it many times, when
we behold Christ in another way. We look upon the Judgments which he wreaks
and executes upon the Enemies and persecuters of the Church, as if he brought
them on them out of such a hatred to them, as we our selves are apt to have.
And so our hearts are carried out in ways of malice, and we make Christ upon
the matter, but the instrument of our revenge. Whereas if we did apprehend him
as aiming not so much at the destruction and ruin of the wicked, as at the
good and preservation of his people, and as administrations of his power which
he sees necessary for the peace, and welfare of the Saints, our hearts would be
in a more sweet and holy temper, then they are sometimes in such cases. For
then my brethren, we should see the Love of Christ in all these dispensations
of his wrath: the more his anger is declared at any time against the wicked,
the more we should be taken up with thoughts and apprehensions of his love to
us. The greater fury and displeasure he reveals against them, the more we
should be led to contemplation of his mercy to our selves. Oh, what are we that
he should have such dear respects to us? That he should be so angry with poor
creatures, and execute such heavy judgments on them for our sakes.

etc. is chiefly for the Good, etc. This then methinks, should prevail with
wicked men, yea though they perish, to have better thoughts of Christ, and
milder apprehensions then they have. For you must know, my brethren, that
Christ has many Enemies; there are abundance in the world that hate him whose
very hearts do rise against him. And whence is this, but because they look upon
him as one that aims at their destruction, as one that means to have their
blood, to ruin them, and damn them in the pit of hell for ever. Now I beseech
you, my beloved, do not so mistake your selves; think not so hardly of the Lord
Christ. Believe it, Jesus Christ has other purposes then these, whatever you
conceive of him; he came not to judge the world, but that the world by him
might be saved. He came not to destroy you, but to save his own people. And
therefore if you be destroyed, thank your selves, and not him. Your help if you
have any, is of him; but your destruction is of your selves.

Do but consider, I beseech you, what Christ has done, what means he has
afforded you for your salvation. He has assumed your nature who are
reprobates, as well as yours who are elect. He has laid down a price of worth
sufficient in it self for your salvation, so that there is not one of you
excluded from it, because it will not reach to you as well as others, because
it is too narrow and too scant to satisfy for all, if all should apprehend it,
and lay hold upon it. No, he has ordered matters so, that there is enough put
in, not for believers only, but for them that perish too. And that which is put
in, as it is sufficient for you, so it is applicable to you as well as others.
As it was paid in your nature, so any of your nature may partake it, if they
will lay hold upon it. It is a satisfaction which nothing but your unbelief and
your refusal can make you incapable of. And hence the Lord will have a tender
of it to be made, the Gospel to be preached to you as well as others; so runs
the tenor of his own Commission, Go, preach the Gospel to every creature; Tell
every man without exception, that there is good news for him, that Christ is
dead for him if he embrace him. Yea Christ himself does by his Messengers
persuade, you, yea entreat you, and beseech you to accept him. Yea, more then
so, he works upon you by some kind of operation of his Spirit, and you resist
the Holy Ghost. He waits upon you many days, yea many years, even till his
head be full of dew, and his locks wet with the drops of the night, he
exercizeth much long-suffering to you, he is patient, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance. All this he does; and
does this look as if it were his aim to damn you, as if he sought your ruin
and destruction? It Is true indeed you are by accident in the worse case for
Christ; you will have one day cause to wish (if you continue in your unbelief)
that Christ had never been Incarnate, that you had never heard of him. But I
beseech you, whose fault is all this? is it Christ's, or is it yours? you had
been damned if Christ had never come; and when he came, he came to you as well
as others. And he came not to destroy you, he came not to condemn the world
(alas that was not his intention) but that the world by him might be saved. And
therefore I beseech you, do not thinks amiss of Christ in this business. If he
should condemn you, yet do not you condemn him, as if your condemnation were
the thing he looked for. If you will perish, think not the worse of Jesus
Christ, but justify him, and applaud his mercy when you are sinking into hell.
Give testimony to the truth, and say, he has done much to save me, but he has
done nothing to damn me. He came into the world to save sinners; that was
indeed the end of his coming; but I, by my rebellion, and my obstinacy, and my
unbelief, have made him do that which he came not for, even to destroy me. It
was not Jesus Christ; no, it was my own perverseness and incredulity, that has
undone me, and everlastingly, and brought me to this place of torment.

etc. is chiefly for the good, etc. Then certainly they shall be saved, they
may rely and rest upon it as an unquestionable thing. Christ has received his
power and his authority for this end, his Father has bestowed it on him for
this end, that he may give eternal life to as many as God has given him; and
certainly they will not both be disappointed of their main intention; They will
not be crossed in that which is their great design. Its true, the carrying on,
and the accomplishment of the work of our salvation is a very hard business, it
meets with many difficulties, and with many oppositions. But Christ you see is
absolutely and completely furnished to go through with it, and to save us to
the utmost. If he were only vested with authority and power over the flesh
which he intends to save, it would fall short in this business: For there is
other flesh that would resist, and hinder their salvation. There is flesh
within them, and there is flesh without them, that would oppose this great
work. The people of the Lord Christ have all of them much flesh, and much
corruption in them. And there is much flesh without them, a multitude of wicked
and ungodly men. And both of these, this flesh within them, and this flesh
without them, are mighty obstacles, and great impediments to the great end
propounded in my text, the giving of eternal life to them. The flesh without
them, I mean the world and worldly men will seek to terrify them, or allure
them, or persuade them from the ways of God, and will deceive, if it were
possible, the very Elect. The flesh within them will close with that which is
without on all occasions, and labor to withdraw them from the living God. So
that, as I have said, if Christ were only vested with authority and power over
the flesh which he intends to save, it would fall short in this business. But
God you see has given him power over all ^^esh, that he may give eternal life
to as many as he has given him. Not only power over the flesh to which he
means to give eternal life, but power over all flesh, that he may give eternal
life to them. That other flesh may not resist and hinder him in this business.
And therefore let us cheer and comfort up our hearts in sweet assurance of
salvation, as many of us as belong to Christ. We are discouraged now and then
perhaps when we perceive how strong the flesh within us is, how mighty and how
violent, and how prevailing our corruptions are. We are afraid the wicked
world, the flesh without us, will overcome us in the end; either by honors and
preferments, or else by threats and persecutions, and so will hazard our
salvation. But here is our never failing comfort, Christ has power over all
flesh, that he may give us eternal life. He has power over the flesh within
us, he can subdue and master our corruptions when he pleases, he can pluck down
those strong holds. He has power over the flesh without us, he can overcome
the world, yea he has overcome the world. And therefore let us be of good
cheer, let us be confident we shall have eternal life at last; for God has
given him full power to this end, and to this purpose, that he may give it, and
that none may hinder it.

Is it so, that the authority of Jesus Christ with, etc. is chiefly, etc.

And thus far of the end of the authority of Jesus Christ; for which he is
invested with it by his Father, considered in the lump and in the gross.

Proceed we now to take it into parts. It is in general, as you have heard,
that he may be enabled to dispense to his people, that which is for their
everlasting welfare and salvation, that he may give eternal life to as many as
God has given him: Particularly we have here to be considered, First the thing
it self to be dispensed by virtue of this power and this authority of Jesus
Christ, and that is life, yea life eternal. Secondly the manner or the way of
dispensation, it is to be dispensed as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a
way of free donation, that he should give eternal life. Thirdly the objects of
this dispensation, or the persons to whom this life here mentioned is to be
dispensed, and that is not to all men, but to as many as the Father has
bestowed on Jesus Christ; As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he
should give eternal life to as many as thou have given him.

Begin we with the thing it self to be dispensed, by virtue of this power, and
this authority of Jesus Christ: And here let us take notice of the nature of
it, and of the adjunct of it. First of the nature of it, it is life: Then of
the adjunct of it, it is life eternal.

As for the first of these, my Brethren, you must know that naturally, and
originally we are all dead men. We are all dead born, we came into the world,
my Brethren, in a state of death and condemnation. And in this sad condition we
continue of our selves, we are not able to put life into our selves. No, we can
no more raise our selves to the life of grace, then a dead man can raise
himself to the life of nature. And therefore God, because he would have such a
number quickened as he has resolved upon, has given power to Jesus Christ to
this end, and to this purpose, that he may give life to those who of themselves
are utterly void of it, and no way able to attain it.

And that his mercy may be full, he has appointed him to give them such a life
as is incapable of dissolution. The life that Adam in the state of innocence
enjoyed, the life of righteousness; and the life of holiness, you know, was
perishable in it self, and so accordingly was left of God. His state in this
condition was mutable, and accordingly he fell from it, from a state of grace
and life, to a state of sin and death. But now God has invested Jesus Christ
with power to give his people such a life as shall be durable, as shall, in
this respect, transcend the life that Adam had, even in the state of innocence
it self; that he may give eternal life to as many as God has given him.

The points to be observed are two: First, They that are Christ's have life from
Christ; and secondly, The life which they have from him is eternal.

DOCTRINE. They that are Christ's, have life from Christ.
He gives life to as many as God has given him. The life which they enjoy,
they have from him, they have it not originally in themselves; he is the author
and the fountain of it. And therefore he is said to be a quickening Spirit, 1
Cor. 15.45. because he quickneth and enliveneth all his members. And he is
called our life very often in the Scripture, I am the way, the truth, and the
life, says our Savior of himself, John 14.6. When Christ who is our life,
says the Apostle, shall appear, then shall we appear with him in glory, Col.
3.4. When Christ who is our life, that is, the author, the efficient of our
life. And hence, says the Evangelist, he that has the Son, has life, 1 John
5.20.

This may serve to prove the point, They that are Christ's, have life from
Christ.

Now to open it a little before we come to application, there is a twofold
life which all Christ's people have from Christ, according to the twofold death
which they are under out of Christ. For as there is a twofold death in sin:
The death in sin with relation to the reign and dominion of it, the death in
sin with relation to the guilt and obligation of it to damnation: So on the
other side there is a twofold life of grace opposed to these, the life of
grace inherent, and the life of grace imputed. The life of holiness, and the
life of righteousness. The life of Sanctification, and the life of
Justification. And both of these, they that are Christ's, receive from him, he
gives his people both these.

First, Christ's people have from him the life of holiness, or the life of
Sanctification, which is opposed to the dominion and the reign of sin; before
they are revived by him, they are under this dominion, and so in that respect
are dead, as the Apostle Paul intimates to the Romans, Romans 6.12. ye are alive
to God, says he, through Jesus Christ our Lord. And what does he infer upon
it? Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies; by which he intimates expressly,
that while sin raigns in any man, so that he voluntarily resigns and yields
himself up to the rule and the dominion of it, as Subjects to their Sovereign
and anointed Prince, he is not alive to God; he is indeed a dead man, he has
no life of holiness or grace in him. But when the reign of sin is once
abolished and dissolved within him, so that he does no longer willingly obey it
in the lusts thereof, but yields up himself to God, then he is alive to God,
then he lives the life of God; the life of holiness and grace. And this life he
has from Christ; And therefore it is added presently, ye are alive to God
through Jesus Christ our Lord: And of this life it is that the Apostle speaks,
Gal. 2.20. and makes Christ the Fountain of it: I live, says he, that is, I
live the life of grace; and yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and this life
which I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved, etc.

Secondly, Christ's people have from him the life of righteousness, or the life
of Justification, which stands in opposition to the death in sin, with relation
to the guilt. While the guilt of sin remains upon a man, so long that person is
a dead man, so long he is dead in Law, as we express it commonly, he is bound
over to eternal death and condemnation. And thus it is with every man while he
continues in the state of nature. He is condemned to die, and so in that
respect is dead in the sentence of the Law: although the sentence be not
executed on him, as our Savior speaks John 3.18. He that believes not is
condemned already: But when a man is justified, absolved, and acquitted from
the guilt of all his sins, he is no longer dead in Law, but as a Malefactor
that is pardoned, his life is given him, as we use to say. And therefore it is
styled in Scripture the justification of life, because it brings life to the
person justified, viz. that life that is opposed to condemnation, the sentence
or the doom of death; For of that speaks the Apostle, Romans 5.18. the free gift
came upon all to justification of life. And this is made the gift of Christ,
and he is said to be the author and the fountain of this life, in that place.
As by the offense of one (that is of Adam) judgment came upon all men to
condemnation, so by the righteousness of one (that is of Christ the second
Adam) the free gift came upon all to justification of life.

Now is it so, my Brethren, that they that are Christ's have life from here then
examine in the first place, whether you be Christ's or no. If you belong to him
(I mean by real calling and incorporation) you have received life from him. You
hear he has received power from God the Father to this very end, that he may
give eternal life to as many as God has given him. And out of question he is
not unfaithful in the administration of this power and the discharge of this
trust. Well then, if you be his, he has given you this life, he has quickened
you, and raised you with himself, you are partakers of his resurrection. And
therefore I beseech you search a little whether it be thus with you or no.

It is a thing which may be known in some degree, if you be diligent; for the
Apostle knew that the Ephesians and the Romans were alive, that they were
quickened from the death of sin: And this he did by outward evidence and by the
signs of life which he observed in them. And we may much more know our own
Condition and estate in this respect if we be not very wanting to our selves.
And therefore prove your selves, my brethren, whether you have the life of
Christ in you, and you may do it by these symptoms following.

Old things are done away, all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5.17. He has new
thoughts and new affections, new pleasures and delights, studies, desires,
ends, purposes, companions and acquaintance; So that he is not now the same man
that he was before. When his old lusts, his old temptations, his old companions
and acquaintance come to call upon him, and think to find him as they did in
former times; he may answer them and say You are deceived, for I am altered, I
am another man, another creature, I am not in the temper nor of the disposition
that I was before.

Pet. 2.2. And have you quick and stirring appetites to this milk? do you as
new born babes desire it? do you thirst and long for it? do you hunger after
it, so that you cannot be content without it? is it pleasing to your palate,
delicious to your taste to feed upon? it is an evidence of life. But if there
be no stomach to this kind of food, if you be well content without it, if you
be never hungry, if you find no taste at all in the good word of God, but say
of this as Israel of the Manna once, Our souls loathes this light bread, there
is no weight, no substance in it, it is a sign you have not yet this light of
Christ in you.

of those other sorts of life. And so accordingly, they that have this life
from Christ, do live by higher principles, (I will not say then those of plants
or those of beasts, but, then those of men too; those who are merely men, and
no more; who are not holy, sanctified men.

Some men there are you know, who live like beasts, who melt away in sensual
and voluptuous pleasures and delights, who eat, and drink, and sleep, and lust,
and satisfy their lusts, and there is all. And therefore they are said in
Scripture to be brutish, because the brute part in them over-powers the
rational, because they live and walk by brutish principles, by the principles
of beasts. They do just as beasts do, and many of them worse too, as if they
were to have the same end that beasts have. And some of late have vented such
doctrine as if the souls of men did perish with their bodies, as the souls of
beasts do. Others there are who live like men indeed, but it is like mere men,
as the Apostle speaks of the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 3.3. Are ye not carnal, and
walk as men? They live at best no higher then the principles of reason carry
them, and that is but a litt e way. They bring them at the very utmost no
further then the young man which our Savior speaks of, to be not far from the
Kingdom of heaven, or not so far as many others are, but they can never bring
them home.

But they that have received life from Christ, my brethren, live by nobler and
diviner principles then these are, such as are full of light and beauty, such
as carry on the soul to supernatural and spiritual things, for the attaining
and enjoying of the highest good. They know what it is to live above the
principles of beasts, above the principles of men, they live by principles of
faith of spiritual men: which are far more above the principles of reason,
then the principles of reason are above the principles of sense.

Fourthly, if you have received life from Christ, you live to Christ; Cor.
5.15. All other men who have not this life in them, live to themselves, and not
to Christ; they have no higher end then self in all their actions; They make
themselves, their pleasures, or their profits, or their honors the scope and
center of their motions; Yea in the very holy and religious duties they
perform, they look no further then their own ends; And so in the performance of
them, they are but servants to their own Lusts.

But now they that have life from Christ, they live no longer to themselves;
no, they have nobler aims in all their ways; and while unsanctified men, who
live the life of nature only, do make themselves their end, even in their holy
and religious duties; the Saints who live the life of Christ, do make the Lord
their end, even in their ordinary, and their Common actions. In every thing his
glory is continually in their eye, even in their worldly and their secular
employments, while in these they do not seek their own things, but the things
that are of Jesus Christ.

Hezekiah did, The living, the living, they shall praise thee as we do this
day. And let us do as the Apostle did, Romans 7.25. who having, in the former
verse, cried out, Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this
body of death, had presently suggested to his thoughts that Christ had done it,
and then cries out, in a way of gratulation, as he had done before in a way of
lamentation, I thank my God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

John 17.2. That he should give eternal life.


DOCTRINE. The life which Jesus Christ bestows upon his people is eternal.
SO it is styled in my text: you see that he should give eternal life to as
many as God has given him. Such is the life which Christ gives: it is a
Lasting and enduring life, a life that is above the power of death, that is
incapable of dissolution. The life of nature as you know, and see my brethren,
is a perishable life. It is obnoxious to decay, it may be cut off in the
twinkling of an eye, and we are gone. But now this life of Christ, the life of
grace is the beginning of the life of glory, and therefore is an endless life,
as the Apostles phrase is, Heb. 7.16. And as the seed by which this life is
generated in a man, is incorruptible seed, as you may see, 1 Pet. 1.23. even so
the life it self which is generated by it, is incorruptible too. It may be said
of every Saint who has received life from Christ, and who is raised by him
from the death of sin, as it is said of Christ himself, Romans 6.9. Being raised
from the dead, he dies no more, death has no more dominion over him. He has
eternal life abiding in him as our Savior speaks, John 6.54. He does not say
that he shall have it, but that he has it in him, even in this present world,
a Life that is eternal and that is abiding in him.

So that the point is plain you see, The life which Jesus Christ bestows upon
his people, is eternal.

To clear it yet a little further to you, my beloved, no life can end in death,
or come to dissolution, and destruction, but one of these two ways, viz. either
by some inward principles of frailty in it self, or else by some outward force
that overcomes it, and prevails against it. If it be destroyed by death, it
must be either by a natural, or a violent death. Now the life of Jesus Christ
which he bestows upon his people, is utterly incapable of dissolution either
way, and consequently is an everlasting life, as I shall show you briefly and
in order.

First, the life which Jesus Christ bestows upon his people, has no David
speaks, Psalm. 33.9. And the Rivulets and streams are always of the self same
nature with the fountain. And consequently if the life that is in Christ, be
lasting and enduring, as it is, the life that is from Christ, is so too. If it
be not perishable in the spring, assuredly it is not perishable in the stream.
This life of grace, my brethren, is communicated and derived from Christ the
root, to us the branches, from him the head to us the members; and if it fail
not in the head, and in the root, how should it fail in the members and the
Branches. Indeed my brethren if the life of grace were radically and originally
in our selves, and from our selves, it must have principles of dissolution in
it. For what that is in us, and comes from us, can be eternal in its own
nature? But our life is in Christ, and comes from Christ, it is hid with Christ
in God, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Col. 3.4. and therefore certainly it is in
this respect like him from whom it comes. We stand not now upon our own
bottoms, as Adam did it in Paradise; no we are branches of such a Vine as never
withers, and we are members of such a head as never dies. So that undoubtedly,
the life of Jesus in us, although it be not privileged from abatements and
temptations, yet it has nothing in it that tends to utter dissolution.

Secondly, the life which Jesus Christ bestows upon his people, as it John 5.5.
This is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith.

The Devil is a far more subtle and pernicious adversary then the world, but
yet he cannot overthrow this life of grace, in any of the Saints. The gates of
Hell cannot so far prevail against them. The Serpent can but bruise the heel of
Christ, and those that appertain to Christ, he cannot touch the head or breast,
he cannot wound us in the vital parts, or take away our life from us.

The flesh is the worst enemy of all in this respect, because it is an inward
Enemy, and a mortal enemy. Either that must die or we, as the Apostle Paul
insinuates, Romans 8.13. But here is our Comfort now, the the flesh shall die, and
we shall live; Christ will destroy the flesh in us, and he will put the Spirit
into us, and maintain the Spirit in us. And by this Spirit we shall live, and
this life shall be eternal, We shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting, Gal.
6.8.

So that the point you see is fully cleared, The life which Jesus Christ
bestows, etc.

For first it has no inward principles of frailty in it self; And secondly
there is no outward force that can prevail against it to destroy it.

But here it may be you will interpose those words of the Apostle Jude, in the
12th. v. of his Epistle, where he speaks of some Revolters who were twice dead,
for that is his expression there; they are trees whose fruit withers, twice
dead plucked up by the roots. And how were they twice dead? They were not dead
at all in regard of their outward and natural life, for they were then alive,
and working mischief in the Church; and therefore out of question, his
intention must be this, First they were dead in trespasses and sins. Then for a
while in some respect or sense, they lived the life of Grace. And afterward
they died again, and so they were twice dead, and how then is the Doctrine
true, The life which Christ, etc.

For resolution of the Scruple, you must know my brethren, that a man may live
the life of grace, either in deed and truth, or else in show and appearance
only. The Church of Sardis lived in show, she had a name, that she was alive,
but she was dead, Rev. 3.1. There was but a name of life, she had a name that
she did live, but there was the reality of Death, she was dead. Now they that
live in name only, who have the show and the appearance of the life of Christ,
may die in show and in appearance too. And therefore the Apostle speaking
according to the common apprehension, and conceit of men, says they were twice
dead. Once indeed and really, before they gave so much as any outward evidence
of life. And then again in show, and in appearance, when they lost that life of
grace, which both to others and themselves they seemed to enjoy.

Now is it so, that the life which Jesus Christ, etc. This then should stay Job
with respect to his natural life, What is my strength that I should hope? What
grace have I, that I should hold out against such violent Encounters as these
are? How should I hope to live, when my life is thus assaulted with such fiery
darts without, with such distempers, noxious humors, and such lusts within? Oh
but remember, my beloved, Christ gives eternal life to his people, a life that
is not subject to destruction, either by inward weakness, or outward violence:
If ever once you have it from him, you can never lose it. He that once lives
the life of Christ, can never die, death has no more dominion over him.

Is it so, my brethren, that the life of, etc. This then may clear and Martha,
when she bewailed the loss of her dear brother Lazarus, John 11.26. Whosoever
lives and believes in me shall never die; He shall never die the death that
overthrows the life of Christ, the life of Grace; for so you must conceive him
there in that place; q. d. Lazarus is a believer, and therefore whatsoever thou
may apprehend, he is not dead. He is not dead in reference to that which is a
Christians life indeed; no true believer is capable of dying so; whosoever
lives and believes in me can never die.

It Is true my brethren, such may lose the life of nature, but that alas is but
an image, and a shadow and a show of life. The life of grace and holiness is
life indeed; he that lives in sin is dead while he lives; he that lives in
holiness is alive when he dies: and if the life of nature be not worth the name
of life, then certainly the death that overthrows no other but the life of
nature, deserves not the name of death. And hence the death of true believers,
which strips them only of the life which stands in union of the body and the
soul together, and not of that which stands in union of them both to Christ, is
styled a rest, a sleep, in Scripture, not a death. They only die indeed which
go down quick to hell as the prophet David speaks, who are cast into the lake
of fire and brimstone, which is the second death, who after many pangs and
tortures suffered in the separation of the body from the soul, are separated
everlastingly from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.

Is it so that the life which Jesus Christ, etc. Oh how does it concern eternal
life. The life of nature is a fading thing, it may be gone upon a sudden. And
it is a sad and dreadful thing for an eternal soul, to have nothing else
between it and eternal woe and torture but such a fickle and perishable life,
which the next minute may be done, and let him drop away to hell for ever. Oh
how suddenly may such perish, and come to a fearful End! but if we live the
life of Christ, that is a lasting and abiding life. And though the natural life
decay, and though the body die and rot, and turn to dust and putrefaction, yet
this will flourish and grow stronger still, till it be perfected and made
consummate in the life of glory. And why then are our labors and endeavors
wholly spent to nourish and maintain this transitory life, with things that
perish in the using, which yet when all is done will fail, and come to
dissolution, but never strive for the attainment of that life which is eternal?
It is a lamentable thing, my brethren, that the divine intentions of eternal
minds should be laid out on nothing else but perishable things. Now that you
may attain this lasting and enduring life of grace, I shall but give you two or
three directions.

viz. the light of saving knowledge from the son of God revealed and manifested
in the Gospel, was the life of men, John 1.4. And in the words immediately
adjoined to my text, that he may give eternal life, etc. and this is life
eternal that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
have sent. Its true indeed there may be light of knowledge without any life of
grace: But there can never be the life of grace without the light of holy
knowledge: And therefore the Apostle speaking of the Gentiles, says, they were
strangers from the life of God: they lived the life of men, but they were
strangers from the life of God, the life of grace, by reason of the ignorance
and darkness that was in them. And surely, if we ever look to rise up from our
graves of sin, and stand up from the dead, we must have light from Jesus
Christ, as the Apostle Paul insinuates, Ephesians. 5.11.

Whosoever lives and believes in me, says our Savior, Ioh. 11.26. (id est)
Whosoever lives by believing in me shall never die. He that believes in him
that sent me, has eternal life, says Christ, John 5.24. and shall not come to
condemnation, but is passed from death to life. These things are written that
ye might believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that believing ye
might have life, Joh. 20. ult. I live says the Apostle Paul, and yet, etc. and
the life which I live I live by the faith of the Son of God. So that the grace
of faith you see my brethren, is the instrument of life, it is the bond of
union between Christ and all his members, it is the Artery by which his Spirit
is conveyed into us. And therefore if you ever look to live, you must labor
after faith.

Thirdly, that you may attain to saving knowledge and to justifying John 5.25.
The hour comes, says Christ there, when the dead (the dead in sin) shall hear
the voice of the Son of God, (conceive it in the powerful preaching of the
Gospel) and they that hear it shall live. And hence the word of Christ is
called the word of life. You see then what you are to do; I say to you, my
Brethren, as the Prophet to the Jews, Isa. 55.3. Hear with an obedient ear, a
flexible and yielding heart, hear and your souls shall live.

And thus far of the thing to be dispensed by virtue of the power and the
authority of Jesus Christ with which he is invested by the Father; And this as
you have heard is life, yea it is Eternal life.

The manner or the way of dispensation comes next in order to be handled; it is
to be dispensed as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a way of free donation,
that he should give Eternal life.

Not that he should communicate it, or confer it only, but (...), that he
should give. So that you see, my Brethren, all is free both on the Fathers
side, and on the Sons. The Father he is free to him, that he may be free to
others. The Father gives him power, that he may give his people life. As thou
have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as
many as thou have given him.

There is no difficulty in the terms, the point is obvious.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ does freely give eternal life to his people: They
have it from him as a free gift.
He does not sell, they do not buy it, or if they do, it is as his own offer
is, without money, and without price. They have it from him out of bounty, and
not out of merit or desert: As a gift, and not a purchase; or if a purchase, as
his purchase, not their own. It is our Saviors own expression with reference
to his people, John 10.28. I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. And therefore it is
called a Gift; and Christ is made the next and the immediate Donor and
Dispencer of it, Romans 6.23. (...), The gift of God is eternal life, through
Jesus Christ our Lord. And the Antithesis between this latter and the former
parcel of the verse, is very much to be observed, as being pertinent to our
purpose. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life. As if
in other words our Apostle should have said, Its true indeed, Death is the
Consequent of sin, and life Eternal is the Consequent of holiness, and of
obedience. But mark it well, not upon the same terms. Death follows sin as the
deserved stipend, and the wages of it: A man earneth death by sin; as a
workman earns his wages by his labor. But life Eternal does not follow
holiness in such a way; it is not merited by our obedience, as death is by our
disobedience: and therefore this is a gratuity, a gift, though that be wages.
The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.

And in another place, our last translation speaks it a free gift, Romans 5.18.
The free gift came upon all men (all that are Christ's members, or upon all men
universally, if you respect the tender of it) the free gift came upon all men
to justification of life. With which accords that which goes immediately
before, they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of
righteousness, shall ragn in life by one, and that is Christ. I shall close up
the proofs with our Saviors proclamation, Apoc. 21.6. I am Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end, and I will give to him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely; if any be athirst, if he have vehement
and strong desires, he shall have life, and he shall have it from the fountain.
I will bestow it on him, and I will do it freely too. I will give him of the
water of life freely.

So that the point is plain you see, That Jesus Christ does freely give Eternal
life.

Now that you may the better see the freeness of this gift of his, and that it
is bestowed upon his people without the least desert of theirs, I shall lay it
open to you in a few particulars; Jesus Christ must needs be free in giving
life to his members, because on their parts, it is first unbought, and secondly
unsought, nay thirdly unthought. They do not purchase it, or buy it of him; nay
nor so much as seek it or desire it of him; nay nor so much as think of having
such a mercy from him: And therefore it must needs be absolutely free in all
respects, it must come from him as a free gift.

Psalmist speaks. And how much less then are we able to redeem our spiritual
life, which is infinitely precious, when we are under the Condemnatory sentence
of the Law, when we are dead in trespasses and sin, both with relation to the
reign and to the guilt, when we are subject every moment to be cast into the
lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death; what can we
give now to obtain our pardon? we cannot purchase it; and therefore certainly we
have it freely.

Indeed Christ buys a pardon for us, because we cannot buy it for our selves.
He gives his blood and life for us, that he may give life to us. And therefore
he is called our life, to show that he is all in all in that business. And when
we first receive his quickening grace, we are described to be in such a case,
that there is nothing upon our parts to procure it, as you may see, Ezekiel. 16.5,
6. Cast out into the open fields, to the loathing of our persons, polluted, in
our own blood, and weltering in our own gore. And then, yea then he gives life
to us. It is repeated twice in that place, as a remarkable and choice thing,
that we may take especial notice of it. I said unto thee when thou wast in thy
blood live, yea I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live. As if he
should have thus expressed himself, Observe it well, I gave thee life at such a
time when there was nothing in thee to deserve it at my hands, when one would
even have loathed to touch thee, or to meedle with thee: when thou had
nothing else but blood and gore to give me, then did I breath this life into
thee; So that you see Christ freely gives this life to his people, in this
respect, that it is by them unbought.

And as it is by them unbought, so it is by them unsought.

As they do not purchase it and buy it of him, so neither do they seek it, or
desire it of him. As they do not pay for it, so neither do they pray for it. We
count a thing is very free, if we have it for the asking. If it be but ask and
have, its a very cheap bargain. The life of Christ is yet more free then this
comes to: to all his members he gives it them before they ask it. He is found
in this respect of them that seek him not, and ask not for him; as the Prophet
speaks, Isa. 65.1. It is the disposition of us all by nature, we will not come
to Christ, that we may have life from him, as he himself complains, John
5.40. and therefore he is fain to draw us. Did Lazarus when he lay dead and
stinking in his grave, address himself to Christ, beseeching him to raise him
up? No more do any that are dead in sin No, Christ is fain to seek them out, to
come to the grave himself, and there to call them to come forth, and to put
life into them, that they may answer that call; he is forced to do all. Did the
lost sheep seek the Shepherd? Did the lost groat seek the Owner? When Adam
being falen had brought himself into a state of death and condemnation, did he
seek God, or did God seek him? Did he call God, or did God call him? You see
the offer was on Gods part, not on his. And so if Christ should leave us in a
state of death, till we sue to him for life, we should die eternally. But he
preventeth us with mercy, and with loving kindness. And he commands the
blessing, even life for evermore, as the Prophet David speaks, Psalm. 133.3.
They do not beg it and entreat it, but he commands it. So that you see Christ
freely gives this life to his people, in this respect, that it is by them
unsought.

And as it is by them unbought and unsought, so it is by them unthought.

They are so far from seeking it, that they do not once so much as think upon
it. It comes not once into their heads that they are dead in trespasses and
sins; That there is life in Jesus Christ; that he is ready to bestow it, and to
give it out to lost creatures. When he breaths this life of grace into any of
his people, it is as much unthought of to them, as Saul's Crown was to him, when
he sought his Fathers Asses. What can a dead man plod and study of a
resurrection? Does he lie in his grave expecting when he shall be quickened,
and looking when he shall be raised up? What did the Disciples think of their
Conversion till Christ called them? Matthew was in the midst of his Extortion,
Peter was busy at his trade, when Christ inspired the quickening life of grace
into them. Little did either of them think that life and mercy was so near to
them. And thus he deals in this respect with all his people. So that which way
soever we consider it or look upon it, Jesus Christ does freely give Eternal
life to his people, they have it from him, etc.

Jesus Christ does freely give, etc.

This then may be a great encouragement for every one of us to come to Jesus
Christ for life. It is confessed that he has enough in him; but yet if he were
loath to spare it, if he did very hardly part from it, if he did not give but
sell it, and sell it at a dear rate, it could not but exceeingly dishearten
those that want it, and have no means to get it, nor any thing to give for it.
But now consider for your comfort and support, that Jesus Christ is appointed
by his Father, and inclined of himself to give Eternal life to his people. He
does not deal with it as a commodity which he means to gain by, but as a favor
which he is willing graciously to bestow upon a company of lost creatures. He
stands and cries, He every one that thirsts, come and drink of the water of
life freely; I ask you not a penny for it, come and buy without money and
without price; Now I beseech you, my Beloved, set your hearts to this business;
consider seriously what you have to do; I say to you as Jacob to his sons, when
they were about to starve, when they were about to die with famine, Genesis 42.1.
Why do you look one upon another? Why do you die and perish in your sins, when
there is life enough in Jesus Christ, and where it is so easily to be obtained
from him?

Oh you will say, we are unworthy to have life from Christ; who are we that
Christ should look upon such dead dogs as we are! Ah, but remember he does not
bargain for it, he does not sell it, but bestows it freely. He gives it out to
those sometimes who least deserve it, he looks for nothing in, or from you, but
the receiving of it at his hands. Why then will you stand off when he calls?
Why will you refuse life when Christ offers, and when he offers it so freely?
Why will you give the Lord of life occasion to complain, as John 5.40. You will
not come to me that you may have life, you will not come when you may have it
for the fetching.

Why you will say, perhaps, you cannot come; True, I confess you cannot in your
natural estate; but yet the greatest matter is, you will not come. And this
appears, because you do not many of you what you can, and what is in your power
to do. You do not wait upon the word of life, the word by which he works life
in his people, but shamefully neglect it many of you, when the word is nigh
you, when it is just without your doors. Christ speaks in life unto the souls
of men, the words that he speaks are life, as it is hiw own expression, and you
will not hearken to them that your souls may live, John 6.63. you do not yield
your selves up to the operation of the words of Christ. When he begins to stir
you, you resist the work of it. When it begins to quicken you, and raise you
up, you close your eyes, and lie down in your graves of sin again. Now, I
beseech you, Brethren, when you feel a little stirring, a little quickening by
the word, O let this word of life have a perfect work upon you. When life is
offered in the Gospel, do not put it from you, and judge your selves unworthy
of Eternal life, least Christ say to you in displeasure, Nay, if you will not
live, then die for me, and die for ever. And if you will not rise out of your
graves, there lie, and rott, and stink for me, till you be raised to receive
your last doom, and to be cast into the Lake that burns with fire and
brimstone, which is the second death.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ does freely give, etc. This then may serve us

First, if Jesus Christ give it, he himself will not withdraw it, but continue
Ioh. 10.10. I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it
more abundantly. If they have a little more, they shall not have less, but
more. Christ gives his people the fountain of life, Apoc. 21.6. not the stream
only, but the fountain too. The stream may fail, but the fountain cannot fail.
At least the stream might fail, but that it is continually fed and nourished by
the fountain.

Secondly, if Christ give his people life, as he himself will not withdraw I
give my sheep eternal life, says Christ, John 10.28. and what follows? Why as
I give it, so I will maintain it too; I will make good this gift of mine,
against the greatest opposition. And therefore it is added presently, and they
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

Is it so, that Christ Jesus does freely give, etc. the greater thankfulness

John 17.2. To as many as thou have given him.


AND thus far of the thing it self to be dispensed by virtue of the power and
the authority of Jesus Christ with which he is invested by his Father, and that
is life, yea, it is Eternal life. As also of the manner or the way of
dispensation, it is to be dispensed as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a
way of free donation, That he should give eternal life.

The objects of this dispensation, or the persons to whom this life here
mentioned is to be dispensed, comes now in order to be handled, and they are
such, only such, and all such, as God the Father has bestowed on Jesus Christ,
that he should give eternal life to as many as thou have given him. My text you
see is still upon a strain of giving, God gives the Son power, that the Son may
give life to those whom God gives him; to as many as God has given him.

I do not hear that Jesus Christ has power to give Eternal life to all the
world, to all men, but only to a certain, pitched, selected Company of men. And
they my brethren, are so far from being all, that they are not said expressly to
be many, but as many, and they may be no great number. That he should give
Eternal life to as many as God has given him, who are comparatively, but a
few. Many are called indeed, but few are chosen, and consequently few are
saved. They are not many then, if you compare them with the rest that are not
made partakers of this glorious privilege to have life from Jesus Christ, but
yet they are as many as God has given him.

So the persons are described who are to have this life from Christ, not by
their own internal quality or disposition, not by their own external action,
but by the act of of God upon them, or concerning them, his giving them to
Jesus Christ. Let them be what they will in all considerations and respects
besides, it matters not in this regard; of what Nation, or of what condition,
or of what station, or of what disposition, or of what conversation, if God
have given them to Jesus Christ, they shall in his appointed time have life
from him:

But then we must distinguish of the Fathers giving to the Son. The Father
gives men to his Son Christ, either for outward ministration, or else for
inward Union and incorporation; either to be his servants, or to be his members.

In the first sense Judas himself was given to the Lord Christ to be his
Minister, and his Apostle, as Christ himself acknowledges expressedly to his
Father in the 12th. verse of this very Chapter. Those whom thou gave me I
have kept, says he, and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition. Now
they who in this sense are given to the Lord Christ, to be his Ministers and
servants only, not his members, have not eternal life from him, as is apparent
from the former instance. Judas was given to him so, and yet he was a lost
Creature, yea, he is styled in the fore-alledged place the Son of perdition.
None of them whom thou gave me is lost, but the son of perdition. One of them
was lost then, though there were but one lost. The Father gave him to the Son,
and he lost him. And therefore he, Judas I mean, though he were given him, had
not eternal life from him.

But now there are another sort, whom God the Father gives to Jesus Christ for
inward union, and incorparation, whom he bestows upon him to be members of his
body, and they must needs have life from him, or else how shall they be his
members? If there be union with him, there must be animation from him. As many
as are given thus to Christ, shall certainly be quickened by him, he has
received authority and power for this End. As thou have given him power over
all flesh, that he should give Eternal life to as many as thou have given him.

You see the meaning of the words: the points suggested here are two. First
there are a certain company of men, whom God the Father, in a special manner
gives to Jesus Christ. And secondly, That Jesus Christ has power to give
eternal life to such and all such as are bestowed upon him by his Father, but
he has no power at all to give this life to any other. At this time of the
first of these.

DOCTRINE. There are a certain company of men whom God the father in a special
manner gives to Jesus Christ.
Some have this privilege above the rest of lost mankind, that God the Father
gives them to his son Christ: and gives them to him in a special manner, as I
showed you even now, not to be his servants only, but his members too. He
bestows them upon Christ to be his own peculiar people. And this is clearly
intimated in that profession of our Savior, John 6.39. this is my Fathers
will, says he, that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing. The
thing admitted there is clear by this, that some are given him by his Father,
and given him so that they are not to be lost. And consequently, in another way
then Judas was, who was bestowed on Christ as you have heard, and yet he was
the son of Perdition. So, in the 37. verse he has the same. Expression, where
he speaks of all those whom his Father gives him. And on this ground it is that
Jesus Christ lays claim to such viz. by virtue of donation from his Father:
Here am I, and the children which thou have given me. Thine they were says
Jesus Christ, John 17.6. Mark that Expression, Thine they were, as who should
says, Now they are thine no longer. They have been thine, I must acknowledge,
but now the property in some respect is altered, they are no longer thine, but
mine. Why, which way came you by them? might the Father say. The Son replies,
by thy own free gift. Thine they were, and thou gave them to me.

So that you see there are a company of men whom God the Father gives to Jesus
Christ.

And further yet, They are a certain company of men: they are just thus many,
not a person more or less, That he should give eternal life to as many as God
has given him, so that the number of them is precisely and exactly known to
God: he knows how many there be of them to a man. He has determined
absolutely, and unalterably with himself, that Christ shall have such a number,
so many millions, or the like. And he has also peremptorily resolved, that
such particular and individual persons known to him from everlasting, shall
make up the number. Whom he fore-knew, them did he predestinate, says the
Apostle, Romans 8.29. Those very men and no others. And hence our savior speaks
of such as if he knew them every one by name. I pray for them. I pray not for
the world, but for them whom thou have given me, John 17.9. So that our Savior
Christ distinguishes, you see, he knows who are his own by free donation of his
Father, and for them he prays. He knows who are not given up to him, but
continue in the world and of the world, and for them he prays not.

The point is plain you see, and needs no further confirmation. There are a
certain company of men, etc.

Heb. 10.5, When he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering
thou would not, but a body have thou prepared me, not only a Natural but a
Mystical body.

Well then, you see, my brethren, how the matter comes about; Christ must have
some to be a body and to be a people to him, or wherefore did he take our flesh
upon him, why did he come into the world? As man and Mediator he has none
originally of his own. And therefore God the Father gives him some. There are a
people for thee, says the Father, thou shall have such and such, and such, I
give them freely to thee that thou may give Eternal life to them. So many
thou shall have among the Jews: and if that be not sufficient, thou shall have
as many more as thou will ask among the Gentiles, Psalm 2.7. Ask of me and I
will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance. And hence our Savior
speaking of his people acknowledges they were his Fathers first, and that they
came to him by his gift. Thine they were; They were thine, though the case be
altered now, for thine are mine, as you may see, John 17.10.

Now is it so, my brethren, that there is a certain company of men, etc. Then
in the first place here is matter of astonishment, that God the Father should
bestow upon his Son such a gift as this: that he should have no better thing to
give him then a Company of poor wretched lost creatures, That Jesus Christ
should accept of such a gift as this is: truly, my brethren, there is so much
wonder in it, that it is able to amaze the man that thinks upon it. Why, who
are we, that God the Father should think us fit to be made over by a deed of
gift to Jesus Christ? What worth is there in us that we should be so much as
thought upon for such a purpose? As if Christ stood in need of us, as if we
might be an addition and advantage to him any way. Whence is it that our
Savior should receive us at his Fathers hands? that he should have the least
regard to such poor inconsiderable stuff as we are, so far as to accept of us?
has he not got a great purchase?

And yet the Father seems to value us so far that Jesus Christ is fain so ask
us too, before he have us: Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy
own possession, otherwise I will not. And Christ is very well content to stoop
to this, to beg us a special boon of God the Father, to become a Suitor to
him, that he may have such and such to be his people. Good Father give me such
a man or such a woman: I reckon not of others: take them who will for me: but
these I am desirous of, and therefore I beseech thee to bestow them on me. And
having gotten us, he seems to glory in us, and to be so tender of us, as if we
were some rich purchase, as if we were of very great use to him, as you may see
in this Chapter all along. Sometimes he shows the Father what a high esteem he
has of those whom he has given him: how carefully he teaches them, and
shows them all his Fathers name, how tenderly he keeps them, how dearly he
affects them, and how his heart is set upon them. Sometimes he beggs his Father
for them to preserve them, to sanctify them, to make the world know that he
loves them, even as he loves Jesus Christ himself, to make them one among
themselves, and one with him; to bring them to the same place where Christ is,
as if he could not live in Heaven without them. Ah, my beloved, did we follow
on this mercy, as far as we could reach it in our thoughts, we should at length
(finding no end or bottom in it) cry out as the Apostle, Oh the depth of the
riches etc.

Are there a certain company of men whom God the Father gives to Jesus

John 6.37. all that the Father gives to me, shall come to me. Let them be
never so unwilling of themselves by nature, let them be never so entangled in
the snare of Satan, so mightily withheld by him, yet however they shall come.
But what if Christ should not receive them when they come? then they may perish
notwithstanding. Yes, if the Father give them, and cause them thereupon to
come, Christ will certainly receive them, All that the Father gives me shall
come to me. And what follows? And him that comes to me, I will in no wise cast
out.

John 6.39. This is the Fathers will, says he, That of all which he has given
me, I should lose nothing. And he came down into this Lower world, to do the
will of him that sent him, as he professes very often; and therefore certainly
he will be careful of this special charge of his, he will observe it very
strictly. He will be infinitely wary that he lose not any of his Fathers things
which he has given him to keep. So that if we be given to the Lord Christ,
however of our selves we are apt to fall away, we may resolve that he will have
us, and keep as unto life eternal.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ as Mediator has power to give eternal life to
such and all such as are bestowed upon him by his Father, but he has no power
at all to give this life to any other.
The point holds forth both the extent, and limitation of the authority of
Jesus Christ, in this respect. The former is expressly mentioned, the latter is
apparently insinuated in my text.

First you have here expressly mentioned the extent of the authority that he may
give Eternal life to as many as God has given him. Be they as many as they
will, be they more, or be they less, he has power to quicken them, to raise
them from the death of sin to the life of grace and glory. This he can do de
facto, as he is God, and this he may do de jure, as he is God and man, as he is
Mediator, to as many as are bestowed upon him by his Father.

And then we have apparently suggested too, the limitation of the authority of
Jesus Christ in this respect: For when it is affirmed here that Christ has
power to give Eternal life to as many as God has given him, it is employed that
he can give it to no more. There are the bounds of his authority, the restraint
of his Commission; So far it reaches, and no further. I shall endeavor to
evince and clear them both in order.

First Jesus Christ as Mediator, has power to give eternal life to such, Joh.
10.10. I am come that they might have life. They, Who? why, his sheep, as he
explains it, both before and after. I am the door of the sheep. I am come that
they may have life: and at the 27th. verse, My sheep hear my voice, and I give
unto them Eternal life. But how comes Christ by these sheep? Why by his Fathers
own gift. And therefore it is added in the very next words, My Father which
gave them me, is greater then all. So that it is as if our Savior Christ had
said, I am come down into the world to give life to the sheep my Father has
bestowed upon me. To all them, and no others. The Father loves the Son, says
John the Baptist, and has given all things into his hand, John 3.35. You must
conceive it, all things of one sort he has bestowed upon him, so that he has
put them into his hand, to honor them, to keep them, and preserve them, all
his elect and chosen people. For all things of another sort, he has (as the
Apostle speaks) put under his feet, to shame them, and to ruin, and destroy
them. But what does Jesus Christ with those his Father gives him in the former
way? Why he bestows eternal life upon them, as it is added in the following
words, He that believes on the Son, (as they do all, and only they whom God
the Father gives him, as before) has everlasting life.

This shall suffice in brief for confirmation of the former member of the
point, That Jesus Christ has power to give eternal life to all such as are
bestowed upon him by his Father. The second follows; He has no power at all to
give this life to any other. It is not in the power of Jesus Christ as Mediator
to save a man who is not given him by his Father. If he have not bequeathed
them over to the Lord Christ, it is beyond the reach of his authority as
Mediator to infuse this life into them. The execution of his power in this
regard, you see, is confined to such only. As thou have given him power over
all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many, and but as many as God
has given him. Thou shall call his name Jesus says the Angel unto Joseph,
Mat. 1.21. for he shall save his people from their sins. Those whom his Father
gives him for a people by Election those he is designed to save, and no others.
Our Savior Christ, as he is man is not to choose whom he will quicken to the
life of Grace and Glory, (For if he had been free in this regard, there is no
doubt he would have pitched upon his own Contrymen, his own Allies, his own
Kindred before others; whereas, as the Evangelist observes, he came to his own,
among them he began his Ministry, and his own received him not) but he must
take such as his Father chooses, and gives him to be quickened by him. Those
whom his Father gives him, only those and all those, he must keep and raise up
and give them everlasting life, as you may see, John 6.39.40.

So that you see as Mediator Christ has no power to give Eternal life to any
but those who are bestowed upon him by his Father.

Isa. 42.1. Behold my servant whom I uphold. And servants are to do their
Masters will, and not their own. No doubt the will of Jesus Christ as he was
man, would have carried him to save those whom his Father and himself as God
had appointed to destruction. But he must stood in this to the will of him that
sent him; he must be satisfied with those his Father has appointed for him to
become a people to him. It is to be considered that the Father having called
him Servant, speaks of him so as one that would in every thing be ordered by
him, Mat. 12.18. which is indeed a Parallel of that in Isa. 42.1. Behold my
servant whom I have chosen (speaking of our Savior Christ) he shall show
judgment to the Gentiles, he shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any hear
his voice in the street. A bruised read shall he not break, and smoking flax
he shall not quench. This and this he shall do, and this he shall not do, says
God the Father; he is my servant, and I will order him at my pleasure: And so
our Savior Christ himself professes upon all occasions, that he will be
obedient to his Father, and that he can do nothing otherwise then he will have
him. And hence it is that he can quicken none but those that are bestowed upon
him by his Father to be quickened by him.

It is not that he has not power as he is God to quicken whom he will, as his
own Expression is, John 5.21. In this respect he is equal to his Father. For
as the Father raises up the dead, and quickneth them, so the Son quickneth
whom he will. It Is act that he has not in himself enough of merit, or enough
of Spirit to raise up all the people in the world, to the life of grace and
glory. It is not that his grace is not sufficient to subdue and overcome the
greatest obstinacy and rebellion in the hearts and wills of men, the most
extreme indisposition: though they be as dry tones, yet he can gather them
together, and make them to stand up and live: but it is because as Mediator he
is a servant to the Father, and must do his Fathers will, and he will have him
give this life to none but those whom he makes over to him by a deed of gift to
be his members, whom he elects in him, as the Expression is, Ephesians. 1.4. Our
Savior puts all this together, in that place so often cited, John 6.37, 38.
All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and I will raise them up, and
give them everlasting life, as afterward, all them, and only them. And why so?
For I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him that
sent me: My own will, as I am man, would carry me to give life to a greater
number, but I am come to do my Fathers will, and not my own. And therefore I
must be content with those whom he is pleased to allot to me, to quicken them,
and make them living members of my body mystical, and no others. And this for
clearing of the observation. Proceed we to the Application, according to the
branches of the point in order.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ has power to give eternal life to all that are
This then may serve to comfort us, at least to keep our hearts from sinking
with reference to those who yet are dead in trespasses and sins. It may be some
of them are near us in the flesh, they are our parents, or they are our
Children, or they are our kindred and acquaintance: they are it may be in our
beds, and in our bosoms, and when we look on such dead souls, our bowels even
turn within us, we pity them, and melt upon them. They have been in their
graves so long, and Christ has called so long upon them in the preaching of
the Gospel, and yet they come not forth to this day. There have so many
powerful and effectual means been used in vain, that we are out of hope of
them, and this even breaks our very hearts with sorrow. Why my beloved, it may
be they belong to Jesus Christ in the eternal Counsel and decree of God; they
are bestowed upon him by the Father in election, though yet they are not given
to him by real union, and incorporation. And if they appertain to Jesus Christ,
though they be never so untoward and indisposed and averse, depend upon it, he
has power to give Eternal life to them; I say to every one of you, my
brethren, that has such a wife, or such a husband, or such a child, or such a
friend, as Christ to Martha, when he had told her that he was the resurrection
and the life, that he could raise up any man, though he were dead, and make him
live, John 11.26. Believe thou this? It may be you will say, as she: Alas, my
Brother, or my Father, or my Child has been dead so many days, so many years,
he has laid buried in his grave of sin a long while, so that by this time he
stinketh. Why yet believe that Jesus Christ can raise him up, and make him live
the life of grace and glory. He has received power to give eternal life to all
that are bestowed upon him. If they belong to that number, be they as dead as
it is possible for men to be, and as averse from being quickened, the power of
Jesus Christ shall master them, and overcome them, and raise them up out of
their graves of sin: that you shall say with admiration, See what Jesus Christ
can do upon a poor dead Creature! And therefore when you look upon such souls
as those, and seem to have the question put you that the Prophet had, when he
saw the dry bones, Ezekiel. 37.3. Can these dead souls live? do you give the same
answer, O Lord God thou know. If they belong to Jesus Christ, he has power
enough to raise them, and he will surely do it in his own time.

Is it so that Jesus Christ has power to give eternal life to all that, etc.
This then should teach us two things. First, Not to be lifted up upon the
contemplation of our high condition; and Secondly, Not to be cast down upon the
contemplation of our low condition in the world. You see the men who are to
have this life from Christ, are not described to be of such a quality, of such
a station or condition, but only to be given to him by the Father. So that let
them be what they will, in all considerations and respects besides, if God have
given them to Christ, they shall assuredly have life from him. He has received
power for this End, that he should give, etc. So that it matters not in this
respect whether we be high, or low, rich or poor, bond or free, we are not any
whit the nearer to the life of Christ, my brethren, for the one, nor any whit
the further from it for the other.

least degree; and therefore certainly there is no cause at all why they should
be so magnified, and admired as they are. If outward wealth and pomp, or
dignity did further us: if outward baseness did hinder us in this business, how
is it that the base things of this world and things that are despised are
chosen? and that the poor in purse as well as spirit, do receive the word of
life? when yet not many mighty, not many noble in the world are called, 1 Cor.
1.25. If outward wisdom, learning, policy did further, or weakness or
unlearnedness did hinder us in point of having life from Christ, how is it that
the weak and foolish things are chosen many times, and that the Law of God
gives understanding to the simple, that the unlearned rise, and take the
kingdom as it were by force, that is, with earnestness and with affection: when
yet not many wise, not many learned men are called? Why are we so exalted upon
these outward privileges and preferments in the world? What is it that you
stand upon? What, that which will promote or further you to life Eternal? Alas
they are of no avail in this respect. All these prerogatives with which men
swell even till they burst again, are such as they may carry with them into
Hell.

Let us not be cast down upon the contemplation of our low condition in the
world. You that are simple, poor and mean, that have not any outward thing to
glory in, no wealth, no parts, no honor, or preferment any way: be not
dejected and disheartened; for as external privileges and advancements are of
no avail to further you, so outward means and abasure is of no avail to hinder
you from receiving life from Christ. He gives it to as many as God has given
him, let them be of what condition or estate they will. There is no other thing
required in this respect, but that they be bestowed upon him by the Father. And
he bestows upon him poor and weak men many times: yea, most times. And
therefore be not out of heart; for had thou all the wealth and honor in the
world, thou were not any whit the nearer to this life of Christ, nor art thou
any whit the further from it by thy low condition: That will be no impediment,
but that he may give thee life; the life of grace in this world, and the life
of glory in the world to come.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ has no authority to give Eternal life to any but
those who are bestowed upon him by his Father? They are mistaken then, who he
should give Eternal life to as many as he has given him, and not to a man
more. This he has given him authority and power to do: further then this his
Commission does not reach. So that it is not in the power of Jesus Christ to
quicken all and save all, it is apparent that he cannot do it. Indeed as God he
can do all things but those that are impossible; Either absolutely being such
as are not to be done; or else impossible upon condition, by reason of a
contrary Decree, by which he has confined-himself. But as man and Mediator, he
can do no more then God will have him, he can save no more then God has given
him, and put into his hands to save. And therefore you shall find it in his
story, that as man he was extremely troubled at the unbelief and hardness of
the peoples hearts. He wept over Jerusalem with many tears: Why, you will say,
perhaps what needed this? he might have wrought upon them, and put the life of
Grace into them. No my Beloved, he could not work on many of them; he could not
raise them to the life of Grace, they were not given him by his Father, and yet
as man he pitied and lamented their condition, as we should do in such a case,
he being in all things like unto us, sin only excepted. And this methinks
should melt the hearts of Reprobates themselves to Christ, and make them to
relent toward him. Alas, he pitties you, and mourns over you, his very bowels
yearn toward you, He delights not in your ruin and destruction; No, it is
troublesome and grievous to him. But why then does he not relieve and help us,
you will say? Why, if you be not given him by the Father, it is not in his
power to do it. Its said indeed that he gives life unto the world, as it is in
his own expression, John 6.33. But that is but in opposition to the Jews; not
to the Jews alone, but to the world, to men of all conditions, and of all
Nations in the world. But to the world in general he does not, nay, he cannot
give it. So that the fault is not in him, if any of you perish, and that you
have not life from him; you see he is confined and bound up by his Father to a
certain number, to give this life, but to as many as the Father gives him.

JOHN 17.3. And this is Life Eternal.


AND thus we have at length dispatched the End for which our Savior is
invested with so large and ample Power over all flesh; That he may give Eternal
Life to as many as God has given him.

But what is Eternal Life? what is there comprehended under that expression? As
when our Savior once discoursed of Truth, he had this question put to him,
what is Truth? So having spoken here of Life Eternal; if any of you now should
put the question, what is life Eternal? you have the resolution in the
following verse which I am now to enter on, And this is life Eternal, if you
desire to understand it, this it is, to know the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom he has sent. So that these words you see are an (...), an
Explication of that which is delivered in the former verse, in which our
Savior shows expressly what he intends by Eternal Life, and wherein it
consists, in the Knowledge of the Father and the Son, or of the Father in the
Son.

And here I shall take notice only of these two Particulars, viz. the thing
explained, and the way of Explication. The thing explained is life Eternal. As
for the way of Explication, he does not show you quare sit, why this life
Eternal is, he does not open and unfold it by the Causes of it; I say he does
not here, though he does in other places, but he shows you quid sit, what this
Eternal life is. This says he, is Life, Eternal life. This is it; what is it?
why, it consists you see in holy Knowledge, which is set forth both by the Act
and Object of it. The Act, that they might know. The Object of it, God the
Father, the only true God, and Christ the Son, Jesus Christ whom thou have
sent. This is life Eternal, that they might know thee, etc.

What then? Does there go nothing else to life Eternal but the knowledge of the
Father and the Son? Does it consist in this, and this only? This is a scruple
that is very variously resolved by those that write upon the Text. Some think
that knowledge here is put for faith, by which we live the life of Grace, which
is Eternal, as the Apostle speaks, The life which I live, I live by the faith
of the Son of God. And so it is, as if our Savior Christ had said, this is
Eternal life, so to know as to believe in thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou have sent.

Others conceive that life Eternal here imports nothing else but the way to
Eternal life, the ready path that leads to it: And that our Savior shows us
here how he brings those to life Eternal, who are bestowed upon him by his
Father, viz. by giving them the saving Knowledge of his Father and himself;
That he should give Eternal life to as many as thou have given him. And this is
life Eternal, this is the way to it, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.

As far as I can apprehend, the scruple might be cleared best by a distinction.
Eternal life is either Inchoate, or consummate.

Eternal life Consummate consists especially in the complete and perfect
knowledge of God, which Schoolmen all Beatifical vision. And hence our Savior
Christ himself sets forth our happiness, of which we shall be made partakers in
the world to come, by this, that there we shall see God. Mat. 5.8. Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God, that is, we shall know God, as
knowledge ordinarily is set forth by the sense of seeing in the Scripture. Yea,
we shall know him clearly and distinctly, we shall see him face to face. And
this is that which the Apostle makes the main of the Beatitude and glory
prepared for the Saints at the time of Christ's appearing, 1 John 3.2. We shall
see him as he is: now we see him as we can, then we shall see him as he is: we
shall know him as we are known, viz. of God, 1 Cor. 13.12. We shall know God,
even as God knows us. As we are known of God distinctly, clearly, perfectly, so
we shall know God. He knows us perfectly according to his nature now, and we
shall know him perfectly according to our nature then, as far as our created
nature is capable of. So we shall know as we are known: for as there is a note
of Similitude and not of Equality. And this shall be our happiness in Heaven,
and our glorious life there, that we shall see the very face of God, and not
his back parts only as we have done in this world. That we shall have him fully
and completely. So that this is Eternal life (you see) consummate in the
Heavens, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent.

But as I take it, the life Eternal mentioned in my Text, is that of which the
Saints are made partakers in this present life, and which our Savior gives
them here in this world. As in another place he tells us, My sheep hear my
voice (says he) and I give unto them Eternal life. He does not say, I will
give them Eternal life hereafter, but I give it them for present, and therefore
it is added in the words immediately annexed, neither shall any man pluck them
out of my hands, John 10.27, 28. And this I do, this Eternal life I give them,
by teaching and instructing them, and making them to hear my voice: as who
should say, by working knowledge in them, My sheep hear my voice, and by this
means I give unto them Eternal life. And this Expression in my Text looks much
the same way. As thou have given him power ever all flesh, that he should give
Eternal life to as many as thou have given him. And this is life Eternal to
know thee the true God, and so on.

This is the way to give them life Eternal, by making them to know thee. And
this I have begun to do already, as he adds afterward, I have made known thy
Name (that is) thy Nature and thy Attributes to the men which thou have given
me. So that this life Eternal here is not, or not so much that which is perfect
and Consummate in the Heavens, as that which is begun in this world, and which
the Saints are made partakers of while they are here: for even here they have
Eternal life abiding in them. And this, this inchoate Eternal life consists
especially in saving knowledge. This is Eternal life, this is it in the
beginning, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have
sent. So that the Point to be observed is this;

DOCTRINE. That Life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eternal, is begun
in holy Knowledge.
Christ gives Eternal life to us at least in the beginning of it, when (as the
Prophet of his Church) he teaches us, and causes us to know his Father and
himself. When he makes known his Fathers Name, and his own Name to us, he
causes us to pass from death to life. In him was life (says the Evangelist,) 1
John 4. and the life was the light of men.

This Life communicated to the sons of men, was the Light of saving knowledge
which he made to shine into them. He gave them life, in that he gave them light
and knowledge, who were before in darkness, and so by Consequence in the shadow
of death, as the Scripture phrase is. And hence says the Apostle, Awake and
rise up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee Light, Ephesians. 5.14. Indeed, as
long as we are ignorant and in the dark, we are all dead men, we know not what
the life of God means: And therefore the Apostle speaking of the Gentiles,
says, That they were strangers from the life of God. They live the life of men
indeed, but they were strangers from the life of God, the life of Grace, by
reason of the Ignorance and blindness that was in them, Ephesians. 4 18. The Grace of
God is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, says
the Apostle, 2 Timothy 1.10. who has abolished death. But how has he done this?
by bringing life and Immortality to light; as it is added in the next words, by
bringing life and ^^^ortality. The latter as I take it, is the Explication of
the former. q. d. by bringing such a Life as is immortal, as is above the power
of Death, as the life of Grace is; By bringing this to men, by shining on them
with the bright and glorious light and luster of the Gospel: I might be very
copious here, but this may satisfy to clear the Point, That life Eternal, etc.

And this appears further diverse ways.

It will appear that life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eternal, is
woman being deceived was in the transgression; as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Timothy 2.14. She fell into it by a mere cheat. And how are men continued in this
state of sin and death? They are corrupt according to deceitful lusts, Ephesians. 4,
22. Look as their lusts deceive them more or less, so are they more or less
corrupt. And therefore they that sit in darkness, are said to fit in the shadow
of death. And which way then shall life Eternal be begun in men, but by
dispelling this darkness by the light of holy Knowledge, and by translating men
out of the power of darkness, as the Expression is, Col. 1.14. Out of ignorance
and darkness which has such a power upon them to hold them under sin and
death, and to keep them still in a condition of estrangement from the life of
God, as the Apostle Paul insinuates in the cited place, Ephesians. 4.18. If it be
ignorance that keeps men from the life of Grace, then surely it is holy
Knowledge that begins it, and that brings men to it.

It will appear that the life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eternal,
our Life very often in the Scripture. And he is said to give it in the words
which I have finished, that he should give Eternal life. And which way does he
give it to his people, but by working knowledge in them? And therefore it is
added in my Text, This is Eternal life (this is the life which he gives) to
know thee the true God. Indeed he gives it to us as a Prophet; he purchases and
gets it for us I acknowledge, as a Priest, by his Invaluable satisfaction. But
he begets and works it in us, by his effectual Teaching and instruction as a
Prophet: And therefore he is said to speak in life to his people, John 6.63.
The words that I speak unto you, they are Life. To show us that he quickens us
in a way of Information; for to what End does speaking tend, but to make us
understand? Thou have the words of eternal life, says Peter to our Savior
Christ, John 6.68. That is, the words that work life; and which way can they
work it, but by conveying knowledge to the mind of him that hears them? So that
you see that Jesus Christ is the Efficient Cause of the life of Grace in his
people, by teaching them, by working saving knowledge in them, by turning them
from darkness to light. He gets it for them as a Priest, He gives it to them as
a King, He works it in them as a Prophet.

It will appear that life Eternal is begun in holy Knowledge, Because the word
of Life, Phil. 2.16. holding forth the word of Life, that is the Gospel and the
Ministry of life, 2 Cor. 3.7. in opposition to the Law, which is the Ministry
of death and condemnation. And which way does the Gospel work life, but by
instilling knowledge into men, by making them to understand that which they
never knew before, that they are naturally dead in trespasses and sins, that
they are in a state of death and condemnation, that there is life enough in
Jesus Christ, that he is ready to dispense and give it out to all that come to
him for it? And so convincing them that it is necessary for them to go to him
that they may have Life; Till they come to know this there is no life of Grace
in them. And it is by Gospel-Teaching that this life is infused into them.

It will appear unto you that the life of Grace is begun in holy Knowledge,
transformed, or to be changed from the state or life of nature to the state or
life of Grace, by the renewing of the mind, Romans 12.2. No doubt the will and
members are renewed too, for the change is universal. But there the work begins
my Brethren, in the mind and understanding, we are renewed first in the spirit
of the mind, Ephesians. 4.23. and from that it goes on to the inferior faculties,
and to the outward conversation. And consequently it begins in knowledge, of
which the mind is capable, which is the proper object of it. And therefore
says our Savior, sanctify them with thy Truth, Renew them, make them holy,
work the life of Grace in them by revealing Truth to them.

New man is renewed in Knowledge, Col. 3.10. why so it is in Faith, and Love,
and other graces. But it is first renewed in knowledge, there is the rise and
the original of all. And even as in the first, the old Creation, the Lord began
with natural Light, Gen, 1.3. so in the second or the New Creation, he begins
with spiritual Light, with supernatural and saving Knowledge; and gives us
other graces by this means. To which effect is the Apostles prayer, 2 Pet. 1.2,
3. Grace be multiplied upon you through the knowledge of God: and after more
expressly to our purpose, As he has given us all things that pertain to life
and godliness, through the knowledge of him. So that we have this Life, the
life of holiness and grace, through knowledge; without it we have no Grace, but
with it all Grace. It is the seed from whence all other graces grow; it is the
means by which they are begotten in the soul. Holy Knowledge will bring forth
heavenly Affections and desires. If a man know God, and know Christ, his will
shall close with him, and his affections shall be carried out to him: it will
effectually restrain a man from sin and reform the Conversation. They shall not
hurt, neither destroy in all my holy Mountain says the Lord, Isa. 11.9. And
why so? for the earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord. If you have
been taught by him, as the Truth is in Jesus, why then you will put off the old
man. It will draw a man to practice and obedience, if it be sound and saving
Knowledge; as holy David intimates in that request of his, Psalm 119.34. Give
me understanding, says he, And what then? why, I shall keep thy Law, yea, I
shall observe it with my whole heart. So that you see, all holiness and Grace
is brought into the soul by Knowledge: and therefore certainly the life of
Grace begins in it.

For this is life Eternal to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he
has sent. We all of us do make a very great account even of our temporary
Lives, which yet when all is done must perish and decay, and come to nothing;
we are ready to Redeem them, if there be no other way, with the loss of all
things else. Though yet even then when all is done, we know we can enjoy them
but a few years, and are not certain to enjoy them one hour. How is it then
that we despise and undervalue holy Knowledge in which Eternal life consists,
which if we can attain, we have Eternal life abiding in us, a life which is
above the power of death and dissolution: Alas, how miserably is it slighted by
the greater part of men, yea by the greater part of Christians! Christians I
mean, in name and in profession. Though it be offered them, they will not take
it, but say in effect to God, Depart from us, for we will not have the
knowledge of thy ways. When light is tendered them, they even shut their eyes
against it that they may not see. So that it may be said of such, as God
complains of some in Israel: their eyes have they closed, lest they should see
with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and be converted, and be
healed. And the Apostle Peter's charge must needs fall home upon them, they are
wilfully ignorant. They enjoy the means of Knowledge, but they will not wait
upon them, they take no care at all to profit by them. They need not to ascend
up into heaven to bring Christ down from above, nor to descend into the deep,
to bring up Christ again from the dead, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 10.6. that
they may be acquainted with him; the word is nigh them, as it is added there in
that place. The Word that manifests and reveals God and Christ, is nigh to
them. They need not to go far to hear it, and to hear of God in it. But many
will not spend an hour, they will not step without their doors to meet with
God, and to be acquainted with him: as if the Knowledge of the Lord were worth
nothing, as if it were of no value; Ah, my Beloved, do you know what it is that
you despise, and set at naught in this fashion? Is life worth any thing? Is
life Eternal worth any thing? Why in contemning Knowledge, you contemn no less
then this; for this, as you have heard, is life Eternal. And how deservedly may
you be left to perish in Eternal Death, who put the means of knowiedge from
you, and judge your selves unworthy of Eternal life!

Is it so, that life Eternal, or the life of Grace, which is Eternal, is begun
the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent. They are absolutely
dead, the life of holiness and Grace is not yet begun in them; They have not
yet the least Degree, the least spark of this life: No they are strangers to
the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, in the place so often
cited. They are so far from being quickened to this life of Grace, that they
are mere strangers to it. They know not what this kind of life means; And are
there not a multitude of such among us, who are almost as ignorant of God and
Christ as the very beasts that perish? Who besides some common names and
notions of God, and of a Jesus and Savior, and the like, which it may be they
can talk a little of, because they hear them every day, know nothing of the
one, or of the other: Examine them and sift them well, and you shall find that
rhey have nothing but a form of words at utmost, of which they can give no more
account then if they were some strange Language. And are not these men in a sad
case? Truly my Brethren, they are but walking Ghosts, and ghastly shadows, they
have no true life in them, no not so much as the beginning of it, for life
Eternal is begun in Knowledge.

I know it is a Common fancy, that if a man profess the true Religion, if he
have been baptized, and come to the Assemblies, and hear and pray as others do,
he is in a good Condition; but be assured of this, if he be ignorant of God and
Jesus Christ whom he has sent, he is no better then a dead man. It is a
cooling word my Brethren, and that which one would think should astonish and
amaze you; Suppose a Messenger should come to any of you from them that have
the power of life and death, and with a serious and composed look should tell
him that he is a dead man, how would it strike him to the heart? how would his
color come and go? how would the powers of his soul tremble? Now we are
Messengers dispatched from him who has the Keys of Hell and Death, to tell
you who are ignorant of God and Christ, that you are in a state of death and
condemnation, and that you are in danger every hour of being cast into the lake
that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second Death. It may be you
will take no notice of it, but chase away the meditation of it from your
thoughts. You will (as many do) delude your selves with this conceit, that
though you die in this condition, yet God notwithstanding will be merciful to
you. But as you tender the salvation of your precious souls, I beseech you to
observe that Gods own Word is peremptory and express for this. That none that
is devoid of knowledge, and continues so, shall have any share in the mercy of
God, or in the glory of the world to come. Oh continue thy loving kindness to
them that know thee, (to them and none but them,) says David, Psalm 36.10. It
is a people of no understanding, says the Prophet of the Jews, Isa. 27.11. And
what follows? Therefore he that made them will not have mercy upon them. It is
the common apprehension of the vulgar sort that he that made them cannot choose
but save them too. No, says the Prophet there, if they be grossly ignorant,
Then God that made them will have no mercy upon them. They have not known my
ways, says God, unto whom I swore in my wrath, that they should never enter
into my rest. The time is coming when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendering vengeance unto them
that know not God. And therefore I beseech you do not slight it, but lay it
seriously to heart, while yet the pardon may be gotten, while the condemnatory
sentence which the Law has put against you, may be yet revoked.

And this is life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he
has sent. Though this as I have showed you, be not all that goes to life
Eternal, yet this is the beginning of it; and therefore if you mean to live
Eternally, this is the first thing that you are to do, this is the first step
that you are to make. Till saving knowledge be attained in some degree, the
soul continues in a state of death; as soon as this comes once into the soul,
Eternal life comes in with it. The Exhortation of the Wise man seems to go far,
Prove. 2 4. Seek for knowledge as for silver, and search for her as for hidden
treasure. But we must go a great deal further, seek for it as for life, yea as
for Eternal Life; Struggle for knowledge as it were for life and death.

But you will ask me, which way shall we come to know God, and know Christ? To
this I answer, that you cannot know him by innate and inbred light, by any
self-ability, let it be what it will, it is incompetent and insufficient to
reveal God to you: though much of him be manifested in the Book of the
Creation, his Wisdom, his eternal power and Godhead, and though there be (...)
something to be known of God as the Apostle speaks, by studying in this Book,
you cannot know him savingly by this means. No, neither can you know him so by
studying in the Book of Scriptures neither, though there he be revealed more
fully then he is in the book of Creatures, unless some other help go with it;
Nay more then so, you cannot know him fully and completely any way by any means
in this life. As he is in himself, he is not to be known of any but himself.
And hence t^^ Scripture tells us, that no man has seen God at any time, John
1.18. It is very full you see, no man at any time But though he does not, yet
he may. No, says the Apostle Paul, 1 Timothy 6.16. He dwells in light that no man
can approach unto, whom no man has seen, nor can see. Indeed we see him darkly
here, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 13.12. And therefore this is called the
seeing of the back-parts of the Lord. As when we see the back-parts of a man,
we know him but by guess only, we know him not so perfectly and distinctly as
when we come to see his face. Such a sight of God is that which we attain in
this life. And however it may seem by some expression in the Scripture, that
God has fully manifested and made known himself to some here, as to Jacob,
Genesis 32.30. and to Moses, Number. 12.8. To him will I speak (says God) by vision,
not in darkness, and he shall see the similitude of God. This must be
understood comparatively of the Lords more clear and full revealing of himself
to Jacob, and to Moses, then to other men. But as for perfect light and
knowledge of the Lord, my Brethren, this was not imparted, neither to Jacob,
nor to Moses. Thou shall not see my face, says God to Moses, Exodus 33.10. That
is, the fullness of my glory: for none shall see my face and live.

But which way may we come to know him, so far as he is to be known in this
life?

Truly there is but one way of coming to the knowledge of him, and way is Jesus
Christ. No man has seen God at any time, says the Evangelist, Ioh. 1.18. What
then, is he not to be seen, not to be known at all, by any means? Yes, though
he be not to be seen or known immediately in himself, yet mediately in and by
the Son he may be known; for he has manifested and revealed him to us. No man
has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the
Father, he has declared him. And therefore when our Savior was Incarnate, it
is said, that God was manifested in the flesh, 1 Timothy 3.16. In which respect it
is, that when Philip was so earnest to have the Father shown him, our Savior
bids him to behold himself, and adds presently, he that has seen me, has
seen the Father also. Indeed it was the business of our Savior Christ into
this Lower world, to bring God down to us, that we might be acquainted with
him: And therefore if you do indeed desire to know him, go to Christ, and use
his help in this business. If you ever see God, and have that knowledge of him,
which is life Eternal, you must have light from Jesus Christ to see him by. I
am the light of the world, says he, Ioh 8.12. without me there is no light in
all the world, none but that which comes from me, and which I am the Fountain
of. He that follows me shall have the light of Life, that is the light which is
life. And therefore if you would have this light follow Jesus Christ for it,
and follow him three ways, or in the use especially of three Means: follow him
in a Gospel-Ordinance, a Gospel grace, a Gospel-duty.

shines, that he gives out the light, by which he shows his Father to his
people. Its true indeed that Moses showed him in the Law as a Judge and an
Avenger. But it is Jesus Christ that shows him in the Gospel as a Father and a
Savior. He is not manifest in a saving way anywhere but in the Gospel. The
Knowledge of him as he is discovered there, and none but that is life eternal.
And therefore wait on that discovery, if you mean to live for ever; where there
is any Gospel-preaching, say Christ shows his Father there, and follow him,
that so you may have life by this means. I say as Solomon, Prove. 4.13. Take
fast hold of Instruction, keep her, for she is thy life.

see God, and know God; as by it we believe the Revelations and Discoveries
that are made of God, which other men may read and hear, and yet because they
have no faith to give belief and credit to them, they get no sight, no
knowledge of the Lord by them. It is by faith that we see him who is invisible,
as the expression is, Heb. 11.27. There are some things that must be first
believed before they can be fully understood: if you believe them not, you can
never understand them. And hence says the Apostle in the third ver. of the
forecited Chapter, by says we understand the world to be created by the word
of God. A man would think he would have said, by faith we credit and believe
it, and not by faith we understand it. But the Creation is a thing that is
above Philosophy: and therefore is not to be fully understood, unless it be
believed first. It is our faith that helps us to the perfect Knowledge of it,
and so by faith we see and know God, because by faith we give assent to the
discoveries that are made of God in Scripture; and having once believed them,
we come to see and understand the nature of the Lord in them. We see the Lord
in his All-mightiness, his All Sufficiency, his Omni-presence, etc. which a man
that has not faith can never do: we bring him near us, by believing his
Immensity, and that he fills all places, (as he is said to do in Scripture)
we look upon him now as just by us, and so we have a clear and distinct sight
of him.

Philip does, John 14.9. Show us the Father: we cannot see him of our selves,
Lord show him to thy poor servants. If Christ withdraw himself and step away,
go after him, follow him, and you shall have the light of Life. If he stop his
ears against you, cry the louder, as the Direction is, Prove. 2.3. Cry after
Knowledge, lift up your voice for Understanding: and what then? Then shall you
understand the fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.

Is it so that life Eternal, etc. If then you desire to save men from Eternal
you shall save a soul from death, yea from Eternal death you shall bring it to
Eternal life.

JOHN 17.3. That they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, etc.


AND thus far of the thing Explained, and that as you have heard, is life
Eternal, together with the way of Explication: our Savior shows not quare sit,
but quid sit, what this life Eternal is? This says he is life Eternal, that
they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.
So that as you have heard, it consists in holy Knowledge.

Proceed we now to look a little more particularly and distinctly on the
Knowledge in which Eternal life consists, as it is here described by the Object
of it, God and Christ, Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have
sent.

So that here is a double Object of the Knowledge mentioned, and each of them
is set forth by a Title and an Attribute. The Title of the former God, the
Attribute the true God, yea, the only true God. The Title of the latter Jesus
Christ, the Attribute whom God has sent. Thee the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom thou have sent.

And here the first thing that I shall observe, is, the communication of this
double Object of the Knowledge wherein Eternal life consists, God and Christ.
You see my Brethren, they are closely knit together by the conjunctive particle
And, to show us that they may not be divided in this great business. That it is
not sufficient to salvation to believe in God, unless we believe in Christ to.
To know God, unless we know Christ too. Our Savior says not, this is life
Eternal to know the only true God; no, he does not stop there. The knowledge
which proceeds no further, will never bring a man to life Eternal. There is
another Object of this saving Knowledge, which must with all be jointly
apprehended by us if we mean to live for ever, and that is Jesus Christ whom
God has sent. And then my Brethren, if we take them both together, we are
right, It is impossible that we should perish. This is life Eternal, to know
thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. Not thee alone,
but thee and Christ. So that the Point to be observed is this;

DOCTRINE. The Knowledge which is life Eternal, in which Eternal life consists,
is the Knowledge both of God and Christ too, not of the former only, but the
latter also.
You see my Brethren, both of them are jointly made the Object of it in my
Text. So that the Knowledge which neglects either of them, is in-sufficient
to salvation. If it stay and rest on God, and go not on to Jesus Christ, it
will never reach home. This only, this is life Eternal, to know God and Jesus
Christ, not divided, but together.

Ier. 10.25. Yea, more then so, the ignorant among the heathen who were
deprived of the means (though not of all, yet) of the saving Knowledge of him:
and yet as you may see the Prophet prays, Pour out thy fury upon the heathen
that know thee not. Indeed, the men that have their understandings darkened by
reason of their ignorance of God, whether they have means or none, are
alienated from the life of God, Ephesians. 4.18. They do not live the life of Grace
in this world, nor shall they live the life of Glory in the world to come. And
the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, rendering
vengeance unto them that know not God, 2 These. 1.7. So that without the
knowledge of him, there is no escaping everlasting wrath and vengeance. There
is no possibility of coming to enjoy him, unless we be acquainted with him. Nec
cum potes aut amare quem nescias, aut habere quem non amaveris: thou can not
love him whom thou know not, nor have him whom thou love not.

Nay, let me go a little further, that Knowledge of the Lord, and only that, is
life Eternal, which brings forth obedience to him. You may see this evident
in both the parts of godliness, both in eschewing evil, and in doing good. As
for the first, hear what the Lord himself says, Job 28.28. The fear of the
Lord, that is Wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding. To know him so
to fear him, to fear to disobey him and to sin against him: this only is the
right Knowledge. As for the other part of godliness, which consists in doing
good, see that of the Prophet David, Psalm 111.10. A good understanding have
they that do his Commandments. They only understand and know the Lord
effectually and savingly, that obey the will of God. Others may have
understanding, but it is no good understanding. That alone is good and right,
which makes a man to do his Commandments: and this the Lord himself observes of
the knowledge of Josiah, Ier. 22.16. He judged the cause of the poor and needy,
was not this to know me says the Lord? q.d. This was knowledge to the purpose,
this was true and real knowledge of the Lord, which made him strict and
careful in the practice of his duty. And therefore because this is life
Eternal, God has bound himself by Covenant to give them whom he means to save,
such a knowledge of himself. His Covenant is to give them Understanding; see
the abridgement of it, Ier. 31.34. They shall all know me, says God there. But
how shall they know God? Why, they shall know him so as to serve him and obey
him. And therefore it is said before, I will put my Law in their inward parts,
and write it in their hearts. They shall not have it only in their minds to
know it, but in their hearts to practice and obey it, And so they shall all
know me. So that you see the Knowledge which is saving, in which Eternal life
consists, has God for the object of it.

Secondly, but though it have him for the Object of it, it has him Peter
presses those whose salvation he desires, that they would grow in the knowledge
of the Savior Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 3.18. And the Apostle Paul desires God in
behalf of the Ephesians, that he would give them the spirit of wisdom and
Revelation in the knowledge of him, that is, of Christ Jesus. Indeed, this is
the great thing that we must desire to know, if we mean to live for ever. And
therefore Christ is made sometimes the only Object of a Christians knowledge,
as if there were no other knowledge necessary to that great End. When Christ
ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto men, says the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.8. and
what was the intent and aim of those gifts? Why, to bring men to the knowledge
of the Son of God. God is not mentioned there, but the Son of God only. And the
Apostle Paul taught the Corinthians nothing else but Christ, and yet his aim
was that they might be saved. I determined to know nothing among you, says he,
1 Cor. 2.2. that is, I resolved so to manage and carry the course of my
Ministry, as if I knew nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified. And in the
same respect it is, that he prefers the knowledge of Christ before all other
things, yea before all other knowledge, as being of the greatest use, Phil.
3.8. He does not only say that it is good, but that it is Excellent, beyond
compare there is an excellency in it. Yea doubtless; I esteem all things but
loss for the excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: yea life it
self but loss, (for that you see is not excepted) in regard of that Knowledge
which brings us to life Eternal. And hence it was, that though he spoke with
Tongues more then they all, though he abounded and excelled in all sorts of
Learning, yet he gloried in nothing but in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ, Gal. 6.4. as intimating that especially to be considerable in the main
business, to make him everlastingly and truly happy.

But why is not the knowledge of the only true God sufficient of it self to
life Eternal, unless we also know Jesus Christ whom he has sent? Let us see
the reasons of it.

Adam did in the state of Innocence. And which way should we come to life
Eternal by such a knowledge as this is? If we look that God should save us upon
this account, that he has made us, we are upon a wrong ground. Indeed, did we
continue in the state in which he made us, he would be sure to save us too.
Could we serve him and obey him so absolutely and exactly as Adam could and
did, while he remained in his first Integrity, I must acknowledge then it were
enough to life Eternal to know him too in such a way as Adam did in that state;
there were no other knowledge of him necessary to make us everlastingly and
truly happy. But we are lost you know in the Creation, there we are dead and
gone, and theretore it is necessary now to know the Lord under another Notion,
if we mean to live for ever, viz. as a Repairer of the ruins of decayed and
lost mankind; as a healer of the Natures, and a Forgiver of the sins of his
people. And thus we cannot know him out of Christ, and so by Consequence,
unless we know Christ too. The old and the first frame and Fabric of salvation
was over-thrown and over-turned by the fall. And if we mean to build it up
again, we must begin upon another ground, a new Foundation; God was the only
Object of Fundamental knowledge then. Christ is at the least the next and the
mediate Object of fundamental knowledge now. You know my Brethren, that
confession of the Apostle Peter, Mat. 16.16. Thou art Christ the Son of God, is
made by Jesus Christ himself, the Rock on which the Church is founded. And
other Foundation no man can lay, says the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians,
Ephesians. 1.3, 11. that is, no other sound and solid Foundation then that which is
said, which is Jesus Christ. Its true, the same Apostle elsewhere speaks of the
foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Ephesians. 2.20. That is the Foundation
which the Prophets and Apostles laid, not making them the matter of it, but the
layers of it; for so you must conceive his meaning in that Text, You are built
on the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, that is, on the fundamental
Doctrine which the Prophets and Apostles teach, of which foundation Jesus
Christ himself, although he be not all, yet he is the chief Cornerstone. The
Knowledge of God was the chief point in Adams foundation. The knowledge of
Christ is the chief point in our foundation. Christ was not there at all as
Mediator, but here he is in the first and chief place. There are other
Cornerstones that rest upon him, but he, and he alone is the chief Cornerstone
on which all the rest are set, and who supporteth all the building. And
therefore he that fails of knowing him, must needs fail of life Eternal.

Secondly, the Knowledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unless Adam left
us, un repaired and un-renewed, we are enemies to God, God is an enemy to us.
And if we know him out of Christ, either we know him not aright, or else we
know him on such terms as these are; Christ is the only Mediator betvveen God
and man. He came down into the World, to take up all the breaches and the
differences betvveen his Father and his people, and to make peace by the blood
of his Cross. And how should Christ make peace for us, unless we know him,
unless we be acquainted with him? unless we put our matter into his hands. So
that if we know Christ, we may know God as a friend, in, and by, and through
Christ. We may look upon him then as Reconciled to us, as pacified and appeased
toward us. But if we know not Christ at all, we cannot know God otherwise
then as an Enemy, and as a Judge, and an Avenger: and whether such a knowledge
of him can be life Eternal, judge you?

Thirdly, Knowledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unless Adam, we
lost him there, and all the right we had in him; and which way comes he to be
ours again? but by a new, a second Covenant which he makes, the former being
broken and dissolved. I entered into Covenant with thee, and thou becamest
mine, says the Lord to his people, Ezech. 16.8. And is not Christ the
Foundation of the Covenant? Is it not made with him in Christ? Is not the
condition of the Covenant, Faith in Christ? Mark what the Apostle says, Gal.
3.16. The Covenant was not made to seeds, as many, but to seed, as one; that
is, to Christ in aggregato, comprizing all his members with him. It was not
made immediately to us; no, it was made immediately to Christ our Head, and in
and through him to us his members. So that the Lord is not in Covenant with us,
he is not ours, we have no Title to him but in Christ. And hence the Interest
of Christ in God is made the rise and ground of ours, I ascend to my God and
your God, says Jesus Christ to his Disciples, John 20.17. First mine, and then
yours. God is our Master but in Christ; He is his first and chief servant, and
we are his servants in him. God is our Father, but in Christ; he is his first
begotten Son, and we are his sons in him. So that if we know Christ, there is a
possibility that we may know the Lord as our God. But if we know not Christ at
all, how can we know God in him? We may know him as a God, as Adam did between
the fall and the renewing of the Covenant, but such a one as we shall fly
from, and as we can by no means close withal, because we look upon him now as
none of ours, as one in whom we have no Interest at all. And certainly Eternal
life cannot consist in such a Knowledge of the Lord as this is.

Fourthly, Knowledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unless we know
Christ too; because unless we know Christ, as we know God without Interest, so
we know him without Faith; I mean without saving faith, if we know God without
Christ; we may believe in God without Christ: we may believe in him as he is
Omnipotent, and All-mighty, and Eternal, and the like. But such a faith as this
will never justify us in the present. Life, nor save us in the life to come.
Even Turks, and Jews, and Arrians boast of faith in God, you know; and yet
because they appehend not Jesus Christ, they catch at nothing but a shadow; and
miserably lose their own souls. He that denies, and so by consequence believes
not in the Son, can never have the Father, as you may see 1 John 2.28. But he
that has the Son, has the Father also. Well then, if we will so believe in
God as to come to life Eternal, we must believe in him through Christ. Such
trust have we through Christ in God, says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 3.4. And this we
cannot do unless we know not God only, but Jesus Christ whom he has sent. For
distinct explicit Knowledge is absolutely necessary to the being of Faith: and
perfect Ignorance in any point whatever it be, destroys all faith in that
particular. And hence is the Apostles question, How shall they believe in him,
of whom they have not heard? and consequently whom they have not known. So that
if we know not Christ, we cannot believe in him, we cannot believe in God with
a justifying faith. And he that believes not is condemned already: such a
person is in a state of death and condemnation. But if we know both God and
Christ too, and so as to believe in God through Christ; Eternal life consists
in this Knowledge. This is life Eternal, to know the only true God, etc.

Now is it so, my Brethren, that the Knowledge which is life Eternal, in which
Eternal life consists, is the Knowledge both of God and Christ too?

Then in the first place, we may here behold the dangerous estate of Heathen
Nations, who know not Jesus Christ, nor can they any way (in the condition
they are in) attain to this Knowledge. How should they come to life Eternal, if
this be life Eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom he has
sent? Its true, that even they have means to know God, as the Apostle shows and
proves, Romans 1.19, 20. That which may be known (conceive it, that which may be
naturally known) of God, is manifest in them, that is the Heathen, for God has
even showed it to them. For the Invisible things of him, from the Creation of
the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which he has made,
even his eternal power and Godhead. So that there is an Image and Resemblance
of him stamped upon the Creatures: there are apparent Characters and
footsteps, and Impressions of the Godhead, of his Power, and of his Wisdom
set upon the things that he has made, which may be looked upon by every eye.
How does his Glory shine and glister in the Rare and admirable structure of the
World, the glorious frame of Heaven and Earth? And hence it is that David
says, the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament shows his
handiwork, Psalm 19.1. Indeed, he tells us afterward, the Law of the Lord is
perfect: the Word of God, and that alone is a perfect, a complete and perfect
help to bring us to the knowledge of God; but yet there is some declaration of
him in the Creatures; the Heavens declare the glory of God; And the means the
Heathens have, the creatures Catechize them and instruct them in the Knowledge
of God, as Job shows, Job 12.7, Ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee,
the fowls of the heavens and they shall tell thee, or speak to the earth and it
shall teach thee, and the fishes of the Sea shall declare to thee; who knows
not in all these, that the hand of the Lord has wrought this? and therefore
the Apostle tells us, that even they the heathen know God as you may see, Romans
1.21.

But now they have no means to know Christ, and this is life Eternal to know
both, both God and Christ too. So that in this respect they are cut off from
life Eternal, which is a very sad case. This Knowledge is not written in the
Creature-book, and they have not the Scripture-book, and how then should they
come to it? Its true that God is written in the Creature-book as I showed you
even now, but not a word of Christ there. Not a word I mean as Man and Mediator
of the Church; as he is Christ whom God has sent. He did not make the World as
man, and so by Consequence as Man he is not represented in the Book of the
Creation; God is written in the heart, but not a word of Christ there. The Law
is written in the heart by nature, but there are no Impressions of the Gospel,
which is the Word of Christ, as the Apostles phrase is, Col. 3.16. And hence it
is, that all the Nations that dwell upon the face of the earth have groped
after God, and found him too, as you may see, Acts 17.27. All people have
acknowledged him. Let a man run from East to West, from North to South: let him
ransack all Ages, and where he finds any men, there he shall find some
Worship, or Religion, by which they all acknowledge that there is a God. And
though they differ in the manner of their Worship, they all agree in this, that
there is a Deity that must be Worshipped. Within these hundred years you know
my Brethren, there have been many Nations discovered, and many are discovered
still, which were unknown in former Ages. Among them many have been found to
live without Law, King, house, going naked, and wandering in the open field,
yet none without some species of Religion, and some notice of a God, which
shows us evidently, that it is not so natural a thing in man to love Society,
to cover and to cloth himself against the injuries of weather (which yet is
very natural) as to acknowledge God.

But now my Brethren, among which of all these Nations who never had the book
of Scriptures, shall you find any notice of a Christ, any inckling of a Savior
or Redeemer? No, no, there is no hint of that among them, they have no glimpse,
no crevice to give them any light of Jesus Christ. And how then can they come
to life Eternal, since it consists in the knowledge both of God and Christ
too? not of the former only, but the latter also. And therefore we have cause
to pity them and bleed over them, and to importune God for them, that the
Gospel may be preached where Christ as yet has not been so much as named: that
to the people that are yet in darkness there may shine a great light. That as
they have some intimations of a God, they may know Christ too, and so may come
to live for ever; for this is life Eternal, etc.

Is it so my Brethren, that the knowledge which is life Eternal, etc. is the
Knowledge both of God and Christ too? Then let the Ministers, and the
Ambassadors of Jesus Christ be hence advised, as they desire to save themselves
and them that hear them, to bring their Hearers to Eternal life, so to instruct
them and to bring them on-ward in the Knowledge not of God alone but of Jesus
Christ too. Let it be their special labor and endeavor to acquaint them with
the things of Jesus Christ, and to implant his Knowledge in their hearts, which
is as I have showed so necessary to salvation. Paul was a very good Preacher,
and see what was the special subject of his Ministry, Col. 1.26, 27. says the
Apostle there, the riches of the Glory of this Mystery, viz. the Gospel is
Christ in you the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man, and
teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in
Christ Jesus. Out of Christ we can never make them perfect and accomplished to
salvation; the knowledge of the Father will not serve the turn, and therefore
we preach Christ to them, that in and through him they may be perfect. And
though the same Apostle did so excel in knowledge, that he durst without vain
glory, compare with the very chiefest Apostles, as you may see, 2 Cor. 11.5,
6. Though I be rude in speech, says he, yet not in knowledge, but we have been
thoroughly made manifest to you in all things, q. d. There was no point of
knowledge in Religion needful for you to be instructed in, no difficult and
thorny case of Conscience, that any of you had occasion to propound to me, but
I was able fully and clearly to resolve you in; yea though he had received such
abundance of Revelation from the Lord, that he was in great danger to be
exalted above reason, as he himself acknowledges, 1 Cor. 12.7. yet he professes
notwithstanding that he made no account of all his other Learning in comparison
of this, to know Jesus Christ and him crucified. This was the whole scope and
drift of his Ministry, 2 Cor. 2.2. This was the high point of Learning that he
gloried in. This was the Knowledge that he labored in his preaching to bring
the Corinthians to. And this he did advisedly, and upon mature Judgment; (...)
I determined, says he, it was my settled and advised resolution before I
preached to you, that this should be the highest point of Knowledge, that I
would profess my self to be acquainted with, and to have skill in, and which I
would in the whole course of my Ministry endeavor to instill into you. I
determined to know nothing among you, not a title of any thing, but Jesus
Christ and him crucified. Oh that we were all of the Apostle Paul's mind! Oh
that all Ministers and Preachers of the Gospel would do as this Apostle did:
that they would not so much affect the knowledge of nice and intricate and
curious speculations, and busy their own and other men's heads with
unprofitable controversies with opposition of Science falsely so called, as the
Apostle speaks, 1 Timothy 6.11. That they would not make this their glory to excel
others in secular Learning, and in such points of knowledge as are vain as to
the main and great business: but rather bend themselves to study this point
better, and to strive to bring themselves and others to this skill, to know
Jesus Christ and him crucified. This were the way indeed to make them happy
everlastingly, for this is eternal life, etc.

in which, etc. Then be you all entreated, and prevailed withal my Brethren,
to labor after this Knowledge. Not to content your selves with this, that you
have some degrees of the Knowledge of God, unless withal you know Christ too.
Let this be your main Endeavor, to get an insight into those things which
concern him, that you may know God in him: That you may look upon him through
Christ, and so may see him as he is in Christ to his people. We preach not our
selves, but the Lord Jesus Christ, says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 4.5. It is Christ
that we preach. What then might some man say, do you not preach God too? Yes,
says the Apostle there, we preach God, but we preach him in Christ: for God
has shined into our hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of God in the
face of Jesus Christ, as it is added in the next words. So then my Brethren, we
must have the light of the Knowledge of God, but it must be in the face of
Christ. It must not shine immediately upon us, as it comes from God, for then
it will overcome us: but it must shine upon us by Reflection on the face of
Christ Jesus. If we would see God we must look on Jesus Christ, and we shall
see God in him; and hence our Savior said to Philip, when he entreated him to
show him the Father, he that has seen me has seen the Father also: If we
would know God, we must seek to know Christ, and we shall know God in him.
And therefore let us set our selves to this business, to know God, and Jesus
Christ whom he has sent, yea, to know God in Jesus Christ: and to this I shall
persuade with some Motives.

First, till you know God in Jesus Christ, you can have no assurance Cor. 1.20.
but they are made in Jesus Christ, they are in him Yea, and in him Amen, as it
is added there in that place. So that if you know God and not Christ, you know
him not as making any promise to you. You may know him as a threatner, this he
does with reference to Christ; but you can never know him as a Promiser, at
least not as a Promiser to you in special. You have no Promise of the Lord for
any thing, no Promise of the Lord will reach to you, to profit you, as long as
you know not Christ the means of Conveyance. Look over all the book of God,
consider all the precious Promises contained in it, from the beginning of it to
the End; and this resolve, if you know not God, you have no right to in any one
of them, nor shall you ever (if you so continue) be a whit the better from
them: God has made Jesus Christ his Steward, he has put all things into his
hand, as we may see, Mat. 11.27. All things are delivered unto me of my
Father, says our Savior; so that they come not to us but through him, they go
all through his hands. God has made him heir of all things, as the Apostle
speaks, Heb. 1.2. So that you see my Brethren, all is his, and Consequently we
can have nothing but from and by, and through him.

Till you know God in Jesus Christ, the Blessings which you have from Jacob of
his Children, Genesis 33.5 These are the Children which God has graciously given
thy servant. As David being rescued out of danger, The Lord delivered me, says
he, because he delighted in me, 2 Samuel 22.20. Then are his Blessings and
Deliverances sweet indeed, when we can relish love in them, when we can look
upon them as the fruits of mercy. Alas, we know God pours out his Blessings
abundantly on many men, not in love, but in displeasure; He gave them their
desire, says the Psalmist of the Jews that perished in the Wilderness: but
while the meat was in their mouths, the wrath of God went out against them,
and slew the fattest of them, Psalm 78.31. they had the Blessing, but they had
it with a curse. The Lord did curse their blessings to them, and so he does to
all that know him not in Jesus Christ, who is his first Beloved, and in whom he
loves others. Christ is the only Way of Intercourse between God and our souls.
He is the Way from God to us; He is the Channel and the Pipe in which the
stream of Gods love runs down to us. So that there is not one drop of Love from
God to any soul, but it is conveyed and carried to it in, and by, and through
Christ. Out of Christ we have no Love, and consequently nothing in Love.

This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, Matthew. 3.17. Observe it
well, for it is very notable; He does not say with whom I am well pleased, but
in whom I am well pleased. In whom I am well pleased with all, with whom I am
well pleased, with all that are in him, and with no man out of him. If you know
God in Christ, you may know him as a God well pleased with you, otherwise you
cannot. He has made us accepted in the Beloved, says the Apostle, Ephesians. 1.6.
First Christ is the Beloved of the Father, and then we are beloved and
accepted in him.

In him we have Redemption through his blood, says the Apostle, even the
forgiveness of our sins, Ephesians. 1.7. We have not pardon but in him. Him has the
Lord set forth as a propitiation through faith in his blood, says the Apostle,
Romans 3.25. God has made him the Mercy-seat, the seat of Mercy, from which
Mercy is dispensed. And whereas formerly the Mercy-seat under the Law was
placed within the Vail, and so was hidden both from the people and the
Priests; the High Priest only had access to it, and that but once a year
neither. The Lord has now set forth this Mercy-seat to the view of all men,
that all may have access to it. And as the High Priest came not to the
Mercy-seat without blood, Levit. 16.14. even so may no man hope to have mercy
from the Lord in the forgiveness of his sins, but through the blood of Jesus
Christ; if he know not God in him, he can expect no pardoning mercies from him.

No man comes to the Father but by me, says Jesus Christ, John 14.6. He must
make our way to God. In him, says the Apostle, we have boldness, and access
with confidence; Ephesians: 3.12. so that we can hold up our heads with courage,
and lift up our faces to him, as the expression is, Job 22.26. But if we know
not Jesus Christ, how can we be but flat and faint in our approaches to the
throne of Grace? It is in his name that we must desire the blessings that we
seek for at the hands of God; and whatsoever we ask the Father in his name, he
will give it us, John 16.23. It is in his name that we must return the praise
for blessings that we have received, giving thanks to God the Father by him,
Col. 3.17. If we draw blessings down from God, we must do it through Christ. If
we send praises up to God, we must do it through Christ. If we have no
acquaintance with the Lord Christ, how shall we come to God with prayers? how
shall we come to God with praises? with what heart or encouragement shall we
draw nigh to God, either to get from him, or to bring to him?

Till you know God in Jesus Christ, you can have no assurance to enjoy we are
without God in the world, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 2.12. But now in Jesus
Christ they who were far of, are made nigh through his blood, as it is added
there in that place; yea, they are made one with God, as Jesus Christ himself
insinuates, John 17.21. I pray for them, that they may all be one, as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, so that they also may be one in us. Well then,
you see my Brethren, we are near to God in this world, but it is in Christ. We
shall be nearer to him in the world to come, and that shall be in Christ too.
We shall enter into the holiest, into heaven, into the place where God is,
whereof the holiest in the Temple was a figure, but that shall be by the blood
of Jesus, as the Apostle shows, Heb. 10.14. So that if we know not Christ, we
may know God at a distance, as one that we shall never be partakers of. He and
we must keep asunder: But if we know him in Christ, we know him then as one who
is our own, and whom we shall enjoy for ever.

JOHN 17.3. That they might know thee the only true God.


AND thus far of the twofold object, of the knowledge wherein Eternal life
consists, as they are both of them united and conjoined by the connective
particle And. Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.

Proceed we now to handle each of them apart and distinctly by it self;
beginning with the first. Thee the only true God: God, in opposition to the
creature. True God, in opposition to the false. Only true God, in opposition to
any other true God.

Others are creatures, he is God. Others are false Gods, he is true. And he is
the only true; all the rest, let them be what they will, are but pretenders:
There is no other true God but he only.

What then? is Jesus Christ excepted here from being God? Is this appropriated
to the Father? So it seems this says our Savior, here is life Eternal, to
know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. This place
was the great Fortress of the Arrians heretofore, it was seeds dogmatis, from
whence they peremptorily concluded, that the Father only is the true God, and
so by consequence that Jesus Christ whom he has sent, is but a mere man, a
mere creature. And because this wicked Tenent which overthrows the Divinity of
Christ, and with it the whole work of man's redemption, has been revived and
set afoot in these times, (which seem to be the common sink, whereunto all the
errors and heresies of former ages empty out themselves) there must the
greater care and pains be taken in resolution of this great scruple.

The Fathers of the Church who lived in or near the days of Arrius, perceiving
how that error spread it self (for all the world became an Arrian, as one of
their own expressions is) labored exceedingly in this business. And truly, my
Beloved, if some of them had not been so overbusie, the truth had not been so
exceedingly entangled as it is. But now it is become much like a piece of silk,
that has been in many hands to be unravelled, and every one almost has left
it in a worse condition then he found it. I shall not trouble you with their
perplexities, but come as briefly as I can to that which I conceive to be the
intention of the words.

Some have essaied to clear the doubt in such a way as this; say they, These
words are so to be applied to God the Father, as to involve and comprehend the
Son with him. Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ. So that the Son is not
excluded here from being God, but included with the Father. And Chrysostom
alleges such another manner of expression, 1 Cor. 9 only I, says the Apostle
there, and Barnabas; where Barnabas is not excluded, but comprehended in the
word only; as if he should have said, I and Barnabas, and no other. So in this
speech of Christ to God the Father, thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ:
q.d. This is life Eternal to know the only true God, thee, and I, and no other.
Or to make it yet more plain, as if the words had run thus, to know thee, and
Jesus Christ whom thou have sent, to be the only true God.

This would do very well as to the Godhead of the Son against the Arrians. But
then the self-same scruple will arise, as to the Godhead of the Holy Ghost,
which some others have denied, for he is evidently left out. And there will be
no help for that exception. For if it be admitted that Christ is comprehended
with the Father in the word only, Thee and Christ the true God, yea the only
true God, the Holy Ghost is plainly shut out. By this account he is not God at
all, if this be the intention of the words, that God and Christ, the Father and
the Son be the only true God. We have maintained the Godhead of the Son
indeed, but we have clearly yielded up the Godhead of the Holy Ghost; And
therefore we must needs shake hands with this, and look after some other
Exposition.

And that as some have apprehended, may be this: That God the Father is not
said to be the only true God, in opposition to the Son or Holy Ghost, but to
the Idols of the heathen. They are all false gods, he only is the true God. So
that the meaning of our Savior is but this, as if he should have said, this is
Eternal Life to know thee who art the only true God, and not the Idols of the
heathen, who are false gods. To turn from all those vanities, and to serve the
living God.

And I confess, if God essentially taken for the whole Godhead, as
comprehending all the persons, were said to be the only true God in opposition
to the heathen Idols, it would bear a clear construction. Or if God personally
taken for the Father only, were said to be the true God, in opposition to those
heathen gods, that would hold extremely well, and there would be no cause of
scruple. But how shall God the Father as distinct from the Son and Holy Ghost,
be the only true God? If he be the true God, this hinders not but that the Son
may be the true God, the Holy Ghost may be the true God: Because though they be
diverse persons, yet they are but one Essence. But if the Father be the only
true God, how can the Son, how can the Holy Ghost be true God? If either of
them be the true God, then he which is another from them as he is another
person, though he be not another substance, is not the only true God. For that
which is affirmed of him only, cannot be said of any other.

And therefore that of Calvin, as it seems to me, gives the clearest
satisfaction. Says he, Our Savior in the Gospel, especially in this of John,
speaking as man, and not as God, under the name of Father, intimates and
comprehends the whole Godhead, and so he does in this place. So then his
Father here is not God personally taken for the first person of the Godhead
only, but God Essentially taken for the whole Essence of the Godhead, as
involving all the persons, and so he is apparently the only true God.

To make this Exposition evident, I shall clear these two things, and it will
be worth our labor, because it opens many other places of the Gospel.

First that our Savior in my text, as well as many other places, speaks as man
and not as God. And then that by the name of Father, he intends the whole
Godhead, of which himself as God is one person.

As for the first of these, that our Savior in my Text, as well as many other
places, speaks as man, and not as God, is very plain. For he speaks as sent of
God, thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. Now though
Christ, who is God as well as man, be sent, yet he is sent most properly as
man; for so, and only so he is inferior, he is the Servant and the Messenger
of God. Besides he speaks in prayer in my Text, and prayer is a part of
worship. And God does not worship God: So that he speaks as man and not as God.

Now speaking so, my Brethren, by the name of Father, he means not the first
person only, but the whole Godhead, Father glorify thy Son, as thou have
given him power over all flesh, etc. And this is Life Eternal to know thee (him
whom he calls Father) to be the only true God. Nor let this seem strange to
you; for Christ as man is Gods Son. Not God the Fathers Son alone, but the Son
of the whole Godhead. Indeed as God, he is the Son of the first person only:
but as man he is the Son of all the persons. As man he is a creature, and he is
not God the Fathers creature only, for the works of the Trinity without are
undivided. And therefore Christ is made the Son of God in the same way that
Adam is, Luke 3.33. He was the Son of Joseph, who was the Son of Eli, and so
on, who was the Son of Adam, who was the Son of God. Now Adam you will grant,
was not the son of God the Father only, but he was the son of God essentially
taken, the son of the whole Godhead; and consequently so was Seth, and so was
Enoch, and so along, and so was Joseph, and so was Christ. And if Christ were
the Son of God in that sense, I mean of all the three persons, then he might
fittly call him Father in that same Notion.

Why you will say then upon this account, Jesus Christ as he is God, is his own
Father, as he is man. No, my Beloved, this is not that which I affirm; I do not
say that Jesus Christ the second person in the Godhead, is the Father of his
manhood. But the Godhead, whereof Jesus Christ himself makes one person, is
really the Father of the same Christ, as he is man. And so he calls him in the
first verse of this Chapter; and him he means in the words that I am handling,
thee the only true God.

And so there is no difficulty in the sense, q. d.

Thou God who art my Father as I am man (meaning thereby the whole Godhead
subsisting in the three persons) art the only true God. And thus I have
explained and cleared the words, as well as I am able. The observation lies
before you.

DOCTRINE. That God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is true God, and the only
true God; there is no other true God, but he only.
That our God is the true God, is plentifully taught in Scripture. Reason will
carry us to a God, but such an one as is unknown, who he is we cannot tell. And
so it did the great Philosophers at Athens, which was an Universitie, who
therefore had an Altar with this Inscription, To the unknown God; as you may
see Acts 17.23. But Scripture carries us to this God, who is indeed the true
God; he is not so in show and in pretense alone, but he is so in deed and
truth. And this is that which he affirms of himself, and confirms many
ways; in that memorable place, Isa. 45.20, etc. And therefore the Evangelist
does set the finger of an hand against him as it were to point him out, in this
respect, 1 John 5.20. We know, says he, that the Son of God is come, and he
has given us understanding that we may know him that is true, (true in himself
and in his nature, and true in his discovery and revelation of himself) and we
are in him that is true, this is the true God. q.d. Take notice of him, and
observe him well, this is the true God.

And as he is the true God, so in the second place he is the only true God.
There are other false gods, there is no other true God, but him only. I am God,
says the Lord, Isa. 45.22. and there is no God else besides me, a just God and
a Savior, there is none beside me. It is repeated twice for the better
confirmation: And therefore Jeremy in this respect sets him in opposition to
all other gods; Ier. 10.8, 9. They are altogether brutish, says the Prophet,
the stock is a vain doctrine. Silver spread into plates, and Gold from Ophir,
blew and purple is their clothing, they are the work of cunning men, but the
Lord is the true God. The Prophet speaks it there exclusively, he is, and none
but he; they are not, he is. The Holy Ghost affirms of Idols universally,
without exception, that they are nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8.4. nothing of
that Idolaters conceit; they are not Numina indeed. And therefore it is added
in that place, there is no other God but one. And howsoever they are often
called Gods in Scripture, yet this is spoken according to the apprehensions and
conceits of sottish men, because they think them to be so; and therefore this
their Godhead is recalled again in other places, and they are styled false
gods; and as a false man is no man, so a false god is no god. I speak not of a
false man in his words and in his actions, (for such an one may be a man) but
of a false man in his nature. Even as a painted man has not the nature of a
man, and so by consequence is no man. So Idols painted, or engraven gods, have
nothing of the true and living God in them, and so by consequence are no gods
as the Apostle shows, Gal. 4 8. Howbeit when ye knew not God, ye did service
unto them who by nature are no gods. And hence an Idol is sometimes called a
lie in Scripture, as Ier. 10.11. his molten image is falsehood or a lie, because
it has not that divinity which it pretends to, and which it is supposed to
have by those that worship and adore it. And because it does not yield that
succor which it seems to promise. You know what God affirms of the Idols of
the Jews, that they are no gods, Ier. 5.7. My people have forsaken me, and
sworn by them that are no gods. An oath is taken there by a Synecdoche for all
the parts of holy worship, as it is often in the holy Scripture, so that the
sense and meaning is, q. d. My people have forsaken me the true God, and
worshipped them that are no gods.

So that the point is plain you see, our God is the true God, and the only true
God. Now the Scripture proves it further yet, by Reason, and Uses, and
Arguments in this present case; it will not be unprofitable if I hint them
briefly to you.

It appears that our God is the only true God, because he, and he only Psalm.
90.2. he is the Lord, the first and the last, Isa. 41.1. whereas the heathen
gods are new, and have their being of another, and so indeed are no gods. You
know how David reasons, They are not gods, says he, and why so? they are the
works of men's hands, Psalm 115.4. And Hosea to the same purpose, Hos. 8.6. The
workman made it, therefore it is not God. Indeed it is so far from being God,
that it is scarce a creature, it is nothing in the world. Or if it be a
creature, it is of their own making. The workman made it, therefore it is not
God.

It appears that our God is the only true God, because he only is the living
God: It is the Prophets argument, Ier. 10.10. The Lord is the true God. But how
does this appear? Why he is the living God, as it is added in the next words.
Other gods are dead gods, they have tongues and cannot speak, they have feet
but cannot walk: And hence is the Apostles Exhortation, to turn from such dead
vanities as these unto the living God.

Among the gods there is none like thee, says David, Psalm 86.8. how does he
prove this? neither are there any works like thy works. And therefore the true
God upbraids the heathen gods in this respect, Isa. 41.24. Behold you are of
nothing, and your work of nothing; that is, you are not able to do any thing,
you can do neither good nor evil, as it is said in that place. Not to speak of
the creation of the heaven and the earth, which is attributed to God in
opposition to all other gods. What can the gods of heathen or of professed
Christians, who make their honor or their wealth their gods, what can they do
to save a man in the time of his distress? Riches deliver not in the day of
death. So that as the Prophet says to the Idolaters of his time, Isa. 45.20.
Ye pray unto a God that cannot save. So we may say to these Idolaters of our
times, ye trust in gods that cannot save: no, this is proper to the true God.
There is no God besides me, says the Lord, a just God and a Savior; and
therefore adds presently, Look unto me and be you saved, for I am God, and
there is none else.

Isa. 41.4. he holds out when all fail. For other gods they perish, Ier. 10.11.
Idols perish, riches perish; honors, friends, all perish; but God endures to
all eternity. As he is from everlasting, so he is to everlasting, Psalm. 90.2.
All other things are subject to decay and dissolution, but he abides for
evermore. They do all perish, says the Psalmist, Psalm 102.26. but thou shall
endure for ever. They all wax old, etc. but thou art the same, etc.



And to this I shall persuade and stir you up with some motives.

is because we have some doubts and haesitations in our faith, of this
particular, that we have so great an eye upon the creature in our ways: that
we approve our selves to men, and seek the approbation and applause of men,
that we are afraid of men, afraid of Creatures, but are not afraid of God.
Whence is it my beloved, but because we are not absolutely satisfied at all
times, that our God is indeed the true God, but have thoughts arising in us, or
cast into us, tending at least toward some scruple in this business: and have
not always arguments at hand to put the matter out of all question, and to
suppress such thoughts as these as soon as they begin to stir in us? Who art
thou, that thou should be afraid of a man that shall dye, and of the son of
man that shall be made as grass: And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that has
stretched out the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth? Esa. 51.12,
13. By which the Prophet intimates that we should never be transported so with
sinful fears of men and creatures as we are, but that the great Creator is set
by; either he is not in our thoughts, or which is worse, he is not in our
faith. And when we come to this my Brethren, to have some scruples in our
selves, whether there be a God at all, or if there be, whether ours which we
have chosen, be the right and true God, it is impossible but we should (so far
as those doubts prevail upon us) go out from him, and apply our selves to those
things which are obvious to the sense, which we see and know to be.

The more undoubtedly and firmly we believe that our God is the true the more
perfectly and fully we shall serve him and obey him; the more we shall trust in
him, the more we shall seek to him, the more we shall strive to please him;
according to the strengthening or weakening of our faith in this particular,
will be the measure of our service and obedience to him, of our reliance and
dependence on him. For even as if a man believe there is no God at all, he will
not serve him, he will not roll himself upon him whom he thinks not to be. So
if he believe it weakly, and with many haesitations that there is a God, or
that the God which he has chosen is the true God, he will fear him, and he
will trust him very weakly and remisly. He will be on and off, and up and down,
according to the ebbings and the flowings of his faith. But if we have a strong
and an unshaken confidence that our God is God indeed, then we will set our
selves to serve him fully and without halting. Then we will trust him
perfectly, we will apply our selves to please him, in all our ways and all our
actions.

But you will ask me then, how shall we do to put this matter out of all
question, that our God is the true God, and what means shall we use to satisfy
our selves, and to confirm our faith in this particular, because it is a Point
of such concernment, and has such influence in our lives? I shall give you
some Directions.

First, Endeavor to the utmost of your power, to give complete and we cannot
but believe (without any haesitation) that our God is the true God. If we be
satisfied of the one, we cannot possibly have any scruple of the other. And
therefore we should spend our thoughts upon such meditations as will settle us
in this. We should consider with our selves the strange Consent of
Scripture-writers living in so many Ages; the strange accomplishment of
Scripture-Prophesies, the strange effect of Scripture-admonitions,
exhortations, threatenings. Though it be carried in a low and easy style, how
it commands us, and prevails more upon us then all the Eloquence of men and
Angels could ever do, were it united altogether. Especially we should observe
(we that are God's I mean, (for to such I now speak) what admirable operation
it has had upon our own hearts; how it has pierced in, and made a separation
between our very joints and marrow. how it has even told us all that ever we
have done; how it has cast us down with sorrow unconceivable, and then raised
us up again with joy unspeakable and glorious; how it has altered and changed
us, and turned us clear about, and made us to renounce our profits, pleasures
and delights, our wills, our reasons and desires, yea to deny our selves, that
we might walk by this Rule. Such things as these methinks, should mightily
confirm us in the truth of this, that the Scripture is the very Word of God.
And then this cannot choose but follow out of all dispute, that our God is the
true God.

Barbarians worshipped, the Sun, the Moon, the very beasts themselves of every
sort, they are no great pretenders neither; we need no more then ordinary
reason to convince us that these can be no Gods. For to say truth, they are
below men. The Roman gods are more considerable then the other, and yet they
were but men, as Jupiter, and Saturn, and the like: Yea, to say truth, they
were vile and wicked men, addicted to the grossest vices, and such as led most
profane and lewd lives: Yea, they were mortal men, and therefore certainly
they were not Gods. And hence their very Worshippers would show you in one
place a Temple, and in another place a Sepulcher erected to the same God, which
is a most apparent Contradiction. And truly if a man consider, who have
pretended to the Godhead besides our God, and what poor things they were, it
will exceedingly establish and confirm him in this business.

You cannot think that if there be a God, as that is granted of all hands, he
is concealed from the world till this time. And truly for the other gods that
have been worshipped, if you will but examine them, you will apparently
discover them to have deluded and deceived the world: so that you may
exceedingly confirm your faith in this respect by an induction of particulars.
This god and that god cannot be the true God, and so along in all the rest: And
therefore our God is undoubtedly the true God. And you shall find the Lord to
have such poor Competitors, that you will certainly cry out at last, as being
fully satisfied, The Lord is God, the Lord is God.

Be sure to sift this business to the full, when you set your selves about in
medio, in suspense; they pass to other thoughts, and do not fully satisfy
themselves in this particular, whereas a man should never rest while there is
any cloud upon his faith, any scruple in his conscience.

Ah, my Beloved, will you be slight in such a matter as this is, of such
infinite concernment? whether the God which you have chosen be the right or no?
How can you but be slight accordingly in all the duties of his service? And
therefore do not give it over till you be resolved. Think with your selves, I
must determine either on or off, either one way or the other. And if you be
necessitated to resolve, our God will carry it from all the rest. They that
have taken other gods, have taken them upon trust, they have received them from
the custom of the places in which they have been born and bred. And most that
worship our God, take him but in such a way as this is. But if you sift the
business well, you will find cause to stick to him whom you have chosen. The
more you prove him and examine him, the better you will like him. And therefore
I beseech you, do not halt in this business, but come to some determination and
decision: Do as Elijah counsels Israel; Be no longer unresolved: If Baal be
God, then follow him; but if the Lord be God, then follow him. Rest not in
opinion here, but sift it to the full. Bring your selves to this disjunction:
If any other god be true, why then there is no other way, but I must worship
him, and serve him. But if our God be the right, then I must stick close to
him. If you be at this hand, that you will absolutely satisfy your selves
before you leave, before you give the business over, (as this you are bound to
do) you will not leave it any longer in suspense, nor suffer any doubtful
thoughts within you unexamined (for then they will return again on all
occasions) you will find that this will strengthen faith exceedingly in this
particular. Our God will certainly be gainer, and have very great advantage by
coming on the test with any other.

Basis of Religion, the foundation that supports the Fabric of it, and bears
up the weight of all the building. A man will never come to God by faith, or by
repentance, or obedience, unless he first believe that God is, Heb. 11.6. And
therefore struggle with the Lord about it; if faith begin to waver, or to fail
in any measure, say, as the Disciples did, O Lord, increase our faith, Lord
strengthen us, Lord do not suffer us to shake in this fundamental truth; for
this does shake all with it. A man may get a common, an acquired faith, by
arguments, and reasons, and the like; it may be brought into a man by custom;
but that will never satisfy a man completely, constantly, unless he have
infused faith, and that is the immediate gift of God himself. If he will show
himself to any man, then he shall see, and know, and be assured, that he is the
true God. But if he will hide himself, he can but only grope after him.

Romans 1.19, etc. they liked not to retain God in their knowledge; they had him
there, but they liked not to retain him, because he was a trouble to them; fain
they would put him out again: The apprehension of a God called upon them for
some duty, and was a curb and a restraint from some evils. And therefore they
were weary of such thoughts as these, and sought to chase them from their
meditations: To say truth, they did not like them, and therefore would be rid
of them: They knew God, (that they were not able to avoid) but yet they
glorified him not as God. And truly this is just the case of many Christians:
They do not serve, they do not glorify and worship God according to their
knowledge of him. They walk not answerably to their principles, and to their
light in this particular. They yield him to be God, and yet they do not trust
in him, they do not live to him, they do not love, they do not fear him, and
the like. They live without God in the world, and they do just as they would
do, if there were no God at all.

Now I beseech you, my Beloved, do but consider the extreme danger of such a
course as this is. It is the ready way to be delivered up to strong delusions,
and to vile affections, as you may see those Gentiles were in the very same
case. Because when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, therefore God
gave them up to strong delusions in their intellectual parts, that they were
vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts were darkened; to vile
affections in their sensual part, that they committed all uncleanness, and
burned in their filthy lusts; their hearts were like an Oven heated by the
Baker, they were set on fire of hell.

And has it not been thus with many men in our days? they know God in a
speculative and discoursive way at least; they were convinced that he was the
true God, but they lived not according to their principles in this respect,
they abated of their strictness and devotion, neglected duties which they had
been wont exactly to perform, forsook the Ordinances and the Worship of the
Lord, despised the Word of God, glorified him not as God, took carnal liberty
against their knowledge, and against their conscience. And now how vain are
they become in their imaginations? how foolish in their fancies, and opinions,
and conceits? How has God sent on many of them strong delusions to believe
lies, that they might all be damned that believe not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness! They knew the truth, but they had pleasure in
unrighteousness. They took delight in some unrighteous way or other, some
secret way of wickedness or other, and now they are delivered and believe lies.
It is a lie and a delusion, but it is a strong delusion, so that you cannot
stir them from it. Do what you can, and bring what arguments you will, it is in
vain, the deceit is strong upon them.

And some are also given up to vile affections, and to those burning lusts,
which the Apostle speaks of in the cited places. This is the formidable
judgment of the Lord on those who know God, and do not walk according to their
knowledge. And therefore as we own the true God, let us serve, and let us
worship him as such a one, let us live and act for him, let us be taken up with
him, let us make this our work to please him, let us in every thing so carry
and demean our selves, as they should do who have the Lord for their God.

JOHN 17.3. Thee the only true God.


IS it so, that God the Father, Son, etc. is the only true God? Then David,
Whom have we in heaven but him, and whom have we in earth but him? Is there any
in the world, whom we set up to our selves as a God but him only? Let us be
always mindful of the first and great Commandment of the Law of God, which is
indeed the very basis and foundation of the rest, Thou shall have no other God
before me. Thou shall have a God, and thou shall have me for thy God, and thou
shall have none but me for thy God. And that which is annexed is very much to
be observed, If thou have any God besides me, it will be before me. If we could
go behind his back and take another god, there were the less iniquity, and
there were the more safety; it were not such a heinous thing, it were not such
a dangerous thing. But to go and take another god before his face, (as if a
wife should go and take another Lover and commit uncleanness with him, even
before her husbands face) what an horrid impudence? what an unsufferable
provocation? What, says the Lord, (as once Ahasuerus in the case of Haman)
will he commit adultery before my face? for so idolatry is spiritual adultery;
will he do it in my presence, and while I am looking on? Ah desperate wretch!
nay then I see there is no hope of him, take him away, and carry him to
execution. And therefore let us be extremely cautious, that we have no other
God but him alone who is the only true God.

But you will ask me now perhaps, what I intend when I exhort you to have no
other God but him only? Truly, my Brethren, it involveth many things, but I
shall draw them to a few heads. When I persuade you to have the Lord and none
but him for your God, my meaning is, that you should serve him and none but
him, that you should fear him and none but him, that you should trust in him
and none but him.

Then since he is the only true God, serve him and none but him. Serve the Lord
so as to serve no other with him. So is his own express injunction, Thou shall
worship the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve, Matthew. 4.10. And here
to be a little more distinct, serve the Lord and not Idols, serve the Lord and
not Times, serve the Lord and not Lusts.

Jeroboams drawing Israel to the worship of the calves, is frequently set forth
by this expression, he made Israel to sin. He made them to commit the sinning
sin, the sin which is abundantly and out of measure sinful. And God himself
dissuading from it, speaks of it as that on which his very heart did rise,
which he abhorred to name, on which he could not think without extremity of
detestation; O do not that abominable thing which I hate, Jer. 44.4. And
otherwise indeed it cannot be: For it is the choosing of another god, that is
the Holy Ghosts expression of it, says he, they chose new gods, Judges 5.8. by
which they made it to appear, that they were weary of the old, as if they had
discovered some iniquity in God, as he expostulateth with the Jews upon the
like occasion, Jer. 2.5. as if the Lord were found upon experience to be such a
god, or were not worth the keeping any longer.

This is a thing from which the very heathen are abhorrent and averse; the
Nations will not change their gods, Jer. 2.11. though they be but false gods,
and consequently no gods, as it is added there in that place. Oh what an odious
thing is this, that the Church should change hers, who has the true and
everlasting Lord of heaven and earth for her God. They will not change their
false gods for the true, and shall we change the true God for a false? Oh what
an horrible indignity is this, what an unsufferable provocation?

And therefore God is exceedingly incensed at this iniquity; it is a sin that
kindles anger, great anger, yea the heat of great anger, Deuteronomy. 24.44. What
means the heat of this great anger? And in the following, verses it is showed
to be because they went and served other gods. Indeed Idolatry stirs up the
jealousy of God, and therefore this is added as the reason of the prohibition
of it, because he is a jealous God. And even as jealousy in man is (as the
wise man notes) the rage of man; so jealousy in God (my Brethren) is the rage
of God. To see his Wife the Church forsake him, and run a whoring after Idols,
is such a thing as blows and kindles up the flames of his hottest indignation.
In what a fearful rage was God on this occasion? behold and tremble at it,
Exodus 32.9. when Moses hung about him, and besought him for the people, he
flung him off; Let me alone, says God, that so my anger may wax hot against
them, and that I may consume them in a moment. And if you search the Scripture,
you shall find that God has executed and inflicted the heaviest of his plagues
and judgments on those that have been guilty of this sin. Look on the
monuments of his severest and most direful vengeance, and you shall find, that
as the wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness
of men; so especially against this hideous sin. And as a man transported with a
jealous spirit, is apt to take unmercifull revenge; in which respect the wise
man says, He will not spare in the day of vengeance, Prove. 6.34. even so the
Lord when he is stirred to jealousy on this occasion, is wont to measure out
to such offenders an excess and overplus of wrath and vengeance, as you may see
a sad example of it in the Jews. And therefore I shut up this Exhortation, as
John does his Epistle. Little children keep your selves from Idols, Amen. Serve
the Lord and not Idols.

But you will say perhaps, what needs this? For who among us is inclinable to
this sin? Or which of us does serve Idols? To this I answer, That there is not
in man a stronger inclination to any sin then that of Idolatry, as I could show
you very plentifully and very clearly from the Scripture. And as for actual
Idolatry, you must know, (my Brethren) that there is a gross and open, and
there is a more subtle and secret Idolatry. The gross and open is the
worshipping of heathen images and heathen gods, or else of Popish Crucifixes,
and the like; from this perhaps you may acquit your selves. But now besides,
there is an inward and secret Idolatry, and this is very rife and common in the
world, yea in the bosom of the Church it self. Professed Christians many of
them, who have but one God in their mouths, have yet an hundred in their
hearts.

For you must know, my Brethren, that this inward Idol-worship is not committed
only by conceiving an Idol or a creature under the notion of God, which was the
error of the heathen, who thought that Jupiter and Mars were gods. But also by
ascribing that to any creature which is peculiar to the Lord. In doing so we
deifie the creature, and set it up in Gods stead: and this is very usual among
those that would be taken to be Christians: some make Idols of themselves:
either their belly is their God, as the Apostle speaks in his time, whose end
is destruction, whose God is their belly, Phil. 3.19. they take more care to
please their appetites, and fill their bellies, then to please God. Or else
they make their policy and wit their God, while they rely and rest upon it to
bring their enterprises and designs to pass: and so accordingly attribute the
effecting of them to their own skill, and to their own ability. These are the
men that sacrifice to their own net, and burn incense to their own dragg, as
the Prophet speaks, Hab. 1.16.

Others make Idols of their fellow Creatures, while they lay out that fear, and
love, and confidence upon them, which belongs to God only. In this respect, the
covetous and worldly wretch is styled an Idolater. Ephesians. 5.5. because he loves
his riches more then God, and trusts in his riches more then God. And the
Apostle James speaking of such as love the world, calls them adulterers and
adulteresses, Jam. 4.4. because they commit this inward Idolatry (which is
spiritual adultery) with the things of this life. The like may be affirmed of
the ambitious man, who loves his honors more then God; and of the voluptuous
man, who loves his pleasures more then God. So that you see my Brethren, there
is need of this advice even to professed Christians, to serve the Lord and not
Idols.

2. Serve the Lord and not the times. (...) and (...) are words not very much
unlike, neither in the writing of them, nor in the pronunciation of them; there
is but a letter odds. And hence it is that some have put the latter for the
former in that place of the Apostle, Romans 12.11. And in stead of reading it
(...), serving the Lord, they read it by an easy change (...), serving the
time. And so we find it in some Greek Copies. And truly there are many in these
days of ours who seem to like extremely well of this change, who would have
(...) put for (...) still, and who would rather serve the time then serve the
Lord. These are the men who fashion and apply themselves continually to the
present garb, and to the present state of things. Like weather Cocks they turn
with every blast, like Ships they set their sails to every wind. Brethren, this
is an odious thing to mould our selves (especially in points of Conscience and
matters of Religion) to the times. Indeed it is observed of the men of
Issachar, that they were wise to understand the times, and to know what Israel
ought to do, 1 Chronicles. 12.31. And so I must acknowledge, it is wisdom so to
observe the times, to know our duty what it is, and to perform it in the proper
season. But to observe them so to serve them, is a very great evil. We must not
serve the times but serve the Lord.

3. Serve the Lord and not Lusts; neither your own Lusts, nor the Lusts of
others.

First serve the Lord and not your own Lusts: if he be the only true God, he
must be served, and not them. And yet how many are there who are slaves and
vassals to their own Corruptions, who are not subject and obedient to the will
of God, but to that which the Evangelist calls the will of the flesh, 1 John
13. They are a rule unto themselves, and walk according to their own counsels.
That which they have a will and a desire to do, to which they are carried and
swayed by their own inclinations and sensual affections, they freely follow and
pursue; but for the will of God, they neither care to know it, nor obey it.

I wish that such would seriously consider what a fearful thing it is for God
to leave men to their own wills. He never does it but in extremity of wrath and
vengeance. When he will take severe revenge indeed, then he picks out this
judgment: My people would not hearken to my voice, (says God) and Israel
would none of me. What must become of Israel now think you? you may behold it
in the following verse, So I gave them up to their own lusts, to walk according
to their own counsels. And certainly unless the Lord should send men quick to
hell, a heavier Judgment cannot come upon them.

Secondly, serve the Lord, and not the Lusts of other men; that is the basest
and unworthiest service in the world, when men are not only subject to the
regular and just commands of their superiors (for so they are in duty bound to
be) but they are subject to their wicked humors. They are not only serviceable
and obedient to their lawful wills, but they are Bawds and Pandars to their
Lusts: They will do any thing, rather then they shall be offended and
displeased: They will serve them in their sins, and serve them in their base
and wicked humors (though conscience grumble and recoyl) they will comply with
them in every thing, they will humor, and applaud them, and admire them for
advantage, as the Apostle Paul speaks. They are resolved to please them,
whether God be pleased or no. Let such remember that God will never own them
for his servants, who prefer the favor and respects of men above him: Mark
what the Apostle says, Gal. 1.10. If I yet please men, if I seek to please
them so that I regard not though I anger and displease the Lord Christ; If I
yet please men in such a manner, in such a way as this, I cannot be the servant
of Christ.

If God be the only true God, then as you must serve him and none Sanctify the
Lord of hosts himself, says the Prophet, Isaiah 8.13. and let him be your fear
and dread: The Prophet speaks it there exclusively, let him be your fear and
none else. To which effect is our Saviors admonition, Luke 12. Be not afraid
of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: But I
will forewarn you, whom you shall fear, fear him that after he has killed,
has power to cast you into hell, I say unto you fear him. And therefore we are
often rated in the Scripture for our fear of men and creatures as Isa. 51.12,
13. Who art thou that thou should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of
the Son of man that shall be made as grass? And truly we are very weak in this
respect abundance of us. We are exceedingly afraid sometimes how men will use
us if we fall into their hands, and if they come to have us in their power, we
cannot eat, we cannot sleep, we are so infinitely troubled and perplexed. This
violent and raging passion eats out all the comfort of our lives; And in the
mean time we neglect the Lord, who is to be feared, as the Prophet David speaks.

Why you will say then, May we not in any case fear creatures? No, my Beloved,
not in any case make them the ultimate and terminative object of our fears.
Fear them we may as instruments of Gods anger, and then indeed we fear God in
them. But to fear them for themselves, as if they could do evil to us of
themselves, is even to set them up in Gods stead. Indeed if they could do us
any mischief without God, and which he could not fence us from, we had great
reason then to fear them, and not him: But seeing of themselves they cannot
strike us, and when they do they are but rods in Gods hand, we should not eye
the rod so much as the hand that strikes with it. God would not call for all
our fear, if any creature could do us any damage without him. But seeing he
alone is able of himself to save and to destroy, I say unto you fear him, and
none but him.

Hosea 3.1. put not your trust and confidence in them. For that from which
deliverance is expected by us, that is the thing to which we look, and on which
our eye is fixed. I will lift up mine eyes to the hills from whence my help
comes, Psalm 121.1. Now this we may not do from any creature. For as it cannot
hurt us, on the one side, so neither can it save us on the other; no, this is
proper to the only true God. I am the Lord, says he, and there is no God
besides me, a just God and a Savior: And therefore adds presently, Look unto
me and be you saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and none else. And
therefore let not any of our hearts depart from God at any time, and step out
to other Saviors: Let us not make flesh our arm, nor place our confidence in
earthly Saviors.

Its that which we are very apt to do, as it is manifest by this, that we are
so disquieted and troubled in the want, and so secure in the enjoyment of these
things, that our very hearts and spirits do even come and go with them. But
what are they in Gods stead, as once the King of Israel said, 2 Kings 5.7. that
they should save us and procure our peace? Oh, my Beloved, be exceeding tender
how you give his glory to another, how you attribute this to any means, how you
expect deliverance from it. If God be the only true God, let nothing share
together with him in your faith and confidence, but let him have this part of
worship appropriated to him, to put your whole trust in him.

Ephesians. 4.3. endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
And this is used as one inducement among the rest, to urge it, and enforce it
on us, because there is but one God, one only true God, as you may see in the
sixth verse of that Chapter. Indeed if there were many Gods, (I mean many true
Gods) there were a manifest and just occasion of division. It were but
reasonable that there should be rents and breaches among the worshippers of
these Gods; That every one should vehemently contend for the God whom he fears.
But if there be but one only true God, whom all of us do serve and worship, we
may the better be at unity among our selves. Yea we should strive the more to
be at one, to keep our selves in unity, that we may be the better like God. And
this is that which Christ desires in behalf of his Disciples, in the 11. verse
of this Chapter, Holy father, keep through thy own name those whom thou have
given me, that they may be one as we are. By which he intimates expressly, that
it is a thing very much to be desired, that the worshippers of God should be
like God in unity. Not like in all respects, (for so it is impossible that they
should be) but as God is one in Essence, so they should be one in heart and in
affection.

Oh let us labor for this Oneness, that we may be in this like God. Let there
be no separations and divisions, but let the Lords Jerusalem be like a City
that is at unity within it self. And truly there was never greater need to set
on this Exhortation, than now when God has suffered such a spirit of division
to possess his own people; and when the worshippers of the only true God are of
so many minds, and draw so many ways, and have such vehement and such hot
contentions and disputes among themselves, that they are no way to be pacified
and appeased. So that the Church had never greater reason to complain (as
Rebecca sometimes did when she had parlies in her womb, and when the twins were
struggling there) If it be so with me, why am I thus?

Is it so, that our God is the only true God? Then let us see our happiness
Gal. 4.8. And what mistake is like this? Oh what an happiness is this, that we
have not been left to this error! Now therefore let us say as David, Psalm
34.2. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord. Let us boast of our God, and
let us glory over other men in this regard, that while they have false gods, we
have the only true God for our God. So that we are not to be equalled for a
God, by any people in the world besides, which is indeed the highest privilege
that any creature is capable of. It is no sin to vaunt and pride our selves in
this prerogative, to make comparisons with others, as the Psalmist does, Psalm
113.5. Who is like the Lord our God? there are other gods abroad, but what god
is like ours? who can compare with us in this regard? who can show us such a
God as we have? If we be miserable and unhappy as we apprehend in other things,
Oh let our happiness in this, which is transcendent and incomparable; quiet
all, and make us still: We have the greatest happiness imaginable and
attainable, in that we have such a God: Happy are the people that are in such a
case, says David, that have outward peace and plenty. But infinitely happy are
they who have the Lord for their God. And thus far of the Attribute of God, the
firmer object of the knowledge wherein Eternal life consists, the only true God.

The Attribute of Jesus Christ, the second object of it, mentioned here, comes
now in order to be handled, sent of God; This is the Eternal life to know thee
the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.

The word in the Original imports such an one as is dispatched upon the
errand of another, upon the business that another sends him in. The theme from
which it comes, is that from which Apostle comes. So that as the Apostles were
to Christ, so was Christ to God the Father: Jesus Christ was Gods Apostle, as
the twelve were his Apostles. God the Father sent him, even as he sent them.
And this is that which he expresses clearly to them, when he renews their
Commission immediately upon his resurrection, Joh. 20.21. As my Father has
sent me, so send I you. By this you may a little guess at the intention of the
phrase, I shall open it more fully when I come to Explication; In the mean time
the point is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ is Gods Apostle, he is a Messenger sent forth from
God.
So is his own expression of himself to his Father in my Text, This is Eternal
Life to know thee the only true God, (...), and Jesus Christ whom thou have
sent; or whom thou have made thy Apostle. And therefore it is usual with him,
when he has occasion to make mention of his Father, to call him nothing else
but him that sent him. He that receives me, says Christ, receives him that
sent me; and you know who that is, Luke 9.48. so to his own Apostles and
Disciples, It is my meat and drink to do the will of him that sent me; or that
has made me his Apostle. And having done his will and business in the world,
and dispatched the errand he employed him in, I go my way, says he, to him
that sent me, John 16.5. And God upon the other side, speaking of Jesus Christ,
uses to call him, Him whom he has sent, his Angel and his Messenger; you may
see that place for instance, Mal. 3.1. there are two Messengers in that text;
the first is John the Baptist, the Messenger of Christ, Behold I send my
Messenger that shall prepare my way before me; the next is Christ himself, the
Messenger of God, The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come, even the Messenger
of the Covenant whom ye delight in.

I might load you with quotations, but I shall add no more for confirmation of
the point, that Jesus Christ is Gods Apostle, he is a Messenger, etc. Indeed it
needs not proof so much as Explication.

Now that you may the better understand the drift and the intention of it,
there are some Queries to be answered. First whence it is that Jesus Christ is
sent, the terminus a quo, of this mission. Then in the next place whether he is
sent, the terminus ad quem. Thirdly what errand and what business he is sent
about. Fourthly how he is qualified for the delivery of this errand, and the
dispatch of this business.

terminus a quo, whence it is that Christ is sent.

To this I answer, he is sent from the bosom of the Father, as that is the
expression, John 1.18. he comes out of the Ivory Palace, Psalm 45.8. In plainer
terms, my Brethren, he is sent from heaven; and therefore he is called the Lord
from heaven, 1 Cor. 15.47. Not the Lord in heaven only, but the Lord from
heaven too, and that not only with relation to his second, but also to his
first coming. No man has ascended up to heaven, says our Savior Christ
himself, John 3.13. but he that came down from heaven. And who is that? even
the Son of man who is in heaven* So then when he was incarnate, he came down
from heaven in a sense, for of this our Savior speaks in that place. And to
this speech of Christ it is that the Apostle Paul alludeth, when speaking of
our Savior Christ's Ascension, Ephesians. 4.8 he adds presently by way of
Explication, Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also first descended
into the lower parts of the earth. He that descended, is the same also that
ascended, far above all heavens, that he might fill all things. So then,
descend he did at first from heaven, as after he ascended up again to heaven.

But you will ask me, How could Christ be sent from heaven? John 3.13. No man
has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of
man which is in heaven. He was then come down from heaven, he was then upon the
earth, when he spoke these words, and yet he adds, he was then in heaven too,
even the son of man who is in heaven. He speaks not of his manhood, or his
humane nature, that was not come down from heaven, for it had never been there
at that time. And therefore he intends it manifestly of his Godhead in which he
was come down from heaven, and yet he was in heaven too at the very same time.

But how was he come down, if he were there? that is the great scruple.

Not really, but in regard of declaration: John 1.14. The word* says he, was
made flesh and dwelt amongst us. For there the Godhead is in Scripture said to
be, where it appears, where it is manifested and declared to be. And therefore
seeing Christ appeared in the flesh, and was God manifested in the flesh, who
was till then in heaven, and did not show himself on earth, in such a manner
and in such a way, he is said to have descended, to be sent down from heaven to
earth: And so as Bernard speaks acutely, Non venit qui aberat, sed apparuit qui
latebat. He came not who was absent, but appeared who was hid.

terminus ad quem of this Mission? His Father sent him down (in the sense
before expressed) into this lower world. And hence he calls himself, him whom
the Father sanctified, and sent into the world, John 10.36. And the Apostle
Paul accordingly affirms, that he descended into the lower parts of the earth,
Ephesians. 4.9. That is as Beza and some others understand it, he took up his abode
and residence upon the earth, which is the lowest of the elements, the lowest
part of this world.

Jesus Christ whom God has sent.

And this to say it in a word, my Brethren, he was sent to be a Mediator and a
Reconciler between God and man, to make up all the breaches and all the
differences between his Father and his people. So that you see he was
dispatched upon a sweet errand. And here he had a double business, and a double
work to do; To make Peace, and to preach Peace.

First he was sent to make Peace, to do and suffer all that was necessary to
compose the business between God and man: To satisfy his Father, and to
pacify his Father, and so to make him friends with his people. And therefore
God is said by him to reconcile even all things to himself, all things
reconcilable, Col. 1.20. And he is said in the very same verse to have made
peace by the blood of his Cross. This is the errand that he came upon. In this
respect he is styled our peace, the Author and procurer of it. And he is
called, the Messenger, the Angel of the Covenant, Mal. 3.1. to show us that the
Message that his Father sent him in, was to bring men into a Covenant and
agreement with himself. And this he did while he took all the matter of the
Controversy between him and them out of the way, paid all the debts of his
people, cancelled all the bonds and bills that were against them, and nailed
them to his Cross in the view of men and Angels, Col. 2.14. That all the world
might know, that all the matters in debate between God and them were ended, and
that he had no more against them. And when he had done this, he cried out,
Consummatum est, The business which my Father sent me in, and which I came into
the world about, is finished.

Secondly, he was sent to preach Peace; As to procure and purchase it, so to
reveal and publish it to his people. And truly if he had not done the latter,
the former would have been to no purpose. And hence the Father has dispatched
him down into the world to do both; as to make Peace as a Priest, so to preach
Peace as a Prophet. To let his people know there is a Peace obtained, or else
how should it profit them if they should never hear of it? God has anointed
me to preach, says Christ himself, Luke 4.17. To preach what? To preach the
Gospel, which is the doctrine of atonement, to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, as it is added there in that place. Indeed
he was appointed and designed to be the great Prophet, the great Preacher and
Revealer of the will of God to men. And therefore the Apostle tells us, That
God who in former times spoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, has in the last
days spoken to us by the Son. He was designed you see to be the Fathers
spokes-man to the world, to tell them what his mind is, to preach the Gospel,
the word of reconciliation to them. This was a great part of the errand which
his Father sent him in, and therefore he is said to speak by him. And Christ
himself acknowledges in this respect, My doctrine is not mine, says he, but
his that sent me, John 6.0. And when he had dispatched this part of his
Embassy too, he told his Father, I have finished the work which thou gave me
to do: And what was that work? you have it in verse 6. I have revealed thy
name, says he, unto the men which thou have given me out of the world. I have
made known thy mercy to the Church, how ready and inclinable thou art to pardon
them, and to be at peace with them. And now I have done this, the business thou
have sent me in is ended. I have no more to do in this world. And thus you see
what business and what errand Christ is sent about.

Now for the last thing, how he is qualified for the dispatch of this business,

He has qualified him with authority, as his Ambassadors and Messengers Him
has God the Father sealed, John 6.27. So that he came into the world with the
stamp, and with the seal of God upon him, that all men might receive him, as
sent forth from him.

As God has qualified him with authority, so he has qualified him

First as God has sent him, so he has furnished him with a fullness of Merit
to make Peace. Made him able to the utmost, to satisfy his justice, and to
obtain his pardon for his people. For he is God as well as man, in him dwells
the fullness of the Godhead bodily. God, that his Merits might be valuable for
us. Man, that his merits might be applicable to us.

Secondly, as he has furnished him with a fullness of Merit to make Peace, so
of Spirit to preach Peace. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, says our
Savior, Luke 4.18. and by this Spirit he has anointed me to preach the
Gospel; as it is added there in that place. As he has sent and appointed me to
preach, so anointed me to preach. And therefore grace is said to be poured
into the lips of Jesus Christ, Psalm. 45.2. so that he spoke as never man did,
John 7.46. That some were astonished at his doctrine, and all men bore him
witness, and wondered, Luke 4.22.

JOHN 17.3. And Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.


etc. This then may teach us in the first place, to admire the mercy of the
Lord; both of the Father and of the Son in this business. The mercy of the
Father in sending Jesus Christ, and the mercy of the Son, in that he would be
sent by him. In both of these the grace of God is eminent to admiration.

Herein is love, says the Evangelist, 1 John 4.10. not that we loved God, but
that he loved us, and sent his Son. Here is love, and here is mercy to be
spoken of, and to be wondered at in all ages.

Zach. 13.7. Awake O sword against the man that is my fellow, says the Lord of
hosts. Though he be found in fashion as a man, he thinks it no robbery to be
equal with God, every way as good as God, Philip. 3.6. And was it not an
admirable condescension, that when the Father had a Message to dispatch into
the world, for the recovery of lost creatures, Jesus Christ should say to him
(as once the Prophet in another case) Here I am, send me. I am very well
content to be sent of this errand. Especially if we consider, where and whither
he was sent, from heaven to earth, yea to the lowest parts of the earth, as the
expression is, Ephesians. 4.9. In a sense to hell it self. From the bosom of the
Father, if not into the place, into the state and the condition of the damned.
In which respect, he says, Thou shall not leave my soul in hell, Psalm. 16.10.
He was sent to make peace, to reconcile us to his Father, as you heard before,
in Explication of the point, and this he was to do by the blood of his Cross,
as the Apostle shows us, Col. 1.20. By his extreme and bitter Passion, by
suffering death it self, yea such a shameful and accursed death upon the
Cross, accompanied with such ingredients, as made him roar, and sweat, and
faint under it. And was it not a miracle of mercy, that Jesus Christ should
yield himself to be sent on such an errand as this is? That he should willingly
submit himself to be the Fathers Messenger in such a business? We need not
wonder, that he whose love and kindness was so full of wonder, should be called
wonderful, Isa. 9.6.

But you will say perhaps, Heb. 5.7. Yea more then so, he prayed against it,
Mat. 26.39. Father if it be possible, says he, let this cup pass from me.

To this I answer, my Beloved,

Take him as a private man who had assumed a nature to which death was an
enemy, (especially so bitter and so sharp a death as he was now about to
undergo) and so he justly feared it, and declined it. Take him as a public
Surety and a merciful High Priest, and so he willingly submitted to it. And
this his willingness by reason of his Office was the greater, because his will
by reason of his nature, could not choose but shrink from it.

So that here was rich mercy: Had he done it by constraint, had he been
enforced to it, there had been no such matter in it, (I confess) of admiration
or thanksgiving. The praise had then been due to him that forced him, and not
to him that was enforced. But that he should go forth of such an errand
willingly for our sakes, that he should willingly expose himself to such a
death for those who were not friends but enemies, both to his Father and
himself. This was love, as the Apostle John speaks, Love in the height, and
with a witness; love to astonishment and admiration.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ is Gods Apostle, a Messenger, etc. Then be it,
John 1.10, 11. that for the greater part he is neglected, slighted and despised
on all hands. He came into the world, says he, but they refused him, they did
not account him worth the looking after. And why so? the cause is evident, they
knew him not, as it is added there in that place. But yet the Jews, a man would
think, who were his own, of whom he came according to the flesh, who knew the
prophesies concerning him, should have received and entertained him. No, for
the greater number of them, they were as bad, and as averse as it was possible
for men to be. He came unto his own, his own friends, his own kindred, his own
acquaintance, his own Nation, the people of his own Country; but though they
were his own, they would not own him, nor embrace him; He came unto his own,
and his own received him not. Yea more then so, it is observed, with reference
to them, that God sent his Son among them, and they cast him out and slew him,
Mat. 21.39.

Now I beseech you, my Beloved, be not you like those men. Since Jesus Christ
is Gods Apostle and his Messenger, since he is sent from God to you, let him be
received by you. When he comes to your doors, let him not stand knocking there,
till his head be full of dew, and his locks with the drops of the night. No,
open presently and let him in, and entertain him with such honor and respect
as is agreeable and suitable to him who comes immediately from God, who is the
Messenger and Ambassador of the great God of heaven and earth.

And that you may the rather be prevailed withal, I shall present you with a
few considerations.



he did not send his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the
world by him might be saved, John 3.17. And so does the Son too, John 12.47. I
came not to judge the world, but to save the world. So that you see Christ is
the Messenger of God for good to you. He is not come to judge you and condemn
you, but to save you. He comes not with a Writ of death, but with a Pardon, and
a Pardon sealed with his own blood, and therefore you have cause to bid him
welcome. He is sent to make Peace for you, and to preach Peace to you, as I
have showed you formerly. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, says our Savior,
Isaiah 61.1. he has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, he has
sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable
year of the Lord. You see the errand he is sent upon is all sweetness, the
message which he brings is nothing else but glad tidings of good things. And
therefore let his very feet be beautiful, let his reception and his
entertainment be answerable to his business.

Consider that the Father, who has sent the Son into the world, expects Mat.
21.37. Last of all he sent his Son, saying, they will reverence my Son. He had
sent many other Messengers before, and they despised and abused them, as you
may see in that place. But last of all he sent his Son, the greatest and the
best Ambassador he had to send, and said, though they have slighted other
Messengers of mine, yet surely they will reverence my Son. Though they have
abused my servants, they will not deal so with my Son, it is impossible they
should be so unworthy to despise my Son. So that you see, my Brethren, when God
sends his Son to you, he looks he should be well received and entertained by
you.

Consider, that if you deceive his expectation, he will take deep revenge Mat.
21.41. He will miserably destroy those wicked men. Indeed the wickedness of
those to whom Christ is never sent, is light and little in comparison of
theirs. He is not sent to Heathen Nations, they hear not of him any way, God
has not favored them so far as to dispatch his Son to them, to be a Mediator
between him and them. And therefore their iniquity is comparatively small, and
their Judgment will be easy. But Jesus Christ is sent to you, he is the
Fathers Messenger to you, and if you do not entertain him, your sin is great,
and your damnation will be heavy: He will destroy others, but he will miserably
destroy you: So that it will be easier for Tire and Sydon, for Infidels and
Heathens in the day of Judgment, then for you.

Consider, if you receive this Messenger of God, and entertain him as Zach.
11.8. Now Jesus Christ is sent to make peace, to make up all the breaches and
the differences between God and his people. He can make you Gods friends, yea
he can make you Gods children. This was the privilege of those that
entertained him, John 1.12. To as many as received him, to them gave he power
to become the sons of God. And this shall be your privilege, if you embrace
him.

And is it such a small thing in your eyes to be the children of the highest,
to be the sons and daughters of the God of heaven and earth? Is it nothing to
have free access to God by prayer and by supplication, to cry Abba Father to
him? That whereas others live without God in the world, and have no refuge in
their troubles, we have a Father to betake our selves unto. Or is it nothing to
have sure protection and defense, in such a time as this is? For can we think a
Father, such a Father so powerful, and so merciful, will see his children
sink and perish while he is able to relieve them? Or is it nothing to have such
a great inheritance prepared for us, as God provideth for his children, that
rich inheritance with Saints in light? All this we shall be sure to have, if we
receive this Messenger of God.

But you will ask me what I mean, when I persuade you to receive him? I will
show you in a word, there go three things to it.



John 1.12. To as many as received him, to them gave, etc. As received him!
what is that? even to them that believe in his name. So that receiving, is
expounded by believing; as if the Holy Ghost had said, I mean not by receiving
Christ, any friendly courteous entertainment that they give him, I do not mean
receiving him into their houses, but I intend receiving him into their hearts
by faith. And therefore by receiving, you must understand believing: So do you
receive Christ. The only acceptable entertainment you can give him, is by
faith, by believing in his name. The Messenger of God is ill received, unless
he have the credit with us to be faithfully believed.

All that the Lord commands we will do. And if you thus receive this
Messenger of God, it will be a blessed time that he ever came to you.

And thus we have at length dispatched two of the Arguments, with which our
Savior presses and enforces the great petition that he makes to God the
Father to be glorified by him. Whereof the former has been taken from the end,
why he desires to have glory from the Father, viz. that he might be enabled to
bring glory to the Father. Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son may also
glorify thee. The second has been drawn a Congruo, from Congruity: it was but
meet and congruous that he should have glory from the Father, seeing he had
power from him. As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he should
give eternal life to, etc. And this is life, etc. The third remains to be
entered on at this time, and this is drawn from the deserving cause. Christ had
glorified the Father, and therefore thinks himself worthy to have glory from
the Father. I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the work which
thou gave me to do: And now O Father, glorify me with thine own self.

And here our Savior does these two things; he minds the Father what himself
has done, and then reminds him what he desires him to do. First, He minds the
Father what himself has done, and that in two particulars; I have glorified
thee on earth, I have finished the work which thou gave me to do. And then
reminds him hereupon, of that which he desires him to do; And now O Father,
glorify me with thine own self. As he had said before in the entrance of his
prayer, Father, glorify thy Son: so that he reasons here from the desert to
the reward, as he might do, though we cannot; for all the works of Christ were
meritorious. This he had done for God, and therefore this he looks that God
should do for him again.

Begin we now with the first thing which our Savior Christ had done, of which
he minds the Father, as an inducement to glorify him with himself: I have
glorified thee on the Earth.

To glorify, is either really to make, or else to manifest, and to declare a
person to be glorious. Christ could not make his Father glorious, because there
was no time in which he was not infinitely and completely so. From everlasting
he was absolutely glorious in himself: so that in this respect there could not
be the least addition to him any way. The meaning is, that he had manifested
and declared him to be glorious: that he had showed him in his glory to the
world. And this is that which he expresses clearly in the following verse,
says he, I have made known thy name to the men which thou have given me. And
this he tells him he had done on earth. It was done in heaven before, the glory
of the Lord was fully and immediately manifested there. And now says Christ,
it is done in earth too: I have glorified thee on earth. And hereupon he looks
his Father should glorify him with himself in heaven, as it is added in the
following words: So that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. Who ever will be glorified with God in heaven, must glorify him
first on Earth.
Our Savior Christ himself you see can have it on no other terms: And
therefore he desires it only upon this account: says he to God the Father, I
have glorified thee on Earth, and now O Father, glorify me with thy self in
heaven. According to his first desire in his beginning of his prayer, Father,
glorify thy Son, q. d. I should not look for any glory from thee, unless I had
brought glory to thee: I should be far from any expectation that thou should
glorify me with thy self in heaven, unless I were assured in my self, that I
had glorified thee here upon the earth. But seeing I have done the former, I
pray thee Father, do the latter: since I have glorified thee, let me be
glorified by thee. And as it was with Christ the Head, so it must be in some
degree with all the Members. No glory to be had in heaven, till they have
glorified God on earth. Its true, they merit not the glory they receive from
God, by that which they bring to God, as Christ did: but yet the one is not to
be attained without the other. They that bring God no glory in the present
world, shall have no glory from him in the world to come. The Lord indeed will
render glory to every man that works good, and so glorifieth him; as the
Apostle shows, Romans 2.10. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey
the truth, but obey unrighteousness, and so dishonor God in their lives and
conversations, he will render nothing else but shame, and ignominy, and
confusion. They shall be raised to everlasting contempt, Dan. 12.2. and be made
spectacles of shame to men and Angels.

that they should be to the praise of his glory, as the Apostle shows you, Ephesians.
1.11, 12. That he may manifest the riches of his glory in the vessels of mercy,
which he had before prepared unto glory: so that you see, as he prepares them
unto glory, as he appoints them to be glorified themselves, so he prepares
them, and appoints them to bring glory to himself, Romans 9.23. To show forth the
praises of him that has called them to his Kingdom and glory: 1 Pet. 2.9. Thy
people shall be all righteous, (says the Lord of his Church) Isa. 60.21. The
branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. Not only
that they may be glorified, but that I may be glorified too. And if this be the
purpose and decree of God, will he not see it executed and fulfilled in all
respects: as well with reference to his glory, as with reference to theirs?
shall his Counsel be accomplished in the one, and not in the other? do you
imagine that the Lord will be put off in such a fashion, that he will be
disappointed of his end and of his purpose in such a business as this is? No,
no, assuredly if he predestinate men, that they may be to the praise of his
glory, as well as that they may be glorified by him: to his praise, and to his
glory they shall be. And if they be not so at all, it is apparent they are not
predestined by him, and consequently they shall have no glory from him.

Now is it so, my Brethren, that whoever will be glorified with God

I beseech you think upon it; you, who by your lewd and vicious conversations
dishonor God continually: you who lie in wickedness, and wallow in
uncleanness, whose lives are full of nothing but profaneness, who are
conscious to your selves that God has not a whit of glory brought him by you,
unless ungodliness and sin will do it: To whom a man may truly say, as the
Apostle does to some, Romans 2.24. The name of God is blasphemed by your means:
do you expect that God should glorify you with himself in heaven, when you
have done nothing else but dishonored him on earth? believe it, he will be so
far from this, that seeing he has not been glorified by you, he will be
glorified upon you. He made you for his glory, and glory he will have, either
one way or another; he will not lose a farthing by you. And if he be not
glorified by your holy conversation, he will be glorified in your damnation,
and eternal ruin. And all the honor that you lose him here, he will fetch it
out again, and have his penny-worths upon you in the world to come. There you
must lie and burn, and there is no deliverance thence till you have paid the
utmost farthing.

Is it so, that whosoever will be glorified, etc. you then my Brethren, you
must make this your work and business, how you may glorify the Lord here, how
you may set him up, and show him in his beauty, and his luster to the world.
And though you can make no addition to him in himself, yet let this be your
endeavor all your days, to bring in some accruments to his honor among men,
that they may honor him the more by your means: that so when you come to die,
you may bespeak him, as our Savior does, when he was ready to be offered up.
We have glorified thee on earth, and now O Father, glorify us with thy self.

Now there are two ways especially, in which you may bring glory to the Lord;
either in a way of vocal declaration, or in a way of real representation: And
both these ways you must endeavor to bring glory to him here, if you desire to
have glory from him hereafter.





1. Let God be glorified in what you are; let his glory shine upon you by
reflection, according to the Prophets Exhortation, Isa. 60.1. Arise, and shine,
for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. Be you the
monuments of his praise, the emblems of his love, and of his mercy, the
standing pillars on which his goodness is engraven, to be read and seen of men.
Do you show forth the praises, or as we find it rendered in the margent, the
virtues of him that has called you, 1 Pet. 2.9. That every one that looks upon
you, and observes you, may see the goodness, and the grace, and holiness of God
in you. That they may say, if there be so much in the stream, what is there in
the spring and in the fountain? If there be so much in the beam, what is there
in the Sun of righteousness himself? If there be so much virtue in them that
are called, what is there then in him that has called them? This makes much
for Gods praise, and so indeed in showing forth the virtue, we show forth the
praise and the glory of him that has called us. He has made me (says the
Church) a polished shaft, a choice, a special, and a polished piece of work,
and said unto me, thou art my servant, in whom I will be glorified. When God
makes such curious pieces, and hangs them forth in the view of all the world,
he is glorified in them.

2. Let God be glorified, as in what you are, so in the second place, in what
you do, yea, in every thing you do. Let this be the utmost aim of all your
actions. Your acts of nature, as eating, or drinking, or the like, let these be
done with reference to Gods glory; as the Apostle Paul exhorts to eat and drink
to the glory of God, 1 Cor. 10.31. Your civil actions, your trading, dealing,
and commercing in the world, your buying, selling, giving, lending, your care
and labor in your calling, let these have the same end; You see the rule is
universal in the fore-alledged Text, whatsoever else you do. Your holy and
religious duties, let those have this aspect and aim, that you may glorify the
Lord, and not your selves in them. That when men see your good works, your
frequent hearing, praying, fasting, bounty to the poor Saints, they may
glorify not you the doers of them, but your Father which is in heaven. And in
a word, (my Brethren) no action is exempt from this direction. And hence says
the Apostle, 1 Pet. 4.11. If any speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God: if
any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, that God in
all things may be glorified, through Jesus Christ.

What then, it may be you will interpose and ask,

The rule (as you have heard) is universal:

A man may aim at nothing else, no other end, in opposition to his glory: all
such must of necessity be laid aside. But other ends may be intended in
subordination to it; they may be looked upon as far as they may be subservient
to this, which ought to be the ultimate, the utmost end of all our actions. A
man in his endeavors and painful labors in his calling, may aim at the
increase of his Estate: Not that he may be lifted up above his brethren, not
that he may consume it on his Lusts, or make it fuel to maintain his pride, or
his intemperance, or the like. These may not be his ends, because they stand in
opposition to the great and utmost end; but that God may be honored, while he
is not burthensom by his remissness and his negligence, (but rather has to
give to him that needs.) And while he makes provision for his family, and
those that have dependence on him: which he that provideth not for, is worse
then an Infidel. Thus we must make the very duties of our callings pay tribute
to the honor of our God, who keeps his servants, not as poor men do, for need;
but as rich and great men do, for their magnificence, and state, and glory. And
as the hatchet serves to make the pin, the pin to hold the timber, the timber
to receive the tyle, and all refers to this supreme and utmost end, to build
the house: we may aim at diverse ends, but all of them must be subservient, and
helping onward to this utmost end, the glory of God.

JOHN 17.4. I have finished the work which thou gave me to do.


AND thus far of the first thing which our Savior Christ had done, of which he
minds his Father, as an inducement to him to glorify him with himself. I have
glorified thee on earth.

The second follows now in order to be handled, which he proposes also for the
very same end, I have finished the work which thou gave me to do.

And here I shall take notice only of these two things: First, what it was that
Christ did, and then the manner how he did it. First, what it was that Christ
did, the work which God the Father had committed to him, which he had put into
his hands, which he had given him to do. And then the manner how he did it, he
did it absolutely and completely. He did not enter on it and desist again, he
did not give it over when he had begun; no, he followed and pursued it, till he
had brought it to perfection. I have finished the work which thou gave me to
do.

At this time I shall fasten on the first of these, what it was that Christ
did, the work which God the Father put into his hands, which he had given him
to do.

To give, is sometimes nothing else but to ordain, or to appoint, or to impose
a thing upon another. And therefore they that have the legislative power, are
said with us to give Law. That is, by their authority to enact it and impose it
on those that are subjected to their power. And to the same effect our Savior
Christ himself uses the very same expression, John 13.34. A new Commandment
give I unto you: because he laid it on them now by his authority, as he was
Mediator of the Church, and so accordingly the King and Ruler of his people. So
in my Text, you see, he makes mention of the works which God had given him to
do. That is, which he had laid upon him, and appointed him to do. The business
which he had designed him, ordained him, and enjoined him to dispatch in this
world. This was the work he was employed about, that which his Father ordered
him to do, he did. I have finished the work, says he, which thou gave me to
do. So that the point suggested here is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ was ordered by his Father, in the work he did in
this world.
The task which his Father set him, the work which his Father gave him, that he
did. As he was Man and Mediator, he did not do things of his own head (if I may
reverently express it so) no his eye was on his Father for direction. He looked
to have his Warrant and Authority for what he did. His Father gave him works
before he did them. And this is that which he professes very often, that he
came down from heaven, not to do his own will, but the will of him that sent
him, John 6.38. not to do his own works, but the works of him that sent him.
Yea, more then so, he tells us plainly, that a necessity in this respect is
laid upon him. I must work the works of him that sent me, John 9.4. And hence
he calls the works he did, and which he was employed about, his Fathers works,
John 10.37. And is content that all the credit which he had or looked to have
among the people, should be put to this issue, If I do not my Fathers works,
says he, believe me not. So that the works he did, you see, were his Fathers,
not his own. No doubt they were in this respect his own, that he was the
immediate agent of them. But in another way they were his Fathers, in that he
was the orderer and disposer of them. His they were, as being done by his
direction, and by his command. That Text is full and home to this purpose, and
parallel to this which I am handling, John 5.36. The works which the Father
gave me, the same works I do. These very works and no other.

So that you see, my Brethren, Jesus Christ was ordered, etc.

To open this a little further, the works of Jesus Christ, as he was Man and
Mediator, were principally and especially of two sorts. Either of satisfaction,
or of application. His works of satisfaction, by which he fully and completely
answered the Justice of his Father for the sins of all the world, if you
respect the Merit and the Value of these works of his. His works of
application, by which this satisfaction came to be applied, and so accordingly
to be effectual to such particular and individual men. Now in both these
works of his, he was ordered by his Father, as I shall show you briefly and in
order.

First he was ordered by his Father in his works of satisfaction; Those

1. Jesus Christ was ordered by his Father in his works of active obedience. He
did them by his Fathers rule, and in subjection to his Fathers Law. For though,
if you look downwards, he gave Law to others, and therefore he is called the
Lawgiver; yet on the other side, if you look upwards, he received Law from God
the Father. And therefore the Apostle says that he was (...), under the Law,
Gal. 4.4. That is, as some translations read it, subject to the Law. Subject to
the Ceremonial Law, and therefore circumcised. Subject to the Moral Law, and
therefore conversant in all the works and duties of holiness to God, and of
righteousness to man. And this not only as a Man, but as a Mediator and a
Surety in our stead. He sanctified himself, and lived holily, and consequently
in obedience to the Law and will of God for our sakes. What the Law could not
do in us, it did in Christ, as the Apostle Paul intimates, Romans 8.3. It could
not make us perfectly obedient, but it made Christ so. It could not be
fulfilled in us, but it was fulfilled in Christ, and by Christ, in our stead,
and for our sakes.

He lived exactly by his Fathers Rule and Law in every thing; his works were
always regulated by his Fathers will, and therefore he is said to do them in
his Fathers name, John 10.25. that is, by his authority, and according to his
pleasure and command. It is my meat and drink, says he, when he was so intent
upon the business of saving the poor woman of Samaria, to do the will of him
that sent me, and to finish his work; John 4.34.

2. Jesus Christ was ordered by his Father, as in his works of active, so in
his works of passive obedience: He did what he would have him do in both these.
And therefore when he was about to suffer, and when the nature which he had
assumed was averse, he came at length to this Conclusion, not my will, but
thine be done: Mat. 26.39. Father, if it be possible, says he, let this cup
pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou will. Here it is evident,
he did his Fathers will, and not his own. And therefore it is said, He became
obedient to the death, even the death of the Cross, Phil. 2.8. To show that he
submitted to it, in obedience to the Father; And therefore when the Article of
death was come, which was the complement of his passive obedience, he cried
out, It is finished -- The work which I have undertaken, and which the Father
imposed upon me, is accomplished and dispatched. Just as he tells the Father in
my Text, when he was about to suffer; I have finished the work which thou
gave me to do. In this respect is that expression of our Savior, John 16.10.
The Spirit (says he) will convince the world of righteousness, that is, full
and perfect righteousness wrought out by me for all my people. And why so?
because, says he, I go to my Father, and ye see me no more. If I had not
performed the work of my obedience absolutely and completely; if I had not done
enough to satisfy the justice of my Father for the sins of all my Members, and
so to justify them, and to make them fully righteous, you should be sure to
see me again. If I had not done, and suffered all that I was appointed and
designed to do before my going up to God the Father, he would be sure to send
me down again among you; But now, because I go and stay with him; because I go
to my Father, and you see me no more; you may be confident that all is well,
that I have ended all the business that my Father has ordered me to finish and
dispatch in this world.

So that you see, my brethren, Christ was ordered by his Father in his works of
satisfaction: whether they were works of active, or whether they were works of
passive obedience.



1. First, In his outward promulgation of the Word, or in his preaching, Jesus
Christ was wholly ordered by his Father. He appointed him precisely, both to
whom he should preach, and what he should preach: First, He appointed him to
whom he should preach, and that was not to the Gentiles, but to the people of
the Jews only. And hence said Christ to the woman of Canaan, Mat. 15.24. I am
not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel: As he was sent by God
the Father, so he appointed him to whom he should go, and what he should say:
He was the Fathers Messenger, the Fathers spokesman to the world, and therefore
he put words into his mouth: In which respect it is, that God is said to speak
unto us by the Son, Heb. 1.2. The Son does not speak himself, he does not speak
his own thoughts, as he is man and Mediator, but God speaks to us by him. So
that he speaks his Fathers mind, he publishes his Fathers will and pleasure to
the world. In which respect our Savior says, my doctrine is not mine, but his
that sent me, John 7.16. See how the Father orders him in this business: Mat.
12.18. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
quench, until he send forth judgment into victory. And so accordingly our
Savior tells us, that his Father had appointed him, both that he should preach,
and what he should preach. He has anointed me to preach, (says he) Isa. 61.1.
to preach, what? good tidings to the meek, to proclaim liberty to the Captives,
and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to proclaim the
acceptable year of the Lord. And this order of the Fathers he obeyed, and
therefore it is much to be observed, that he begun his public Ministry with
this; The first Sermon he preached in Nazareth, his own Country, was upon this
Text, as you may see, Luke 4.18.

2. Secondly, Jesus Christ was ordered by his Father, as in that work of
application of his satisfaction, which is done in the external promulgation of
the Word: so in that work of application of it, which is done by the internal
operation of the Spirit. He did not by his Spirit draw any to himself, nor work
faith in the hearts of any, that so his satisfaction might be actually applied
to them, but only those that were appointed to it by his Father. Those whom his
Father gave hm by Election, whom he designed him to justify, and sanctify,
and save, those he saved, and no others. Our Savior Christ as he was man, was
not to choose whom he would make partakers of his satisfaction, to whom he
would apply the merits of his passion: no, he must take such as his Father was
contented to bestow upon him. That place is notable to this purpose, John 6.37,
38. All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and I will raise them up,
and give them everlasting life: all them, and only them. And why so? For I came
down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. My
own will as I am man, would carry me to justify and save a greater number. But
in this I must be ordered, I must remember I am come to do my Fathers will, and
not my own, and therefore I must be contented with those whom he is pleased to
allot me. I am come that they might have life (says Jesus Christ) John 10.10.
They, who? why his sheep, as he explains it both before and after, I am the
do^r of the sheep, and I am come, that they may have life. And at verse 27. My
sheep hear my voice, and I give unto them eternal life. But how comes Christ by
these sheep? why by his Fathers own gift. And therefore it is added in the very
next words, My Father which gave them me, is greater than all. So that it is as
if our Savior Christ had said, I am dispatched into the lower world, to save
those whom the Father has bestowed upon me. All them, and none but them. I
must be wholly ruled by him in this business.

By this time, I suppose, the point is fully cleared, That Jesus Christ was
ordered by his Father, etc. And it was fit he should be so: the reasons of
congruity are such as these.

esse, and its operari. And therefore seeing Jesus Christ, if you respect his
humane nature, is a Creature, it stands with reason that he should be wholly
regulated and disposed according to the pleasure of his Father.

Behold my servant. And servants are to do their Masters will, and not their
own, they are in every thing to be ordered by their Master. And therefore it is
very notable, that God the Father having called our Savior servant, speaks
of him so, as one that would be regulated and disposed by him. Behold my
servant, whom I uphold, he shall show judgment to the Gentiles, he shall not
strive nor cry, etc. A bruised reed he shall not break, and so on. Thus and
thus he shall do, and this he shall not do, says God the Father: He is my
servant, and I will order him at my pleasure; And so our Savior Christ himself
professes upon all occasions, that he will be obedient to the Father, as a
servant ought to be, and that he will do nothing any otherwise then he would
have him.

He loved us, and gave himself for us. To offer up himself, Heb. 7.27. To
humble himself, and become obedient (conceive it passively obedient) to the
death, yea, the death of the Cross. So that he was not forced in this respect,
you see, to obey his Fathers order. He was not humbled and made obedient, but
he humbled himself, and became obedient, and that to the death. And this he
clearly intimates in that speech of his Joh. 10.18. No man takes my life from
me, I have power to lay it down (that is, to lay it down of choice and free
election, so that I cannot be constrained to it) and I have power to take it up
again. And certainly if he had power to take it up again when he had lost it,
then he had much more power to keep it while he had it. And hence his death is
called a sacrifice, because he voluntarily submitted to it. He gave himself for
us an offering and a sacrifice to God. This death of his arose not out of the
Condition of his Nature, neither was it inflicted on him by an excess of
strength in those that brought him to it. But he submitted to it in obedience
to his Father, and in love to his people. Ah, my Beloved, what a miracle of
mercy was there in this Condescension? That Jesus Christ should stoop in this
to be ordered by his Father. His obedience to the death, the death of the
Cross, was not of necessary duty, as his obedience to the Law was, for that his
very Nature called for, but it was of humility. He stooped below himself in
this obedience, he humbled himself and became obedient.

And now my Brethren should not we stoop, and should not we be humbled as
Christ was? The Father ordered him to suffer for us, and he readily and
willingly obeyed that order. Suppose he order us to suffer for our Savior
Christ again, shall we not willingly obey his order too as Christ did? Shall
Christ take up his Cross for us, and shall not we take up our Cross for him? I
do not say we should draw crosses and afflictions on our selves, but if they
come upon us for our Saviors sake, we should not take them as imposed on us,
but we should set our shoulders to them, and cheerfully submit our selves to
bear them.

But oh the tenderness of men to suffer any thing for Christ? If crosses, and
afflictions, and persecutions come upon them for his sake, how do they murmur
and repine? Ah my Beloved, remember the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
when he was equal to God, he humbled himself and became obedient, etc. And will
you grumble at a little shame, a little trouble, a little loss of outward
things for his sake? Oh my Beloved, learn at length to be ordered as Christ
was. To suffer willingly for him, who suffered willingly for you. And to make
you willing to it, I shall present you but with two Considerations.

1. First though you should suffer much, remember yet the time of suffering is
not long. The season from our Saviors Incarnation even to the final
dissolution of the World, as some expound it, is but an hour, as the Apostle
John calls it. And alas what are our lives, but as it were a little minute of
that hour? And shall we be so facile and tender, to sink under so short a
suffering? I say to you of suffering as once our Savior Christ of watching.
Can you not suffer with him one hour? What, is your patience out so soon, will
it not hold for one hour? Are you so quickly weary of so short a Cross? Oh be
ashamed of such unworthy Cowardice as this is.

2. Consider, if you suffer with him (conceive it willingly and in sincerity)
you shall also reign with him, 2 Timothy 2.12. There is no ordinary way to come to
reign with Christ hereafter, but by suffering with him here, and by suffering
willingly as he did. For if you do it of necessity, and of constraint (as the
Apostle tells us in another case) you have your reward. But if you suffer
willingly as he did, then you shall reign as he does. And though you be not
worthy, yet you shall be counted worthy of the Kingdom for which you suffer, as
the Apostle Paul speaks, 2 These. 1.5.

I am come down from heaven, says our Savior, not to do my own will, but the
will of him that sent me. And this is the Fathers will, that of all which he
has given me I should lose nothing, Joh. 6.39. I am precisely ordered to see
that not a man of them perish. As for the rest they may, they must be lost for
me, it is not in my power to help them. All that the Father gives him he can
keep and save, further then this his Commission does not reach. No doubt the
will of Jesus Christ, as he was Man, would have carried him to save those whom
his Father had appointed to destruction. But he must stoop in this to the will
of him that sent him. There is no question if he had been free in this regard,
he would have pitched upon his own Countrymen, his own Allies, his own Kindred
before others. But the Evangelist observes, he came to his own (among them he
began his Ministry) but he did no good there, his own received him not. And
therefore you shall find it in his story, that as man he was extremely troubled
at the unbelief and hardness of the peoples hearts. He wept over Jerusalem with
many tears. Why, you will say, what needed this, he might have wrought upon
them, and converted them, and saved them. No my Beloved, he could not do it, he
had no order for it from his Father. This belonged not to the work which he had
given him to do. And yet as Man he pitied and lamented their condition, as we
should do in such a case, he being in all things like unto us, sin only
excepted. And certainly this pity over lost Creatures was no sin.

Now this me thinks should overcome and melt the hearts of Reprobates
themselves to Jesus Christ, and make them to relent toward him. Alas he
pitties you, and mourns over you: his very bowels yern toward you: he delights
not in your ruin and destruction. No, he has such a tender heart (though
yours be hard) that it is troublesome and grievous to him. But why then does he
not relieve and help us, you will say? Why he has no order for it. His Father
has appointed him to whom, and whom alone he shall apply the merits of his
passion, and you perhaps are none of that number. So that it is not any of the
business that he came into the world about to save you. The work of your
salvation is not given him to do, and if it be not given him, he cannot do it;
so that the fault is not in Jesus Christ, if any of you perish and be lost for
ever. Neither is there any reason why you should be exasperated and incensed
against him.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ was ordered by his Father in the work, etc.

First some do the good which God has not given them to do; the Vzziah did,
was for the matter of it very good. The incense which he meant to offer was
such as was prescribed in the Law, the place in which he meant to offer was the
Temple, the Altar upon which he meant to offer, was consecrated to the Lord,
the God to whom he went to offer was the true God. But he was not a person
qualified and fit to offer, he was not called to that service. This good work
was not given him to do. And therefore God was very angry with him, and he was
stricken with a foul disease. The like we see exemplified in Saul, the error
was not in the Sacrifice he offered, nor in the object of his offering, the
person unto whom he offered, but only in the person that did offer; The work
was good, but it was not his work, he had no order for the doing of it, and
therefore he was utterly ejected from the Kingdom, 1 Samuel 13.13. There are some
works that belong to some callings as proper and peculiar to them. Some works
that are peculiar to the Magistrate, or else the Magistrate has no distinct
calling. Some works that are peculiar to the Minister, or else the Minister
has no distinct calling, For that is no distinct calling that has not some
distinct work. Some works there are which God has given to the Magistrate, as
a Magistrate, to do. Some works there are which God has given to the Minister,
as a Minister, to do, and these works, they that are not called to them may not
do. Or if they do, when they have ended them, they cannot say to God as Christ
does, I have finished the work which thou gave me to do.

Secondly, as some do the good which God has not given them to do, themselves
a mind to do, that they are employed in. They are a rule unto themselves, and
walk according to their own counsels. They follow the way of their own hearts,
and the sight of their own eyes. They are not guided by the will of God, but by
the will of man, and the will of the flesh, as it is called 1 John 13. which
stands in opposition to the will of God. God may order what he will, and they
will do what they please. For tell me, my Beloved, when you swear, and when you
are unclean, and when you run out to all excess of riot, when you profane the
Sabbaths, and the Ordinances of the Lord, when you do things that are
apparently and grossly evil, which admit of no excuse. Are these the works
which God has given you to do? Can you look him in the face and tell him so?
When you lie, and when you cozen, and deceive, do you these things by his
order? No my Beloved, no such matter: This is the will of God, even your
sanctification, that as he who has called you is holy, so you should be holy
in all manner of conversation. And therefore while you wallow in your lusts,
while you defile your selves with every sin, you do not follow Gods order, you
do not walk by his rule, but are a rule unto your selves. I wish that such
would seriously consider but these two things.

Gentiles, Act. 10.16. to wallow in their own ways, the ways which of
themselves they choose and follow. This is a formidable thing indeed. And
therefore he is wont to execute this in the close of all, as the heaviest of
his judgments, as having nothing left but this to show the fierceness of his
wrath and fury on a person, or a people. When he has proved and tried men
every way, and nothing will prevail with them, this is the last, the parting
blow, he gives them over to themselves, and so he leaves them, And this is
certainly the worst that the Almighty God can do to them.

Depart you cursed into everlasting fire, will you be able to resist and to
disobey that order? Will you be able to control him, and hinder him from
executing the sentence of the Law upon you? No, no, you break the bonds and
cords of God here, but then the Lord will bind you fast enough, in everlasting
chains of darkness, break and rent them if you can. The haughtiness of men
shall be brought low, and God alone shall be exalted in that day. And therefore
I beseech you, my Beloved, eye the Lord in all your ways, and see what work it
is that he gives you to do. Be sure he give it you before you do it. And this
indeed is to be men after Gods own heart, when you do Gods will. I have found
David, says the Lord, Psalm. 89.20. called, Act. 13.22. A man after my own
heart, who will do all my wills. And if you thus do, God will own you in the
latter day, and liberally reward you too. After you have done the will of God,
you shall receive the promise, that is, the happiness and mercy promised, Heb.
10.36. In doing of your own will, or the wills of other men, perhaps you may
attain some transitory riches, pleasures, honors, poor fleeting things, which
in the end will perish with you. But if you do the will of God, this will
perpetuate and Eternize you, and make you to endure for evermore, 1 John 2.17.
The world passes away, and the lusts thereof, but he that does the will of God
abides for ever.

JOHN 17.4. I have finished the work which thou gave me to do.


AND thus far of the first Particular considered in the words, what it was that
Christ did, the work which God had given him to do.

The Second follows now in order to be handled, viz. The manner how he did it;
he did it absolutely and completely, I have finished the work which thou gave
me to do.

(...), I have made an end of it. Now a work is ended then, when it is so
dispatched, that there is no remainder of it to be done. When there is nothing
left of it imperfect and unfinished. So that there can be nothing added to it
any way, to make it more accomplished and complete. And this is that which
Jesus Christ affirms of himself, in relation to the work that was committed
to him of his Father, says he, I have gone through with it, I have finished
the work which thou gave me to do, or I have brought it to a full end.

But had he so completed it, and ended it indeed, when he put up this
supplication to his Father? Was there no remainder of it to be done? Why, the
great work of all was yet behind, the offering of himself upon the Cross, as an
oblation and Sacrifice to God the Father. He had not yet laid down his life for
his people. Yet this he was designed to do, his Father had appointed him to
tread the Wine Press of his wrath, and to become an offering for sin. In which
respect the holy Ghost affirms of him, that it behoved Christ to suffer.
There was a necesse in it, because it was the Fathers pleasure that it should
be so, it was the work that he had given him to do, and how then says our
Savior here, before his passion, and before his suffering, I have finished the
work which thou gave me to do.

To this Interpreters give various answers, according to their various
apprehensions of our Saviors meaning in the words. Some think he speaks by way
of prophecy, and so makes mention of that which was indeed to come, as if it
had been past already, which is a very usual thing in Scripture; In such a
manner spoke the holy Prophet David, as a Type or Figure of our Savior, long
before him, Psalm. 22.16. They have pierced my hands and feet, my garments they
have parted, and cast lots upon my vesture. They had not done it then, but it
is spoken by anticipation. And so our Savior, I have finished the work which
thou have given me to do. I am about it, and I shall as certainly go through
with it, as if it were already perfect and consummate.

Others conceive our Saviors meaning to be only this, I have finished the
work, viz. in purpose and in preparation. In that I have laid the groundwork
and foundation of it, I have assumed the humane nature, I have preached the
Gospel freely, I have by my Reproofs and Miracles, and many other ways
sufficiently exasperated and enraged the Jews to crucify me, and so to make an
end of this business. And consequently I have done as much as lies in me to
finish it, and to bring it to perfection.

The plainest and most genuine Exposition, (as it shows to me) is that of
Calvin, which Beza and some others after him have rested in. And it is to this
purpose, I have finished the work, that is, as if our Savior Christ had said,
I have as good as finished it. My death and passion is at hand, I am now ready
to be offered up, so that my work is upon the matter ended. And thus because
the Consummation of it was so near approaching, he minds his Father of it, as a
thing that was already perfectly accomplished, and fulfilled. I have finished
the work which thou gave me to do.

Well then, my Brethren, finish it he did, you see he pleads it to his Father,
and so accordingly the Point on which I shall insist is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ did not do his work by halves, but he went through
with the business that was committed to him by his Father.
He did not enter on it and desist again, he did not give it over when he had
begun, and leave it incomplete and inconsummate. No, he followed and pursued
it, till he had made an end of it, till he had brought it to perfection. It is
his own assertion of himself, who is the faithful and the true witness, and
that in Prayer to his Father, I have finished the work which thou gave me to
do. So that we need no other testimony to induce us to believe it.

He tells us in another place, that it was his meat and drink to do the the
will of him that sent him, and to finish his work, Joh. 4.34. He was about the
work of the Conversion of the woman of Samaria, and many of the people of the
City with her, and he was so intent upon it, that he would neither eat nor
drink, till he had done it. And as the Father put his work into his hands, to
this end, that he might go through with it, and dispatch it, as he himself
acknowledges, John 5.36. Where he styles it, the work which God had given him
to finish, so he did accordingly. And therefore when he came to die, he cried
out, it is finished, John 19.30. The work of Gods Commission, and of Man's
Redemption and Salvation is accomplished, so that I have no more to do in this
world. In which respect perhaps is that expression, Heb. 2.10. It became him
for whom are all things (that is the Father) to make the Captain of our
Salvation perfect through sufferings. Perfect as a Mediator, and as a
reconciler between God and Man, because when he had suffered once, his work was
perfect, so that there could be nothing added to it to make it more consummate
and complete. The point is plain, etc.

Yea, but it seems there was something yet behind, Col. 1.24. I now rejoice in
my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions, or
sufferings of Christ. All was not finished then it seems, it was not so
completely ended, but there needed some addition.

For clearing this, my Brethren, you must know there is a twofold passion of
Christ, the one in his proper and natural,

The first sort of sufferings may be styled (...) the former afflictions of
Christ endured in his own flesh, of which we have read at the 22. ver. You has
he reconciled through death in the body of his flesh. The latter sort are
called (...), the after afflictions of Christ, endured in the flesh of his
members, in the verse now cited. I fill up that which is behind of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh.

Now, my Beloved, there is nothing behind of that first sort of sufferings of
Christ, endured in his own flesh, for the Redemption of the Church. There is
nothing wanting to them, there is no such indigency or failing in them, as to
need a supplement or a supply by the after afflictions of Martyrs or Saints.
No, my Beloved, the Passion of our Savior is complete and full, he finished it
himself upon the Cross. It was the last word that he spoke, before he yielded
up his soul into the hands of God the Father. And since it was his last, his
dying word, the sin were the greater, if we should not believe him.

But there is much behind of the latter sort of sufferings of Christ, endured
in the flesh of his members. And these are more and more completed every day.
For even as the Father did determine the number and measure of the sufferings
of Christ, which he should endure in his natural body, which he accordingly
accomplished and fulfilled. So he has also determined the number and measure
of the sufferings of Christ in his mystical body, which they accordingly, must
accomplish and fulfill. So that every persecution and affliction that any of
his members suffer, abates the number and the tale, lesseneth the heap of those
afflictions. And hence it was that the Apostle Paul rejoiced, because he filled
up that which was behind of the sufferings of Christ in his mystical body. This
comforts me and cheers me yet, that by the trials and the troubles that are now
upon me, I make up the remainder of the sufferings which God the Father has
appointed Christ to undergo, although not in himself, yet in his members. I
rejoice in my sufferings, because I fill up that which is behind of the
afflictions of Christ in my flesh.

etc. they are severely to be censured then, who come in with their additions
to the works of Christ; and go about to botch it up with their supplies. As if
he had not done what he professes to his Father in my Text, but had left his
work imperfect: So that it needed any thing which they can either do or suffer,
to finish it and make it perfect.

And here the Papists are not only faulty, who make up the work of Christ, and
fill it out with the invented superfluities of the sufferings of their Martyrs
and the merits of their Saints. As if he had not done enough himself to make us
perfect, to satisfy the justice of his Father for us.

But even many of the Saints themselves sometimes, though they believe that
Jesus Christ has finished the work of their Redemption, and that it needs no
Supplement in any kind, much less that any thing that they can do, can make the
least addition to it, yet are insensibly betrayed, they know not how, into a
kind of joining of their duties with him, in the work of their Redemption and
Salvation. For this they do in some degree, while they expect to be accepted
with the Lord, and to be justified and saved, the rather for their works and
duties. And therefore when they seriously consider with themselves, how they
shall have their sins forgiven them, how they shall be admitted into Gods
favor, they are not satisfied to look upon the work that Christ has done, to
make him all in all in this business, but they must also cast an eye on that
which they themselves have done. And when they think upon their own
enlargements; their deep humiliations, their earnest and incessant labors in
the service of the Lord, they do, they know not how, put then in with Jesus
Christ as joint Saviors. Much has been said of late against duty, so much,
that it has been more slighted and neglected then it ought to be. That which I
speak is not against the doing of it, but against the mixing of it with the
work of Jesus Christ. The setting of our posts by his posts, and our works by
his works. Ah, my Beloved; let us be extremely shie of this, let us not so
dishonor Jesus Christ, as if he had not done enough to justify us, and to
gain acceptance for us: But since he has finished the work himself, and done
it perfectly; Oh let us trust him perfectly for Redemption and Salvation; let
us rely on what he has done, and resolve with the Apostle, that we are
complete in him, Col. 2.10. so that we stand in need of no addition. When we
are thinking how we shall be satisfied, sanctified, justified in this world,
and saved in the world to come. Though we have lived like Angels, and done
religious duties, as if we were in Heaven already, let us bid all this stand
by, and cry out with the holy Martyr in the flames, None but Christ, none but
Christ.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ did not do his works by halves, etc. Then Job
says, The upright man does; Let us not give over all again, as some have done
in these times. Let us not be weary of well doing; No, as we have begun to
work, and as we have wrought hitherto, so let us work still, till we have
finished all the work that God has given us to do; and let our last work be
more then our first. And to this end, I beseech you carefully to weigh these
few things.

First, If we finish not our work, and if we do not end well, it argues They
that are planted in the house of God, says David, shall flourish in the Courts
of our God, they shall bring forth more fruit in their age, Psalm 92.13, 14.
And hence it is observed by the Holy Ghost of the best of Gods servants, that
they never showed such Zeal, and Faithfulness, and Diligence in the work of the
Lord, as when they drew near their end, and when they saw their time was ready
to expire. As Jacob, Moses, Joshuah, David, Peter showed more care of Gods
Church, and more zeal for Gods Glory toward their end, then they had ever done
before. Yea, Our Savior Christ himself was never so much in prayer, so
painful and affectionate in comforting, and in instructing his Disciples, as
he was when he was ready to be offered up. He wrought the works of him that
sent him while it was day, as his own expression is, While the day of life
lasted, John 9.4. And therefore so let us too. His unwearied diligence is very
notable. Luke 21.37, 38. In the day time he was teaching in the Temple, and at
night he went into the Mount of Olives, where he retired himself to prayer. And
all the people came early to him in the morning, in the Temple, for to hear him.

If you finish not your work, and if you go not through with your I have
glorified thee upon the earth. How so, might God reply? Why, I have finished
the work that thou gave me to do; I have not entered on it only, and carried
it along awhile, but I have brought it to perfection. God is never glorified,
but by finishing his Works. To begin, and then fall back, is to put God and
Christ to shame.

Thirdly, If you finish not your work, as you dishonor God and Christ, The
salt that has lost its savor, is good for nothing, says our Savior, but to
be cast out with contempt, and to be trodden under feet of all men, Mat. 5.13.

Your active obedience is as it were forgotten with God, unless you continue,
Ezekiel. 18.24. So is your passive, if you fail in Perseverance. Your sufferings
are in vain, as the Apostle speaks to the Galatians, Gal. 3.4. In a word, It is
constancy in doing and suffering that crowns a Christian; It is not promised
to Beginners, but to such as continue: Beloved, Here are many of you that have
done many things, and suffered many things for God. Many that have taken pains
in holy Duties, in Hearing, Praying, Fasting, etc. Oh let not all be cast away,
let not all that you have done or suffered be in vain. I say as the Apostle,
John 2.8. Lose not the things that you have wrought. It is a sad and lamentable
thing to see a man come home even to Heaven-gate, and for want of one step
more, to tumble back again into Hell.

He that continues to the end, shall be saved, Mat. 24.13. If you be faithful
to the death, you shall receive the Crown of life, Apoc. 2.10. And if you thus
hold out in Gods work, till the Period of your lives, when you shall come to
die, you may conclude with God as Christ does, I have finished the work which
thou gave me to do, and now O Father, Glorify me with thy self. And you may
sing your dying song with the Apostle, 2 Timothy 4.7. I have fought a good fight,
I have finished my course, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of
Righteousness, which God the righteous Judge shall give me.

And thus we have at length dispatched three of the Arguments, with which our
Savior presses, and enforces the great Petition that he makes to God the
Father. And we are now descended to the fourth and last, and it is drawn Ab
aequo, from the Equity of that which he petitions for, and the right he had to
it: Nay, He affirms, that he had not only Jus ad rem, but more then so, he
had Jus in re too. He had not only Right and Title to the Glory which he prays
he may be made Partaker of, but he had the possession of it, and that from all
Eternity.

JOHN 17.5. And now, O Father, Glorify me with thy own self, with the Glory
which I had with thee before the world was.


SO that our Savior pleads Prescription for the Glory he desires, and for
which he is a Suitor in my Text: he had it, as he tells the Father here, time
out of mind, indeed before all time, before the world was. And therefore though
he has in some respect been out of the possession of it for awhile, he hopes
he shall recover it again with his Fathers good liking.

The only difficulty lies in this, what Glory Jesus Christ intends in this
place, whether the Glory of his Godhead, or the Glory of his Manhood, of his
divine or humane nature. And it will be the harder to resolve, because against
either of them there is appearingly a very strong exception. It should seem he
could not mean the Glory of his Godhead, for that he had never lost. A man
would think he would not mean the Glory of his Manhood, for that he never had,
and therefore could not pray for the Recovery, or the Restitution of the one,
or of the other; he could not say to God the Father, with relation to his
Godhead, Glorify me with the Glory which I had with thee before the world
was, because he had that Glory with the Father still; when he made that Prayer,
he was coequal, co-essential with him still, and consequently he was
infinitely glorious with him still. He could not say with relation to his
Manhood, Glorify me with the Glory which I had with thee before the world
was, because the humane nature came to have a being but a little while ago. It
was assumed by our Savior many ages since the world was, and so could have no
Glory with the Father before the world was. So that it cannot be intended of
the Godhead, or the Manhood, if you take either of them severally and
distinctly by it self.

Its true the Godhead of our Savior seemed to be divested of the Glory which
it had from everlasting, when he assumed the mean condition of a servant, and
so in that respect he might desire the restitution of it; but if you mark it
well, the Godhead never lost the Glory which it had with God the Father,
though it might seem to lose the Glory which it had with men. It was not
humbled really, but in regard of declaration only, and that with reference to
men, and not to God, who is not carried by appearances. And that which Christ
desires, is, that his Father would glorify him with himself, with the same
Glory which he had with him before the world was.

Besides, Our Savior prays as man, and not as God, (for God does not worship
God,) and it is incongruous that the Manhood should become a Suitor for any
thing to be conferred upon the Godhead.

And therefore to avoid the rocks on either side, the sum of this Petition of
our Savior to his Father must be this, that as his Godhead had been glorious
with himself from everlasting, so now his Manhood might be glorious too. That
the Glory which he had as God, together with the Father from Eternity, might be
communicated to his Manhood, so far as it was capable of it, in such a measure
as it could receive it. That God would raise him up, and set him in his humane
nature, at his own right hand in heavenly places, and make him glorious, even
as he was man, in the eyes of all the world. And this is clearly that which
Christ intends in his Prayer here, And now O Father, Glorify me with thine
own self, with the Glory which I had with thee before the world was: Glorify
me with thy self as I am man, or as I am God-man, with the Glory I had with
thee as I am God, before the world was. I was glorious with thy self, as I am
God from Everlasting, and now let me be glorious with thee as I am God and Man
too. In one nature I was glorious from Eternity, viz. in my divine Nature, and
now let me be glorified in my divine and humane Nature too, let me be glorified
in my person.

Now this Petition of our Savior (you must consider) did undoubtedly prevail
with God the Father; for he was always heard in every thing that he desired of
him; his Father never put him off with a denial. And then the point to be
observed, is this.

DOCTRINE. That even the Manhood of our Savior participateth of the Glory
whereof the Godhead has been seized together with the Father from Eternity.
Jesus Christ as he is man, shares in some measure and proportion in the Glory
of the Godhead. There is a social Glory (as the Schoolmen call it) of our
Saviors humane Nature, which it partaketh with the Godhead, and which it
could not have without it. The Glory which the Godhead had alone from
Everlasting, is now communicated to the person, consisting of the two Natures,
both of the Godhead, and the Manhood too. God has highly exalted him, says
the Apostle, Phil. 2.9. Him, Who? why Jesus Christ both God and Man, in his
divine and humane Nature. As for the former, his divine Nature, though that be
utterly incapable of an intrinsical improvement of the Glory of it, yet so far
forth as it was humbled for the Administration of his Office, so far it was
accordingly advanced again. Now he abased himself as he was God, not by putting
off his Glory, but by permitting it to be ecclipsed and overshadowed with the
similitude of sinful flesh, and to be humbled under the form of a servant,
even as the brightness of a Candle is hidden in a dark and close Lanthorn; so
that declaratorily he is in that respect exalted, he is declared to be the Son
of God by Power, in rising from the dead, and returning to his Glory.

As for the humane Nature that is properly exalted: For being joined to the
Godhead, it has an ample and immediate claim to all the Glory, which from the
Godhead might be communicated to it, and conferred upon it. So that however,
while our Savior Christ continued here, the Exigence of the condition, and the
office which he had assumed and undertaken, made him a man of sorrows and of
sufferings, and intercepted as it were the beams of the divine Glory from
shining in the other nature, so that there was no form nor beauty in him. Yet
having finished that Dispensation, there was by virtue of the intimate
Association of the Manhood with the Godhead, a giving out, or a Communication
of all the Glory from the Deity which the other Nature was capable of. And this
is that which Jesus Christ desires of his Father in my Text: And even as by
the Spirit of Holiness he was filled with Treasure of Wisdom, and Knowledge,
and Grace, and thereby fitted for the office of a Mediator, and made the Head
and Ruler of the Church. So likewise by the Spirit of Glory, he is filled with
unmatchable perfections, beyond the Comprehensions of all other Creatures.
Being not only full of Glory, but having in him all the fullness of Glory, which
a created nature, joined to an infinite and endless fountain, could receive.
The Godhead of our Savior was at the right hand of the Father from Eternity.
But now the Manhood of our Savior is exalted to the same condition. I say not
to the same measure, but to the same condition of Majesty and Glory with it.
God has raised him from the dead, (and that you know must be as he is man) and
set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, Ephesians. 1.20. That is, he set
him up above all other things or persons, in the next place to himself. And
therefore it is added in the following words, Far above all Principality, and
Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but in that which is to come. In which respect it is that God will have
him worshipped with divine and religious Adoration, and that by the very
Angels, Heb. 1.6. Of which the humane Nature single is not capable, but that it
shines with the Godhead in this high Glory.

Much might be added for the proof of this, that even the Manhood of our
Savior participateth of the Glory whereof, etc.

Now to open it a little more particularly and distinctly to you. Beloved, you
must know that the Manhood of our Savior comes not by nature to partake of
this Glory. Look upon the humane Nature as considered in it self, and so it
has no right to it. It is by Grace then that the Glory of the Godhead is
communicated to it; and that by a double Grace, the Grace of Union, and the
Grace of Dispensation.

First, The Manhood of our Savior participateth of the Glory of

Secondly, The Manhood of our Savior participateth of the glory Peter notes,
Acts 3.13. The God of our Fathers has glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye
delivered up, and denied the holy one. Though you abused him, and abased him,
yet God has glorified him. It is by him, and his means that he is raised to
such Glory.

etc. Here then we may take notice of the high Advancement of our nature in the
person of our Savior. The very Glory of the Godhead is in a sense
communicated to it. Our nature shareth with the Godhead in such incomparable
and transcendent Glory, as can by no means be expressed. It is many ways advanced
and set up in Jesus Christ; But this, my Brethren, is the height and top of
all that in him dwells, the fullness of the Godhead bodily, as the Apostle
speaks, Col. 2.9. Not that the Godhead is confined, or circumscribed within
the narrow limits of our Saviors flesh, or that his body is co-extended with
the Godhead, as Ubiquitaries dream. But the Godhead dwells in Christ, as
Bernard speaks, not umbrative, by external signs, and shadows, and tokens of
his presence, as once Christ dwelt in the material Temple: not effective, by
the effects and operations of its Grace, as now it dwells in the bodies of the
Saints, who in the same respect are called the Temples of God. But in him dwells
the God head bodily, that is, really united to the humane nature, to the body
of our Savior; And herein Christ has no Peer. It is an high and matchless
honor, which no other Creature is capable of. By which our nature is advanced
in him above all other things and persons in the world besides.

etc. Then as we may take notice here of the advancement of the nature, so of
our personal advancement too, as many of us as belong to Christ. For all the
Glory of the Godhead, with which the Manhood shines, is for us, and our
advantage. If he sanctify himself, it is for our sakes, as his own expression
is. And so if he glorify himself, it is for our sakes too. It is for our sakes
that he prays, And now, O Father, Glorify me with thy self, with the Glory,
etc. For all his Mediatour-ship throughout is with some respect to us. And so
it is for our sakes that this unparalelled and matchless Glory is conferred
upon him. Why, you will ask me, what is our advantage by it? I answer, It is
very great, for we poor men (if we be members of the Lord Christ,) do share in
this incomparable Glory of the Manhood of our Savior, and that partly in
fruition, and partly in assured expectation.

First, Partly in Fruition, for the present we share in this incomparable Glory
of the Manhood of our Savior. For as the Manhood of our Savior shareth in
the glory of the Godhead; so we, my Brethren, share in the Glory communicated
from the Godhead to the Manhood of our Savior, by reason of our Union to
them both in the person of Christ Jesus. And even as we are punished, in that
Christ is punished; and sanctified, in that Christ is sanctified; so we are
glorified, in that Christ is glorified. We shine with the incomparable and
dazzling Luster of the Godhead, in that Christ shines with it. And as we sit in
Christ in heavenly places, Ephesians. 2.6. so we are glorified in Christ with the
same glory which he had with God the Father before the world was, because he is
invested with it, as our Head in our flesh, on our behalf. In him God (having
raised him up, and glorified him, he) has glorified us with the very same
glory. In him we took possession of it. So near and so indissoluble is the
union between Christ and us, that the Divine and Godlike glory wherewithal he
shines is truly ours. The members cannot choose but share in the glory of the
head.

Secondly, we share in this incomparable glory of the Manhood of our Phil.
3.21. And this should have a double operation and effect upon us.

1. First it should make us to despise the shame of this world, though we be
trampled under foot, and made the dung and the offscouring of the Earth; as
this is many times the portion of the Saints, our spirits should not droop or
sink within us. No, we should bear them up, in spite of all the ignominy and
contempt that men pour out upon us, and all the venom that they spit against
us. We should endure the reproach, and despise the shame, while we think of
this glory. We should not reckon of a little undeserved shame with men, while
we consider that we shall shortly shine with the glory of God.

2. Secondly it should cause us so to walk, that we be not in any thing a shame
to Christ, whom God has made so glorious, and who will shortly make us so
glorious. In whom the humane nature is advanced to such honor, as to partake
of the glory of the Godhead. Mark what the Apostle says, Shall I take the
members of Christ and make them the members of an harlot? So may I say on this
occasion, shall I take the nature of Christ, the Nature which our Savior in
his Person has so highly dignified, and make it in my person, the nature of a
Devil? Suppose a Prince should marry with a mean woman, would he endure to see
those of her nearest kindred, her Brethren and her Sisters live like Scullions
and like Strumpets in his own eye? Now Christ my Brethren has assumed our
Nature into a nearer union with himself then that of marriage, a union which
death it self was not able to dissolve. For when the soul was separated from
the body, the Godhead was not separated from the one or from the other. It was
the Lord that lay buried in the grave, and he that ascended into heaven, was
the same that came down from heaven. And shall we then defile this nature by
wantonness, intemperance and vile affections, which Jesus Christ has so
honored, to take into so near a union with himself, and to cause it to partake
of the glory of the Godhead? Especially if we expect hereafter in our persons
to partake of this glory. Oh let us learn to keep our vessels in all holiness
and honor. And as we look hereafter to be like him, so in the mean time let us
purify our selves as he is pure.

JOHN 17.6. I have manifested thy Name unto the men which, etc.


WE have been very long upon the first Part of our Saviors Prayer, and now at
length it is ended and dispatched. Charity begins at home, and so our Savior
Christ began with his Petitions for himself. For that has been the substance
of his Prayer hitherto, that as he has been humbled and abased with men, so
now he might be glorified with his Father. And this he urges very hard with
many pressing arguments; and so he ceases to solicit any further for himself.

Charity begins at home, as I have said, but it does not end there; Our Savior
is not satisfied to put up his Petitions to his Father for himself, but in the
next place he becomes a Suitor also for his Church. And here he prays for his
Apostles and Disciples then about him, the members of the present Church. And
then for those who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of
the Church to come. In the first place he prays for his Apostles and Disciples
then about him, the members of the present Church, who were already called and
sanctified, whom God had given him out of the world. I pray for them (says he)
I pray not for the world. In the second place, he prays for those who were
after to be called by their preaching, the members of the Church that was to
come, in verse. 20. and so on to the conclusion of the Chapter, Neither pray I
for these alone, but for them also that shall believe on me through their word.

I must at this time make a little entrance upon our Saviors Prayer in behalf
of his Apostles and Disciples, who were present with him. They were very near
to him, they were waiting then upon him, they were converted immediately by
himself, and called by his own word, and therefore they have the precedence and
the preferment in his Prayer.

And here we have to be considered, First the preparation to it, and secondly
the matter of it. The preparation to this Prayer of our Savior in the behalf
of his Apostles and Disciples; Discovers first, what he himself had done in
reference to them. And then what they had done in reference to him. What they
were, both in relation to himself, and to his Father. And where they were, viz.
In such a place wherein they stood in need of his Prayers. These things are
interwoven and commixt, and we must take them in our progress as we find them.
Only this would be considered, that all of them are premised by our Savior,
before he puts up one Petition for them, to show what cause there was why they
should be remembered in his Prayers.

Begin we with the first thing which our Savior mentions by way of preparation
to the Prayer which he makes for his Apostles and Disciples. I have manifested
thy Name unto the men which thou gave me out of the world.

And here you may take notice with me of these two particulars. First; the
action of our Savior in reference to his Apostles and Disciples, of which he
minds his Father here, I have manifested thy Name. Secondly, the description of
the persons to whom he had made known his Fathers Name, viz. the men which he
had given him out of the world. For opening of the former, we must examine and
resolve what is intended by the Fathers Name, which Christ affirms here he
had made known, I have manifested thy Name.

Some think the meaning to be only this, that he had made him known to his
Apostles and Disciples, under the notion of a Father. They knew him as a God
before, and so did generally all the people of the Jews, but as a Father in his
Son, they had no acquaintance with him. Now by this Name our Savior had
discovered him to those whom he had called and sanctified, he had brought them
now to know him as a Father. This is the title he gives him all along from the
beginning of his Prayer to the end, Father, Holy Father, Righteous Father, and
the like. This is the name by which he represents him unto his Apostles and
Disciples, and under which he would have them to conceive and apprehend him, as
a Father to his Son, and as a Father to themselves in him, and this is that
which he intends (as some conceive) in this profession, I have manifested thy
Name, etc.

This is something (I acknowledge) yea, this is very much of that which he
intends, but yet I think it is not all. The Name of God in general is all that
makes him known to men, wherein soever the nature, or the will of God, or
whatsoever else of God can be imagined or conceived, is discovered and made
known, all this is intimated by the Name of God. So that our Savior in my
Text, in saying he had manifested Gods Name, says in effect, that he had fully
manifested and revealed his Father to his people. So that there was nothing of
him necessary to be known, which he had concealed from them. He had not hid one
letter of his Name from them. So that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ has made an absolute, complete and full discovery
of his Father to his people.
The Name of God sometimes imports his Nature, sometimes his Titles, sometimes
his Attributes, sometimes his Ordinances, and sometimes his works, as I could
give you instances of all these. And all of these our Savior had laid open
fully to his Apostles and Disciples, as he professes to his Father here, I have
manifested thy Name unto the men which thou have given me out of the world.

And this is that which the Evangelist affirms of him, Ioh. 1.18. No man has
seen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the
Father, he has declared him. Observe it well, it is not said he has declared
something of him, but he has declared him. Declared him wholly and completely,
all that is declarable of him he has made known to his people. The
protestation which he makes to his Apostles, when he was about to leave them,
runs very much to this purpose, Joh. 15.15. All that I have heard of my Father,
not from my Father, but of my Father, I have made it known to you. Whatsoever I
have been informed in concerning my Father, at least as Mediator, and as the
Prophet of my Church, I have discovered it to you. I have been very faithful to
you in the business, whatsoever has been shown me of my Father, for your
instruction and your information, I have not kept one whit from you. I shall
add no more for proof, that I may have time to show you, How Jesus Christ has
made this full discovery, and then why Jesus Christ has made this full
discovery of his Father to his people. And in pursuance of the latter, I shall
examine and resolve why Jesus Christ, and none but he has made it. And in the
second place, why the discovery he has made is such an absolute and full
discovery.



1. First by his Personal appearance in the flesh, our Savior Christ has made
some discovery of his Father. Jesus Christ as he is Man, and as he has
assummed our Nature, is the Image and resemblance of his Father. And this is
that which the Apostle aims at, when he says, He is the Image of the invisible
God, Col. 1.15. by which he intimates expressly, that however God be in himself
invisible, yet there is some resemblance of him in the Lord Christ, so that he
may be seen in him. It Is true indeed, that Jesus Christ as God is the invisible
Image of God, and thus he is the very picture of the Father, Heb. 1.3. But as
he has assumed our flesh, he is the visible Image of God. And this is clearly
the Apostles meaning when he says, He is the Image of the invisible God. His
purpose is not to declare how Jesus Christ is the invisible Image of God the
Father from Eternity, but visible to us in time. And hence he says not simply,
who is the Image of God, but of the invisible God. In which there is a close
Antithesis. q. d. Having assumed our Nature, he is now become the visible Image
of the invisible God. That God who is invisible, is made visible in him. And
this is that which is suggested, Ioh. 1.18. No man has seen God at any time,
you may conceive it with the outward eye, the Son of Man who came out of the
bosom of the Father has declared him. He has discovered him in some respect
to that eye. And therefore when our Savior was incarnate, it is said, that God
was manifested in the flesh, which is the object of the eye of sense, 1 Timothy
3.16. So that he that had looked upon him, might have seen the Father in him.
In which respect it is, that when Philip was so earnest to have the Father
shown him, our Savior bid him to behold himself, and adds presently, He that
has seen me has seen the Father also, Joh. 14.9. This is the Vision mentioned
in the Book of Job, I know that my Redeemer, etc. yet in my flesh I shall see
God. Not in my spirit, or my understanding only, but my flesh: yea, and I shall
look on him, not with other, but with these same eyes. Which can be no other
way, but in the glorified Body of Christ.

2. Secondly Christ has made a discovery of his Father by his Word, and by his
Gospel. There he has showed him forth to men, so far as it is necessary that
he should be known by them. And this is partly intimated in that speech of his
to Philip, Joh. 14.9, 10. How say thou show us the Father? Believe thou not
that I am in the Father; and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you,
I speak not of my self, says Christ. My manner is not to be speaking to you of
my self so much, as of my Father, nor to advance my self so much, as to set up
my Father upon all occasions. And how then is it that you that have so long
conversed with me, and have heard so much from me, are yet so unacquainted with
my Father? If you observe the manner of our Saviors teaching and discoursing,
you shall find that he insisted very much on matters that concerned his Father,
he was always talking of him, especially when he was drawing near his passion,
and ready to depart from his Disciples, he labored very much to make his
Father better known to them. And when he was about to leave them, he professed
that he had perfectly acquainted them with all things that concern his Father,
so far as they were come to his knowledge for the instruction and the
information of his people. Indeed the word of Christ, the Gospel, contains in
it all things that are necessary to be known of God the Father, whether his
Nature, or his Will, or his Son, or his Spirit, etc. And therefore it is said,
that it is able (of it self without addition) to make us wise unto salvation, 2 Timothy 3.15. This is a perfect and a full discovery, so that we need no other
knowledge of the Lord to bring us to salvation then that which is revealed to
us in the Scripture.

3. Thirdly Christ makes a full discovery of his Father by his Spirit. And this
is that which is the Complement of all in this business. Indeed there is a full
discovery of him in the Word, materially there is nothing wanting there; But it
is not full to us without the revelation of the Spirit. Christ shows his Father
there, in all his glory, excellency, overflowing love to his people. But if
the Spirit do not cure the blindness of our eyes, and open them, and take away
the vail that is upon them, we can never see him. It is the Comforter the holy
Ghost that teaches all things, conceive it efficaciously and with success, Ioh.
14.28. who comes out from the Father, and makes known the Fathers Name to his
people. Thus we have seen how Jesus Christ makes this discovery.

Now let us see why Jesus Christ makes this discovery of his Father;

1. First, as for the first of these, Why Jesus Christ and none but he makes
this discovery. There are two weighty reasons for it: For first, none but he is
able. And next, none but he is fit to make it.

1. First none but Jesus Christ is able to make this full discovery of his
Father; For none but he is perfectly acquainted with him. Alas all men are
strangers to the Father, the worst men absolutely and in all respects, and the
best in some measure. And all the knowledge which any soul has of him, it has
from Jesus Christ too. But now my Brethren, Jesus Christ has the full
knowledge of his Father, he does not know him outwardly alone, but he knows his
very heart, and the secrets of his bosom. And therefore he is said to lodge
there, and so to be the only possible revealer of the Father to the world. No
man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of
the Father, he has declared him, Joh. 1.18. How is it possible for any one to
make the Father known, unless he know him? Now this is proper and peculiar to
the Son. No man knows the Father but the Son, that is, originally, primitively
of himself, and therefore it is added presently, and he to whom the Son will
reveal him, Joh. 11.27.

2. Secondly as none but Christ is able, so none but Christ is fit to manifest
his Father to his people. He is the only Mediator between God and man, there is
but one, as the Apostle tells us, and that is Christ, 1 Timothy 2.5. And therefore
it is congruous that he should manage and transact the business, all the
business between God and man, that all should go through his hands. He is to
make God friends with us, and to make us friends with God, the peace must be on
both sides. And how shall he effect the latter, but by revealing and making
known his Father to us, in all his beauty, and his glory, and his excellency in
himself; in all the tenderness and dearness of his love to us, and so to join
our hearts to him. This latter is especially the Name of God, which Christ was
(as a Savior) to discover, viz. his attributes of Love and Mercy. This was the
proper work of Christ indeed, to manifest this Name of God, all that is sweet
and lovely in him to his people.

This may suffice to let you know, why Jesus Christ and none but he makes this
discovery of the Father to his people.



1. He makes a full discovery, that he may be faithful as the Prophet of his
Church. For if he should not show his Father to us fully, if he should hide any
thing of God from us, which it concerns us to know, how should he be a
faithful Prophet to us? And even as if he should not make complete and perfect
satisfaction for us, he should not be a faithful Priest; So if he should not
give complete instruction to us, he should not be a faithful Prophet. Indeed
his Father has appointed him, my Brethren, to make known his Name, every
letter of his Name to his people, and hence he gives him this account, when he
is even about to leave the world. I have manifested, etc.

2. He makes a full discovery of his Father to his people, that the discovery
which he makes may be effectual. For if he should conceal the least particle,
the least iota of his Fathers Name, which is required to be known necessitate
medii, to salvation, all the rest that he reveals would be in vain, it would
be to no purpose. If he make not a full discovery, (in the sense that I have
said) it were as good that he made none at all. And therefore that he may
attain the end for which he came into the world, for which he executes his
Mediatorship in all the offices, and branches of it, even the Salvation of his
people, he makes his Father so far known to every one of his, that nothing may
be hidden from them; in the ignorance of which, whosoever dies, must perish.

Now is it so, that Jesus Christ has made an absolute, complete, and etc. The
less are they to be excused, and the more to be condemned, who yet continue
ignorant of God, of his Nature, and his Will, notwithstanding this discovery.
Though Jesus Christ has done so much to make his Father known to them, yet
they continue wholly unacquainted with him. They are mere strangers to the
Father, they do not know so much as a Letter of his Name, which Christ has
made so manifest. And this is very evident, because they do not love him, they
do not trust in him, which they would be sure to do, if they did know the Name
of God. They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee, says the
Psalmist, Psalm. 9.10. And so it may be said as well they that know thy Name
will love thee, and they that know thy Name will fear thee. It is impossible
but men's affections should be managed and molded by their apprehensions, and
that the principles which they have rooted in their understandings should have
some influence, and operation on their hearts. So that if men did but know the
wrath of God, it could not be but they would fear him, if they did know the
power of God, and know it as engaged for them, it could not be but they would
trust him and depend upon him. If they did know the love, and mercy, the beauty
and the excellency of the Lord, it could not be but they would love him. But
while they show forth none of this, it is apparent that the Fathers Name (of
which these are but diverse Letters as it were) is utterly unknown to them. Now,
my Beloved, when the Lord shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty
Angels, in flaming fire, to render vengeance unto them that know not God, what
will become of those men? Alas their unacquaintance with him (now Christ has
showed his Name so plainly) will be void of all excuse. If Jesus Christ had
kept his Father close, if he had hid his Name, his Love, his Power, his Mercy,
and the like, and had not manifested it to men, they might have pleaded
something when the day of reckoning comes. They might have said, alas it is no
wonder that the Father is unknown to us, for which way should we come to be
acquainted with him? He dwells in light, that no man can approach unto, whom no
man has seen, or can see. But then Christ Jesus will be ready to reply, it was
a great part of my errand and my business down into the world, to help men to
the sight of him, to manifest his Name to men. And I have done it fully and
completely, and therefore if you know him not, your sin is wilful, and your
damnation must be heavy.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ has made an absolute, etc. then let us bless have
no means to be acquainted with him. Indeed by nature we may come to have some
knowledge of a God, as the Apostle speaks at large, Romans 1. But the knowledge
of the Father in reference to Jesus Christ, and to his people, is another
thing. To know God as a Father to his Son Christ, and in and through Christ to
us, to know him by this Name of his, is unattainable by any light but that
which we receive from Christ himself. So that unless he had discovered him, we
had never known the Father, and so had perished everlastingly. No man knows
the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him, Matthew. 11.27.
And therefore we are infinitely bound to Jesus Christ that he has revealed him
to us, that he has made such an absolute and full discovery of his Father to
his people, which if he had not done, they had continued strangers to him, both
in this world, and in that which is to come. Indeed we might have known him as
an angry and a powerful God, we might know him as a Judge and an avenger
without any help from Christ. But as a sweet and gracious Father, we had never
known him, if Christ had not discovered him in such a way, and under such a
notion to us. This Name of his none but Jesus Christ could teach us, we could
have learned to spell and understand it of no other Master in this world. And
therefore we are bound the more to Christ, and his mercy is the greater, that
he has undertaken to instruct us, and make us perfect in this sweet Lesson,
which is indeed the first and greatest in the Primmer of Religion, the Name of
the Father.

etc. Then let us be persuaded to address our selves to the performance of that
necessary duty, which this so large so ample a discovery of the Father calls
for. viz. To grow up in the knowledge of him, and not to rest, till we be
inwardly and thoroughly acquainted with him. That as the revelation of him in it
self is very full, so it may be so to us too. Beloved, Jesus Christ has done
his work as he professes to his Father in my Text, I have manifested thy Name,
(...), I have brought it forth says he, into the light, and set it in open
view, for so much that word imports. By which he intimates, that his Fathers
Name was like a rare and curious piece behind a curtain, like a rich treasure
covered, or a glorious Image veiled. But now says Christ, the vail is taken
off, the covering is removed, the curtain drawn. I have exposed my Fathers Name
to the veiw of all my people. This Christ has done, you see, and now let us
consider what we are to do. No question he has brought it forth that we might
see it, that we might feed our eyes upon it, that we might grow up in the
knowledge of his Fathers Name, of the dearness of his love, and the sweetness
of his mercy, the tenderness and the abundance of his compassions unto poor
lost creatures. This is the Name which Jesus Christ has manifested to us that
we might be acquainted with it.

Now I beseech you, my Beloved, let us not by neglecting this discovery, go
about to frustrate Christ, and do as much as in us lies to disappoint him of
his purpose. Oh let us labor that our knowledge of the Name of God, may be in
some sort answerable to the revelation that Jesus Christ has made of it. And
that as we have (since our Saviors coming in the flesh) a fuller, and a more
complete discovery of it then they in former ages had, we may accordingly
exceed and go beyond them in the knowledge of it too. We may know more of God,
especially of his love, and of his mercy to his people in his Son, then they
did. Or if it be not so, to what end is the pains that Christ has taken to
manifest his Fathers Name to us? Oh let us be ashamed to come behind the Saints
of the Old Testament in the knowledge of this Name, who came behind us in the
means of this knowledge.

Is it so, That Jesus Christ has made an absolute, etc. Then let us satisfy

Indeed there is an itch in Nature to search into those things (especially
concerning God) which are concealed and hid from us. Fain we would see his
face, when Christ has manifested but his back-parts to us, we would know more
of his Nature, of his Counsels and Decrees, the order of them, the measure of
them, the objects of them, then he has thought expedient to reveal to us. We
would approach too nigh to gaze, we would intrude on those things which we have
not seen, for which we have no revelation, as the Apostle speaks, Col. 2.18.
And this my Brethren, is the evil Genius of these very times, men go beyond
themselves in sifting into things concerning God, and beyond Christ too: I mean
beyond any thing that he has manifested of his Father to them. Indeed they
tell us that Christ reveals it to them by his Spirit. But that is not the
Spirit of Christ which shows us any thing beyond what he has written in his
Word. The business of the Spirit is not to bring us any other truths then those
which are revealed in the Word, but to clear those to us. If any spirit bring
us any thing, crossing with, or but so much as diverse from the Scripture, if
an Angel dropped from Heaven teach us any other Doctrine, he must not be
believed, but accursed. To the Law and to the Testimony says the Prophet, Isa.
8.20. If any man or Angel speak not according to this Word, let him pretend
what light he will, it is because there is no light in him. And therefore let
us satisfy our selves with that which Christ has manifested of his Father in
his Word, and in his Gospel. Since his discovery is so full, let us not seek to
go beyond it. That speech of God to Moses, who (whether he were curious or no)
was very earnest to behold his glory, is observable, Exodus 33.19. I will make
all my good go before thee, (that is) I will discover so much of my self to
thee, as shall be good for thee to know. And this our Savior Christ has done
completely. We need no further knowledge of the Father here to make us happy,
to make us wise unto salvation. And therefore let us rest in it.

And to this end I shall present you with a few Considerations.

Col. 2.18. Intruding into those things which they have not seen. But how comes
this to pass? vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind. There is the cause of
this intrusion. And hence the Prophet David, to show that he was not proud and
haughty, makes this the evidence, Psalm. 131.1. I do not exercise my self in
things that are too high for me.

Col. 2.18. Intrudes upon another right, enters on the possession of another.
Now whose possession are these secret things? To whom do they belong? to God
says Moses, Deuteronomy. 29. ult. The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but
those things which are revealed belong unto us and unto our children. So that
while we content our selves with these revealed things, we are like
honest-minded men, that keep and use their own, and love not to encroach upon
their neighbors. But if we be not satisfied with the things which God has
manifested and revealed of himself, as thinking them too narrow and too mean a
purchase for us, and so presumptuously go on to search, and dive, and pry into
his reserved secrets which he has locked and sealed up, we go beyond our own,
and enter upon his possession. And this is that which the Apostle notes in
these seducers, they entered and intruded into those things which they had not
seen, for which they had no revelation from the Lord, no demonstration from the
Scriptures, they were not things allowed for them to know, and so their meddling
with them was intrusion.

Jews you know had certain bounds and limits set them, at the promulgation of
the Law, beyond which none of them might dare to step, no, not a foot to gaze
or pry, Exodus 19.21. Their ground was measured out, and so was Gods; so much he
allowed to them, and so much he reserved to himself; as long as they contained
themselves within their compass they were safe. But if out of a curious
disposition any man adventured into Gods precincts, there was no other way but
death. So God has set us bounds and limits in our knowledge of himself, so
much he allows to us, and so much he reserveth to himself. So long as we
contain our selves within the bounds of things revealed, we are safe, for they
are ours, as Moses tells us. But if out of a vain desire to gaze and pry, we
enter upon secret things, we have intruded upon Gods peculiar, and we may
justly fear his stroke.

Consider it is a fruitless thing to labor to know more of God then Excellens
visibile destruit sensum. He dwells in light that no man can approach unto,
and therefore the Apostle Paul exhorting us to labor for the knowledge of the
Lord, and of his will, advises us withal (...), not to be wise above that
which is meet, Romans 12.3. Adam had a mind to know as much of God, as God
himself, and by this means he came to know nothing. And truly it is just with
God to suffer such to err and wander in their vain imaginations, who would be
so overwise, till they become mere fools, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Romans 1.22.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ has made an absolute, etc. then let us live All
people will walk, every one in the Name of his God, says the Prophet Micah,
Mic. 4.5. And why should not we add as he, and we will walk in the Name of our
God for ever and ever. I shall persuade you to it especially in two Cases, in
times of sinful and of poenal misery.

1. First when we are under sinful misery, by reason of the guilt and power of
our transgressions, let us walk like men that have the Fathers Name made known
to us. We are apt in such a case sometimes to cast away all hopes of pardon and
forgiveness, to think that mercy is too narrow for us; to say to God as Peter
to our Savior, Depart from us, for we are sinful men. Why, my Beloved, do you
know the Fathers Name, the Name which he himself proclaimed to Moses, Exodus
34.6. The Lord, the Lord God, patient and long-suffering, merciful and
gracious, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin. All sorts, all kinds, and all
degrees of sin. And can you doubt whether there be enough of mercy in him to
cure your sinful misery? What do you want, or what can you desire that is not
to be found in his Name? Are your sins many for the number of them, and great
for the measure of them? The mercies of the Lord are more and greater, he is
abundant in goodness and truth. Are they of diverse sorts, and diverse kinds? He
forgiveth iniquity, transgression, and sin. Have they been long continued and
held out against God? He is gracious and long-suffering. Somewhat there is in
Gods Name to answer all objections of the humble soul, and to keep it from
despair, when iniquities do look most horrid, and most black upon it.

2. So in the second place when we are under poenal misery, let us walk like
men that have the Fathers Name made known to us. What ever our distresses be,
either personal or National, let us not give all for lost, as most are very apt
to do. Oh we shall never be delivered. There is no other way, but we must sink
in this affliction. Why, my Beloved, do you know the Name of God, do you know
his power and mercy? How is it then that you have so little faith? That you
depend no more upon him? mark what the Prophet David says, Psalm. 9.10. They
that know thy Name will put their trust in thee. And therefore while you are so
diffident and faithless, it is too apparent that you are not so well acquainted
with the Fathers Name, as you might and ought to be. Now I beseech you, my
Beloved, take in the discoveries that Christ has made of this Name. And when
you are in any misery, in any sinful, in any poenal misery, hide your selves in
the Name of the Lord your God.

JOHN 17.6. Unto the men which thou gave me out of the world.


AND thus far of our Saviors action, in reference to his Apostles and
Disciples, of which he minds his Father here, I have manifested thy Name.

Proceed we now to his description of the persons, to whom he had made known
his Fathers Name, The men which thou gave me out of the world.

The Father gives men to his Son Christ, either for outward administration, or
else for inward union and incorporation. Either to be his servants, or to be
his members. Our Savior clearly speaks of those that were bestowed on him in
the latter way, to be united to him as living members of his body. And this is
very evident, because he says, that they were given him out of the world. They
that were bestowed upon him only for outward ministration as Judas was; Or only
in regard of outward profession, as many others were, were given him. So that
they were of the world still. They were a part of the unbelieving world, and of
the wicked world, the world that lies in wickedness, notwithstanding this
donation. But as for them who did in deed and truth believe in him, and were by
faith incorporated into Jesus Christ, they were the men that were given him out
of the world. That is, they were bestowed upon him. So that they were severed,
separated from the world, they were no longer of the wicked unbelieving world,
but of another party, that were divided and distinguished from the world. In
the world they were indeed, but they were not of the world. And these are
evidently they, of whom our Savior speaks in this place. The men whom thou
gave me out of the world.

Now to those he here affirms that he had manifested and made known his
Fathers Name. And you must understand it to be spoken by our Savior here
exclusively. I have manifested thy Name unto the men which thou gave me out
of the world, that is, to them and none others.

Why, did not Christ make known his Fathers name to all without distinction?
Did he not Preach to all? Did he not open and unfold his Fathers love and
mercy, and the like, to all the multitude that came to hear him? He did indeed
as to the outward Promulgation, but not as to the inward and effectual
revelation. He did not manifest it by his Spirit savingly to all: No my
Beloved, this was the Privilege but of a few, and in particular of those who
were bestowed upon him by his Father to be Members of his body: So says our
Savior to his Father here, I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou
gave me out of the world: To them, and not to others; or else at least to
them so, as I have not done to others. They have a Privilege in this respect,
which others are not made partakers of: I have made it known to them
effectually and savingly, and not to others.

You see the meaning of the words; the Points to be observed are two: First,
There are some certain men, whom God the Father gives to Jesus Christ out of
the world. Secondly, that Jesus Christ does make his Father known effectually
and savingly to them, and none besides them. At this time of the first.

DOCTRINE. There are some certain men, whom God the Father gives to Jesus
Christ out of the World.
In prosecution of this Observation, I shall distinctly evidence and clear
these four things.

First, There are some men, whom God the Father gives to Jesus

Secondly, There are a certain number of them.

Thirdly, They are of the World before the Father gives them to the

Fourthly, After they are given up to Jesus Christ, they are of the world no
longer. All these particulars are wrapped up in the Observation

First, There are some men whom God the Father gives to Jesus whom thou gave
me: So that some have this privilege, you see, above the rest of lost
mankind, that God the Father gives them to his Son Christ, and gives them to
him in a special manner, as I showed you even now, not to be his Servants only,
but to be his Members too. He bestows them upon Christ to be his own peculiar
people. I will not stay on this, because it has been largely handled
heretofore.

Secondly, Now for the second thing, there are a certain number of exactly
known to God and Christ; he knows how many of them there be to a man. And hence
our Savior speaks of them in such a way, as being able to distinguish them
from all the world besides. I have manifested thy name unto the men whom thou
gave me out of the world. And so he tells us that he knows his sheep that are
given him of his Father, as his own expression is, John 10.27, 29. And yet he
calls his sheep by name, ver. 3. and in the 9th. verse of this very Chapter; I
pray for them, says he, I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou have
given me. So that our Savior Christ distinguishes you see; he knows who are
his own by free donation of his Father, and for them he prays. He knows who are
not given him, and for them he prays not. There are a certain number of them
known to Christ.



David calls them, who have their portion in this present life, Psalm. 17.14.
They are not of the Father, as the Apostle speaks, but of the World, 1 John
2.16. They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world
hears them, John 4.5. But they that are delivered up to Jesus Christ and
become his Members, they are of the World no longer. And this the Saints in
Scripture have confessed, that they were Strangers, Pilgrims, Sojourners in
this World, and therefore looked for, and made toward their own Country, Hebr.
11.6. I am a stranger on the earth, says David, Psalm, 119.196. not in his
place of banishment alone with the Philistims, but in the Land of Canaan too,
yea in his house, yea in his bed, yea any where upon the earth, he was a
Stranger, he counted not himself at home in any place but heaven only: To say
the truth, the world lays no claim at all to those that belong to Christ; and
therefore this will need no great proof: It does not own them, or acknowledge
them for hers: but rather casts them out and persecutes them, and does them all
the spite and mischief that it can. And this evinceth manifestly, that they
are not the Worlds, as Christ himself informs his Disciples upon the very
same ground, Joh. 15.19. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own;
but because you are not of the world; but I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world hates you.

To open this a little further to you, because it is the great thing of the
Doctrine and the Text, that they that are bestowed on Jesus Christ, are given
him out of the world, and so are of the world no longer, I shall make it to
appear in a few particulars.

They that are actually given up to Jesus Christ to be his Members, Paul
insinuates, Col. 2.20. If ye be dead with Christ, says he, (as that he takes
for granted and supposed) why as though living in the world, are ye subject to
Ordinances? He reasons there from the Condition and the state of the
Colossians, on whom those worldly Ordinances were imposed: They were dead in
relation to the world, they lived not in the world, and therefore were not to
be burdened (in their consciences at least) with the inventions and
constitutions of the world. Law is the rule of life and action, so that where
there is a cessation of life, there is no further obligation of the Law,
because there is no action in a dead man to be ordered by it. Know ye not says
the Apostle to the Romans, chap. 7.1. that the Law has Dominion over a man so
long as he lives? So long and no longer; for as soon as he is dead he is loosed
from the Law, as it is added there in that place. It were a senseless thing to
lay Commandments on the carriages of men, and to exact obedience from them
after they are dead. But ye are dead says the Apostle, dead to the world, and
therefore these unlawful Ordinances ought not to be imposed upon you by the
world. They should not burden you with these things, for this is not the
Country that you live in. And in another place the Apostle speaking of
himself, says he was crucified to the world, Gal. 6.6, 14. not only dead, but
crucified to it, and so he was no more of this world.

They that are actually given up to Jesus Christ to be his members, as they are
actually dead, and so departed out of this world, so they are actually living
in another world. You are dead says the Apostle, Col. 3.3. and what follows?
you are not so dead, that you do not live at all, but you do not live here, no
you live above with God, You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Their conversation is indeed in heaven, as the same Apostle speaks, Phil. 3.20,
their life is Angel-like, they walk with God as Noah did, Genesis 6.9. They are
with him in the Palace, Psalm. 45.15. Others are abroad in the Town or in the
Country, but these men are in house with him; they are without doors, but
these are within; such faithful souls have fellowship with the Father, and with
his Son Jesus Christ, as the Apostle speaks, 1 John 1.3. They are far from God,
and far from Jesus Christ by Nature, they dwell a great way from him, as the
Prodigal in a strange Country, and so have no commerce with him. But when they
are converted and given up to Christ, they are made nigh, as the expression is,
Ephesians. 2.13. When peace is once effectually preached to those that are afar
off, they have access by one Spirit to the Father, and so they are no longer
foreigners and strangers, but fellow-Citizens of the Saints and of the
household of God. Indeed my Brethren, whatsoever they that are bestowed on
Christ do in regard of their natural life, yet in regard of their spiritual
life, they do not live so properly in this world, as in the other, and
therefore in that respect are out of this world, as I shall show you in a few
particulars. For

1. There is no life but is accompanied with some relation to those that have
the same alliance, and descent and Original of life. Now true it is, that they
that are bestowed on Jesus Christ, in regard of their natural life, have
natural parents and kindred, and allies in this world. But in regard of their
spiritual life, they have spiritual parents and kindred in another world: Their
Father that begat them, God, is of another world; Their Mother that conceived
and bare them, and gave them suck, the Church, is of another world. The new
Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all, Gal. 4.26.
Their Brethren and their special friends, that are united to them in the
nearest bond and tie of grace, are of another world. So that their chief
relations are above in heaven. And wheresoever they may sojourn for a Season,
there they live where their Father, and their Mother, and their Brethren, and
their choice Relations are.

2. There is no life but is accompanied with some place of habitation (though
in some I must acknowledge it may be more unsettled then in others) and with
some means of sustentation. Now it is very true, that they that are given up to
Christ, in regard of their natural life may have an earthly habitation, and
earthly means of sustentation, and so in that respect they may be yet in this
world. But in regard of their spiritual life, their mansion house is in another
world, as the Apostle tells us, 2 Cor. 5.1. They have a building with God, a
house not made with hands, but eternal in heaven. The means which they subsist
upon, by which this life is nourished, and maintained, are not any earthly
things; They feed upon the bread which comes from heaven, which was prefigured
by the Manna, with reference to which the Psalmist says, that man did eat
Angels food. My Father gives you the true bread from heaven, says our Savior,
John 6.32. And what is that? I am the bread, says he, that came down from
heaven, at ver. 41. This bread all they that appertain to Christ do eat, by
faith, and of his blood do they drink, and so the life of grace is strengthened
in them. And for the estate they live upon, the main possession, it lies not
here but in another world. In Christ they have obtained an inheritance
incorruptible, undefiled, etc. and so in him they sit already in heavenly
places.

3. There is no life but is accompanied with some action. Now they that are
bestowed on Jesus Christ, may in regard of their natural life, act in and with,
and for this world. They may in many things do as worldly men do, they may
labor in their callings, they may deal in the affairs, and trade in the
Commodities of this world, for the procuring of subsistence here. But in regard
of their spiritual life, their actings are in and for another world. Their
minds and thoughts do work exceedingly on heaven and heavenly things. Their
hearts are always running out to God and Christ, and the happiness above, and
feeding upon such objects. They are too large to be contained within the narrow
limits of this lower world; no, as the Psalmist speaks, they are continually
with God. With the woman, Apoc. 12.1. They tread upon the Moon, this variable
and inconstant world; they trample with an holy scorn upon these earthly
things. They are aspiring still to heaven, walking and acting heavenward.
Indeed they live in some respect in this world, but it is but as though they
lived in the world, as the Apostle Paul's expression is, Col. 2.20. They use the
world, but yet it is as though they used it not, as the same Apostle speaks, 1
Cor. 7.29. They lay not out the strength of their affections and endeavors
upon these things: But on the matters of the other world, there they are intent
indeed, there they are in good earnest, there they act with full vigor; (...)
their Trading, their Commerce, their Dealing, their Negotiation is in heaven,
Phil. 3.20. The word there used has very much in it, and can hardly be
expressed. Beza assaies in many ways: The manner of our living is in Heaven,
or which comes nearer yet, we carry and demean our selves as Citizens of
Heaven. As if Heaven were a City, and we (as being free there) do walk and act
according to the Manners, and the Customs, and the Laws, and Constitutions of
the City we belong to. So that the Saints you see do live as if they were in
Heaven already, as being now no more of this world.

Now is it so my Brethren, That there are some certain men whom God Ephesus,
you know my Brethren, it occasioned such an uproar in the City, and such a
mutiny among the Tradesmen and Mechanics there, as you can hardly parallel in
any story. You shall observe in the New Testament, when Christ began to gather
people to himself, that wheresoever there were any numbers given to him by the
Father, some were exceedingly disquieted and out of patience at it. It galled
the Pharisees, and cut them to the very hearts, that Jesus Christ had such an
harvest among the people there: why (say they in a great passion) the whole
world runs after him: And so it is to this day, and will be to the worlds end,
when God is pleased to give in souls to Jesus Christ in any place, some will
fret and storm at it.

Nor is it any wonder that they should, for they are given him out of the
world. And the world is loath to lose that which appertains to it, and which is
its own possession. If God did give a people to his Son, to which the world had
no right, and to which it could pretend no title, the world would like it well
enough, it would never be against it. But this is that which vexes it, and
troubles it, that God must give away that which is his (the worlds) to Jesus
Christ. He cannot have a man, but the world must be a loser, who cannot keep
his own for him: what has any one to do to meddle with that which is the
worlds known right, to fetch away that which has many years (perhaps) belonged
to him? This is an injury (as he conceives) that puts him out of all patience;
and this is that which makes him strive and struggle as he does. Christ enters
upon every soul that is bestowed upon him by his Father, by dispossessing and
disseazing him: so that it is no marvel though he be extremely startled, and
though he labor every way by promises and by preferments on the one side, and
by threatening, and by persecutions on the other, to keep that which he has in
his possession.



Now that you may be able to discover this, I shall give you marks for trial.

Romans 12.2. not as this world does. As Turks and Spaniards are not like to
English men, they have another kind of visage, another garb, another habit, and
the like. So they that are given up unto Christ out of the world, they differ
manifestly from the world. There is a clear distinction to be made between them
and other men, by any man that eyes them well, there are none like them in the
earth, their ways are of another fashion. Now my Beloved, is it so with you?
do you differ from the world? do you live soberly, and righteously, and godlily
in this present evil world? In a world of wickedness, are you singular in
goodness? so that the same may be affirmed of you, that is recorded to the
everlasting praise of righteous Noah, that he was just and perfect in his
Generations. Genesis 6.9. and they were wicked and corrupt enough. Of holy Lot,
that he was so far from joining with the vicious Sodomites in their vile
abominations, that his righteous soul was vexed at their filthy conversation, 2
Pet. 2.8. This is a comfortable evidence that you are given up to Jesus Christ
out of this world. But if you walk according to the course and custom of the
world, as the expression is, Ephesians. 2.2. if you have fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness, if you run out with others to the same excess of
riot, if you be also led away with the error of the world, and so fall from
your own stedfastness, if you be carried down with the swinge, and with the
current of the times, and of the places where you live, do not deceive your
selves, you are yet of this world. I must confess, it is a very strong
temptation, when the stream runs in a wrong course, and often shakes the
holiest Saints. But yet in such a case, they that belong to Jesus Christ, must
consider with themselves that they are of another world, and therefore are not
much to eye the fashion and the ways of this. They must behave themselves
according to the fashion of their own Country. They must conclude with holy
Joshua 24.15. If it seem evil to other men to serve the Lord, if they will
forsake God, and forsake his worship, let them serve whom they will for me; as
for my own part, I am at a point for that, I and my house will serve the Lord.
And they must say in such a case as David did, Away from me ye wicked; I am not
for your company, because I am not for your courses; away from me ye wicked, I
will keep the Commandments of my God.

If you be now no longer of this world but of the other, your language Psalm.
45.1. It is like a boiling pot, for that is the similitude that is alluded to;
it is always bubling up and running over, and then it speaks of good things,
as it is added there in that place. The heart within boyles, and the tongue
without speaks; and as the boiling Pot runs over with the self same matter
which it has within it, so it fares with such an heart. It bubleth up with
good matter, the matter which it has conceived and meditated touching Christ,
this is that which is so readily and freely uttered with the tongue. My heart
is enditing of a good matter; I speak of the things which I have made touching
the King. Such are the hearts and tongues of those that are of the other world;
their speech is gracious, and either tends to glorify their God, or to edify
their Brethren; this is the language of their Country.

What think we then of those whose language is always vain and frivolous? it
does not benefit the hearers, it ministers no grace, for there is no grace in
it; or which is worse, it is wicked and pernicious. Their speech is rotten and
corrupt, there is no salt to season it and make it wholesome: and hence their
throat is likened to an open Sepulcher, Romans 3.13. which breathes and steames
up nothing else but odious smells and loathsome exhalations: or else at best,
their speeches and discourses are of nothing else but earth and earthly things.
Talk with them while you will, you hear of nothing else but worldly matters
from them. Of what Country do you think are these men? The Apostle John tells
you, 1 John 4.5. They are of the world, and they speak of ^he world. Shibboleth
never descryed so many Ephraimites as this does worldly wrerches. They are of
Galilee, they are of this world, for their speech bewrays them. Shall I
believe they are Inhabitants of the Celestial Canaan, who cannot speak almost
without an oath, whose tongues are always dipping in that blood which alone
can cleanse them from all sin? Shall I say that such a man or woman is of
heaven, whose tongue is set on fire of hell? Brethren do not deceive your
selves, if you cannot spoke the language, you belong not to that Country.



And therefore they are gross dissemblers, who would be thought to be given up
to Christ out of the world, and yet their bosom friends and their Companions
are all of them of this world. These are the men which they converse withal,
and which they take delight in: Nay which is worse then this, they hate the men
whom Jesus Christ has called and chosen out of the world. They persecute them
with the hand and with the tongue, and do them all the spite and all the
mischief that they can. Suppose thou were in Italy or Spain, or any other
foreign Land, and there should meet an Englishman, would thou mock and
scoff at him? would thou deride and jear at the fashion of his clothes, the
manner of his complement, his gate and carriage, and the like? would thou
procure him to be taken up, imprisoned, put to death? thy Earthly Country would
not own thee, if thou should be so unworthy: And truly heaven will not own
the men, who deal thus basely and injuriously with the Inhabitants of that
Country.



etc. so that however they were once the worlds, now they are of the world no
longer? Then do not you regard the world, nor the things of this world. We see
that Travailers do not use to set their hearts on any thing they meet with in a
strange Country. If they see stately houses, orchards, gardens, if they hear
curious music, they are not taken up with these things, no they keep on their
way and are not hindered, or withdrawn by the most pleasing avocations. Does
any stranger fall a building at his Inn? or does he plant and sow as he
travails by the way? And therefore seeing we are of another world; let us not
set our hearts on these things. No let us use the world but as though we used
it not: for necessity alone, not for delight, to further us in holy duties, not
to stop us, to help us heavenward, not to hinder.

Are there some, etc. so that however you were once, etc. This fits Shadrach,
Mesach, and Abednego refused to bow before the Golden Image which Nebuchadnezar
the King had set up, they might have said to them, What will you do as no body
does? you see that all men universally fall down before it, and they no small
ones neither, the Judges, Counselors, Princes, Rulers of the people, Dan. 3.3.
And will you take upon you to be wiser then your betters? will you stand out
alone, and be so stiff in your opinion? yet this did not one whit move them,
neither must such an argument as this prevail with us. No we must keep the
right way though we go alone, though all the world should leave us and forsake
us. And to this end I propound two things.

1. It will be a safe course thus to reserve our selves from the pollutions of
the world, and the contagion of the times and places where we live. The Lord
most commonly vouchsafes to such a special privilege of preservation, when
dangers and calamities and troubles come; as he did to Lot, and Noah, and the
Mourners in Ezechiel. And as they have not shared in common corruptions, so he
exempteth them from Common desolations, etc.

2. And as it will be safe for us thus to reserve our selves, so it will be
honorable too. The veriest wretch may keep himself from wicked acts sometimes,
when there are no examples, no temptations to withdraw him. But in a world of
wickedness to be singular in goodness, is Christian-like indeed. It was Tullies
Commendation of Muraena, Laudandus Muraena non tam quod in Asia vixerit, quam
quod in Asia continenter vixerit. And Gods of Job, that there was none like him
in the earth.

Are there some certain, etc. And are you of that number? there is see such
stirs and troubles, such alterations and confusions in the world. Why should
you be so out of patience to see things turned upside down in such a Country
where you do not live, to which you do not appertain? What need you care (I
spoke of such a Care as eats out the joy and comfort of a man) how matters
go, what stirrs and hubbubs and combustions there are here in this world, so
long as all goes well at home in your world? Remember still in such a case that
you are not of this world but of another. And why then should it startle you,
though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst
of the Sea? Yea though the Kingdoms of this world be shaken, so long as your
world and the Kingdom of it is not shaken, so long as that stands firm and
sure, you have no reason to be swallowed up with overmuch fear, and overmuch
sorrow: But rather on the other side, when you see all the world and all the
Kingdoms of it in a flame, to bless and magnify the Lord that you are out of
this world; that you are out of Gunshot, out of the reach of these things.
Indeed with reference to the men of this world, who have their Conversation and
their portion here, whose friends, and means, and dwellings lie in this
Country, we have reason to be troubled when Concussions and Confusions come
upon the earth; for we should pity those who are of the self same nature with
us, in their troubles and distresses. But for our selves, we may behold the
greatest tribulation and distractions that come upon the world, as things that
do not much concern us, just as we do the wars in Italy; when we have peace, we
pity the poor people there, and rejoice that we live not in that Country. So
long as all goes well at home, as no ill tidings come from heaven, from our own
Country, we are in a good Condition: It may be we may suffer some outward evils
and extremities; we may be banished from the Country which we sojourn in, but
then we are but banished from a place of banishment. We may be banished (if I
may express it so) out of this world into the other, that is, we may lose our
lives, but then at worst we are but banished home. They do but send us to the
world that we are of, and that we belong to; men may deprive us of the Life by
which we live in this world, but this is but a seeming Life, the shadow of a
Life; it is but as though we lived in the world. But the life by which we live
in the world that we are of, is an enduring and abiding life; It is a lasting
and an endless life, it is above the reach of death and dissolution: And though
the natural life decay, this life of grace will flourish and grow stronger
still, till it be perfected in that of glory.

JOHN 17.6. Thine they were, etc. thou gave them to me.


ANd thus far of the description of the persons to whom our Savior had made
known his Fathers Name; not by their own condition, or their own action, but by
his Fathers act upon them, or in reference to them, his giving them to Jesus
Christ out of the world. I have manifested thy Name to the men whom thou gave
me out of the world.

The following words seem to be added to anticipate a scruple that might be
raised in the hearts of those who heard him praying to his Father thus; or who
in aftertimes might come to read this prayer of our Savior, as it is here
recorded in the Gospel. They might consider with themselves on this occasion;
if Jesus Christ have none belonging to him, none that are indeed his own, but
those that are bestowed upon him by his Father; why then it seems all were the
Fathers in the first place. For no one gives that to another which he has not
first himself. Nihil dat quod non habet. True, says our Savior, so it is
indeed, they were my Fathers, and I had them all from him. Thine they were, and
thou gave them to me. So that you see the Observation lies before you.

DOCTRINE. That all the people of the Lord Christ were first of all belonging
to the Father.
His they were in the first place, and he gave them to the Son. And indeed he
could not give them, if they were not first his own: For he that gives a thing,
alters the property of that which he bestows; passes away the right he had,
and makes it over to another. And so does God in reference to Jesus Christ. He
gives him all the people that he has. Jesus Christ has not a man but by
donation from the Father, and therefore they were his first. And this is that
which Jesus Christ acknowledges in this place, thine they were, and thou gave
them to me. And to the same effect he speaks, ver. 10. of this Chapter, Thine
are mine, and I am glorified in them. They that were sometimes thine, are now
mine. Thy interest was first, and mine in the second place by donation and
conveyance from thy self.

You see then all the People of the Lord Christ were first of all belonging to
the Father.

Now to unfold the point a little further to you, because indeed it needs not
proof so much as explication; We will examine and resolve a few things. First,
who the Father is, to whom the people of our Savior Christ do first belong?
Secondly, how and in what respect they do first belong to him? Thirdly, how far
the Father parts with the right he had in those whom he bestows upon our
Savior Christ? Whether he makes them over to him so, that he himself has now
no longer any right at all in them? Or whether only so, that Christ and he do
share together, and have a joint and mixed right and interest in those people.
And lastly, seeing all do first of all belong to God the Father, why he does
not keep them to himself, but makes them over to his Son Christ. These things
would be a little looked into before we come to application.

Calvin also carefully observes, that our Savior in the Gospel, especially in
this of John, speaking as man and not as God, under the name of Father,
intimates and comprehends the whole Godhead. Nor let this seem strange to you;
for Christ as man is Gods Son, not God the Fathers Son alone, but the Son of
the whole Godhead. Indeed as God, he is the Son of the first person only, but
as man, he is the Son of all the persons. As man, he is a Creature, and he is
not God the Fathers Creature only, for the works of the Trinity without are
individed. And therefore Christ is made the Son of God in the same way that
Adam is, Luke 3.33. etc. And it is very evident, that in my Text he spakes to
God the Father, as a Creature and as a Man: for he speaks to him in prayer,
and prayer is a part of worship, and God does not worship God. And when as man
he prays to God, you must not think he prays to the first person only and
exclusively, but he prays to all the persons. And therefore when he says to
God in prayer, thine they were, the people which I have, were sometimes thine,
he cannot mean that they were the first persons only, (for certainly one person
prays not to another) but they were the whole Godheads. You see then who the
Father is, to whom the people of our Savior Christ do first belong. Not God
personally taken for the first person of the Godhead, but God essentially taken
for the whole essence of the Godhead, as subsisting in the persons. And God so
taken is the Father of our Savior Christ as he is man, and so he prays to him
in this place.

Quaere, how and in what respect the people of the Lord Christ were first of
all belonging to his Father, that is to the whole Godhead, before they came to
his hands as he is man and Mediator of the Church. Beloved* they were first of
all belonging to his Father in that sense that we have said, especially in two
respects; either as his Created ones; or as his Elected ones, as his Creatures,
or his Chosen.

1. All the people of the Lord Christ were first of all belonging to his Father
as his Creatures. His they were, for he made them. It is the greatest reason in
the world, that he that makes a thing should own it too, that it should be his
that made it; That he that gives a thing being, should have a title to it while
it has a being, unless he voluntarily and freely make it over to another. And
by this means, God has a primitive original and native right in all the world
and all the people that are in it. Jesus Christ as he is man, has not right to
one person; I mean originally of himself. But how then shall he come to have a
people to be his members, and to make up a Church a body for him? Why God his
Father is content to furnish him out of his store. Rather then he shall want a
Company of men to be his members, he will spare him some of his, and others he
will keep for other purposes to execute his wrath and manifest the glory of his
Justice on. There are a people for thee, says the Father, thou shall have such
and such of mine. All the world are mine, thou know; and such a number I
will give thee out of the world; So many thou shall have among the Jews, and if
that be not sufficient, thou shall have as many more as thou will ask among the
Gentiles. Ask of me and I will give thee, Psalm. 2.7. And hence our Savior
speaking of his people, acknowledges they were his Fathers first, I have
manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave me out of the world. Thine
they were, and thou gave them to me.

2. All the people of the Lord Christ were first of all belonging to his Father
as his chosen. Not only as his Creatures, but as his Elect too. And thus he
has a nearer interest in those whom he bestows on Jesus Christ, then he has
in any other. All the world are his indeed, but then there are some certain
people whom he chooses for himself in a peculiar and a special way. As he that
is the Owner of a goodly Wood, all the Trees are his indeed, but yet there is a
Tree or two, or more, which he chooses to himself and which he marks out to
himself, and for his own particular and private use. So the earth is the Lords,
and all the people that are in it; but yet there are some certain men whom he
has set a part from everlasting to be his, to be the Vessels of his own
House, the Servants of his own Family. As it is said of Jacob, Psalm. 135.4. The
Lord has chosen Jacob to himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. And
therefore when he gives these up to Christ, and makes them actually his, no
marvail though he answer him as in my text, thine they were, and thou have
given them to me. And here indeed the gift of God is most to be observed. He
does not give our Savior all that are his by Creation, all the wicked; he
gives him but some of them, and therefore he is said to give them out of the
world. But he gives him all that are his by Election, he does not keep one man
from him. God has a special interest in them above the rest, they are his own
peculiar treasure, as you heard but now, and every one of them he gives to
Christ. Jesus Christ has all his treasure, take his trash who will.

Now for the third particular, how far the Father parts with the right Thine
they were, says Jesus Christ, why then it seems they are not now; thine they
were, but now they are no longer thine; for thou have given them to me.

But certainly we must not understand it in such an absolute and rigid sense,
but with some grains of mitigation. For when the Father has actually given men
to Jesus Christ to be his members, they do not cease to be his Creatures, they
do not cease to be his chosen, and therefore in a sense, my brethren, they are
his still. And this our Savior Christ acknowledges expressly, but a little
after at ver. 9, 10. I pray not for the world, but for them which thou have
given me, and mine are thine. Observe it well, he says not to the Father, mine
were thine, before thou gave them to me, but mine are thine, notwithstanding
thou have given them to me. So that the Father does so bestow his people on the
Son, that after the donation, Christ and he do share together, and have a joint
and mixed interest and right in those people; and however they that appertain
to Christ, are styled his peculiar people. Tit. 2.14. which is a term that
intimates not a right in common, but an unmixed and undivided right; you must
not understand it in opposition to the Father, but to themselves, and to the
world and to the Devil. They are his peculiar so, that though they were once
their own, now they are their own no longer. Though they were once the worlds,
now they are the worlds no longer. Though they were once the Devils, now they
are his no longer. But they are not his peculiar so, that they are no more the
Fathers. No, God and Christ do always share, as I have said, and as he himself
confesses, in the fore-alledged verse, All mine are thine, and thine are mine.
And in this sense, you must conceive the Expression in my text, Thine they
were. They were once wholly and entirely thine; now they are not so thine, for
thou have given them to me, and therefore I must strike in for a share with
thee. Once they were thine only, now it is so no longer, for they are thine and
mine too.



First, Those that belong to God, are his created ones, or as his Creatures; if
he should keep them still in that Condition, and should not give them up to
Jesus Christ, there were no other way but they must perish. All that the
Creator made, by Adams fall have brought themselves into a lost condition. His
work is wholly spoiled and marred by sin that is come in upon it, and has
defaced it, and destroyed it so that unless there be a reparation, all mankind
is cast away and lost for ever. This reparation is the work of Jesus Christ; it
is his business to repair the ruins of decayed mankind, and to restore them to
that beauty and felicity from which they are declined and departed by the fall.
If God the Father give him any broken piece to be amended and recovered by him,
he does his work upon him, and he saves him to the utmost. But if the Father
keep him to himself as a created one, if he leave him in the condition of a
Creature, and do not make him over to his Son, that he may be a redeeemed one,
that he may be recovered and restored by him, he even remains in that
miserable and undone estate wherein the whole race of mankind is involved by
the fall. And therefore when the Father looks on the Creation, and sees his
work is wholly spoiled, he considers with himself, I will not leave it all in
this condition; no, some of it shall be repaired again, and that shall be my
Sons business. And so accordingly he picks out such and such a soul, and brings
it to the Lord Christ; There take that soul, and set it right again: I give it
thee to this end that thou may repair it, and restore it to all the happiness
which it has lost by Adams fall.

Secondly they that belong to God as his Elected ones, or as his Chosen, if he
should keep them still in that Condition, and should not give them up to Jesus
Christ (this cannot be, but if this should be supposed,) there were no other
way but they must perish; for it is not enough to the salvation of a soul, that
it be chosen, unless withal it be delivered up to Jesus Christ, and made a real
living member of his body. And therefore God Electeth every soul in Christ; he
chooses it in him, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 1.4. That is, he looks on it in
Christ, in the instant of Election, designeth it in time to be a part of
Christ. And so accordingly when the appointed season comes, he brings this
Chosen one of his to Christ, and gives it him, yea puts it into him; There take
it to thy self (says he) mine it has been from everlasting by election, and
now I make it thine by actual union and incorporation. I have done my part for
it, and now do thou do thine. I have chosen it, do thou save it.

This shall suffice for clearing of the observation. I shall but add a word or
two of application.

And is it so that all the people of the Lord Christ were first of all
belonging John 6.39. This is the Fathers will, that of all which he has given
me, I should lose nothing. His Father gave them to him, bequeathed them to him,
by his will. And this was upon the Will, that he should not lose them too. O
what a ground of confidence is here that Christ will keep us? though we be apt
to fall away, though the Devil and the world pluck violently at us, we may
depend upon it, they shall not get us out of Christ's hands. We were his
Fathers, and he gave us him by Will, and that with this Condition that he
should not lose us. And therefore let us rest upon it, he will be careful of
his Fathers Will, and he will keep us for his Fathers sake.

And thus far of the first particular whereof our Savior minds his Father by
way of preparation to the prayer which he makes for his Apostles and Disciples:
that which he had done for them. I have manifested thy name to the men which
thou gave me out of the world, thine they were, and thou gave them to me.

The second follows now in order to be handled, that which they themselves had
done in reference to God the Father, they have kept thy word.

And here you may take notice with me of these two things, which show
themselves to any one, that does but look upon the words. First the act of
these Apostles and Disciples of our Savior, they have kept; And then the
object of this act of theirs, the thing which he affirms they have kept, the
word of God, They have kept thy word.

And this our Savior mentions (as he does the rest) by way of preparation to
his prayer for them, to show what cause there was, why they should be remembered
in his prayers, what did induce him to pray and to be confident that he should
speed with God in prayer for them, because they had been faithful and
obedient. They had kept the word of God, and therefore they shall have his word
to God in prayer for them, he makes no doubt, they shall have a word from God,
by way of merciful return and gracious answer to his prayer.

There is the inward and essential, and there is the outward and declaratory
word of God. The inward word, the word God. The outward word, the word of God,
or the word which comes from God: Though not immediately from God to us, yet
mediately by his Prophets and Apostles, and Jesus Christ himself as he was man,
whom he made his Scribes, and Heralds, and Ambassadors and Mouth, God spoke in
times past to the Fathers by the Prophets, Heb. 1.1. he spoke by the mouth of
the holy Prophets, Luke 1.10. The Prophecy came not in old time by the will of
man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2 Pet.
1.21. And so for the New Testament, the Apostle tell us, that in these last
days God has spoken to us by his Son, Heb. 1.2. and that which God speaks, is
Gods word.

Now it is called the word of God in my Text and elsewhere often, because it
manifests and makes known the mind and will of God. For as the word of man
discovers to us, what the man means, what he conceives in his mind and heart
within, which else we were by no means able to imagine; so the word of God (my
brethren) shows us the heart and mind of God, as far as he is pleased to
express it, and to make it known to us; it shows us what his will and pleasure
is. What he will have us to do, and what he means to do with us.

And this word the Apostles and Disciples kept: that is the term our Savior
uses in my text. He made it known to them, he showed them what his Fathers mind
and will was, and they kept it. I have manifested thy name unto the men which
thou gave me out of the world, and they have kept thy word. What is intended
by that phrase of keeping, shall be fully opened, when I come to explication of
the point; in the mean time the observation shall be this.

DOCTRINE. They whom the Father gives to Jesus Christ, do keep his word.
You see it is the Character he gives of those that are bestowed upon him by
his Father. Thine they were, and thou have given them to me, and they have kept
thy word. And after to the same effect, they have received thy word; It is
usually set down as the property of those who belong to Jesus Christ, that they
keep his sayings, John 14.23, if a man love me, says our Savior there, he
will keep my words; and his words and the Fathers words are all one. And hence
there is a blessing poured out on such, Luke 11.28. Blessed are they that hear
the word of God and keep it.

But not to stay upon the proof in general, because the term is for somewhat
dark, I shall proceed to show you more particularly and distinctly what it is
to keep the word of God, which is the main thing in the observation, They whom
the Father gives to Jesus Christ, do keep his word. Now this imports and
carries in it diverse things.

To keep the word of God is to retain it in the memory, not only to To hold
fast what we have received, as the expession is, Rev. 3.11. Reprobis effluit
sermo dei, says Calvin on my Text. The word of God flows away from reprobates
and wicked men. It is like water shed upon the ground, which is gone upon the
sudden. But it sticks with the Elect, it takes deep root there. It is observed
to the praise of Mary, that she kept the sayings of our Savior, all his
sayings, Luke 2.50. Others lost them, but she kept them and therefore she is
set in opposition to them. They understood not the sayings which he spoke to
them, they knew not what he meant, and therefore it was quickly gone with them;
for what you do not understand you shall be hardly able to remember. But Mary
kept these sayings in her heart, while many others, who understood not these
discourses of our Savior, let them go. They valued them as things of nothing,
and looked upon them but as loose words, and therefore had no mind to keep
them. She laid them up with extraordinary care, as singular and choice things.
And this is that which the Apostle Paul exhorts us to, Heb. 2.1. We ought to
give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, that is to the
words of God, least at any time we should let them slip. (...), least we prove
like leaking vessels that hold not what is poured into them, but leak it out
again upon a sudden, Lest we forget the word of God. That is the first thing
then, to keep the word of God, is to retain it in the memory. And those whom he
bestows on Christ, do thus keep it.

And as there is a keeping of it in the memory, so in the second place, so in
the heart by believing. And of this sort of keeping speaks our Savior, John
8.51. Verily I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
His saying is the doctrine of the Gospel which is more properly the word of
Christ. He cannot mean if a man keep my saying, if he remember it, he shall
never see death. But if a man keep my saying, if he believe it, if he keep it
in his heart (for with the heart a man believes to salvation) then he shall
never see death. And so the words are parallel with those which he delivers in
another place, John 11.2. Whosoever believes in me shall never die. That is
the second sort of keeping then, in the heart by believing.

There is a keeping of the word of God, as in the mind by remembering, David
kept the word of God very dear in his affections, as he professes very often;
sometimes he says that it is sweeter to him then honey or the honeycomb
sometimes that is dearer to him then thousands of Gold and Silver; That he
loves it above Gold, yea above fine Gold. He loves it not as Silver, but as
Gold, not equal unto Gold, but above Gold. Not above ordinary base Gold, but
above fine Gold. That place is notable in which he seems to be transported,
Psalm. 119.97. O how do I love thy Law! It is, out of all measure, it is so
great that I am no way able to express it.

There is a keeping of the word as in the mind by remembering, and keep and to
obey is all one. And so the Lord himself explains it. Deuteronomy. 13.4. Ye shall walk
after the Lord your God and keep his Commandments; And what is that? you shall
obey his voice and serve him, as it is added in the next words.

Now the word of God is kept as I shall show you very clearly both by active
and by passive obedience. First it is kept by active obedience to it; and
Secondly it is kept by passive obedience for it.

1. There is a keeping of the word of God by active obedience to it, by doing
that which it commands, and by avoiding that which it forbids. This is the
common acceptance of the term. This sense the Holy Ghost himself (the best
Interpreter) gives of it, 1 John 5.22. Whatsoever we ask we receive of him,
because we keep his Commandments. Keep his Commandments! how so? you have it
clearly in the following words, And do those things that are pleasing in his
sight And thus you must conceive the meaning of the Holy Ghost in the
forealledged Scripture. Luke 11.28. Blessed are they that hear the word of God,
and keep it, that is; that hear it, and obey it.

2. And as the word of God is kept by obedience active to it, so by obedience
passive for it. And this is clearly intimated in the attestation that he gives
the Church of Sardis, Apoc. 3.10. thou have kept the word of my patience, that
is, as thou have kept my word in general, so more particularly thou have kept
those portions of my word, and those parcels of my truth which must have
patience to the keeping of them. A man may keep some part of Gods word without
patience, as being as being universally received by all, opposed by none. But
then there are some other portions of the Word and Truth of God, which if a man
maintain and hold, and practice, he shall surely suffer, he shall be persecuted
for them. A man might have gone clear along with some truth, even in the Marian
days themselves. But if he held and openly professed the truth against the real
Presence in the Sacrament, and so in many other things, he brought himself into
extreme danger. And so in every age there are some passages of holy Scripture,
and the truths delivered in them that are more opposed then others, so that
whoever sticks to them, shall be sure to meet with trouble, and so to exercise
his patience. And he that keeps these notwithstanding, that maintains them, and
that yields obedience to them, he keeps the Word of Gods patience. And
therefore it is noted of the good ground that it receives the Word of God
aright, and brings forth fruit with patience, Luke 8.15. That on the good
ground are they, which in a good and honest heart having heard the Word keep
it, and bring forth fruit with patience, That is, the Word is fruitful in them,
notwithstanding persecutions and afflictions. So was it in the Thessalonians,
as the Apostle testifies of them, 1 Epist. 2.13. When ye received the Word of
God, said he, ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the
Word of God, which effectually also works in you. And what was this effectual
operation? Constancy in sharp sufferings, as you may see in the next verse. And
yet they would not let it go, though they suffered much for it. That of the
Prophet David is remarkable, Psalm. 119.161. Princes have persecuted me without
cause, but my heart stands in awe of thy Word. He had rather have them
against him, then have the Word of God against him. They threatened him if he
obeyed and kept the Word. The Word on the other side that threatened him if he
renounced and disobeyed it. Whom did he fear most? why, says the Psalmist, My
heart stands in awe of thy Word. Though they be Princes, very great men, and
though they threaten me, and persecute me too, yet I fear the Word of God more
then I fear them. I dare not disobey it, how much soever I displease them, how
much soever I may suffer from them. This is to keep the Word by obedience
passive for it.

Thus much shall serve for the Explication of the point.

Now is it so, that they whom the Father gives to Jesus, Thine they were, says
Christ to God the Father, and thou gave them to me, and they have kept thy
Word. And is it so with you my Brethren? Consider it a little and proceed in
the discovery according to the branches laid before in Explication of the point.

Mary did, you have them sure and safe there. You have them ready and at hand
to bring them forth on all occasions for the Direction and the Consolation of
your selves and of your Brethren; But for the greater number, they have lost
all, nothing at all sticks by them. The Word of God has come to them as the
Apostle says, and they have let it go again. I must acknowledge there is
difference in the memories of men, and some are subject to a natural defect, so
that they fail them strangely in their own affairs, which are of most
concernment to them. But when the memories of men are sure and faithful to them
in all other things, but hold the Word of God no better then a Sive holds
water, that lets every drop go, this is a very sad case. It is a shrewd
presumption that they are none of Christ's Disciples. But you will say, How
shall we amend this, how shall we do that we may keep the Word of God in this
respect? I will give you two or three Directions.

1. Keep your minds close to it, let them not rove and wander while you hear
it; if they do, you lose all. This is the Apostles counsel to give earnest
heed, to be intent upon the things we hear, to watch the words as they come
forth out of the Preachers mouths, Heb 2.1. and why so? least at any time we
let them slip. If we would remember well, there must not be the least diversion.

2. Get a good understanding in the Word of God. The observation of the Holy
Ghost is notable for this purpose, Luk 2.19. They understood not the sayings
which he spoke unto them. But Mary kept all these sayings in her heart. They
kept them not, because they did not understand them; that which is not
understood will very hardly be remembered. They are our understanding hearers
that carry all away, while ignorant and sottish people keep nothing.

3. Value the Word of God more, and you shall find you will remember it the
better. See the necessity, the excellency of it, and then you will be careful
how you lose it. Esteem it as the Prophet David did above gold, yea, above fine
gold. He whose memory is weakest, seldom forgets where he has laid his gold.

4. Strengthen memory by meditation, repetition, conference of what you hear.
If it be hard to take in holy Truths, chafe them in, rub them in, and settle
them by this means. Let them be as a nail well fastened (as the expression of
the Wiseman is) and set home with many strokes that they may not out again.

5. Set instantly upon the practice of the truth delivered to you; as soon as
you hear it, act it. That which you do, you will remember. Mark that of the
Apostle James 1.25. Not being a forgetful hearer but a doer of the Word; The
doer then is no forgetful hearer. Many men remember nothing because indeed they
do nothing.

6. When holy truths are gone with you, when they are slipped away, entreat the
Holy Spirit to recall them. Mind him humbly of his Office, and of the end for
which your Savior sent him down into this lower world, to bring things to
remembrance which have been taught you, Joh. 14.26.

JOHN. 17.6. And they have kept thy Word.


TO pass on to the Second branch of this discovery; Have you

And is it so with you my Brethren? Do you believe the Word of God? Do your
hearts say Amen to every particle and tittle of it? If God should come and put
the question to you concerning those particulars of holy Truths which seem most
hard to be believed, most difficult to be accomplished, as once our Savior did
to Martha, when he had said, I am the Resurrection and the life; he that
believes in me though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever lives
and believes in me shall never die. Believe thou this? Joh. 11.26. Can you
return the same answer? yea Lord I believe, as she did; May not the same be
charged on abundance of you, which God so sharply reprehends in Israel, Psalm.
106.24. They believed not his Word, and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
Are there not multitudes among us, who give no credit to the Word at all? who
when they hear the truths of God delivered to them, do not enquire with
Nicodemus only, How can these things be? but even peremptorily determine they
can never be.

And here because they are of many sorts who do not keep the Word of God in
their hearts by believing, I will set them in their ranks, and proceed with
them in order.

Some there are who question all the Word of God throughout, David in his haste
and in his passion, All men are liars; the very Penmen of the Word of Truth it
self. The Prophets, the Apostles, all are liars. As that blasphemous Pope who
styled the Gospel, the Fable of Christ. These men are flat Atheists, what ever
their professions be. We want not some in these times, who are so bold as to
declare themselves in this particular, and openly to renounce the Word of God.
And certainly however other men conceal themselves for shame, yet there are
more of this opinion then we are aware of. They do not say with their tongues
perhaps, but yet with David's fool, they say it in their hearts, the Scripture
is not Gods Word, yea there is no God at all, to be Author of the Scripture.



1. Some there are who do not give assent to the Divine Authority of all the
Precepts of the Word of God. Some deny some certain Precepts' and Commandments
by themselves apart. The Papists they deny the second Precept. Vasques
acknowledges that this Commandment interdicts not only the adoring of an Image
under the notion of a God, but also the adoring of the true God in an Image.
And further he confesses that they do the very thing that is condemned in this
Commandment. What then? because it will not be obeyed, it must be cancelled
and repealed, and not admitted to have any place among the Moral precepts of
the Law of God. It was says he, a positive and Ceremonial Law, and therefore
ceases now in our days. And thus they make the Commandment of the Lord of no
effect, through their tradition. Others deny the fourth Commandment, and
affirm that is also vanished with the Ceremonials, that it belongs not to
Christians, save only in regard of Moral equity, in which respect the Moral and
Judicial Laws belong to us also. And yet the Lord you see has placed it in the
middle of the Decalogue, and hedged it in on every side with other precepts
that it might be the safer from the violence of those who seek to raze it out
of the Tables. But that which these men do by parcels and retail, there are
another sort who do in gross, and as it were by whole sale, cast off all the
Precepts and Commandments of the Law of God together, affirming they are all
abolished, not only in regard of irritation, malediction, condemnation, but
even in regard of obligation; And thus with those in David's time they make void
the Law of God. These men cannot pray to God as David does, Psalm. 119.66. Teach
me good judgment and knowledge, for I have believed thy Commandments. And
verily if all that are bestowed on Jesus Christ do keep the Word of God in the
heart by believing, they that renounce it thus, seem to be in an ill Condition,
and they have reason to consider well whether they be given up to Christ or no.

it is not be, with Israel, neither shall we see Sword nor Famine, Jer, 5.12.
And are there not a multitude of this opinion? For tell me, my Beloved, when
you that know your selves to be unclean livers; have heard that dreadful
commination, Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge: when you that are so
glewed to the world, that nothing can divide you from it, have heard that
flaming sentence, That no covetous person has any inheritance in the Kingdom
of God: when you that wallow in your filthiness, you that are liars, swearers,
drunkards, enemies of all goodness, have heard that nothing that is filthy or
unclean, shall come within the new Jerusalem; that without shall be liars and
dogs that bark and snarl, and snap at holiness, that such shall have their
portion in the lake, etc. have you believed these threatenings? have you
assented to the truth of them? Alas, my Brethren, it is Evident you have not.
For

1. First, If you believe the threatenings, you will quake and tremble at them.
This disposition is observed in the Saints of God in Scripture, that as they
had believing, so they had tender trembling hearts, in relation to his
threatenings. Such a heart had good Josiah, his heart was tender when he heard
the words (that is, the threatening words) of God, his words against Jerusalem,
2 King. 22.19. not to it to instruct; nor for it to comfort; but against it to
affright. Such a heart had holy David, Psalm. 119.12. My flesh trembles for
fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments. He speaks not of his
Judgments actually inflicted, for they are felt, but of his judgments
threatened only; and hanging in the Commination, for they ate feared, I am
afraid of thy judgments. Of such a temper was the Prophet, Hab. 3.16. when I
heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, etc. And such a
disposition they discovered, of whom the Propeht Ezra speaks, chapter 9. ver. 4.
they feared the words of the God of Israel. That is, his threatening words, as
appears by that which follows, because of their transgression. Nay the Apostle
James affirms of the very Devils that even they belive and tremble, Jam.
2.19. They believe the Comminations, and they quake and tremble at them. And
verily the same effect would they produce in men, if they did but believe them
as the Devils do. But alas how many are there who have no such thing in them?
who though they hear the wrath of God denounced, and though they see his
vengeance executed on ungodly men before their eyes in a very dreadful manner,
yet are not moved or troubled at it in any measure or degree, by which it is
apparent that they have no faith in them.

2. Secondly if you believe the threatenings, you will take some course or
other, to avert the evil threatened. It is observed of the Ninvites; that they
believed God, believed him in the threatening message he sent them by the
Prophet, Jonah 3.5. And what followed? They proclaimed a Fast, and put on
Sackcloth, and turned every one from his evil way, from the violence that was
in his hands. They that are never troubled for the sins which God threatens,
never endeavor reformation, but continue as they were, wicked and unclean
still, do not believe his Comminations, they look upon them but as bruta
fulmina, and empty Scare crows which though they may fright others so as to
drive them out of their beloved sins, they are resolved they shall never scare
them, so as to work the smallest change, or the least amendment in them.

There are a third sort yet behind, and they are such as do not believe the
promises of God. They do not act their faith upon them; They do not keep them
in their hearts by beleiving. And truly there are multitudes that fail in this
particular, as is apparent by these symptoms following, viz.

1. Because they are so full of fears, they walk so sadly and dijectedly. Faith
in the promises will fill the heart with joy and comfort in the worst of times,
and the sharpest of sufferings. Believing we rejoice with the Apostle, and that
with joy unspeakable and glorious, 1 Pet. 1.8. You cannot think of any trial,
any trouble, whether inward in the soul, or outward in the body, name, estate,
but there is a promise for it, to clear and comfort and support the soul in it.
And if the promise be believed, the soul cannot be void of comfort; It will
revive the saddest heart. It is for want of faith that men are so oppressed
with grief and sorrow.

2. It is too evident that men do not believe the promises of God, because they
are so full of doubts and fears, so full of endless cares and troubles, and
distractions. Brethren, there is no end of the cares and fears of men, of their
questions and debates until they come to pitch upon the promises. Till they
come to rest on this, God has said it, I have God in bond for it, he has
undertaken it who lives for ever, in whom is everlasting strength; the soul
will never be at quiet, it will be shaken as the trees in the Forest, as Isa.
7.2. Oh thinks a poor wretch, if I should live till I be blind, till I be
impotent, till I have spent all, what should I do? What shall my wife and
children do? What if I lose such a friend, or such a comfort? So rich men have
as much trouble, What if the times should frown upon me? what if malicious men
should swear against me? what if the Enemy break in upon me and plunder me?
etc. and a thousand of these doubts and fears men have; And whence are all
these? truly they are not so much from the greatness of their danger, as from
the smallness of their faith: O you of little faith, wherefore do you doubt?
whence are your doubtings, troubles and perplexities, but because you do not
keep the word of promise in your hearts by believing? You do not act your faith
upon that Word of God, that he will never fail you nor forsake you. Beloved,
let a man look where he will, there is a greater power against him, then there
can be for him, out of God. And all these outward things are so contingent,
they lie so doubtful and uncertain, that a man can never be secure in them. And
therefore if you would be settled and secured for the future, build on God, and
on the Promise. Say not I have such a Parent, such a Friend, and he will
provide for me, he will see I shall not want. I have such Income by the year,
such a Trade, such an Estate, such a power on my side. The conclusion will not
hold; but say rather I have such a God, and such a promise. God has said that
he will feed me, and therefore I shall be fed. God has said that he will keep
me, and therefore I shall be kept. God has said that he will pardon me, and
therefore I shall be forgiven.

3. It is apparent that men do not believe the promise, because they are
inconstant and uncertain in their ways. They knew not what to do, nor where to
live, nor what side to stick to. They are tossed to and fro, they are on and
off again. And what is the cause of this? truly it is for want of faith upon
the promise; for that would settle them and root them; but on the other side,
says God, and binds it with a strong asseveration too, If ye will not
believe, surely ye shall not be established, Isa. 7.9. You will be thus
unstable still, and fickle still, unless you pitch by faith upon the promise.

4. It is apparent that men do not believe the promise, because they will
suffer nothing for it. They will not part with any thing, their liberty, their
ease, their profit for the promise sake: whereas faith if it were acted, would
have an admirable operation on them. And therefore the Apostle makes this the
ground of the strange patience of the Saints. When they were tortured, tried
with mockeries, scornings, bonds, imprisonment, when they were stoned, sawn
asunder, what made them able to endure such things, and not to accept
deliverance when it was offered, if they would have yielded and complied a
little? It was their faith, as you may see, Heb. 11.33, 37. by faith upon the
promise they attained to this strength, that they could not be overcome nor
made to yield to adversaries when they endured such torments as were impossible
for flesh and blood to suffer, but became Conquerors in them all, yea more then
Conquerors, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Romans 8.37. So when it is affirmed of
the holy Martyrs, Apoc. 12.11. that they overcame the Dragon in all the
persecutions that he raised against them, it is withal observed, that they did
it by the blood of the Lamb; the faith they had in the blood of Jesus Christ
enabled them to bear and overcome so bitter torments as they did endure. And so
it will do any of us in the like case. This is the victory that overcomes the
world, even our Faith, 1 John 5.4. And therefore when we are so quickly
overcome, and brought to choose sin rather then affliction, it is a sign we
want faith.

By this, you see there are too many who do not keep the Word of God in their
hearts by believing. Now I beseech you, my Beloved, as you would have this
assurance that you are of the number of those that belong to Christ by the
donation of the Father, keep his words; if you observe your Faith to waver, or
to fail in any point, abase and judge your selves for it. And that you may the
better know how far to judge, and how far to acquit your selves in this
particular, I shall give you some Cautions.

1. You are not bound to credit every thing that is presented to you, under the
name and title of the Word of God; To give a sudden and inconsiderate assent
to all that the best Minister delivers to you, because he teaches it, and you
are well persuaded of the man. You may, nay more then so, you ought to try
before you trust in this case. Prove every thing, says the Apostle, 1 These.
5.21. and then hold fast that which is good. It is observed of the Bereans,
that they were not so servilly addicted and engaged to any Teachers, how
excellent soever their endowments were, as to receive upon their credit any
thing that they delivered. No, their manner was to search the Scriptures,
whether things were so, Act. 17.11. And yet it is notable that they are said to
have received the Word of God with all readiness of mind for all this. The Lord
requires no greater readiness of mind then this, in entertaining or believing
any thing that is delivered in his Name, that is, to take it upon some trial.

2. It is no sign of infidelity to move some questions, with an aim at
satisfaction concerning things delivered either in or from the Word. If it be
done with holy reverence, and with an humble and sincere desire of satisfaction
and instruction, it is a very good course. So did the blessed Virgin make a
question concerning what the Angel had delivered to her, Luke 1.34. A question
not of opposition, but of inquisition, How shall these things be? This way of
making doubts and questions it seems was used in the Jewish Church, and Christ
approved it by his Example, Luke 2.46, 47. So it is said of the Apostle Paul
that he reasoned with the Jews out of the Scriptures, Act. 17.2. And if such
reasonings were more in use, not reasonings against the Word, but out of the
Word, there would assuredly be more faith then there is at this day.

3. Nay (though it be a sign of weakness,) it is no sign of utter infidelity,
to have some doubtful thoughts arising in our hearts concerning the most clear
and pregnant Truths that are revealed in the Word of God. David had such
thoughts as these, and yet he was a good man, though this indeed were no part
of his goodness, Psalm. 89.19, 37, 38. There you have first the Lords assurance,
that he will establish David and protect him. And at last he comes to swear
that he will not lie to David, his Throne shall endure for ever, etc. And yet
observe how David fails in the very next words, but thou have cast off and
abhorred, thou have made void the Covenant of thy servant. This was his great
infirmity, and yet you see it was not incompatible with grace. It may befall a
Saint, to have such unbelieving thoughts as these, provided that he pray
against them, strive against them, and be humbled for them. As David was when
he had motions to distrust the Providence of God, to question this great truth
of God, as Psalm. 73. this did so trouble him, that at verse. 21. he says his
very heart was grieved, and he was pricked in his reins because he was so
foolish and so ignorant: And while it is thus with us, we need not thereupon,
to doubt our interest in Jesus Christ.

But if we entertain such thoughts as these, and bid them welcome when they
come, etc. if we never pray, nor strive against our unbelief, nor grow up into
any certainty in matters of Religion: If we resolvedly reject the Word of God,
either in part, or in the whole, this is a very sad case. If I speak the truth
says Christ, why do you not believe me? Joh. 8.46. And mark what follows
presently, ye therefore hear me not, that is, believe me not, because ye are
not of my sheep, as I said unto you. So that it is a formidable thing you see
not to believe the Word of Christ. It shows that men are none of Christ's. And
therefore let us give assent to the whole Word of God, the precepts, promises,
and threatenings, that Christ may own us, that he may say concerning us to God
the Father, Thine they were, and thou gave them to me.

And thus we have dispatched the first and second branch of the discovery.

Proceed we to the third; Have you kept the Word of God in your They received
not the love of the Truth says the Apostle there, and what follows? that they
might be saved. No salvation unless the Word, the Truth of God be kept in the
affections by the loving it. And therefore it is added presently, for this
cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they might all be damned. Oh
then as you desire to have this sweet assurance in your souls, that you belong
to Jesus Christ, and that you shall be saved by him, examine whether you have
kept the Word of God in this respect or no? whether you have it dear in your
affections?

And that you may the better try your selves in this regard, I shall give you
some discoveries.

If you love the Word of God, you will desire on all occasions to converse with
it. Desire of union and communion is always an effect and David, who was
unparalleled in this respect, for infinite affection to the Word of God. It is
a wonder to consider how his heart was set upon it. And hence it was, that when
he was kept off from the enjoyment of the Word, he had such vehement and
enflamed desires to be partaker of it. He panted and he gasped after it, even
as the Heart pants after the waterbrooks. Oh when shall I appear before God?
Psalm. 42.2. when shall I be partaker of his Word, and of his Ordinances once
again? when will it once be? So in another place, My soul longs, yea even
faints for the Courts of the Lord, where Ordinances were dispensed. My heart
and my flesh cries out for the living God, Psalm. 84.2. So that he envies the
very Sparrows and the Swallows, who were freer then himself to be near that
place. Yea, his longing was so great, that he was even heart-broken with it,
Psalm. 119.20. My soul breaks for the longing that it has to thy judgments
at all times. And have you such affections, and such anhelations in you? Let us
examine it a little in these two particulars.

1. Do you hear the Word of God as often as you may? not only now and then,
when you have nothing else to do, and when you have no other business to
withdraw you, but constantly on all occasions? do you attend upon it, as your
main and chief business? do you for the love you bear it, neglect and set aside
and under-value other things? this is the Wisemans admonition, Prove. 23.23. Buy
the Truth and sell it not. Sell it not for a little profit, in the field or in
the shop, but rather buy it and redeem it with your loss of outward things. Do
you conceive that David of whose high affections you have heard, would neglect
any opportunity, for being made partaker of the Word of God? Oh how did he
bewail the want of it? How would he have struggled for it? How eagerly would he
have taken it, with any outward disadvantage? And this is that which Christ
commends Mary for, not for a work of supererogation, as doing more then she
was bound to do, but for a regular account and estimation of the Word, setting
aside her household business, that she might be partaker of it, Luke 10.42. Not
only they that will not hear the Word of God at all, but they that hear it
seldom, that suffer every worldly business to withdraw them from it, will be
found not to have loved it and esteemed it as they ought to do. How shall we
escape says Paul, Heb. 2.3. if we neglect so geeat salvation?

2. Do you exercise your selves as in the hearing, so in the reading and in the
meditation of it? Do you converse with the Word of God in private? Does it
dwell with you in your houses, as the Apostles phrase is? Col. 3.16. For this
you must know, my Brethren, that though you should be ordinary hearers of the
best Ministry beneath Heaven, yet you must not rest in that, but you must
exercise your selves in reading of the Word of God in private. It was the Lords
Commandment to the King himself, that though he might plead want of leisure
more then many others, and though he had the ordinary help of the Levites,
Priests, and Prophets more then others, as David had both Gad and Nathan, yet
he must have his Bible still, and must be constant in the reading of it, as you
may see, Deuteronomy. 47.49. And it was that which cheered and supported Job in his
affliction, Job 23.12. that he could say uprightly in the presence of the Lord,
I have esteemed the Word of his mouth more then my necessary and appointed
food. More duly then he kept his meals, he tied himself to read and meditate in
Gods-Word. Among the Jews under Antiochus it was made capital for any man to
have the Book of God by him. And in Queen Mary's days, you know the danger was
not less, and then how did they prize a little piece of Holy Writ, how did they
value a few Chapters of the Bible? If a poor a man could get a leaf, or two,
how safely would he keep them in his bosom, next his heart, as the most
precious things he had? How would he wear them out with reading in them? God
has dealt more graciously with us, there is now no danger to have a Bible, and
therefore if we be not constant in the reading and the meditation of it, we
show not such affection to it as we ought to do. That is the first thing then;
if you love the Word of God, you will desire on all occasions to converse with
it, both in public and in private.

2. If you love the Word of God, you will endeavor to be inwardly acquainted
with it; we converse with many men, with whom we are not intimate. And so there
are abundance that hear and read the Word of God, and yet know little of the
meaning of it. But if you love it as you ought to do, you will not satisfy
your selves with this, that you read so many Chapters in a day, that you attend
on every Sermon that is preached, unless you find that you do in a measure
understand the mind of God, and the mind of Jesus Christ, in those things. If I
affect a man exceedingly, I shall endeavor what I can to get within him, as we
use to say; not to know his face, and to hear his words only, but to be
inwardly acquainted with his disposition, and the purpose of his heart. And so
if you affect the Word, you will strive to get into the bosom of it; You will
not be contented with a formal superficial knowledge of the letter of it, but
you will dive into the very bowels of the Scripture, and never leave till you
know the heart of it. And this is that which the Apostle Paul insinuates, Col.
3.16. Let the Word of God dwell in you richly, (...), Let it dwell, let it be a
houshold-guest, let it rise, and sit and walk, dine and sup, and lodge with
you, let it be familiar to you. Be you as thoroughly acquainted with it, as any
man that dwells in your house, with whom you have discourse and dealing every
hour. And truly if you strive not thus to be acquainted with the Word of God,
you do not love it as you ought to do.

3. If you love the Word of God, you will not easily fall out with it, when
you find the meaning of it, and perceive it is against you in something that is
naturally dear to you, you will not quarrel with it, your hearts will not rise
up in enmity against it. No, your dear affections to it will make you quietly
and meekly to submit to it. Indeed ungodly men cannot endure the Word of God;
the Precepts and Commandments of it are like bonds and cords to them, they lay
restraint upon them, they curb them and they hold them in, and hence they are
enraged against it. They endeavor what they can to break the bonds of God
asunder, they are always contradicting and opposing, and gainsaying, and
raising quarrels, and disputes against the Word, because they hate it. But now
the Saints upon the other side are very much in Love with it, and hence it is
that the Commandments of it are not grievous to them, they agree with their
spirits, they are written in their hearts. Or if at any time it cross them,
they are not angry with the Word, but with themselves, that their base hearts
should not in every thing agree with it; Yea, when it is a little sharp and
bitter, though their stomachs rise at first, yet in the issue they submit, and
say as Hezekiah to Isaiah, Isa. 39.8. Good is the Word of the Lord, which thou
have spoken. They find a sweet and pleasing savor even in the sowrest passage
of the Word. There goes a savor with their knowledge of it, as the Apostle
Paul's expression is, 2 Cor. 2.14. Carnal men may know abundance of the
Scripture, more then a precious Saint of God; but here is the difference, they
find no savor in their knowledge of it, at least no sweet and pleasing savor.
No, it is distastful to them, it does not suit with their palates, it does not
fit their humors. A Drunkard knows it is a sin to be intemperate, to drink
himself down to a beast; A wanton and lascivious person knows it is a sin to be
unclean, but this doctrine does not please him; and so it is in other cases:
whereas the Truth is sweet to those that are in Christ, they look upon it as
their friend, and love it, because it joins with them against their lusts who
are their greatest enemies, whom they abhor and whom they hate with a perfect
hatred.

4. If you love the Word of God, you will hardly part with it; you will not
let it go from you, if you can keep it any way, by any means. And much less
will you go from it. I have not departed from thy judgments, says holy David
to the Lord, Psalm. 119.102. for thou have taught me. Brethren, there are a sort
of men who have a kind of knowledge of the Word of God, but they have no love
to it, and hence it is that they are easily withdrawn from it, as multitudes
have been in these times; while they that have it dear in their affections are
rooted and established in the present truth, as 2 Pet. 1.12. They are not
carried clean away with every new opinion and conceit as others are. They
cleave unto the Truths of God, with full purpose of heart. They are settled in
their judgments, and resolved in their minds, This is undoubtedly the Truth of
God, I know it to be so, I find it to be so by sensible experience in my soul,
and to this I mean to stick, even to the loss of goods and life, and all. I am
resolved that I will not relinquish it, what ever hazard I may undergo to hold
it, whatever Sophisters and sly Seducers object against it.

5. If you love the Word of God, you will be extremely troubled when it is
slighted and abused; it will vex you to the heart, to see it undervalued and
despised; You will be ready to reply in such a case, The Word is a good friend
of mine, one whom I love dearly, from whom I have received much comfort: And I
am no way able to endure, it wounds me to the very soul to see it used in this
fashion. Beloved, these are times in which the Word of God has suffered much
from wicked and ungodly men. It has been strangely scorned and contemned, and
even trampled under foot: It has been usual in these days of ours for men to
speak against those things that are delivered from the Word, contradicting and
blaspheming. Now, my Beloved, how have such things as these affected you, and
wrought upon you? what tears have they drawn from you? what sorrow have they
wrought in you? how often have they sent you over-loaden to your closets, there
to open all to God? It is observed by the Holy Ghost, that when Jehoiakim had
cut the roll in pieces with a penknife which Jeremiah brought him from the
Lord, and burnt it in the fire upon the hearth, they that stood by were not
afraid, neither did they rent their garments, nor manifest their sorrrow, Jer.
36.23, 24. Beloved, some of you have seen as high contempt as this offered to
the word of God, though not in the same kind. And truly if you have not rent
your hearts, at least, if you have not been inwardly afflicted in your spirits,
and done what you are able to the vindication of it, you have showed but little
love to Gods word.

By these things you may try whether you have kept the word of God in your
affections by loving it, and so have made it to appear that you belong to Jesus
Christ, by the donation of the Father.

Now in the last place, let me quicken you a little to the love of Gods word;
That if you love it not already, you may come to love it; Or if you love it,
you may go on to love it yet more. And to this end I shall desire you to take
notice of how great excellency and admirable use it is to you, as I shall lay
it open in a few particulars.

1. Are you yet in your natural estate? the word of God is the means to convert
you. The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul, Psalm. 19.7. Faith
comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Sanctify them says our
Savior; How? By thy truth, thy word is truth, Joh. 17.17. That speech of Paul
is apposite and full, God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification
of the Spirit and belief of the truth, whereto, that is, to which
sanctification and belief he has called you by our Gospel, 2 These. 2.13, 14.

2. Are you wandering from the way? as who has not his deviations? The word of
God is a light to guide you; it is a Lanthorn to your feet, as David speaks,
Thou shall guide me with thy Counsel, Psalm. 73.14. q. d. although thou do not
lead me by the pillar of a cloud and fire, as once thou did thy people in the
Desert, although thou go not with me in a visible appearance, yet thou have
left me such exact directions, such wholesome Counsel in thy word, that if I
follow that exactly, it is impossible I should miscarry.

3. Are you ignorant? the word of God is a teacher to inform you, It gives
understanding to the simple, Psalm. 119.130. And makes them wise unto Salvation,
2 Timothy 3.15. There is no knowledge indispensably required to salvation, nothing
of necessary faith or practice, either to be believed or done, but is
abundantly revealed in the Scripture.

4. Are you infirm and weak in grace? The word of God is a means to confirm
you. This was the Instrument by which the Apostles confirmed the Churches, Act.
15.4. And as it is the usual means, by which the grace of God is begotten in
the heart, in which respect we find it styled The word of grace, because it
works it, Acts 20.32. so it is the instrument by which it is confirmed and
increased. We grow by sucking the sincere milk of the word, 1 Pet. 2.2. And we
are built up by it to Salvation.

5. Are you in any deep distress? The word of God is the means to comfort you.
Through-comfort of the Scriptures we have hope, Romans 15.4. And David to the
same purpose, Unless thy Law had been my delight, I should then have perished
in my affliction, Psalm. 119.92. And in another place cries out, Remember thy
word unto thy servant upon which thou have caused me to hope; this is my
comfort in my affliction, for thy Word has quickened me, Psalm. 119.49, 50.

6. Are you lost, as we are all of us by nature? The word of God is the means
to save you: this is the saving doctrine, Act. 11.14. The word of life, Phil.
2.16. the word that brings men to life and glory. The Gentiles says the
Apostle Paul to the Ephesians, Ephesians. 3.6. came to be fellow-heirs, and
partakers of the promise by the Gospel.

To sum up all, we have cause to love the word, to have it dear in our
affections, for it is the word that guides us, it is the word that informs us,
it is the word that confirms us, it is the word that comforts us, it is the
word that saves us, that is the power of God unto salvation; with which agrees
the Apostles valediction to the Elders of Ephesus, Act: 20.32. wherewith I take
my leave of you at this time; I commend you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them
that are sanctified.

JOHN. 17.6. And they have kept thy Word.


WE have been long upon this use of trial and discovery whether we be given up
to Christ, or no, by the donation of the Father. Three branches of it we have
now dispatched, and are arrived at the fourth and last, which God assisting we
shall finish at this time. Have we kept the word of God, as in our minds by
remembering, and in our hearts by believing, and in our affections by loving, so
in our lives by obeying? For all of these as you have heard, are comprehended
under this expression. And this indeed, my Brethren, as it is the last, so it
is the height, the upshot, and the sum of all, to keep the word of God in the
life by obeying.

Many there are that remember much of it, that give assent and credit to it,
yea, that pretend a great deal of affection to the word of God, and are indeed
much taken with many things that are delivered in it, and yet they fail in this
which is the main business, they do not give themselves up to the practice and
obedience of it. They leave the rule of God, and are a way and rule unto
themselves. And this was Herod's temper right, he heard the word of God gladly,
he took some kind of pleasure in it, and therefore out of doubt had some
affection to it; but when it came to practice and obedience, there he failed.
He did but many things at most, he did not all that was delivered to him from
the word of God, and this was that which marred all, and made all the rest
worth nothing. And so the second ground, the stony places in the parable,
Matthew. 13.20. they received the Word of God and that with joy, and there must
be some love where there is delight and joy; and yet no fruit at all follows,
as you may see in that place: And truly there are many such among us, who find
some taste in the good Word of God, as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 6.5. There is a
pleasing relish in it which they are delighted with, as there is something in
the Word that may content a palate that is merely carnal, but they make it not
their rule in their lives and conversation. They sit before the Preacher as the
people sits, and listen with affection to his words perhaps, they are a
pleasant sound to them, but their hearts are far from stooping to the obedience
of the Word; no, they are for their covetousness, their uncleanness and their
lusts still.

Now I beseech you, my Beloved, see how it is with you in this regard: If you
will have this sweet assurance in your selves that you are given up to Jesus
Christ, by the donation of the Father, you must keep the Word of God in your
lives by obeying it: you must not rest in this, that you have (as you conceive)
some love to it, and that you take some kind of pleasure and delight in it,
(for this a carnal wretch, a reprobate may do) but you must yield obedience to
it; you must be ruled and ordered by it in your ways: the Word of God must be a
guide to you. When you have any thing to do, you must not think what is
agreeable to your wills, humors, interests, ends, and so act accordingly. But
you must seriously consider with your selves what is agreeable to the direction
of the Word of God, and to the rule which he has there prescribed to you, and
to that you must conform, how unsuitable soever it may be to your desires or to
your aims. Thus you must keep the Word of God, (if you will clear your interest
in Jesus Christ, in your lives by obeying it.

And here that you may not be mistaken, and deceive your selves, I shall desire
you to take notice of a few things.

You must keep it wholly and entirely, you must not keep some parts Thou have
given them to me (says our Savior in my Text) and they have kept thy Word.
Observe it well; he says not, They have kept some portion of thy Word, or They
have kept it in some certain things, they have obeyed some rules and some
directions of it, but they have kept thy Word, you must conceive it, all thy
Word, without any reservation. They have not willingly allowed themselves in
any disobedience to the least iota of it. And thus it is with those that are
bestowed on Jesus Christ, they are obedient to the Word in all things, and so
they make it to appear that they are men of proof indeed, that they are tried
Christians, as the Apostle shows, 2 Cor. 2.9. To this end did I write to you,
that I might have the proof of you, and whether you would be obedient in all
things. They can say as David does, Psalm. 119.104. Through thy precepts I get
understanding, therefore every false way I utterly abhor. As Soon as I get so
much understanding from thy Word and from thy Law, to know that such a way is
false, and leads not to the happiness and comfort which it seems to promise. I
do not follow it and keep it as I did before; no I decline it and abhor it,
yea, I abhor it utterly, I never touch more with it, let it be what it will,
never so sweet, so pleasing, so delightful, so accustomed to me. Through thy
Law I get understanding, therefore every false way I utterly abhor.

And is it so with you (my Brethren)? Turn in upon your selves a little, and
consider how far you are acquainted with the Word and Will of God, how far
the Lord has showed what is good, and what he requires of you, so that you are
convinced of it; and then examine whether you fall short in nothing, whether
you come fully up to the obedience and the practice of it: whether you keep the
Word entirely, so that you do not fail in any thing advisedly and customarily,
of which your understandings are informed, and which you know to be a duty.
Tell me Beloved, is there no such thing? is the Conscience quiet now? does it
lay nothing to your charge? no neglect of any thing you should have done? does
it not tell you that in this and that particular you know the rule, and yet you
have not walked accordingly? In such or such a thing you have gone quite and
clean against it. Brethren, if your hearts accuse you, God is greater then your
hearts, and knows all things. Go home and judge your selves for it: Commune
with your hearts and say, Herein I see I have been faulty; I have not kept the
Word of God, my practice has not been in every point according to the Rule;
no, I have failed in this and that and the other thing: But now I am resolved
in good earnest, by the grace of Jesus Christ to take another course as far as
it is possible; I will not swerve a whit, nor vary in my conversation from the
Word of God. This I acknowledge I have done, which I know well enough I ought
not to have done. This, I confess, I have neglected, which I know I should have
done, but now it shall be so no more. My aim shall be to keep the Word, as far
as humane weakness and infirmity will suffer, wholly and entirely. Thus you
must do if you will make it to appear, that Christ has any share in you.

As you must keep the Word wholly, so you must keep it cordially Romans, Romans
6.17. Ye have obeyed from the heart (says he) the form of Doctrine that has
been delivered to you, or whereto you were delivered, as it is rendered in the
margent; you have obeyed it, and you have obeyed it from the heart; so that
your obedience was voluntary, free, delightful; you found complacencie and
pleasure in it; you needed nothing else to carry and incline you to it, but the
inward motion, disposition, and affection of the heart: You had enough within
you, to quicken you, and stir you up to the obedience of the Word of God. And
thus it is with those that are bestowed on Jesus Christ; they obey it heartily,
while others do it merely out of self ends: All their motives and inducements
to the obedience which they yield are from without; either they are drawn by
force, or they are hired, or they are frighted to it. Their hearts merely of
themselves do nothing with them in the business. Jehu was large enough in his
obedience to the command and will of God, as to the matter of the things he did
with reference to Ahabs house. To say the truth, he did all, every thing that
God would have him; But he failed in this particular, he did nothing heartily,
nothing out of love to God, but all for his own ends, and therefore all he did
was worth nothing. See what an ample attestation he received from God himself,
2 King. 10.13. Thou have executed that which was right in my eyes, and have
done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart. He had not
omitted any particular, and yet because it was not cordially done for God, but
merely for himself, that he might bring about his own designs, he met with a
revenge instead of a reward, as you may see Hos. 1.4. How far does Artaxerxes
go? Ezra 7.23. Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
diligently done. You see to what a pass this Heathen Prince is brought, he will
do any thing for God; any thing that he requires, let it be what it will, he
will obey. But what is that which moves him to it? is it a principle of love to
God, does he do it heartily? No, it proceeds from noting else but fear of wrath
and vengeance, as it is apparent in the latter member of the verse, for why
should there be wrath upon the Realm of the King, and of his Sons?

Now I beseech you, try your selves in this particular; you obey the Word of
God, yea, and it may be you are large in your obedience, as to the matter of
the thing required. But do you (as it is observed of the Romans) obey it from
the heart, or from some other principle? if there is nothing else to move you,
would your hearts carry you to this obedience? Have you that within you still,
that would hold you in from sin and stir you up to duty, if there were no
inducement from without? Can you say as David does? Psalm. 10 8. Lord, I delight
to do thy will, for thy Law is in my heart. Lord, we delight to pray, read,
hear, perform religious duties; it is our meat and drink to do thy will, for
thy Law is in our hearts; It is not written in our understandings only, but in
our hearts and our affections, and this is that which makes obedience to it
pleasing and delightful to us. So that if you might be free from the
injunctions and directions of the Word (with the servant in the Law) you would
not value such a liberty: You would not swear, and be unclean, and run out
into all excess of riot, if you might because your spirits have by grace an
inward contrariety and antipathy against it: you would not cease to pray, and
hear, and perform religious duties if you might, because your spirits have an
inward sweet complacencie in these things. If you thus keep the Word, it is a
sign that you are Christ's Disciples.

As you must keep the Word wholly, and keep it cordially, so you must keep it
constantly; you must keep it to the end, as the Prophet David speaks, Psalm.
119.33. You must hold on in keeping it; you must persist in your obedience to
it, even to your lives end: that Christ may say at last concerning you, when
you depart out of this world, and appear before his Father, Thou have given
them to me, and they have kept thy word. And indeed to obey it for a time, and
then to throw it off again, is not to keep it, but to lose it. Alas how many
such are there among us, in these latter times, who for a while were very
diligent, and Instant in the study of the Scriptures, seemed to be very
cautious and exact to frame their lives in every thing according to the word of
God, so that they would not vary from it in the least particular. Or if they
found themselves at any time, in any thing to swerve from the direction of the
Rule, they would judge themselves for it. But now the Word the rule it self is
laid aside, as an unnecessary and a useless thing, as if it were not worthy the
keeping any longer; there is no care at all to walk by it: when there are gross
and horrid deviations from it, they are not looked upon as matter of
Humiliation or Contrition in the least degree. I wish that such would seriously
consider with themselves, how Christ shall own them in the latter day, how he
shall plead before his Father for them, that they have kept his word.

Now, my Beloved, lay these things to heart, and never rest till you have
gotten this Character of those that are bestowed on Jesus Christ, by the
donation of the Father. Never satisfy your selves till you keep the Word of
God in your lives by obeying it; till you keep it wholly, and till you keep it
cordially, and till you keep it constantly: And then there is a blessing poured
out upon you by the mouth of Christ himself, Blessed are they that hear the
word of God and keep it, that is, that do not hear it only, but obey it. And to
the same effect speaks the Apostle James, Jam. 1.23. If as you look into the
Law the word of God, and understand it, so you continue in it, and are doers of
the work, not forgetful hearers of it, but doers of the work, you shall be
blessed in the deed: And that you may attain this blessedness that follows
those that are obedient to the word, I shall give you some direction.

1. You must seek to God to teach you, though you may learn to know it, as that
a Castaway may do, yet you can never learn to keep it any other way; you shall
never keep the word in the obedience of your lives, unless God and Christ teach
you. David was very sensible of this* and therefore poured out his prayer to
the Lord, Psalm. 119.33. Teach me O Lord the way of thy statutes, and I will
keep it to the end. When thou thy self have taught me once, and not before, I
shall walk accordingly, I shall be obedient to it. It is not in the power of
any in the world to teach a man to frame his life in every thing according to
the word, unless God himself do it. But if he undertake it once, if he be
pleased to be our Teacher, all is well. And this is that which the Apostle Paul
insinuates, Ephesians. 4.20. and in the following verse, ye have not so learned
Christ, (says he) viz. to say and to profess that you are Christians, and yet
to live profanely and licentiously, and lewdly still, If so be that you have
heard him, and been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus. Why what does he
intend? what is it to be taught by him? he tells us in the following verse,
That you put off (touching the former conversation) the old man, and be renewed
in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man. It is such a kind of
teaching whereby we are transferred and brought to the obedience of it: And
therefore if you do indeed desire to have your lives conformed to the rule and
Word of God, seek to Christ himself to teach you.

2. Be sure to set your selves to the obedience of it, out of hand;
Procrastinations and delays will dash all. It is observed of the Colossians,
that they obeyed the Word from the day they heard of it, Col. 1.6. So you my
Brethren, do you grow practical from this day. It may be you are now convinced
of many things, you think of this and that, in which your practice is not
answerable to the rule; you have secret inward motions, and it may be
resolutions to amend all, as David had, I have said that I would keep thy Word,
says he to God, Psalm. 119.57. strike now while it is hot; do as the same holy
Prophet did, I made haste and delayed not, says he, to keep thy precepts,
Psalm. 119.60. As Soon as I resolved, I made haste and set about it. If you have
holy resolutions wrought to practice any duty which you have hitherto
neglected, up, and be doing presently; do not permit such resolutions to grow
cold, and die within you, least you never have them more. I am persuaded there
are many souls in hell, who have purposed in many things to bring their
practice to the Word, to abandon such a sin, and to set on such a duty; they
were resolved upon the thing, but they could not do it yet, and so the Lord
has cut them off, and their delays have proved their ruin.

2. If you will keep the Word of God in your lives by obeying it, you must find
out and mortify the lusts that hinder you in this business, or if you do not
so, you may resolve on this and that, but surely it will come to nothing; and
therefore if you have within you any holy purposes of coming nearer to the
Rule, of leaving such a sin, or setting upon such a duty, think now what lust,
or what corruption there is in you, that will be like to make this blessed
resolution frustrated in you, and set the edge of your Petitions of your
humiliation against this; for if you do not this, you do nothing. Many men have
been very well resolved to walk according to the Word in many things; but when
they come to act their resolutions, there is some lust or other that prevails
against them, and this they do not mortify, and so are able to do nothing.
Well then my Brethren, you have purposes perhaps to keep the Word of God in
such and such particulars: You are extremely sensible that you have failed, but
now it shall be so no more: I but there is some lust, or other, a lust of
pride, or covetousness, or uncleanness, which if it be not mortified will blast
all; strike that, and kill that, and then you may with comfort hope that you
shall approve your selves, such as are given up to Christ, in that you keep his
Word.

And thus we have at length dispatched the Character of those who are bestowed
on Jesus Christ by the donation of the Father; they are such as keep his Word,
that is, the Word of God the Father: So says our Savior here of his Apostles
and Disciples, they have kept thy Word.

Now in the following verses he proceeds to show how they were brought to keep
the Word of God, and by what means it came to pass, that they receive it, and
believed it, and embraced it, and obeyed it. Why says our Savior, they did it
upon this account, because they were persuaded and convinced, that it was the
very word which I received of my Father to deliver. They knew for certain that
it was not any thing which I (as man) devised and invented of my self, but it
was the very message which my Father put into my mouth, and therefore they gave
heed to it. Now they have known that all things, whatsoever thou have given me
are of thee, for I have given unto them the words which thou gave me, and
they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee.

Now this (if you observe it well) is both expressed and amplified. First it is
nakedly expressed, Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou have
given me are of thee. Then it is amplyfied in the succeeding verse, For I have
given unto them the words which thou gave me, and they have received them,
etc. And here our Savior does these two things: First, he declares his own
fidelity in the delivery of his message from his Father to his people, for I
have given to them the words which thou gave me, those very words and no
others. And then he shows the issue and event of this faithfulness of his in
his Apostles and Disciples; and that especially in two respects: First with
relation to the message which he brought, they have received them, says he,
that is, the words which I delivered to them in thy Name. Secondly, then with
relation to himself the Messenger, they have known surely that I came from
thee, and they have believed that thou did send me. Let us at this time make
a little entrance on this discovery of our Savior as it is nakedly expressed.
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou have given me are of thee.

These words as I have hinted formerly, my Brethren, are annexed to those
immediately before, which we have even now dispatched, to show the means and
way by which our Saviors hearers came to keep the Word which he delivered to
them from his Father. Why, says our Savior, this was a great inducement to
it, because they were persuaded that it was of thee, that it was thy word
indeed, and not my own. If I had spoken to them in my own Name, or brought my
own word to them, they would never have received it. But this was that which
made them keep thy word, because they knew that it was thine. Now they have
known that all things whatsoever thou have given me, (you must conceive it to
deliver or declare to my Disciples) or as it is explained in the following
verse, all the words which thou have given me are of thee. So that the point
apparently suggested here is plainly thus:

DOCTRINE. They that will give the Word such entertainment as it ought to have,
must know for certain that it is the word of God.
Had not our Saviors hearers been convinced of this, had they conceived, and
apprehended that it came from him merely as he was a man, they would never have
believed it, or embraced it, and obeyed it as they did. But this was that which
made them keep it in the sense that has been said: because they knew that that
which Christ delivered to them was the Word of God. And to this end it is that
Christ is so exactly cautious to persuade his hearers still, that the message
which he brings them is not of or from himself, but from his Father. My
doctrine is not mine says he, but his that sent me, Joh. 7.16. He that
speaks of himself, he seeks his own glory; but he that seeks his glory that
has sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. And in the
following Chapter at the 28. verse, As my Father has taught me, so I speak.
Even as the Father said to me, so I speak, Joh. 12.50. The words that I speak
unto you, I speak not of my self, Joh. 14.10. And this he beats so much upon,
to gain the better credit, and respect and entertainment to his Message. By
which he intimates that he could look for no acceptance, or regard among them,
if that which he delivered to them were not Gods Word. It is observable in
Nicodemus, that this was that which made him come to Christ, to hear him, and
be taught by him, because he was persuaded that he was a Teacher come from God,
as his own expression is, John 3.2. that he had somewhat to deliver to him from
the Lord. Had it not been for this persuasion he had never waited on him. And
this was that which wrought upon the Thessalonians, and brought them to a meet
receiving of the Word, because they looked upon it as the Word of God himself.
So the Apostle testifies of them, 1 These. 2.13. when ye received the Word which
ye heard of us, says he, ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is
in truth the Word of God. If you had apprehended it to be the word of man, and
not of God, you would not have regarded it, and entertained it as you did. But
this was that which drew your hearts to such an high account and estimation of
it, because you were persuaded that it was in truth the Word of God; not in
appearance only, and in the apprehensions and conceits of men, but really in
deed and truth the Word of God.

So that the point is plain, you see, They that will give, etc.

And there is such reason for it, as amounts to demonstration, viz. because
there is such entertainment due to it, as nothing else can draw us to, but this
persuasion that it is the Word of God. If we conceive it to be nothing but the
word of man, this apprehension will never raise the heart to such an estimation
of it, to such an acceptance of it as belongs to it: This will never draw the
heart, to give it greater credence, or greater reverence or obedience then
appertains to the word of man. Now this is infinitely short of that which
appertains to the Word of God. And therefore that we may come up to that,
that we may give the Word such entertainment as it ought to have, we must know
for certain, that it is the Word of God, and this I shall exemplify in many
particulars.

1. Ye must know for certain that it is the Word of God, that we may give it
such entertainment as it ought to have in point of reverence. The Word of God
must be received with holy fear: This carriage of the heart is due to that
which has so great and so divine an Author as God is; we ought to tremble at
the Word of God, Isa. 66.5. To hearken to it, not with an ordinary measure, but
with a very high degree of fear; with such a fear as works trembling. So did
the Prophet Habakkuk, as you may see, Hab. 3.16. When I heard, my belly
trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rottenness was in my bones, and I
trembled in my self. And so the holy Prophet David, as he professes of
himself, Psalm. 119.10. My heart trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of
thy judgments, (that is) of thy word, as some understand it. I fear and
tremble at thy word, for that has frequently the name of the Judgments of
God, as you may see that place for instance, Psalm. 19.8. Shall a Trumpet be
blown in the City, and the people not be afraid? it is the Prophets question,
Amos 3.6. By the City understand the Church of God; by the Trumpet, the word of
God; and by the people, the hearers of this word: So that it is as if the
Prophet should have said, Shall the word of God be pronounced, and the hearers
not fear? as who should say, that were a strange and an incongruous thing
indeed; So that you see they that will give the word such entertainment as it
ought to have, must hear it, and receive it with extraordinary fear and
reverence. Now this they will never do, unless they know for certain, that it
is the Word of God. If they be doubtful whether it be so, or if they look upon
it as the word of man, they will be apt to disregard it, and to give it no
respect at all. Nothing but this persuasion that it is the Word of the
Almighty, and the glorious God himself, will raise the heart to such an high
degree of fear and reverence as belongs to it. No other apprehension of it will
prevail to this effect, but this alone will surely do it, as the Apostle Paul
insinuates, 1 Cor. 14.24. If there come in an unbeleiver or unlearned person,
he is convinced, he is judged, the secrets of his heart are manifested by the
word, says the Apostle there. And what follows? So falling down upon his face,
he will worship God and say, that God is in you of a truth: when he perceives
that God is in you, that you speak from God, that that which you deliver is the
word of God, then he will fear and tremble and fall down and worship God.

2. We must know for certain that it is word of God, that we may give it such
entertainment as it ought to have, in point of credit and belief. For you must
know my Brethren, that we owe this special and peculiar honor to the word of
God, beyond the word of any man, to give complete and absolute assent and
credit to it. Though it be never so unlikely, never so much against appearance
and above reason; yet when the Lord has spoken it, when we have his word for
it, we ought to make no doubt or question of it. Those truths which own him for
the Author of them, do not admit of any doubtful disquisition, but rather call
for absolute belief: The very thoughts and cogitations must be captivated to
faith, when it appears that God has spoken. And therefore it is charged home
on Israel, as a very great offense that they believed not his word, Psalm.
106.24. And on the other side it is observed to the praise of Nineveh, that
they believed God, that is, the word of God, his Message sent them by the
Prophet Jonah, Jonah 3.5. And yet it was a most unlikely one. What probability
that forty days should put a period to all the happiness and luster of such a
flourishing and famous City: However they believed it, because it was the word
of God. You see then what our duty is in this respect, to hear the word with
absolute belief, this is the entertainment which we ought to give it.

Now this it will not find amongst us, unless we be persuaded that it is the
word of God; the word of man can never challenge this from us, for men are
liars, as the Prophet David speaks, they are deceitful on the balance. Though
they give us good words, yet when we come to prove them, and to try them, many
times they prove too light: Those that we think are best to be believed among
them, may deceive us; so that there is no reason in the world why we should
take what they deliver upon trust, because they deliver it. And therefore we
are bid to sift the doctrines and to try the spirits, because there be that
say, The Lord has said, when the Lord has not spoken. But when the word
appears to be of God, this apprehension and persuasion is enough to silence all
objections, that in appearance may be made against it. This alone will raise
the heart, to entertain it with that absolute belief wherewith it ought to be
received: while we remember that the God who is the Author of it, is the God of
Truth, yea he is the Truth it self: His saying always is a faithful saying, 1 Timothy 1.15. because it is the saying of the faithful God, and therefore worthy
of all acceptance.

3. We must know for certain that it is the word of God, that we may give it
such entertainment as it ought to have, in point of humble resignation and
submission to it. For this belongs to the word of God, that we quarrel not
against it, but that we justify it and submit to it. So it is said of John's
hearers, Luke 7.29, 30. All the people that heard him, justified God; yea the
very Publicans, the worst among them, as it is noted there in that place. So
holy David, I esteem all thy Commandments concerning all things to be right,
Psalm. 119.128. yea he will have him always to be justified when he speaks,
and clear even when he judges, Psalm. 51.4. when it is hardest to acquit him,
and to stoop to him. So that you see, my Brethren, we must justify the Lord in
his reproofs and threatenings, how sharp soever they may seem to be. As Rehoboam
and the Princes did when they were sharply menaced be the Prophet, they replied
not, they fretted not against him, but confessed the Lord is righteous, 2 Chronicles. 12.6. And Hezekiah when Isaiah dealt so roundly with him in the Name of
God, Good is the word of the Lord which thou have spoken, 2 King. 20.19. Yea,
God requires this of all his people, that they say Amen to every Curse of his,
and that they set their seal to it, as you may see, Deuteronomy. 27.26.

This is the entertainment which we ought to give the word of God in this
respect, meekly and humbly to submit to it, even when it seems to be most
against us; and not so much as once to mutter or repine at it. Now this we
shall not do unless we look upon it as the word of God. Nothing but such an
apprehension of it will bring the heart to such a temper, and put the spirit
into such a frame as this is. That which comes to us under the notion of the
word of man, will never be so yielded to; No, the heart will boil, and rage,
and rise against it. But when it has the stamp of God upon it, it stoops the
spirit to submission. Such entertainment (you may see) it found in Eli upon
this account, It is the Lord: when Samuel who was then a child, declared to him
what the Lord resolved to bring upon him and his house, says Eli, it becomes
me to be humble and sumit to this, and not to murmur and repine against it; for
it is the Lord, 1 Samuel 3.18. As Hezekiah, Isa. 38.15. What shall I say? for he
has said it to me. And so in every truth that is delivered to us, in every
precept that is laid upon us, in every reprehension that is given us, in every
Commination that is thundered out against us, if we consider with our selves,
whoever be the messenger, it is the Lord that speaks this, it is the word of
God and not of man, this and only this will make us in all humility to stoop to
it.

4. We must know for certain that it is the word of God, that we may give it
such entertainment as it ought to have, in point of obedience. Herein the word
of God is singular, it must be absolutely and universally obeyed, and that not
only with the outward but also with the inward man. It does not only take
command upon the members, but even the spirit and the conscience must be
subject to it. And that without delay, without question, without exception,
without reservation; as soon as that which is delivered to us, appears to be the
word of God, there is no room for disputation, or expostulation, but obedience.
All that the Lord Commands we must do, Exodus 1^.8. if he command it, we must
do it. This is the entertainment which we ought to give the word of God. The
word of man can challenge no such honor and respect from us. All the commands
of men are limited, and are to be obeyed so far, and but so far as they agree
with the commands of God, or else at least as they are not repugnant to them.
And consequently while we look on any word as that which comes from man, or as
that which is of man, we cannot yield it such obedience as is peculiar to the
word of God. But when we know once that it is of God, when we are certain that
he is the Author of it, we shall no longer think our selves at liberty to obey
or disobey. No, this persuasion will convince us, that it is absolutely
necessary to resign our selves to the obedience of this word of his, who is
such a Lawgiver as is able either to save or to destroy, and with whom every
disobedience receives a just recompense of reward.

JOHN 17.7. Now they have known that all things, etc.


etc. We see the reason then (my Brethren), why the word is so unworthily and
slightly entertained by the greater part of men; why it has no greater
reverence, no greater credit, no more submission, no more obedience then it
meets withal, from those that are the ordinary hearers of it. Alas, how is it
disrespected and despise everv where? how little credit does it find with me?
how do their hearts and spirits rise against it, when it meets with
corruptions, and crosses them in their ways and their humors? how far are they
from yiedling absolute obedience to it, in every thing that it requires of
them? And what is the cause of all this? Truly the main and principal is this,
that they believe it not to be indeed and truth the word of God. When it is
read or preached to them, either they call the matter into question, and are in
very great suspense whether it be the word of God or no; or else they
peremptorily resolve as Israel did, It is not he, Jer. 5.12. It is not God that
speaks to us, this is not the word of God, and then no wonder though it be
neglected and despised by them. They hear a man, and so accordingly resolve
that that which is delivered to them, is of man, and that it has no higher
Author then the man that speaks to them. And some of them will now and then
express themselves, Preachers may say their pleasure in a pulpit, and the like.
And hence it is, my Brethen, that their respect and entertainment of it, is
answerable to their apprehension of it, such as belongs to the word of man
and no more. They regard it and believe it and obey it just as far as they
themselves please.

But you will say perhaps, if you could hear the Lord himself speak to you, Oh
how would you fear before him, how would you stoop to him, how would you yield
obedience to his voice! But who is this that you hear? a man such as your
selves are, whose weaknesses and failings and infirmities are known to you.

Oh but remember that though you have this treasure in earthen vessels, yet it
is a treasure still, and it is of God still; That all the messengers of God in
their regular prescripts ought to be instead of God, and instead of Christ to
you; That it is not they that speak, but the Holy Ghost himself that speaks
by them, Mat. 10.20. And therefore even as he that hears them, hears God;
so on the other side, he that despises them, despises God himself, Luke
10.16. They were but men that preached to the Thessalonians, the Apostle and
his fellows; so that they might have made the same objection, and so have kept
themselves from due and reverend entertainment of the word which they
delivered: But they did otherwife, as the Apostle testifies of them to their
commendation, 1 Thessalonians. 2.13. The word which ye heard of us (says the Apostle
there) ye received it not as the word of men, though ye received it of us who
are but men, yet ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the
word of God.

Is it so, that they that will give the word of God such entertainment etc. You
see then what you are to do, if you desire to entertain the word aright, and to
receive it in such a manner as you ought to do; you find perhaps much
slightness and irreverence and stubbornness and disobedience in your hearts
against it; you cannot bring your hearts to such a temper, in the reading or
the hearing of it, as you unfeignedly desire to do; your thoughts are wandering,
or your hearts are unbelieving, or your lusts are struggling, or your corrupt
and carnal reason is gainsaying, while you are attending on it. Something or
other there is still that hinders you from a right receiving of it. And this is
a continual grief and burden to you. Now, my Beloved, I will show you how you
shall help all this at once: You must come to be assured, to know for certain
that that which is delivered in or from the Scripture, is the word of God; If
you have any secret unbelief of this, any doubt in this particular, do what you
will in all respects besides, and labor what you can, you will never bring
your selves to give the word such entertainment as it ought to have. This one
defect will hurt you more then all the means that you can use besides will help
you. And truly Satan (knowing well of how great consequence it is) endeavors
what he can, if not to overthrow us utterly, at least to weaken us in this
assurance. And if he can but weaken us in this, and make as faint in this
assurance, that that which is delivered in or from the Scripture is the word of
God, he knows he does much work at once: He weakens by proportion our
Reverence, our Assent, Submission, and Obedience with it.

And verily, my Brethren, though it may not be perceived, yet this is that
which lies at the bottom, and is the main original of all that slightness, and
incredulity and obstinacy, and disobedience, which many of the precious Saints
of God discover in themselves, in relation to the word, and know not how to
remedy. They are not firmly and inviolably settled and confirmed in this
persuasion that it is the word of God. Their faith is weak in this particular,
and so accordingly they are weak in all those things which concern the due and
right receiving of it. For even as if a man believe it not to be the word of
God at all, he will give it no fear, no faith, no submission, no obedience: So
on the other side, if he believe it weakly, and with many hesitations, he will
accordingly be weak in all these; he will be on and of, and up and down,
according to the ebbings and the flowings of his faith.

And therefore I beseech you, my Beloved, strive and labor what you can to
strengthen and fortify your selves in this persuasion, which is of such
concernment to you. And certainly the best among us have need of Confirmation
here, for we are apt sometimes to waver and to have doubtful thoughts about it.
And they that are most free from these, have yet defects and imperfections in
their faith of this as well as other parts of holy truth. They have not yet
attained to such a pitch, but they may be adding to it, and go on to further
measures and degrees. And therefore let it be our labor and endeavor to
increase our faith in this particular, and to grow up to full assurance of this
inviolable principle, that That which is delivered in the Scripture is verily
the word of God.

Now that you may know this for certain, I shall do two things: First, I shall
lay down such considerations as make it credible: And in the next place I shall
show you what you are to do that it may be certain to you.

As for the first of these, my Brethren, there are many things that make it
very credible, that whatsoever is delivered in or from the Srripture, is the
word of God. I shall name a few of them, as

1. The evident accomplishment of all the prophesies contained in it. I mean of
all, excepting those the time of whose fulfilling is not come in. It has been
Ruled long ago, that De futuris contingentibus non datur determinata veritas.
Man cannot certainly determine of future things that are contingent: He cannot
do it of himself, and by his own foresight. Now this the Prophets and Apostles
did (as by the issue and event is manifest) and therefore it appears that in
their prophesies they were directed by the All-knowing and Omniscient God.

2. It is made credible by the harmonious testimony of the Church in every age
who have assented to it, and acknowledged and received it, as that which
comprehends and contains the divine and holy Oracles of God himself. And
however diverse Churches have been at very sharp dissentions about diverse other
things, yet herein they have still agreed, and none of them have once so much
as questioned, whether the Scripture be the word of God or no.

3. It is made credible by the almost incredible consent between the Scribes
and Penmen of it; who writing in such diverse places, tongues, and seasons,
must needs unreconcileably have crossed and thwarted one another, had they been
guided by their own spirits. We see how men that write upon the Scripture
differ in their Expositions of it, and speak directly one against another. How
more would the Prophets and Apostles then have jarred, unless they had been all
directed by the same Spirit? We know in reason, men would far more easily agree
in Explicating Principles already made, then in composing those Principles and
Rules themselves, if every man had liberty to frame what Axioms he thought good
himself, and to set them down for text. And therefore certainly the Penmen of
the Scripture were guided all by one, viz. the Holy Ghost himself who lead them
into one Truth.

4. It is made credible by the effectual and mighty working of it on the hearts
and souls of men, above all other writings whatsoever; For however it be
carried in a low and easy style, yet it commands us, and prevails upon us more
then all the eloquence of men and Angels could possibly do, were it united all
together. And herein I appeal to Gods people, let them consider with themselves
what wonderful effects it has wrought upon their hearts; how it has pierced
in and made a separation between their very joints and marrow; how it has even
told them all that ever they have done; how it has cast them down with
unutterable sorrow; and then raised them up again with joy unspeakable and
glorious. How it has altered them and changed them, and turned them clean
about, and made them to renounce their pleasures and delights, their wills,
their reasons, their desires, yea, to deny themselves, that they might walk by
this Rule.

5. The blood of many Martyrs gives testimony to the Scripture, that it is the
word of God; who but for this divine and saving Truth, and by his power and
might whose Truth it is, would hardly have endured the rage and fury of the
flames, the violence of the tormentors. We read indeed that diverse Heretics
have suffered exquisite and horrid tortures for their gross opinions and
conceits, as we have many instances in Church story. But it is to be considered
that they did it for the Scripture, though falsely and corruptly apprehended
and applied. Where has been the Jew, or Turk, who for his Talmud or his
Alchoran (which are the Scriptures they receive and use) has put himself into
the hands of the Tormentors.

These and such things as these, do make it in it self extremely credible that
that which is delivered in the Scripture is the word of God. But yet they may
not so take hold upon us to convince us notwithstanding, they may not chase our
scruples all away, nor clear up all doubts, unless some further thing be done,
to make it credited by us, and to make us know for certain, that it is the word
of God.



Now if you ask me how the Holy Spirit does this great work, which nothing else
besides can do. I answer that it does it principally two ways. First by
removing those impediments which hinder this assurance; And secondly by giving
us those gifts and graces, which make us able to receive it.

First by removing those impediments that hinder this assurance. There is a
double hinderance or impediment in every man by nature. First ignorance whereby
our eyes are closed as it were. The word has light enough, my Brethren, in and
of it self to show it self to us, to manifest it self to us, as it is indeed;
but we are blind and cannot see it. The second hinderance is corruption, by
means of which, although we see it, we cannot of our selves but hate it, and
dislike it, and reject it.

These two the Holy Spirit cures and removes by a double remedy. The first
illumination, restoring our decayed understandings to some degrees and measures
of their first light, opening our eyes that we may see the wonders of the word,
and so be satisfied that it is the word of God. The next, Sanctification,
infusing into our desires and our affections some degrees and measures of their
first holiness. And by this work of Gods Spirit, opening the eyes of our blind
minds, that we may understand the Scriptures, and see those admirable rays and
beams of divine and heavenly light that shine in them: And also rectifying our
corrupt affections that we may love them and embrace them, we come to be
assured that the Scripture is indeed and truth the word of God.

So that you see the Spirit works not this assurance in us by adding any thing
to Gods word, by curing any failing or defect in it, but only by bringing it
into the light, and representing it unto us as indeed it is. The Spirit does
not make it credible, for it is so in it self abundantly beyond all
possibility, even of the best addition, but it makes it so to us, by curing and
removing the impediments, and supplying the defects which are in us, by means
of which we cannot apprehend it as it is. And I mention this the rather,
because some have been apt to say of late, the Word without the Spirit is no
more to them then any other Book, or any other piece of writing. Now if their
meaning be to blame themselves in this, and to import that their corruption and
their ignorance is such, that unless the Spirit help them they cannot come to
understand it, or look upon it as better then another Book, it may receive a
pretty fair construction. But if their intention be to undervalue and abase the
Scripture, as if the proper and innate and real worth thereof depended wholly
on the Spirits revelation, it is a horrid derogation from the precious Word of
God. It Is true indeed, without the Spirit it may be no more to us then any
other book; such is the darkness and profaneness of our hearts; but yet it is
more in it self, whether the Spirit show it us or no. The Spirit in this work
of his does not make it in it self to be the Word of God, but only to appear
so. It makes no alteration in the Word, but in our selves. When first it tells
us and assures us that it is the Word of God, it was clearly so before, or else
it certifies us of a falsehood and untruth, only it was not apprehended and
believed to be so This is indeed the Spirits work, to make us know for certain
that it is the Word of God, it is not to be done without it.

And therefore that we may attain to this persuasion, we must do these two
things.

1. We must cry to God to send down his Holy Spirit, to give in this assurance
to us: To set his seal and testimony to it, that it is the Word of God; and so
to put the matter out of all question, to satisfy us without any further
scruple, that all that is delivered in it, is of God.

2. We must take in and cherish all the light, that from the Spirit shines upon
the soul. Sometimes a beam breaks in upon us on a sudden, it makes us see and
know for certain that it is the Word of God, so that all doubt is banished
quite in that particular. But we neglect it, and permit our thoughts to be
misled to other things, before we fix and settle upon this persuasion; and so
our assurance fails, and our doubts return again. The Spirit offers clear
illumination and conviction, and we take no notice of it, and therefore it is
just it should be withdrawn again. And thus far of our Saviors declaration of
his Apostles and Disciples due and ready entertainment of the Word which he
delivered, together with the ground of it, as it is barely mentioned only.

Proceed we now to look upon it as it is amplified in the following verse, For
I have given unto them the words which thou gave me, and they have received
them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
that thou did send me.

And here as I have showed you formerly, our Savior does these two things:
First he declares his own fidelity, in the delivery of his message from his
Father to his people; I have given unto them the words which thou gave me.
And secondly, he shows the issue and event of this fidelity of his, in his
Apostles and Disciples, and that especially in two respects: Both with Relation
to the message which he brought, and also with relation to himself the
Messenger. First, With Relation to the Message which he brought, They have
received them, says he, that is, the words which I delivered to them in thy
name. Secondly, Then with relation to himself the Messenger, They have known
surely that I came from thee, and have believed that thou did send me.

At this time the first thing which our Savior does, he pleads his own
fidelity in the delivery of his Message from his Father to his people, I have
given unto them the words which thou gave me.

The words which thou have given me as the principal Author, I as the Messenger
and the Ambassador from thee have given them. Those very words and no other: No
less, no nor more. For both of those are clearly intimated here; I have given
them the words which thou have given me.

No other words, but those only. I have not given them a word more. Nothing of
my own devising, nothing of my own inventing; that which I have received from
thee, and only that, I have declared to them, I have not added one word.

And as I have not added, so neither on the other side have I diminished one
word. I have given them the words which thou have given me, every one of those
words, I have not kept a word back, but have delivered all to them; That which
thou have given me, they have had without abatement, or diminution in the least
degree.

So that you see, my Brethren,

DOCTRINE. Christ has approved himself a faithful Prophet to his Church, a
faithful Messenger from his Father to his people.
He has no failed either way by adding to, or taking from; by Addition, or
Substraction: But has been very just in his Embassage to a word. The words
which by his Father were delivered to him, he has delivered to his people,
only those, and all those. And this he pleads and urges in my Text, you see, to
show his faithfulness, and to make it appear how well he had discharged the
trust that was reposed in him by his Father. I have given unto them the words
which thou gave me.

That I may fully and distinctly clear the point, I shall evince that Christ
has showed himself a faithful Prophet, a faithful Messenger from his Father to
his people: First in this respect, that he has added nothing to his Message;
And secondly in this respect, that he has taken nothing from it. Both which
are evidently intimated in the Text.

I have given unto them the words which thou gave me. He speaks it here
exclusively, no other words but those only; We find our Savior sometimes
styled him whom God has sent, the Angel and the Messenger of God, as you may
see that place for instance, Mal. 3.1. Yea the Apostle, Heb. 3.1. Consider the
Apostle and High Priest of our profession Jesus Christ. And herein he has done
his part, that he has been exact in the discharge of his Apostleship, and the
delivery of his Errand to the Church. He has not put in any thing, no not a
word, that may be called his own, in opposition to his Father. He has not gone
beyond the bounds of his Commission in the least degree. And this he pleads
very often in the Gospel, and beats very much upon it, that he might be
understood, and that he might not be mistaken, because it was of such
concernment to the success and efficacy of his message; Even as the Father said
unto me, so I speak, says Jesus Christ, Joh. 12. ult. That [so] respects not
so much the manner as the matter of his speaking, as you may easily discern, if
you will look back to the words immediately before, What I speak, even as the
Father said unto me, so I speak. The things which I deliver are the same which
I received of my Father. That only I have said and nothing else, not a word
besides that. And therefore he inculcates frequently, that he speaks not of
himself, it is a phrase he uses often. His meaning is not, that he speaks not
of his own strength, but that he speaks not of his own devising, he utters
nothing but that which is committed to him by another. The words I speak, says
he, I speak not of my self, Joh. 14.10. but the Father that is in me. They come
originally from my Father, and I do not add so much as one of my own words.

And even as Christ has showed himself a faithful Prophet, a faithful I have
given to them (says he) the words which thou gave me: you must conceive it
All those words; I have not kept a word from them; with which accords his
protestation to his Apostles and Disciples when he was about to leave them,
Joh. 15.15. Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knows not what
his Lord does, but I have called you friends. And why so? For all things that I
have heard of my Father, I have made known to you; In this respect I have used
you like friends, that I have told you all my Fathers Council, I have
acquainted you with all, without any reservation. All that he has delivered to
me as the Prophet of the Church, and as a Messenger from him to you; I have
exactly and completely made it known to you.

But you will ask me how this accords with his own expression to his Apostles
at another time, and in another place, viz. the Chapter following, that even
now alleged, Joh. 16.12. I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot
bear them now, as if he should have added, therefore I will not speak them now;
and how then could he say before, I have made known all things to you?

Truly, my Brethren, he might say it very well. He had indeed made known all
things to them, that were to be known by them: be made acquainted with them, he
had imparted to them to the very utmost: so that he had been faithful in the
business. There is no doubt our Savior Christ as man had many things revealed
to him from his Father, which he instilled not into his Disciples; for he was
perfect in regard of knowledge, and they were not so, nor could be so in this
world. But whatsoever was communicated to him as the Mediator and the Prophet
of the Church in that behalf, and for the information and behoof of his people,
all this he manifested and made known to them again, as far as the estate which
they were in would bear it, and their condition did require it: And this he
clearly intimates in the fore-alleadged place, I have yet many things to say
to you, but ye cannot bear them now; And to what end should Christ say that
which he knew they could not yet bear? why should he lay a burden on them,
which was too heavy for their shoulders?

But if he had said all before, how had he many things to say yet? He had said
all that was to be said before, all that his Father had appointed him to say,
and he had many things to say, that were not to be said yet, because they were
not suitable to the condition they were in at that time. But did our Savior
say them afterward? or if he had many things to say, and did not say them, how
was he such a faithful messenger (as I have shown) from his Father to his
people?

For clearing this, we must distinguish of our Saviors sayings; something he
was to say to his Apostles and Disciples with his own immediate voice, while he
was conversant upon the earth. Other things he was to say by his Spirit
afterward, and he was very faithful both ways.

1. What things he was to say to his Apostles and Disciples with his own
immediate voice, he said all those things. He kept nothing back from them. He
taught them lesson after lesson, still as they could learn. And so he carried
them along, as long as he remained among them: So that he might have said at
any time while he was with them, I have made known all to you, all that you are
yet to know. And whereas he affirms in the cited place, I have yet many
things to say to you, if they were such as he was himself to speak, to utter to
them with his own mouth, there is no question to be made, he spoke them
afterward. before he left them, and ascended to his Father. And it is
manifest, that after he was risen, he conversed with them forty days, talking
of mysterious things, speaking of things pertaining to the Kingdom, Act. 1.7.
The Kingdom which had been set up in the hearts of a few poor despised ones
before, but was now to be erected in the Church. These and such things as these
they could not hear till now, and therefore though our Savior had these things
to say, yet he said them not till now: And now he said them that he might be
faithful, and that he might discharge the trust, that was reposed in him by his
Father.

2. But there were other things which he was not to say to his Apostles and
Disciples, by his own immediate voice, while he was conversant among them, but
by his Spirit afterward, when he had left them. And these he said accordingly
by that Spirit. And this is chiefly aimed at, and is the main intention of the
fore-alleadged Text, I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear
them yet. But what then? did he say them afterward? Yes, he said them
afterward by his Spirit, and what the Spirit said, he said. And therefore it
is added presently, Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you
into all truth; For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear
(viz. of me) that shall he speak. He shall receive of me, and shall show it
unto you.

While Christ was conversant with his Apostles in the flesh, they were capable
of nothing in a manner. It was but little they could bear then, and therefore
there was little to be showed to them. But when he was ascended once, their
hearts were presently enlarged to a capacity of greater measures and degrees of
knowledge. And Christ was now accordingly to show them (and the Church by them)
much more by his Spirit: which he performed with all fidelity, as the event
has manifested and declared.

The point you see is fully cleared; Christ has approved himself a faithful
Messenger from his Father to his people. For he has added nothing to his
message, and he has taken nothing from it. All the words his Father gave him
to deliver by himself and by his own immediate voice, he has delivered. All
that he gave him to deliver by his Spirit, all these he has delivered too; and
so he has been absolutely and exactly faithful every way.

Has Christ approved himself a faithful Prophet to the Church, a etc. Has he
not failed in speaking any thing that he should have concealed, or in
concealing any thing he should have spoken? has he not spoken so much as a
word too little, or a word too much? This then may serve to teach us diverse
things; As

1. To hear this Prophet, and diligently to observe and mark all that he speaks
to us: He has no loose words, no vain expressions, nothing too little, or too
much in that which he delivered to us, and therefore it must be the better
noted, and the more valued. The words of men, yea, the exactest of them are
sometimes defective, and sometimes redundant. The words of Christ are not so. I
speak not this that you should do as some of the Church of Corinth did. I am
for Paul, says one, I am for Cephas, said another; I am for neither of them,
said a third, I am for Christ only. That which Christ himself said, I will
hear, and I will read, but I will hear no other man; I would not have you hear
Christ, so as to hear none but him. But I would have you hear Christ, so as to
hear none like him, for never man spoke like this man. And therefore when we
meet with his words, let us take special notice of them, let us fix and dwell
upon them, and let them rest and dwell in us. Let the word of Christ dwell in
us richly: Let us have an eye to mark them, an ear to hear them, and a heart to
keep them, as Mary had, of whom it is recorded, that she kept all his sayings
in her heart. How carefully did the Apostle keep that which our Savior spoke,
though it be no where mentioned in the Gospel, and wishes other men to do so
too! Act. 20.35. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
blessed to give then to receive. And so he minds the Corinthians of that
whith Christ himself spoke. To the married, I command, and yet not I, but the
Lord, 1 Cor. 7.10. As intimating that the words which dropped from his lips,
did challenge singular regard from them. And such regard, my Brethren, let them
have from us, when we meet with his Prayers, his Sermons, his Sayings; let us
hear this Prophet, and hear him so to be obedient to him.

It was a dangerous thing you know, to refuse to hear Moses; he that despised
Moses Law, was to die without mercy. But it is much more dangerous to refuse to
hear Christ. There is a sorer punishment for such, Heb 10.28. It went very hard
with those who refused the word that was spoken by Angels. But if we refuse the
word that was spoken by Christ, and do it finally, there is but one way with
us, we are gone without recovery: For if the word spoken by Angels was
steadfast, (for the execution of it) and every transgression and disobedience
received a just recompense of reward; How shall we escape if we neglect so
great Salvation, which was spoken by the Lord? If we hear him not, we die, and
that without mercy too. But if we hear him and obey him, we shall live, and
that for ever. The words that he spoke are spirit and life: And if a man keep
his sayings, he shall never see death.

2. This should teach us in the second place, to trust him; since he is such a
faithful Messenger that he varies not a word, we may well rely upon him, and
believe him to the utmost. His words are all heavenly, all of God; he has
given us those words, that are given him of the Father, all those, and none but
those; and why then should we not depend upon them, for our direction, for our
Consolation, and trust him perfectly in all cases?

3. To try other Prophets by this Prophet, other Messengers by this Messenger,
and so accordingly to embrace them, or reject them. Other men that come from
God really or in pretense, may speak more or speak less then he has put into
their mouths; Christ has said neither more nor less: and therefore let us
always try their Messages by his Message; if they agree with his, let us
embrace them; but if they disagree, let us reject them.

JOHN. 17.8. I have given unto them the words which thou gave me.


ANd thus far of the General Application. Proceed we now a little more
particularly and distinctly to apply the diverse branches of the point in order.

have weight in them, and therefore they must all be weighed, by them that
handle them, or read, or hear them. Every word that he delivered comes from
heaven, it is given him of his Father, as you have it in my Text. And do you
think his Father would give down from heaven, so much as one vain word to be
delivered by him to his Church and people? And if there be not one superfluous
word in his Message, then certainly there is not one to be unadvisedly and
lightly passed over by us. And therefore let it be our care to pry into, and
study every word of Jesus Christ which he has left upon record in Scripture,
to sift it and to scan it to the very utmost, to seek to God by earnest prayer
to open and unfold it to us, that nothing in it (as far as it is possible) may
escape us unobserved.

And truly, my Beloved, this deserves the more to be considered by us, because
we know not what we lose sometimes by our neglect in this particular: by slight
and careless handling, reading or hearing of the words of Christ; Oh the
inestimable hidden worth that is wrapped up sometimes in one of his expressions,
and we take no notice of it! Either we are ignorant of the Original, the
Language and the Tongue in which he speaks, and so cannot: or else we are
negligent and idle and remiss, and so do not dive in it. It is not to be
imagined what a world of light and information in deep and mysterious things,
of sweet direction, of precious Consolation we lose by this means. And
therefore when we labor to expound the Scripture, when we read, or when we
hear it, let us not look upon a sentence, or a verse in gross; and so endeavor
to find out the general intent and drift and meaning of it, but let us scan and
study every word. Were there any loose expressions, as there are in other
writings, that carry nothing of solidity and weight in them, we might very well
omit them, and not spend our thoughts upon them. But there is not a word to
spare in that which Jesus Christ delivers from his Father to his people;
nothing but what is necessary to express some matter of importance and
concernment to us, and therefore let us value it and fist it well, that we may
know the mind of God, and the mind of Christ in it.

Has Christ approved himself a faithful Messenger from his Father to which of
it self is able to make us wise unto Salvation. Let us beware of itching after
novelties, and harkening after new and strange discoveries, such as Christ has
never made, as many do in these days. Oh let not any of us who have heard and
learned Christ, turn away from wholesome doctrine, and be turned after fables,
as the Apostle Paul speaks; Let us not leave the Living Fountain, and go to
broken Cisterns that will hold no water. But let us stick to Jesus Christ, and
satisfy our selves with that which he has taught us in the Scripture, as
comprehending in it all that is necessary to salvation.

But here to clear my self a little that I may not be mistaken, I acknowledge
that many necessary things are not expressly delivered to us by our Savior from
his Father; and yet his message is complete for all that: For though they be
not clearly mentioned and set down disertis verbis, they may by manifest and
necessary consequence be gathered and deduced from that which he has taught us
in the Scripture. And to this end I shall desire you to take notice of these
three particulars.

1. Where generals are taught us, there all particulars comprised in them, and
comprehended under them, are in the purpose and intention of our Savior taught
also; as when he interdicteth any sin, suppose it murder, or adultery, there
all the sorts and kinds and measures and degrees of that corruption, are with
it interdicted and condemned.

2. Where principles and causes are delivered to us, there the effects that
flow and issue from them, and are caused by them, are intended and comprised,
as virtually comprehended and contained in their causes.

3. Where we find one like taught, we must conceive alike of all the rest of
like nature; Quia parium par ratio; and where there is par ratio, there is also
par Lex: where things are like, there the reason is alike; and where there is
like reason, there is also like law. And thus not any instance can be given, of
any point of necessary faith or practice, that is not taught by our Savior in
the Scripture. So that we need to go no further, but may content and satisfy
our selves with his teaching.

As my Father has sent me, so send I you. And therefore even as he is faithful
to his Father, so they accordingly must be faithful unto him. And even as he
delivers that which he has received from his Father, so they must deliver too
that which they have received from Christ. And that without addition, without
diminution, as Christ does.

Gal. 1.8. another Doctrine, 1 Timothy 1.3. but must be able in uprightness to say
as the Apostle does to his hearers, 1 Cor. 11.23. That which I have received of
the Lord, I have delivered unto you. Only that and no more. And here there are
three sorts faulty; I shall but only name them to you, and go on.

1. The Superstitious Teacher; there were a multitude of such not long ago; but
blessed be the Lord, their number now is well lessened; whose manner was to
beat on nothing in the Pulpit but humane Observations, and Inventions and
Traditions. They must stand up at Gloria Patri, they must bow before the Altar,
and the like. These were the things that many Preachers dwelt upon, in which
their greatest heat and zeal was shown, as if they were of greater consequence
then Principles and Fundamentals of Religion.

2. The Sceptick Teacher, who doateth about foolish idle questions, which do
not serve to edify, and which when all is done, have neither ground nor
resolution in the Scriptures. And here the Schoolmen were extremely faulty who
have filled the world with multitudes of needless and unprofitable scruples,
and inquiries, concerning which our Savior (the great Prophet of the Church)
speaks nothing of or on. Such were the points that many of them even spent
themselves upon: which many Preachers tossed and canvassed in the Pulpit, by
which they spoiled the people, as appears by the Egyptian darkness of those
ages which they lived in. And truly there are many in these days of ours who
spend their time and thoughts on idle questions, and disputes about words, and
are extremely vain in their imaginations, and so are hindered from studying
weighty things, and matters absolutely necessary to salvation.

3. The vainglorious Teacher, who stuffes his Sermons to the people with
nothing else almost but humane Learning; as if that which Christ has taught
us, would not yield sufficient matter to deliver to the people. It Is true, my
Brethren, there may be in preaching, a lawful use of secular learning, but not
a lawful ostentation of it. Use it we may, so far as it illustrates any thing
of Christ, and helps us to the clearer explication, or better application of it
to the hearers. But if we preach our selves and not Christ, if we lay aside the
perfect and the precious doctrine which he has delivered to us, and study
nothing else but how to vent our own wit, our own learning, our own fancies;
this is dangerous to our selves, and pernicious to the people.

And as the Messengers of Christ must utter what they have received Col. 1.25.
declare it fully to the people: as Jesus Christ revealed fully what his Father
put into his mouth, as we have plentifully showed you: so must the Messengers
of Christ deliver fully what they have received from him; they must not mince
it out of fear or favor, or any other base end. It was the strict injunction
of the Angel to the Apostle Peter and his fellows, when he sent them forth to
preach, Act. 5.20. Go, stand and speak unto the people all the words of this
life. And Gods immediate precept to the Prophet, Jer. 26.2. Speak all the words
that I command thee, diminish not a word. And therefore let not any Messenger
of Christ suppress and smother what he has received, delivering so much as he
thinks expedient and no more; so much as suits with his fancy or with his ends.
Let him not upon any grounds, considerations, or pretenses whatsoever, wrap up
any thing in silence which Christ would have him to make known: But let all his
Ambassadors resolve with faithful Micaiah, whatsoever the Lord shall put in our
mouths, whether it be good or evil, whether the hearers will approve it or
dislike it, that will we speak.

I shall lay down a few Considerations, which though they may not seem so
pertinent and proper for this Assembly, yet may be of some use; At least to
make you bear with Ministers the better in their faithful dealing with you,
when you see how much it lies upon them to be faithful: For

1. If they suppress and smother what they have received to deliver, they draw
upon themselves the guilt of blood; yea, of the blood of souls; yea, of the
souls of those whom they are bound to watch for, as those for whom they are to
give up an account when the day of reckoning comes. And this appears
evidently by the Apostles protestation to the Elders of Ephesus, Act. 20.26. I
take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men. How so?
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Counsel of God; not some,
but all his Counsel. They that hide any, are not pure from blood; no, not from
the blood of souls, which is a formidable thing. The blood of bodies has a
voice, and cries aloud for wrath and vengeance upon them that shed it; The
blood of souls speaks worse things, and cries louder then that of Abel.

2. If they suppress, etc. they do (in the desert) deprive themselves of any
share in the mercy of the Lord. It is a dreadful sentence against such, which
God himself does not seem to speak so much as to thunder out against them,
Apoc. 22.19. If any man shall take away (says he) from the words of this book;
Well, if he do, what then? the Lord shall take away his part out of the Book of
life, and out of the holy City, and from the things that are written in this
Book. If there be any happiness to be enjoyed in Heaven and in the new
Jerusalem, which is above; if there be any mercy mentioned in the Book of God,
in all the precious promises from the beginning of it to the end; if there be
any privilege to have a part in the blessed Book of life; the man that takes
away one word out of the Book of God (that so does and so continues) is utterly
cut off from all these. He that is able to diminish blessings, and to bring
them down so low that nothing of them shall remain, will recompense them who
diminish his word, and pay them home in the same kind wherein they sin.

3. If they suppress, etc. they expose themselves to ignominy and contempt with
men. They think perhaps to gratify and please, and to be loved and honored
and esteemed by this means, viz. by hiding and concealing that which they
imagine will not relish with the people. But God will meet with such in this
preposterous way of theirs, and cross them so, that this shall make them
despicable in the eyes of all men. I have made you (says the Lord to the
unfaithful Priests of Israel) contemptible and base before all the people. And
why so? because you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.
Some of it you have delivered, and some of it you have concealed, according as
your hearers, and the times would bear, you have dealt partially with it. And
thus you thought perhaps to get your selves esteem and love among the people.
But it is fallen out quite contrary, clean against your expectation; For all
men look upon you now as self-seekers, men-pleasers, and time-servers: and so
you are become contemptible and base by this means. And if you look on those at
this day who are partial in the Law, and who apply it only against one side,
who reprove and threaten none but those that are not of their own party, you
shall find them of no great esteem among the people.

4. If they suppress, etc. as they expose themselves to shame, so to wrong from
men too. They lay themselves by their unfaithfulness the more open to abuses
and injuries and molestations from the people: Whereas if they be faithful,
they are under Gods protection; I have made thee (says the Lord, encouraging
the Prophet) a defenced City, and an Iron pillar and brazen walls against the
whole Land, against the Princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, and
against the whole land; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not
prevail; and what of this? Therefore gird up thy loins, and speak unto them all
that I command thee, Jer. 1.17. withold not any thing for fear that I would
have thee to deliver, be bold and confident in my protection. Be not dismayed at
their faces, least I confound thee before them. The Lord has always taken
special care of them, who have been trusty in the delivery of his message. And
hence the Prophet David having said, he suffered no man to do them wrong, but
reproved even Kings for their sakes, discovers in the words immediately
annexed, who they were that had this special interest in Gods protection. Touch
not mine anointed and do my Prophets no harm, Psalm. 105.15. And that
Prophetical Petition of Moses in behalf of Levi, is notable to this purpose,
Deuteronomy. 33.11. Strike through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
them that hate him, that they rise no more.

Now if you ask me how it comes to pass that notwithstanding th assurances in
the Name of God himself, ungodly men have risen and pr^vailed against the
faithful Messengers of Jesus Christ, sometimes to their utter extirpation.

To this I answer in a word, It was not that the Lord was careless of their
peace and welfare, but it was because they had dispatched the work which God
had given them to do, they had finished their testimony, as the expression is,
Apoc. 11.7. Or else because the Lord foresaw he should receive more honor by
their suffering then their peace, Phil. 1.12. And thus far of our Saviors
faithfulness in the delivering of his Message, from his Father to his people.

The issue and event of this fidelity of his, comes now in order to be handled,
and that as I have showed in two respects. First with relation to the Message,
which he brought, they have received them, says he, (that is) the words that I
delivered to them in thy Name; Secondly, then with relation to himself the
Messenger, they have known surely that I came from thee, and have believed that
thou did send me.

So that here is their good reception of the Message, and their good persuasion
of the Messenger delivered in such plain expressions, that they will need no
Explication. The only seeming difficulty lies in this, how Christ as Man and
Mediator may be said to have come out from God, since in that Nature he was
never with him, in regard of his immediate presence in the heavens. Truly, my
Brethren, he came not from him locally, but he came from him Ministerially; he
came not from him in respect of place, but he came from him in respect of
mission, because he came of his Message, and of his Errand: and so our Savior
Christ explains himself by an Exegesis in the succeeding parcel of the verse,
They have known surely that I came out from thee, that is, they have believed
that thou did send me.

Now both of these particulars, importing the good carriage and behavior of
the Apostles and Disciples of our Savior, both with relation to his message,
and to himself the Messenger, may be considered two ways. Either in a joint
dependence of both of them on that which goes before; Or else in a particular
dependence of one of them, upon the other. If you consider them and look upon
them, in a joint dependence upon that which goes before. So they are both of
them the fruit and the effect of the faithfulness of Christ. He was exact in
the delivery of his message to a word, as he declares himself in the foregoing
parcel of the verse, which we have even now dispatched, and the event was this;
That both his Message and himself were very well received and entertained among
his hearers; So that here I might lay down this observation.

DOCTRINE. The faithfulness of the Messenger of God, in the discharge and
execution of his Office, is of very great avail, and efficacy to commend his
Message, and himself unto the people.
I shall but only touch at this, because though it be a truth, yet it is not a
proper and a seasonable truth to be insisted on in this Assembly: You see the
issue of it in our Savior here, the chief Messenger of God; he was absolutely
faithful in the trust that was reposed in him by his Father; and this was that
which came of it, and followed it among his hearers. Their good reception of
(...) message, they received his words. Their good persuasion of himself the
Messenger; they knew for certain that be came from God. And where did ever any
Messenger of Christ, that was faithful in his place, miss altogether of
success, and good esteem among the people? It Is true, some will dislike him and
oppose him, and hate him for his faithfulness, as Ahab did Micaiah. But the
wisest and the best will value him, and love him, and respect him for it. There
is a special blessing of the Lord on the fidelity of his Ambassadors, which is
the cause and reason that they seldom fail of doing some good, and of finding
some fruit, and of having some regard from those whom they are sent to. And
there is something in their faithfulness it self, when it comes once to be
observed by the people, to gain their hearts, and to win their good affections
and submission to themselves and to their preaching. When they are once
persuaded and convinced that their Minister is faithful, this has a mighty
operation on them, if they be not very stupid and profane, to make them hear
him, and respect him, and obey him.

So that to give you but a word of Application,

But you will ask me, How may this be done, and wherein does this consist? I
will show you in a word, and pass on to another point of Observation. The
Messenger of Jesus Christ, if he will be well received and well-approved, must
show his faithfulness especially two ways.

1. In an active way he must show his faithfulness in two respects. First

1. He must show it in a right delivery of his Message, just as he receives it
from his Master. He must not alter it or change it in the least degree, to make
it suit with the genius of the times, or the pleasure of Superiors, or the
corruption of the people. For if they once perceive that he will scrue the word
to any interest, and make it to comply with any humor, though they may like it
well enough, whose humors and corruptions he complies with, yet they will never
like him, nor think the better of him, but the worse. No, they will look upon
him as a man of no fidelity, of no conscience: and so accordingly will suspect
and undervalue any thing that he delivers. Whereas if he deliver what he has
received without fear, without favor, and will not vary in the least degree,
to comply with any man, they must take it as it comes, they will say of him as
Ahab of Micaiah, 1 King. 22.8. I hate him, for he prophesies against me still;
but yet he is a Prophet of the Lord: he crosses me and meets with me
continually, but yet I must confess he is an honest and a faithful man.

2. As he must show his faithfulness in a right and just delivery of his
Message, so in the second place in a delivery of it too, for right ends;
conceive it, for his Masters ends and not his own. To advance Christ's glory, to
build up Christ's Church, to save the souls of Christ's people; If we would be
well received and entertained, our hearers must have no occasion to distrust,
that that which we deliver (though for the matter of it right and sound) is to
satisfy our own passion, or to promote our own ends.

First, not to satisfy our own passions. They must not think that our seeming
heat and zeal is for our selves, and not for Christ: and this we must be very
wary of in the great differences that are on foot at this time. Corruption will
be apt enough (if there were nothing else) to make us sharp and bitter against
those and their opinions, who are it may be violent against us; and if they
apprehend us so, we shall never do them good: and therefore we should strive to
carry matters so, that we may satisfy them, and convince them, that we speak
nothing out of spleen against them. And to this end it would be prudence to
forbear loose flings, and bitter girds at them. We must in no wise betray any
truth of Jesus Christ, by our neglecting to appear and show our selves for it,
who ever set themselves against it; But we should rather do it in a way of
reason and solid conviction, then in a way of passion and bitter opposition;
and in this way undoubtedly we shall do Christ and it most service.

Secondly, our hearers must have no occasion to distrust, that that which we
deliver, aims at our own respects: That we seek our selves in it; our own
honor by vain ostentation of wisdom, and eloquence, and secular learning; Our
own advantage by insinuation and pleasing, and flattery, so making merchandise
of those that hear us, as the Apostles phrase is; we must be able to appeal for
this as the Apostle did, 1 These. 2.3. Our exhortation was not of deceit or
guile; but as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the Gospel, so we
speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tries our hearts. For neither at any
time used we flattering words (as ye know) nor a cloak of covetousness, God is
witness. If such a cloak as that be used by any that pretends himself a
messenger of Christ, a cloak to hide and cover base ends, and once the people
come to look under that cloak, and to see what is within, they will never like
him more.

And as the Messenger of Christ, if he would be well received, must show his
faithfulness to Christ his Master, in an active, so in a passive way. As in a
right delivery of his message both for the matter and the ends of it, so in a
constant and a patient suffering for that which he has so delivered, if Christ
shall call him thereunto. In the first place he must be sure that that which he
delivers is indeed his Masters message; and then he must stand to it, even to
the loss of liberty, and goods, and name, and life and all. For if the people
see him flinch when he is called to this, if they perceive that he will suffer
nothing for that which he has preached to them with so much earnestness, with
so much confidence, with so much seeming resolution, farewell their
acceptance, their estimation of him any more. They will see he is a hireling
(as Christ speaks of such a one) and so accordingly they will account of him.
The good and faithful Shepherd, says our Savior, Joh. 10.11. gives his life
for the Sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd of the sheep,
whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep. The
hireling flies because he is a hireling, etc. By which it is apparent, that it
is the part but of a hireling and a mercenary man, who serves for nothing else
but wages, to fly when trouble and when danger comes. And hence the faithful
Messengers of Christ, have sealed their teachings with their sufferings, and
their blood, as I might give you many instances out of the stories of the
Scripture and the Church. And therefore they that will preserve the credit of
their Ministry, and hold up the power and operation of it with the people, must
be extremely circumspect that they deliver nothing but what they know to be the
truth of Christ, for which they must rather suffer then revoke it; and then
they must be valiant when the time of trial comes; For if they shrink in
wetting, they are gone. It will not serve the turn to tell the people they were
deceived and misled. For if they be confessedly mistaken once, they will be
ready to conclude, they may be so a second time, and so a third, and so a long;
and the end of all will be, that they will never give any great credit or
esteem to them, or to their teaching any more.

Thus by the way upon the observation hinted to us in the joint dependence of
both particulars, considered in the Text on that which goes immediately before.

Proceed we now to look upon them in a particular dependence, the one of them
upon the other, viz. the latter on the former. First you have here their good
reception of the message which our Savior brought, They received it, says the
Text. And then you have their good persuasion of the Messenger, that he came
out from God, was sent from God; and this persuasion, as I take it, was the
ground of the reception, and under that respect is mentioned here; They
received my words, says Christ; but how came this to pass? They were persuaded
that I came from God. The point is obvious.

DOCTRINE. The good reception of the message by the people, depends upon their
good opinion of the Messenger; their sure persuasion that he is sent to them
from God.
The words of Christ himself you see were entertained on this account, as he
suggests in his expression to his Father here, I have given them the words
which thou gave me, and they have received them. How so? why they have known
verily or surely, (...), they have known it for a truth, that I came out from
thee, and have believed that thou did send me. If they had doubted this, my
words had never found such entertainment and success among them.

And hence it is that the Apostles when they began to deal with any people, the
first thing that they do, is to show them their Commission and authority from
God. You shall observe in the Epistles, how this is set upon the thresholds
still, and in the very entrance of them, that so the Penmen of them might
anticipate or meet with that in the beginning which would be prejudicial to the
success and efficacy of their doctrine, and consequently leave the people free,
to benefit by that which was to follow. Paul's wisdom is remarkable in this
respect; in his Epistles you may see a taste of it, Gal. 1.1. Paul an Apostle
not of men, nor by men, q. d. however the false Teachers tell you that I am
called by men, as other ordinary Ministers and Pastors are, and so by
consequence that I have no such Universal charge as I pretend, and that I
thrust my self into the right of other men, to stand a meddling and a tampering
as I do with all the Churches: yet I assure you, I do nothing else but that to
which I am deputed and designed by my Commission from the Lord; For I am his
Apostle called immediately by him: and Jesus Christ is very careful to satifie
and to convince his hearers that he came from God, as I might give you
instances enough, but they are known. And this both he and the Apostles,
because they did knew the peoples good reception the message depends much,
etc.

Against an Elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
If there be witnesses sufficient, and the fault deserve it, pursue it, follow
it. But if not, do not receive it, let not your ears be open to it. Especially
in such a time as this, when sides are violently one against another, and when
reports are usually raised and aggravated very much by this means.

But above all take heed how you drink in the least suspicion, whether the
Minister be sent of God, or no, without a very sure ground; for this, if it be
entertained, will altogether hinder the good reception of the message which he
brings you.

And that you may not be misled in this particular, I shall in a word or two,
direct you how to judge of this business.

1. You may judge a little by his entrance; if he be sent of God, he comes in
by the door, and not by the window. The door which Christ sets open to him, and
not which he himself unlocks and opens with a false Key. So that if any
question grow in this particular, he is able to appeal to all the people, as
the Apostle sometimes did, 2 Thessalonians. 2.1. You know our entrance: It was not in a
clandestine and surreptitious way; you of the Church, you know it what it was;
whether it were according to the rule, and as be seems a Minister of Christ, I
leave it to your selves to judge, I appeal to your verdict.

When Christ ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto men for the work of the
Ministry: Ephesians. 4.12. God makes able Ministers of the New Testament, 2 Cor.
3.6. As he makes them, so he makes them able too, indues them in a measure with
ability of knowledge and utterance; gives them wisdom and a mouth. If they be
competently able both ways, it is an evidence that they are of Gods making and
of Gods sending.

You may judge a little as by their ability, so by their propensity to do Pet.
5.2. A good will to deal out to the people the Gospel of Christ. 1 Thessalonians. 2.8.
Indeed my Brethren, when a Minister that has a Competency both of knowledge
and of utterance, regards not at all to stir up the gift of of God that is in
him, or to use his abilities for the good of the Church, but is idle and
remiss, prefers his pleasure and his ease, before the good and the salvation of
the peoples souls, you have great reason to suspect him, that he is not come
from God. But if he be content to spend himself and to be spent, if he be like
a burning and shining light, as it is said of John the Baptist, burning in his
zealous Doctrine, shining in his holy life, and wasting while he shines to
others; if it be his meat and drink to do the work that God has put into his
hands: such a Minister as this, so coming in, so qualified, so employed, beware
how you suspect that he is not sent of God.

JOHN. 17.9. I pray for them, and I pray not for the world.


WE have not yet dispatched the Preface, or the preparation to our Saviors
Prayer in the behalf of his Apostles and Disciples; some think indeed, that he
begins his Prayer for them in the following verse, which we are now about to
enter on, I pray for them, I pray not for the world: But if you mark it, there
is nothing in it, either of Confession, or Petition, or Thanksgiving; only our
Savior Christ lays down some leading Considerations which induce him to
present this Supplication for them to his Father; And they are taken either
from their relation, or from their condition. The first is drawn from their
relation to his Father and himself, I pray for them, I pray not for the world,
but for them which thou have given me, for they are thine. And all mine are
thine, and thine are mine; by means whereof it comes to pass that I am
glorified in them: the next is drawn from the condition they were in, and were
likely to be in, they were at present in the world, and they were likely to be
in it out of hand without Christ; I mean without his visible and corporal, and
fleshly presence; And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world,
and I come to thee; as if he should have added, and I must leave them behind
me; The greater need they had to be recommended by him in his prayers, which
were the last he was to make with them in this world. These are the things that
move him to become an earnest suitor to his Father for his Apostles and
Disciples in a special manner, as he hints in the beginning, I pray for them, I
pray not for the world.

Now this he speaks exclusively, you see, as it is very manifest, even in the
letter of the Text. A man would think it might have been sufficient for our
Savior to have said, I pray for them. For had he said but so, he had employed,
that other men were not at all remembered, by him in his prayers: But he will be
express and clear in such a business of such high importance; he will shut out
the world from having any share at all in this incomparable privilege, in
downright language, and in plain terms from being once so much as mentioned in
his prayers, I pray for them, I pray not for the world.

So that the point to be observed is plain.

DOCTRINE. Christ is an Intercessor to his Father for none but his own people.
He prays for them, and none but them; the world are utterly excluded from
having share at all in our Saviors Intercession. He intercedes for none that
are without the pale that he sets up in this Text; he does not speak one word
to God for them: I pray not for the world, says he, I meddle not with them at
all in that business. But if he pray not for the world, who are they for whom
he prays? I pray for them, says Christ. For them, for whom? why, for them whom
thou have given me. So that they who are Christ's, you see, have a peculiar
privilege in this regard; for all the Intercession of the Son of God, the
great High Priest is spent upon them; If any sin, we have an Advocate with God
the Father, says the Evangelist, 1 John 2.1. He speaks it there exclusively,
we have, and no others. And therefore it is very much to be observed, that he
says not, If any sin, he has an Advocate; for there are many sinners in the
world, that have no Advocate with God the Father. But if any sin, we have an
Advocate, we that believe, have Christ to intercede for us. And he may have an
advocate if he believe; if he be one of us, let the man be what be will, and
let his sin be what it will, Christ will be an Advocate and Intercessor to his
Father for him: He ever lives (says the Apostle speaking of our Savior) to
make intercession for them, Heb. 7.25. Them, whom? why them who come to God by
him, as you may see if you reflect upon the former parcel of the verse; He is
able to save them to the utmost who come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to
make intercession for them: Still you see his intercession is confined to a
selected company of men, and not extended to the whole world. He appears in
Heaven for us, says the Apostle, Heb. 9.24. Not for all without exception, but
for us whom he has taken into his special and peculiar love and care, who are
comparatively but a small number.

So that the point is plain you see, Christ is an Intercessor to his Father,
etc.

branches (as you may know my Brethren) of the Priesthood of our Savior;
Sacrifice and Intercession; and they are both of them for his people. He offers
Sacrifice for none but them, and so accordingly he intercedes for none but them
neither; for both the branches of his Priesthood of necessity must go together.

He is a Mediator for, and only for his own people; he makes peace for none but
them. And even as he is not a Mediator of redemption for the world; so he is
not a Mediator of Intercession for it neither. Indeed, my Brethren, all that he
is, or does as he is Man and Mediator, is for his people. Why was the Son of
God incarnate but for them? why did he take our Nature on him but for them? why
was he made a Mediator but for them? He is a King to rule them, a Prophet to
instruct them, a Priest to sacrifice and intercede for them. He had never been
a King as he is a Man, he had never been a Prophet, he had never been a Priest,
but for the sake of his people. And hence it follows very clearly, that
whatsoever he does in the administrations of these Offices of his, he does it
(next to his own glory) for his Churches good. He carries it throughout in
reference to them: and so accordingly the Execution of his Priestly Office in
both the parts and branches of it is for them. He is an Intercessor to his
Father for none but for, etc.

Is Christ an Intercessor, etc. this may serve to satisfy us in the point I
pray not for the world. And might he not have said as well, I dye not for the
world? and if our Saviors intercession now in heaven be not vocal, as it is
usually resolved, but a real presentation of the merits of his death, and the
virtue of his passion to his Father: That as the blood of Martyrs cries for
vengeance to be executed upon those that shed it, so on the other side, the
blood of Jesus Christ the Mediator cries for mercy to be showed to them for
whom he shed it. It claims it out of right and justice in the behalf of those
for whom he dyed. Why then, it follows, that if he dyed for all, he cannot
choose but intercede for all too. Or if he should be silent, his blood would
cry for mercy for them, to whom it was intended and designed; and consequently,
if he pray not for the world, he dyed not for the world neither.

Is Christ an Intercessor, etc. Here then you see the sad condition of for your
selves, and all in vain; for Jesus Christ will not speak a word for you, nor
any such as you are. Beloved, I beseech you think upon it, there come in heavy
things against you every day at the bar of Gods Justice. Sin cries, and the Law
cries, all the Commandments which you break continually come in with open
mouth against you, and importune Gods Justice for wrath and vengeance to be
executed on you. They cry How long Lord? and sin cries How long Lord? and
Christ who is the only Mediator to avert wrath, and make peace, he sits
still and says nothing. Oh my Beloved, what should hinder now, but that the
black decree for execution should go forth against you, when there is none to
interpose and stand between you and the wrath of God! when these complaints and
cries of all the sins that you have done, of all the Oaths that you have
sworn, of all the lies that you have made, etc. come in against you in the
Court of heaven: and the Father puts the question to the Son the only advocate
in that Court, What have you any thing to say for this man, why judgment
should not pass against him? will you undertake for him? and Christ shall
answer no, I have not a word to say for him; I intercede not for the world: Let
Justice have its course against him, let it be executed on him to the utmost: I
pray for my own people, and I desire they may be spared as in right they ought
to be, for I have satisfied for them. But for the rest I even leave them to the
vengeance and the wrath they have deserved, I will not hinder it, or stop it,
in the least degree; Let Justice pay them home in full weight and full measure;
Look how much they have sinned, and how much wickedness they have committed, so
much torment and so much sorrow let it give them. Oh what a flood of horror
and confusion, think you, will be poured out upon you, when once the day of
vengeance and of visitation comes; when God comes forth against you as an Enemy
with nothing else but war and death, and blood, and mine, and destruction in
his looks, and there is none to pacify and appease him, none to speak a word
for you; but Christ the only Mediator leaves you to the utmost of his fury, Oh
consider this, etc.

etc. here then you may behold the matchless happiness of those who belong to
Jesus Christ. In this respect they have a privilege above the world, that they
have him to intercede for them, to be their Advocate, and to present their
Supplications and requests to God. Brethren, I know not how you value it, or
what account you make of it, but I assure you, it is a rich Prerogative that
you have such an Intercessor with the Father, if you have eyes to see the worth
of it. And that you may the better know your happiness in this regard, I shall
lay it open to you in a few particulars.

ask of me, and I will give thee. And is it not a privilege to have such as he
to speak for us? One that can do so much with God, that has his ear and heart
too; One that can surely carry any business for us in the Court of Heaven; for
his Father hears him always, Joh. 11.4. and never puts him off with a denial.
An Advocate that is not favored; may speak much and plead hard, and yet he may
prevail but little. But Jesus Christ is sure to speed in any suit, in any
business that he undertakes. Oh the blessedness of those who are within the
compass of this glorious privilege, and who have such a powerful Advocate as
Christ is!

Your happiness is very great that you have Christ to be your Intercessor,
Immanuel, God with us, God one of us, who took not on him Angels, but the seed
of Abraham, who is of our own flesh and blood and bone, and therefore he will
certainly be tender of us, and compassionate toward us. And therefore the
Apostle Paul observes that we are very happy in a High Priest, He being such a
one as cannot but be touched with our infirmities, as being of the self same
nature with us, and having had himself experience of them, for he was in all
things like unto us, sin only excepted; and therefore cannot but be very much
affected with our sorrows and our sufferings, and very sensible when he is
pleading for us to the Father.

Our happiness is great, etc. in this respect, that he is not like to dye, He
will save us to the utmost, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Heb. 7.25. and why so?
because he ever lives to make intercession for us, as it is added there in that
place.

So you see our happiness is great, it is a blessed privilege that we have
Christ to be our Intercessor; and it may yield us singular encouragement, and
precious comfort diverse ways: As

1. It may encourage us and comfort us, in our addresses to the Majesty of God.
Now we may go with boldness to the Throne of grace, having so good a friend
with God as Christ is. If we were to go alone, and of our selves, if we had
none to make our way for us, it could not choose but be a great disheartning to
us. But when we seriously consider that our Advocate is there, our friend is
there, who will be ready upon all occasions to second us, to put in a good word
for us; to help out us in any business, this is a ground of choice comfort.

2. It may support us in the sense of our many imperfections. However our
petitions are put up in much infirmity and fear and weakness, yet if they be
according to the will of God, we may remember still that they are seconded by
Christ in heaven; That he puts in on our behalf, and demands the same things,
that he excuses what is wanting in our prayers, and supplies it in his own. We
are flat, but he is quick; we are dull, but he is lively; we are short, but he
is full.

3. It may assure us of success in our Petitions, since we have Christ to
intercede for us: We might stand begging long enough our selves, and never
speed. But if we be among the number of those for whom our Savior undertakes
to plead; if he will put in but a word for us, all is ended presently, and we
have a gracious answer out of hand. God may deny us, while we are speaking for
our selves; but if Christ speak for us, he can never be denied; his Father
always lets him have his own asking.

4. This may keep us from despair and sinking under the weight of all our sins.
If we sin, we have an Advocate to plead for us, to answer all the accusations
of the Law and of the Conscience. It is his Office to interpose between his
Father and his people, to plead the causes of our souls before him. And this we
may take special comfort in, that be our matters never so soul, never so
inexcuseable as considered in themselves, his very undertaking of them clears
all, and sets us right even at the bar of Gods justice. True, their iniquities
are black and heinous, says our Advocate; but, are they greater then my merits
are? if so, let them be condemned; if not, let them be absolved: If all that I
have done and suffered will acquit them, let them be acquitted. What cause have
we to cheer our hearts, and bless our God, that we have such an Advocate as
Christ is!

And thus far of our Saviors Declaration.

Proceed we now to the Considerations that induce him to become a Suitor for
them to his Father: Whereof the first is taken from the relation which they
had, not to himself alone, but to his Father. I pray for them; I pray not for
the world, but for them which thou have given me, for they are thine, and all
mine are thine.

So that the words indeed contain a reason of congruity why our Savior should
commend the case of his Disciples and Apostles in his Petitions to his Father;
because as they were his, so they were his Fathers too, and it concerned him to
take care of those that were his own, that appertained and belonged to him. As
if our Savior should have said, If they are mine and not thine, I had no such
great inducement, or no such great encouragement at least to petition thee for
them, or to expect a gracious answer and a merciful rerurn from thee in their
behalf; But they are thine as well as mine. I pray for them; I pray not for the
world, but for them which thou have given me, for they are thine. True, thou
have given them to me, but so, that they are thine still. Thou art not utterly
divested by thy gift, of the right thou had in them, and therefore it is meet
and congruous that thou should still continue thy regard to them, and that
thou should be flexible to the Petitions that I make for them.

Now this he clears a little further yet, that they were his Fathers still,
though they were bestowed on him, because all that belonged to him were so; I
pray for them whom thou have given me, for they are thine. How so? might the
Father say; if I have given them to thee, how are they mine? Why says our
Savior, all that I have is thine; all mine are thine, and consequently they
are thine too, notwithstanding this donation. So that the Conjunction And, they
are thine, and all mine are thine, stands for the causal particle, as if he
should have said, for mine are thine. And so we find it often used in the
Scripture; you may take that place for instance, Psalm. 60.11. Lord, do thou
give us help from trouble, and vain is the help of man, so it is the Original;
but in our last Translation it is rendered by the causal particle, for vain is
the help of man: so in my Text, They are thine, and all mine are thine, that
is, for all mine are thine, q.d. Father they must needs be thine, for indeed
all mine are so, so that the point to be observed is this:

DOCTRINE. That all the people of the Lord Christ do belong to God the Father.
They are not his so, that they are not the Fathers too. Christ has not a
divided, but a mixed and common interest in all his people with the Father. And
hence he wraps up both their rights together in my Text, They are thine, and
mine are thine, and thine are mine. So that the Father does not give his people
so to Christ, that he does wholly pass away his right in them; No, they
continue his still; yea, let me say, that they are more the Fathers when he
has given them to Jesus Christ, and Christ has taken and received them, then
they were before he gave them, as I shall make it evidently to appear to you:
For

When Christ has taken them for his, then he has none but Christ The world
will love her own: Yea more then so, we are the Devils, we are the things which
he possesses: We are the Devils own possession, we are Satan's freehold. But
when we come to be the Sons by the donation of the Father, then we are our own
no longer, as the Apostle tells us on the very same ground, Ye are not your
own, says he, 1 Cor. 6.19. We are the worlds no longer, as our Savior Christ
himself informs his Disciples in the fore-alleaged place, If ye were of the
world, the world would love (...) own; but ye are not of the world, for I have
called you out of the world: We are no longer Satan's neither; the Prince of
this world is cast out, the strong man is bound, and spoiled of that which was
before his own possession. So that you see my Brethren, Christ takes off all
other sharers in his people, when once they come to be bestowed on him, and to
be seized upon by him: He either buys them out by good purchase, or drives them
out by plain force, and so they come to be the Fathers and his own, entirely
and peculiarly; so that the Father is apparently a gainer by it, his interest
is greater in them then it was before; for whereas there were many sharers in
his people formerly, now there is none but Christ to share with him: He, and be
alone is lest, and all the rest of the pretenders are casheered.

they are mine; for I have received them: but more then so, they are mine; for
my own Son has bought them, and brought them back again for me, when I had
lost them.

they are one in us, Joh. 17.21. not one among themselves alone, but one in us;
not in me only, but in thee too: So that when God bestows a people on our
Savior, he brings them nearer to him then they were before: He does not only
make them his, but he makes them one with him; and an interest of union, is far
beyond an interest of mere possession.

So that ye see the point is clear, The people of the Lord Christ do belong to
God the Father; and that the more because they are bestowed upon him by the
Father. The Fathers interest is so far from being weakened and abated (...) that
indeed it is strengthened and increased by this means.

The hill of Sion, the hill of God, because the excellentest of all other
hills, Psalm. 68.15. The trees of Lebanon, the trees of the Lord, because the
excellentest of all other trees. And so the Saints, the people of the Lord,
because the excellentest of all other people; and surely that must needs be
excellent which he owns: And therefore let us learn to value them aright, and
as the Lord in this respect has made them high above others, as he speaks of
Israel, Deuteronomy. 26.18.19. God has avouched thee to be his own peculiar people,
to make thee high above all Nations. So let us have an high esteem of them: let
us not slight and disrespect them as carnal men are apt to do, because they
have a mere outside; but let us look upon them as the Fathers, as that which he
peculiarly owns, and that not as his ordinary stuff, but as his Treasure and
his Jewels, as they are often styled in the Scripture: And though they may be
trodden under foot awhile, by wicked men, we may be confident the time is
coming, when the Lord will make them up as it is said, Mal. 3.17. When he will
make up his Jewels, when he will take them up out of the mire, and wipe them
clean from those abasures that have lain upon them, to hide their beauty, and
obscure their luster, and show them in their brightness, and their splendour to
the world.

Is it so, that all the people of the Lord Christ do belong, etc. Then let You
shall be holy to me, says the Lord. And why so? For I have severed you from
other people, that you should be mine: And so say I to you, my Brethren, you
are the Lords own people, and he has severed you from others to be his
peculiar ones. Oh see now that you walk as it becomes those to do, who are the
Lords, and that upon these two grounds: For

1. The sins of those who are his own, reflect with more disparagement upon him
then the sins of others do. He suffers not so much in the exorbitancies of
other men that appertain not to him, as he does in yours, and therefore you
should be the more wary. Oh let not wicked men have any cause to say of you, as
the Heathen did sometimes of the people of the Jews, the only people of the
Lord at that time, Ezekiel. 36.20. These are the people of the Lord, and they are
gone out of his Land. They carried and demeaned themselves so ill, that he
could not bear with them, but he was fain to cast them forth out of the Land
which he had bestowed upon them: So let not wicked wretches say of you, These
are the people of the Lord, and yet they are proud, covetous, worldly, wanton,
loose, etc. Let not his name I pray you be dishonored and blasphemed by your
means; but think when you are tempted and enticed to any sin, Whether it be fit
for those who are the Lords own people, to do such wickedness and sin against
their God.

2. As your iniquities who are the Lords, dishonor him more, so he will
chasten you, if you miscarry, sooner and quicker then he will do other men who
are further off from him: and this should make you yet more cautious; that
known place is home and apposite to this purpose, Amos 3.12. You only have I
known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you: For other
families that are not mine, as you are, and that appertain not to me in such a
special manner as you do, I shall not be so quick to exercise my Discipline
upon them. But you are mine own household, and therefore if you do amiss, I will
be sure to take a course with you. If God see many Aliens to him, doing any
wickedness, he may bear with them long, for it concerns him not so much to deal
against them; but if he spy out any of his own amongst them, doing as the rest
do, he will be sure to single him and call him out from all the rest, and say,
You are my own, you appertain especially to me; and what, will you do as these
vile abominable wretches do? will you run out with them to the same excess of
riot? Come I must order you, though I let the rest alone, I must not suffer you
in such courses.

Is it so, that all people of the Lord Christ do belong, etc. Here then is
precious comfort for the Saints arising from the property and interest that God
the Father has in them. For it they be his own, and that in such a special and
peculiar way, as we have showed, we may be confident, he will do very much for
them, and that in diverse cases; I will name a few of them.

1. If they be his own, the Father certainly will hear the Son for them; he
will be easily entreated for those that have such near relation to him: If they
were only Christ's, and not his, this were enough to make him facile, to the
Intercession that his own Son makes for them, because they appertain to one
that is so infinitely dear to him: But seeing they are Christ's and his too,
this carries all before it; and this is that our Savior urges in my Text, That
those for whom he prayed and interceded, did as well belong to his Father as
himself: so that his Father was as much engaged to hear as he was to pray for
them; I pray for them whom thou have given me, for they are thine; q. d. I hope
thou will not put me off with a denial; For they are thine as well as mine,
whom I intercede for.

2. If they belong to God the Father, we may depend upon it, he does love them,
and love them very dearly too, as those that are so near to him: Property and
interest is one special ground of love; we use to love our own, you know, yea
many times to dote upon them out of measure, though there be nothing lovely in
them. And certainly the Lord has very dear affections to his own too; though
they be black, yet they are comely in his eyes: His love toward them is so
great, that it covers many faults, and many blemishes and spots in them: and
the cause of all is this, the near and special interest he has in them; this
makes his love without measure and without end, Joh. 13.1. Having loved his own
to the end he loves them.

3. If they belong to God the Father, he will be very tender of their wrongs;
and this he will discover one of those two ways, either he will defend them, or
avenge them.

First if he see it fit, he will defend them, and protect them from the wrongs
of those that seek to be abusive and injurious to them: They are his own, and
therefore he will certainly take care of them. Beloved, these are times of some
danger, and it is good to have a sure and safe keeper. And verily they that
belong to God are in a very good condition, what ever alterations come upon the
world; how ever matters go, he will be careful of his own; he will not be so
ill a Master to abandon them to ruin, when they have most need of him: Or

Secondly, if he defend them not from wrong, (as he may leave his own sometimes
in the hands of wicked men, for causes which he best knows,) certainly he will
avenge them: The property and interest he has in them, will engage him to
appear on their side, to take their quarrel into his hands, and to render wrath
to those that are abusive and injurious to them. Especially if they make
complaint to him, and if they cry because of the oppression, they are so near
and dear to him, that he cannot choose but right them; Will he not avenge his
own, when they cry day and night to him, Luke 18.7. As who should say, Do you
make a question of it? it is impossible but he should do it.

4. If they belong to God, he will provide for them: Will he not find his
people meat and drink, and clothes, and other things that are expedient for
them? Does he keep so ill an house, to let his Family lack bread? Oh do not so
dishonor him, to have such poor and low thoughts of him; it is that which
troubles many that belong to God, of the meaner sort of people, they are afraid
that they shall want; their charge increases and their Trade decays, and
poverty begins to come upon them like an armed man, and now their hearts are
quite down; they doubt their Master will not find them bread. Oh you of little
faith, wherefore do you doubt? Why do you so distrust God? The earth is the
Lords, and the fullness thereof. You are his who is the Lord of all the Earth,
and all the fullness of provision that is in it. He feeds his enemies, and will
he see his own want? Truly my Brethren, if you have not such provision as you
would desire, it is because he sees it best to diet you, and knows that fullness
and plenty of external things would not in any case be best for you.

5. If they belong to God, he will not lose them; what do you think the Lord
will be so wretchless that he will not keep his own? No, no, he bought them at
so dear a rate, that he will know how he forgoes them: His they are and he will
keep them; and however sin and Satan and the world are always plucking at
them, to get them (if it might be possible) away from God, he will hold them
fast enough, that none shall pluck them out of his hand.

JOHN 17.10. And I am glorified in them.


AND thus far of the first consideration, that induced our Savior to become a
Suitor for his Apostles and Disciples to his Father: The joint relation which
they had to himself and to his Father.

Before he pass on to the next consideration, he adds a consectary that
depends on this, and flows from this, the near relation which they had to him,
to Christ himself; All mine are thine, says our Savior to his Father, and
thine are mine. And what follows? Since they are mine, I am glorified in them.
And this adds strength to the Consideration upon which it is inferred, and
has something in it farther to move our Savior to be mindful of his Apostles
and Disciples in his prayers, because as they were his own, so he was glorified
in them. Many times we are dishonored in those that are our own, and that have
near relation to us, more then we are, yea more then we can be in those that
are further off from us. Christ is not so in those that appertain to him; no,
he is glorified in them: The more inclinable he is to tender them in his
petitions to his Father; I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for
them whom thou have given me; for they are thine, and mine are thine, and thine
are mine, and I am glorified in them.

And here the phrase our Savior uses, deserves our careful and attentive
observation: He does not say, I am glorified by them, but I am glorified in
them; not by them in an active way, but in them in a passive way, q. d. any
thing that is commendable and praise worthy in them, tends to advance my
praise, and to set forth my glory; I have the honor of any worth or excellency
that is in them any way: and that by reason of the near relation which I have
to them, and the interest I have in them. They are mine, and I am glorified in
them. So that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ is glorified in all those that belong to him.
If they be his, he is glorified in them even as the Teacher is glorified in
the Scholar, as the Master is glorified in the servant, or as the head is
glorified in the members, so Christ is glorified in his people; he is the great
Prophet, the great Teacher of his Church, and if his people learn well, if they
thrive and grow in knowledge, it is a Commendation to their Teacher; he is the
Lord and Master of his people, and if his servants do well, it is an honor to
their Master: He is the head of his Church which is his body; and if his
members thrive well, if they have any beauty in them, it is a commendation to
their Head; Indeed, my Brethren, if they were the Scholars of another Master,
the servants of another Lord, the members of another head, their proficiency
and tractability, and beauty, were nothing to the Lord Christ. But seeing they
belong to him, he has the honor of any thing that is commendable in them.

To clear the point a little more distinctly to you, Jesus Christ is glorified
in all those that belong to him, either in the present life, or in that which
is to come. First in the present life he is glorified in their grace. Then in
the life to come, he is glorified in their glory.

1. In the present life he is glorified in the grace of all those that belong
to him: Their grace is his glory: When they abound in faith, and love, and
hope, and patience, and obedience, this is an honor to the Lord Christ, that
he has such people, so qualified, and so employed: when they believe in
difficult and hard cases, they glorify him in believing, as it is said of
Abraham, Romans 4.20. He was strong in Faith, giving glory to God: when they are
fruitful in the works of righteousness, these are also to the praise of his
glory: Herein is he glorified, if they bring forth much fruit: For Jesus Christ
is looked upon as the Original of all the good, the Fountain and the Spring of
all the holiness that is in his people. And hence the praise of all returns to
him, as the Apostle Paul insinuates, Romans 11. ult. For of him are all things.
And what follows? To him be glory for ever, Amen. If any of his people have a
special gift of knowledge, they have learned it all of Christ: if they excel in
other grace, they receive it all from Christ. If they have any choice ability
to any holy and religious duty, it is Christ that makes them able, and it is
Christ that strengthens them. They that have judgments exercised and are able
to discern as soon as they discover any excellency in any kind in any of the
Saints, they ascribe it all to Christ, because they know they had it all from
him: See what Jesus Christ can do in, and for, and by those that have
Originally nothing that is good in them. If any of them shine, the beams that
make them glister, come from Christ, and they dart back to Christ again: He
shines upon them, and he shines in them, as the Prophet insinuates, Isai. 60.1.
Arise and shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
thee. It is a glory to the Lord Christ that he has such a beautiful and
glorious people. And thus you see, my Brethren, he is glorified in the grace of
those that belong to him.

2. As he is glorified in the grace, so he is glorified and shall be glorified
in the glory of those that belong to him: especially in the great day, when he
shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that
believe, as the Apostle Paul tells us, 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. to be glorified in them
to wonder and to admiration. So that the world shall be astonished and amazed
to see the matchless and unutterable glory that he shall adorn them with, and
in their glory glorify himself. This shall transport beholders into wonder, it
shall make them to admire them, and to admire Christ in them.

Its true, Christ shall be glorified wonderfully on that day in the damnation
and destruction of the wicked that belong not to him. The wrath of Jesus Christ
shall be an admirable wrath; the judgments and the vengeance that he shall
inflict upon them shall be full of wonder; that men shall be astonished and
amazed to see, that Jesus Christ the Lamb of God, who in this life has showed
himself so meek and patient, and long-suffering to abominable sinners, should
be so out of measure wrath with them. Ungodly men themselves will wonder at his
fury. The Saints will wonder at his glorious justice, and adore the
righteousness of his proceedings with all the wicked unbelievers of the world.
Yea, their confusion and destruction in that great and dreadful day will be
one special part of that admirable glory, whereby Christ will be wonderful in
the eyes of all his people. Because for their sakes, and the wrongs and
injuries that wicked men have offered them, shall their judgment be the
heavier, and the deeper, and that to all eternity. Oh what an admirable thing
is this (will the poor people of the Lord say) that Jesus Christ should have
such dear respect to us, that he should be so angry with poor creatures and
execute such heavy wrath upon them for our sakes!

But there will be incomparably greater cause of glorifying Jesus Christ, and
of wondering at his mercy in the salvation of his own people. For alas the
wicked shall have nothing else but their deserts in that day. But this shall be
the height of wonder that Jesus Christ should load his people with such an
Hyperbolical and transcendent weight of glory without the least desert on their
part, yea when they have deserved the same extremity of vengeance that is
inflicted on the wicked. Oh what a glory must this be to Jesus Christ? how
shall this fill the mouths of all the Angels and triumphant Saints in heaven
with his praises? How shall his people wonder at their own glory, and at the
glory of their fellow-Saints, and the transcendent love of Christ in it! How
shall the great ones of the earth that have contemned and trampled under foot
the poor despised Servants of the Lord Christ, stand amazed at their glory,
beyond all that they looked for! Oh my beloved, how wonderful shall Jesus
Christ be in that day to all the world, in the incomparable glory which then he
will bestow upon his poor contemned and despised people!

Romans 2.24. The name of Christ is blasphemed by your means; I beseech you
seriously bethink your selves what condition you are in; believe it for the
present you are none of Christ's. Take notice of his own expression in my text,
they are mine, and I am glorified in them. And therefore if he be not glorified
in you, depend upon it, you are none of his. And is it nothing, my beloved, to
be renounced by Jesus Christ, as men whom he will not own? Is it nothing for
the Lord to shake a person off, to say unto him in displeasure, Sir, tell me
not of any interest you have in me, for you belong not to me; I will not
acknowledge you, I tell you plainly you are none of mine. Truly my brethren,
however it may seem at present, the day will come when this will be a sad
sentence. When men in the great day of separation shall strive to make a title
to the Lord Christ, when they shall tell him, Lord, we have been acquainted
with thee heretofore (as they did in the Parable) we have born thy name, and we
have been called Christians, and have been accounted thine, and will thou not
acknowledge us and own us now? And Christ shall answer them, depart from me, I
know you not, go, get you over on the other side among the Goats, I tell you,
you are none of mine. Ah my beloved, this will be a cooling and a killing word
indeed.

Is it so that Jesus Christ is glorified in all those that belong to him?

1. This should quicken us and stir us up to labor after holiness and grace,
that Jesus Christ may be glorified in us. If grace were only advantageous to
our selves and honorable to our selves (as to be really and truly gracious, is
indeed the greatest honor in the world) there were no such reason then why we
should labor to attain it, and abound with it. For then you know we could have
no higher aim then only to set up a poor Creature. But seeing Jesus Christ is
honored in the grace and holiness, and the obedience of his people, Oh how
should this inflame us with restless and unsatisfied desires of these things!
How should we covet and covet earnestly the best gifts, and labor that we may
excel in inward grace and outward obedience, that we may set up Jesus Christ
the more, and that his honor may be the more advanced by us. When we are
seeking to the Lord for holiness and grace that he would give it out to us, and
give it more abundantly, how should we press and quicken our petitions with
this prevailing argument, that Jesus Christ will be advanced by it, and his
glory more enlarged. Lord, give us more faith, love, hope, patience, zeal,
power against corruption, strength to new obedience, that Christ may have the
more glory. We seek not these things to promote our own esteem and reputation,
and that we may be some body among the Saints, but that Christ Jesus may be all
in all. It is thy great design to glorify thy Son Christ, and this is the
ready way to accomplish the design on which thy very heart is set; if thou give
us more holiness and more grace, he will have more glory. Thou will not honor
us so much, but Jesus Christ thine own beloved Son will be glorified in us. And
therefore we beseech thee set thy Treasure open to us, and give us out a large
share. In such a manner the Apostle deals with God in his petitions, in that
memorable place to this purpose, 2 These. 1.11, 12. We pray continually for you,
says the Apostle there, that God would count you worthy of this calling, and
fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with
power. That he would carry on that work of grace upon your souls, till he has
brought it to perfection. And why so? to what end? That the name of our Lord
Jesus may be glorified in you; not that you may be honored; but that Christ
may be glorified in you.

2. And as this should stir us up to labor after grace in this world, so
after glory in the world to come; Since Christ is glorified as in the grace, so
much more in the glory of his people; For glory is complete grace, and
therefore Christ is glorified in that to admiration, as we have showed you
formerly in explication of the point. The Apostle speaks of some who seek
glory. Romans 2.7. he means the glory of the other world, as it is very evident
by that which is joined with it, glory, and honor and immortality and Eternal
life. And truly it is not unlawful for every one of us to seek glory, I mean
our own eternal glory in the heavens, because while we seek that, we seek the
glory of Christ in it.

Its that which troubles many of the Saints, they think that they are scarce
upright because they have so great an eye upon their own glory. They doubt
their own sincerity, merely upon this ground. Indeed, my brethren, if your own
glory and salvation went single and alone, it were a greater cause of scruple.
But since the glory of the Lord Christ, is comprehended and involved in it, why
should you not desire and seek it, as subservient to the great and high end?
And therefore I beseech you my beloved, under this notion have respect to it,
and draw encouragement and sweetness from it, amidst the many heavy labors and
bitter sufferings of this present life. Look up man to the glory that is set
before thee, press hard toward it, be diligent and patient in the expectation
of it, strive and labor to obtain it: while thou considerest with thy self
that when thou art glorified, Christ will be glorified in thee. And so in
aiming at thy own glory do thou intend and seek the glory of Christ. And this
is that which thou may do, yea, this is that which thou must do. And
therefore go on cheerfully, embrace the promise that is yet afar of, reach at
the Crown of glory that is hung out to tempt thee and to toll thee on; And let
this animate thee most of all, that when thou have attained it, Christ will be
glorified and admired in thee. He whom thy very soul loves, will have one
monument the more of his own praise and glory unto all eternity. And thus far
of the first Consideration that induced our Savior to become a Suitor for his
Apostles and Disciples to his Father, viz. the near relation which they had to
his Father and himself, by means of which it came to pass that he was glorified
in them.

The second follows now in order, to be handled, viz. the sad condition they
were likely to be in, by reason of the near approach of his departure from them
to the Father, and leaving them behind in an unquiet and malicious world. And
now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.

A doleful and heart-killing word, you must conceive, it was to his Apostles
and Disciples, and now I am no more in the world. They who left all for him,
must needs be very much dejected to be left by him. And to be left alone in
such a wilderness in such a troublesome, unpleasing and a vexatious place, as
the world has always been to Christ's Disciples. As long as he was with them,
he was a very great support, encouragement and comfort to them in all
conditions and in all cases. And therefore now he is about to leave them, he
thinks it necessary to commend them to the especial care and mercy and
protection of his Father.

There are two things suggested in this dying Song, this last farewell of our
Savior in my Text; his own departure, and his Disciples stay behind him. His
own departure; and now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee; his
Disciples stay behind him: but these are in the world, and are to continue so,
for that is intimated in the words. Christ must go, and they must stay, so that
a doleful separation is at hand. If Christ had been to have remained among
them here, or if he would have taken them up with himself into the other world,
it had been well, they had been together still. But Christ is now about to go,
and they must not go with him.

Begin we with the first particular suggested in the words, the departure of
our Savior, and now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee. And here
you have the terminus a quo, the term from which he goes, and that is from this
lower World: Now I am no more in the world. And the terminus ad quem, the term
to which he goes, to the presence of his Father, but I come to thee. I am no
more in this world, this lower world beneath Heaven. He speaks of that which is
approaching and at hand, as if it were already acted and accomplished; for it
is evident he was in this world, when he uttered these words. And it is usual
with the Holy Ghost in the Scripture to speak of instant things as done
already. And so our Savior in my Text, I am no more in this world, q. d. I am
as good as gone already, the time of my departure is at hand.

Now this our Savior does not here affirm of himself as he is God, for so he
does not, neither can he go or come. He fills every place at once, and
consequently cannot move (in that respect) from place to place. But he speaks
it of himself as he is man, and in relation to his bodily and fleshly presence:
So he is now to be no more in this world, he is to leave it, and depart from it.

But whether is he then to go, if he do not tarry here? Why to his Father, as
you have it in the following words, I come to thee. Why, was he absent from his
Father here? Was there a distance between his Father and himself while he
remained in this World? Was not the Father present with him everywhere? Yes he
was in his Fathers presence every where, but not in his immediate presence,
where he reveals and shows himself in the fullness of his glory, that is
confined to the heaven of the blessed. And thither is our Savior now about to
go, to the Immediate presence of his Father, as accordingly he did in a short
time after; I am no more in the world, but I come to thee. So that the Point to
be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ as he is man, is gone out of this lower world, to
the immediate presence of his Father.
Though he were once, yet he is now no more in this world: no, he is gone up
far above all heavens, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Ephesians. 4.10. above all that we
see, to the Heaven of the blessed. And therefore David speaking in the person
of our Savior, says, Thou shall not leave my soul in hell, neither shall thou
suffer thy holy one to see corruption; but shall show me the path of life: in
thy presence is fullness of joy, and at thy right hand there are pleasures for
evermore, Psalm. 16.10, 11. Thither is our Savior gone to the immediate
presence, and to the right hand of the Father: And there are witnesses enough
of this; while they beheld, says the Evangelist, Acts 1.9. that is the
Apostles assembled together, as you may see in the foregoing part of the
Chapter: While they beheld he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of
their sight. And that must be as he was man, in which respect alone he was in
sight, before he was withdrawn from them. And after, Stephen saw the heaven
opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God, Acts 7.56. He saw
Jesus Christ there in his Humanity, and as he is the Son of man. And there he
must continue in his humane Nature, until he come again to Judgment, as the
Apostles were certified by the Angels as soon as he was taken from them, Acts
1.11. Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus which is taken up
from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him going
into heaven. And this is that which the Apostle intimates in his Sermon to the
Jews, Acts 3.20, 21. He shall send Jesus whom the heaven must receive until the
time of restitution of all things. Indeed, my Brethren, Christ was once
manifested in the flesh, appeared in his humane Nature in the World, but now he
is departed hence, and received up to glory, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Timothy
3.16. So that the point is plain you see, That Jesus Christ as he is man, is
gone out of this lower, etc. But wherefore did he not continue here? Why did he
leave this lower World? Let us see the reasons of it, and they are many, and of
great importance; some of them concern himself, and some of them concern his
Church; we will survey them in their order.

John 17.5. And now O Father, glorify me with thy self, q.d. I see there is no
glory for me till I come to thee; this is the place of my abasure, and
therefore I beseech thee take me to thy self, that I may have glory with thee.

This world is not such a place, in which one would be willing to continue
longer then he has work to do in it. Indeed as long as Jesus Christ had any
business to dispatch he was very well contented to stay here. But as soon as
that was ended, he was desirous to be gone, and to return to him that sent him:
And therefore this he urges very hard, when he enrreats his Father to receive
him to him self; I have finished the work which thou gave me to do, Joh. 17.4
q. d. If I had not done the work for which thou have dispatched me down into
this lower world, I should be willing to continue here: But I have gone through
with it, (...), I have made an end of it, so that I have no more to do in this
world, and therefore I beseech thee let me come away to thee.

Jesus Christ as he is man is gone, etc. because as he has no more to

1. He was to triumph there over his Enemies and ours: This was a necessary and
important business, and it was not to be done completely here in this world, at
least not till and in the very act of his departure; and this is that which the
Apostle points at, Ephesians. 4.8. When he ascended up on high, he led Captivity
captive; He did it not before, or after, but in that article of time, when he
ascended, when he returned to his own Country, then he led his Captives with
him: Even as those Conquerers of old among the Romans, when they returned back
to Rome, after some glorious victory, were wont to bring their Captives with
them which they had taken in the wars, and to lead them by their Chariots in a
victorious and triumphant way. So Jesus Christ when he had conquered Sin, and
Death, and Hell, and was returning out of this world to the immediate presence
of his Father, to the Country whence he came, he did it in a glorious and
triumphant way: He did not steal away out of the world, as if he had ashamed of
that which he had done or suffered there, as if he had been overcome; No, he
went away triumphing, as one that having absolutely conquered and beaten all
that stood against him, brings along his prisoners with him.

2. Jesus Christ is gone away, etc. that he might send down his Spirit to his
people: That was another work he had to do, the Spirit was not to come down,
till he came up; and therefore he ascended, that the Spirit might descend
abundantly upon his people. And this is that of which he minds his Apostles
and Disciples when he was about to leave them, Joh. 16.7. It is expedient for
you that I go away, and why so? For if I do not go away, the Comforter, the
Holy Spirit will not come. While I am with you in the flesh, you are so taken
up with carnal and fleshly apprehensions of me, that you are made incapable of
great degrees and measures of the Spirit. And therefore I must even go away
from you, that I may send the Spirit to you. And so accordingly he did, as the
Prophet David takes notice, Psalm. 68.18. He ascended upon high, and he received
gifts for men (gifts to bestow on men) that the Lord God might dwell among
them. A strange expression, he ascended from them to this end, that he might
remain and dwell among them. Yes he ascended from them in his body, that he
might dwell among them by his Spirit, or by those gifts which he received for
men, in the preceding words. Well then, you see he is departed from us, not to
forsake us, but to dwell among us. He has withdrawn the presence of his Body,
that he might dwell among us by the presence of his Spirit, According to that
sweet and precious promise made to his Disciples, when he was ready to depart
from them, Mat. 20.28. Behold I am with you always, etc.

3. Jesus Christ gone away, etc. that he might intercede for his people. Why
you will tell me so he might, and so he did, while he was resident in this
world, he offered up strong cries to God, and that not for himself alone, but
for his Church, and members too. Yea, the Chapter we are handling is the Prayer
of our Savior in the behalf of his people; so that he might have interceded
for them by vocal supplication, had he remained still in this world, and had he
never gone hence. Yea, but he could not then have interceded for them by
personal appearance, as he does now. And therefore he is gone to heaven, that
he may appear in the presence of God for us, Heb. 9.24. And is it not a comfort
to us to consider that we have such a choice and precious friend there? That we
have such an Advocate in Court continually at all times and in all causes? That
he is always by his Father in his Body and his humane Nature, wherein he
suffered for his people? You know he bare our sins in his body on the tree, and
in that crucified body, he appears in the presence of his Father. So that he
is at hand on all occasions, to show his Father all his wounds and all his
scars, all the prints, and all the marks of his bitter bloody sufferings. Oh
Father, may he say, (when there is any thing in agitation for his people, any
supplication for them, or any accusation laid against them) remember what I
have endured for them in this flesh of mine, what I have suffered for them, in
this body here before thee, look upon these wounds and scars, and for my sake
be gracious to them: do not deny them their Petitions, do not reject them for
their unallowed and bewailed imperfections.

4. Jesus Christ is gone away, etc. to make heaven ready for us, that so we may
be presently admitted when we come. And this our Savior Christ himself, who
best knows, yields as the reason of his departure from his Apostles and
Disciples; when he was about to leave them, says he, I go to prepare a place
for you, Joh. 14.2. when our Savior Christ entered heaven, and passed into the
immediate presence of his Father, he took possession of it in our name and
stead, and left it open after him to all his Members. He has in this respect
prepared it for us, that he has made it ready to receive us; And when we are
ready too, he will come and receive us to himself, that where he is, there may
we be also, as it is added in the fore-alleadged place, Joh. 14.3.

5. Jesus Christ is gone away, etc. that in the mean time till he take us up to
him to heaven personally, he may draw us up to heaven virtually. That till we
follow him in person, we may follow him in heart and in affection, that may set
them on the things that are above, where Christ also fits on the right hand of
God. If Christ were still among us in the body, and in a visible and fleshly
way, you are not able to imagine how much it would detain us here. We should
not care much to look higher then the place where Christ is. But now he is
departed from us into heaven this draws up our affections after him, who is so
infinitely dear and precious to us; for where the treasure is there will the
heart be also. This makes us to desire with the Apostle to be with him, to be
dissolved and to be with Christ: This makes us keep him company, though at a
distance: It makes us heavenly in our discourses, meditations, conversations,
as the Apostle was, Phil. 3.30. Our conversation is in heaven, from whence we
look for the Savior, even the Lord Jesus Christ.

JOHN. 17.11. And now I am no more in the world.


IS it so that Jesus Christ, as he is man, is gone away out of this etc. Then
let us not expect to see him here, till he return again from heaven. It Is true
he shall so come again from heaven, as the Apostles saw him going into heaven,
as you may see, Act. 1.11. He shall come down again in a remarkable, observable
and visible way, Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see
him, Apoc. 1.7. And in the mean time, my Beloved, the heavens must contain him,
or confine him as to his bodily or fleshly presence, he must be comprehended
there, Act. 3.21. I say then as our Savior Christ himself upon the like
occasion, Mat. 24.4. Take heed that no man deceive you, for many shall come in
my name, saying I am Christ. And though it seem so gross a business, that there
can be no danger in it, yet it is added presently, and they shall deceive many,
so that there may be need of this Caveat.

And therefore I beseech you, my Brethren, lay it up against the time of trial
come, if it ever come upon you; For there shall arise false Christ's, and false
Prophets, as the true Christ's tell us, Mat. 24.24. insomuch that if it were
possible they shall deceive the very Elect. And therefore if they say unto you,
Lo here is Christ, or there, believe them not. If they say he is in the Desert,
go not forth; he is in the secret chambers, believe it not, as Christ adds in
that place. If a seducing spirit tell you, Christ is in such, or such a place,
such or such a one is Christ (as some have been so grossly impudent in these
times) believe him not. If a Papist, or Ubiquitary tell you, Lo here is Christ,
lo, he is corporally present in the Sacrament, the bread is really and truly
changed into his body, believe him not. No, my Beloved, do you depend on that
which Christ himself, affirms in my Text, and now I am no more in the world,
as to my bodily and fleshly presence until you see him come again, as the
Apostles saw him go away (for every eye shall see him when he comes) be
confident he is not here in this world, I say as Christ in the fore-alleadged
place, Take heed, I have foretold you.

etc. and that he has withdrawn his corporal and fleshly presence from us?
Then let us make the more of the presence of his Spirit by which he is still
among us: If he be absent from us one way, it is good reason that we should the
more improve his presence with us in another. The chief comfort of the soul
consists in Communion with the Lord Christ, in having fellowship with him.
Now Christ, as he is man, is ascended into heaven, and so in that respect he is
no more in the world. We cannot yet go up to him, though we would gladly die
and be dissolved, that we might be with Christ, yet it cannot yet be. But which
way then shall we enjoy Communion with him? Why, my Beloved, because we are not
able to go up to him, the Spirit will do so much for us, that he will bring him
down to us; and thus though he be absent from us in the body, yet he is present
with us in the Spirit, and will be to the worlds end, according to his own
promise, Matthew. 28.20. Lo I am with you always to the end of the world; They
are the last words of the Chapter, and the last words of the Book, and there is
nothing added, but Amen, Let it be so: and sure it is a sweet close. Well then,
my Brethren, let our work and business be to consider with our selves, how we
may the more enjoy him in the Spirit, because we can no longer now enjoy him in
the body. How we may make the most of that we have. And I shall give you the
best advise that I am able, in this great business.



But you will ask me, Which way do we vex and grieve the Spirit? we would know
it, that so we might be careful to avoid it. I might speak much of this
Subject, and draw out my discourse into abundance of particulars; but I will
say it in a word; you grieve the Spirit when you deal unkindly with him any
away. This is the specal thing that grieves friends, when one of them deals
unkindely with another; and so it is between the Spirit and the soul; He comes
to us from Christ, in much love and much kindness to supply his absence from
us, and we are unkind to him, and this grieves him out of measure; Now we are
unkind to him especially two ways, and that is either when we slight him, or
resist him.

1. When we slight him, this is a very great unkindness, and that which friends
can very ill bear. He makes tenders of himself, and we take no notice of him;
he stands knocking at our doors, or rather Jesus Christ by him, and we let him
knock still; He would be entertained by us, and we will not entertain him; or
if we do, it is in such a careless, and in such a slight way, as if he were not
worthy to be looked upon: The evil spirit comes, and he has all the welcome
that the house can make, he finds it swept and garnished; the Holy Spirit
comes, and he is set behind doors. He offers holy motions to us, he stirs us up
to read, to pray, to humble and afflict our souls, to meditate of holy things,
and we neglect them, as if they were not worth the harkening to. He offers
sweet and precious comforts to us, and we forsake our own mercy; we hanker
after other pleasures and delights; the comforts of the Spirit will not relish
with us, our souls loath this light bread; we must have fleshly satisfactions
and refreshments, spiritual will not serve the turn: Brethren, this is no good
usage, the Holy Spirit grieves at this; He thinks (as well he may) he has
deserved better at our hands then this is: I have brought down Christ to them,
and so have comforted and cheered them (thinks he) and now they slight and
grieve me.

2. And as we deal unkindly with him when we slight him, so we deal more
unkindly with him, when we oppose him and resist him, when we set our selves
against him; I know the Spirit of grace is irresistible in some respect, but
yet ad luctam, he may be resisted, though he cannot ad victoriam; and so he is
sometimes even by the Lords own people. Even they have flesh within them, that
lusts against this Spirit, as the Apostle Paul speaks; That does not slight it,
and neglect it only, but lust against it. The Spirit will have this or that
done: no says the flesh, it shall not, the Spirit shall not be obeyed; the
Spirit will have such a lust cast out that is always crossing him, and
thwarting with him. No says the flesh, it shall not go. The Spirit would have
us set about such or such a holy duty; the flesh opposes and resists the
motion; and we are well content (it may be) at present that it should do so,
and so we sit still and let all alone, say the Spirit what he will. Brethren,
the Spirit takes it very ill to be thus used by us; it makes him sad, that
these whom he has done so much for, should make him such a recompense, and
that he should be wounded thus in the house of his friends: That they should
keep and favor fellows there, and make them houshold-guests, that go to thrust
him out of doors when he comes to lodge with them. I beseech you think upon it,
and give him better entertainment, that so he may take pleasure to be with you.

If you desire to make the most of the presence of your Savior in the to
heaven, and he will fetch you after him ere it be long, that where he is, there
may you be also. And in the mean time he has taken care of you, and he has
sent me down of purpose to be instead of him to you; and he would have you look
upon me, as if he himself were with you. Ah, my Beloved, should not our hearts
even leap within us, at such news as this? Does not the Spirit comfort us?
should it not be a ravishing, and a reviving thing to us, when he comes in
Christ's stead, and supplies Christ's room, and Christ's place?

Does not our Savior Christ himself propound it oftentimes to his Apostles and
Disciples for their comfort, when they were in heaviness, and when their hearts
were even about to break within them? come be not troubled, that I am about to
leave you, I will send you another Comforter that shall abide with you for
ever, Joh. 14.16. I have been a comfort to you I confess, but I will send you
another Comforter, one that shall comfort you as much as I have done, and one
that shall stick to you, and shall not leave you (as I am about to do) but
shall abide with you for ever; I will not leave you comfortless, as Christ adds
in the 18. verse. No, which way will you help it might they say? How can we but
be comfortless when Christ is gone? why, this way I will help it, might our
Savior say, I will come to you, and be with you by my Spirit: And though the
world can never see me while my body is withdrawn, and I am only present with
you by my Spirit, yet you have eyes to see me present with you this way; and
while you have this presence with you, I hope you have no reason to complain
that you are left without comfort: So that the Spirit is a comforter you see by
representing Christ to us; yea, it is a greater comfort that the Spirit is with
us, then if Christ himself were with us: It is a greater comfort that Christ is
present with us by his Spirit, then if he should be present with us by his
body; then the comfort were more narrow, but now it is more large; then the
comfort were more outward, but now it is more inward; then the comfort were
more fleshly; but now it is more spiritual, and therefore let us take in this
comfort.

When he ascended up on high, he received gifts for men, the gifts and graces
of the Spirit to bestow on men, that the Lord God might dwell among them, by
those gifts and those graces: And therefore the Apostle prays for the
Ephesians, that Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith, one of the
principal of those graces, Ephesians. 3.17. Well then, my Brethren, when Jesus
Christ makes tenders of himself to you, by these graces, let him come in and
dwell with you. Make the more of this way of his residence and habitation with
you, because you cannot have him in the other. When he offers any grace,
consider with your selves, Now Jesus Christ draws nigh to me, he that is above
in heaven, and with relation to his bodily and fleshly presence is no more in
this world, is in another way coming into my soul; And therefore do not shut
the doors against him, but bid him very welcome when he comes; when he offers
more knowledge, faith, love, hope, patience, let not these offers be refused:
Remember when you take in these, you take in Christ with them, in the presence
of his Spirit: So much as you enjoy of these, so much you enjoy of Christ; and
therefore seek and value every saving grace the more, and be the readier to
receive and entertain it, because it brings Christ with it.

Is it so, that Jesus Christ as he is man is gone away, etc. Then let us Arise,
let us go hence. Jesus Christ is gone, you hear, and why then do we stay behind
him? why do we tarry here, when Christ is gone? It Is true, we cannot go to him
in the body; but yet as Christ though he be absent from us in the body, yet he
is present with us by his Spirit: so we upon the other side, though we be
absent from him in the body, let us be present with him in the Spirit; and as
he comes from heaven to us by his Spirit, though his body stay there; so let us
go from earth to heaven to our Savior in our spirits, though our bodies stay
here.

But you will ask me, How may this be done, or how may we be present with our
Savior in our Spirits?

I Answer;

1. We may be present with him in the thoughts and meditations of the Spirit.
These are the proper actings of the soul, the inner man; and if our thoughts be
much upon him, we are in this respect much with him. And therefore I beseech
you, my Beloved, let us feed our selves continually with sweet and precious
thoughts of Jesus Christ; though we be here below, and must continue so till
Christ be pleased to take us to himself, yet let our minds ascend to heaven,
and let our thoughts and meditations be where Christ is. Oh let us think upon
him in the day and in the night; upon our beds when we are still, and have
nothing to distract us; then let our hearts be filled with sweet soliloquies,
with ravishing and transporting thoughts of Christ, that we may speak to him as
David did, Psalm. 104.34. How precious are the thoughts of thee, O Lord? How
great is the sum of them? It passes my Arithmetique to cast them up.

2. Let us be present with our Savior in the affections of the Spirit; let our
spirits cleave to him, though we be absent from him in the body: Where Jesus
Christ our treasure is, there let our hearts be also. That as Elisha said to
Gehazi once, Went not my heart with thee? when at that very time he was sitting
in his house, and Gehazi was abroad, 2 King. 5.26. So we may say to Jesus
Christ, though in another way; However we be absent from thee in the body, yet
is not our heart with thee? as the Apostle to the Thessalonians, We Brethren,
being taken from you in presence, not in heart, 1 These. 2.17. so we to Jesus
Christ; Oh Lord, though we be separated from thee in our bodies, we are not
separated from thee in our hearts; They are continually with thee, nor shall
they be divided from thee.

3. Let us be present with our Savior in the desires and anhelations of the
Spirit; let them be always mounting up where he is; he is gone, and in the mean
time till he come again to us, let us long to go to him. Oh let us build no
Tabernacles on the Tabor of this world, since our Savior is not here: But let
us look upon our selves as banished men, as the Apostle did, knowing that while
we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord, 2 Cor. 5.6, and so let
us groan earnestly to get to Christ as he did. Let us be always breathing,
gasping, fainting after Jesus Christ, and putting out our heads to see when he
will come and receive us to himself, that where he is, there may we be also.
And thus far of the first particular suggested in the words, the departure of
our Savior out of this lower world to the immediate presence of his Father;
And now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee.

The second follows now in order to be handled, and that is, his Disciples stay
behind him; But these are in the world, and are where they are like to be, and
where they are to tarry and remain when I am gone.

The world in which our Savior Christ's Apostles and Disciples were, and were
to stay, must be conceived to be the very same which Christ himself was now
about to leave, and from which he was ready to depart, viz. this lower world
beneath heaven; that from which he was to go, in that were his Disciples and
Apostles to remain. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the
world, the self same world in which I am to be no more.

But why is this alleged by our Savior to his Father here, that the Apostles
and Disciples were to stay in this world? apparently to show what cause he had
to mention them in his Petitions, and to commend them to the special care and
mercy and protection of his Father. As in the words that are immediately
annexed, Holy Father, keep them through thy own Name. q. d. I am even now about
to leave them, and to leave them in the world, and thou know what a place
the world is, how troublesome, unpleasing, and vexatious it has continually
been to my Disciples; and therefore I beseech thee, Father, keep them, have a
special eye upon them who are to stay behind me in such a place as this is.

So that the point apparently suggested here is this;

DOCTRINE. The world has always been, and is, an evil and uncomfortable place
to Christ's Disciples.
It is a sad and doleful place to live in, and hence our Savior seeemeth to
bewail the case of his Apostles and Disciples in my Text; These are in the
world, says he, as if he should have added, and that is but an ill place.

Now that I may the better clear it, and evince it to you, I shall show in what
respects the world is such an evil and uncomfortable place to Christ's Disciples.

It is in this respect an evil and uncomfortable place to Christ's Disciples,
John 15.19. If ye were of the world, the world would love its own, but because
ye are not of the world, therefore the world hates you. And hence it comes to
pass that it persues them, persecutes them, casts them out, creates them all
the trouble and vexation that it can: so that they are not like to have a quiet
hour almost in this world. Besides the evils and afflictions to which they are
exposed by the necessity of nature, as man is born to trouble as the sparks fly
upwards, Job 5.7. distempers and diseases in their bodies, loss of their
estates and friends and earthly comforts and the like, ungodly men come in with
their additions. The Church of Christ while she is here, is ill-seated, she
grows in an ill place, as he himself affirms of her, 2 Cant. 2. as the Lilly
among thorns, so is my Love among the daughters. She is environed and begirt
with them, so that she is annoyed and hurt and pierct on every side. She cannot
stir but one or other of her thorny neighbors has her by the sleeve. She
dwells in Mesech while she dwells in this world, and has her habitation in the
Tents of Kedar, in the midst of wicked men, so that she is beleaguered as it
were and hemmed about with those that hate her, and desire her ruin. This is
the state and the condition of the Saints while they are here, they are
continually vexed and troubled: So that no marvel though our Savior tells his
own Apostles, In the world you shall have tribulation. John 16.33. That is your
portion, as long as you remain here.

The world has always been an evil and uncomfortable place to worldly lusts,
Tit. 2.12. And our members that are upon the earth, Col. 3.5. because we cannot
possibly be rid of them, while we are here upon the earth, and while we live in
this world. The Apostle Paul compares himself and others of the Saints, to
earthen Vessels, 2 Cor. 4.7. And earthen vessels when they were legally
defiled, could not be made clean again, till they were broken all in pieces, as
you may see Lev. 11.33. So we, my brethen, are not to be fully cleansed, till
we be shivered all in pieces. We are not to be wholly rescued from the bondage
to corruption, till death translate is to another world. And then he that is
dead, says the Apostle, is free from sin, Romans 6.7. So that no marvel though
the world be a place of such disquiet and discomfort to the Saints; For how can
they be fully comfortable here, while they are always sinning against God. He
that has entered into rest indeed has ceased from his own works, as the
Apostle speaks, Heb. 4.10. Till then he cannot wholly cease from those that are
most properly his own works, but is in danger of offending God and falling into
sin continually, and so can have no rest here.

Nay, my beloved, no man knows how far the Lord may suffer him to fall in this
world. Though it be a certain truth that they that are elect, can never wholly
fall away from God, yet they may sin exceedingly, to the dishonor of the Lord,
the scandal of their brethren, and the irreparable wounding of their name,
while they have a day to live. And this they are in danger of, I mean of
falling fearfully, so long as they remain here. What deadly falls have many of
Gods worthies taken in their latter times! It is observable that David's first
ways are commended 2 Chronicles. 17.3. By which the Holy Ghost insinuates that his
last ways were not answerable to them. He (speaking of Jehosaphat) walked in
the first ways of his Father David. Indeed the latter ways of David were
blemished with extremity of sin and scandal. The like is also noted of Solomon,
1 King. 11.9. And Asa, 2 Chronicles. 16.10. And Jehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20.35. And how
then can the world but but be a doleful and uncomfortable place to Christ's
Disciples, where they are in such hazard? How can they but complain as Rebecca
sometimes did, though in another case, If I must still be troubled with my
lusts, and my corruptions, if I must still be overruled by them thus, what
good will continuance in the world do me?

etc. in this respect, that it is a place of banishment from Jesus Christ, from
him in whom their very souls delight. This makes it sad and grievous to them,
that they have not Christ with them. And this is that at which our Savior
aims in my text, I am no more in this world, but these are in the world.
There is the dolefulness of their condition, that they are to continue here
without me. Indeed we are debarred of the immediate presence of the Lord, while
we remain in this world. And therefore it is said expressly, 2 Cor. 5.6. That
whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. And is not
this a grievous thing to be kept from the enjoyment of such a one as Christ is?
Especially to him that knows him, and is well acquainted with him, and has
tasted of his sweetness? can you blame him if he be weary of the world, and if
it be a trouble to him to continue here? if be be willing to be absent from the
body, that so he may be present with the Lord? What holy heart can choose but
find a weariness in that place (let it be otherwise as pleasant as it will)
which keeps Christ and him asunder, and hinders him from the complete fruition
of his blessed Savior? Who would not gladly leave a place in which as long as
he continues Christ and he must be asunder?

etc. Then let it be a Caveat to us, not to cast (as we are very apt to do) on
too much joy and comfort here. Our manner is when things look a little well,
and when we have some present quiet and content, to promise great and
extraodinary matters to our selves; To sing a requiem to our souls, with the
rich man in the Gospel, take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry. Its true, the
men of this world may have some content and quietness and satisfaction here.
They have their portion here, and they receive their good things here. But as
for Christ's Disciples, they must look for no such matter; And therefore he
forewarns them when he is about to leave them what they are like to meet with
in this world, persecutions, tribulations and afflictions, all the injury, and
wrong, and malice, and despite, and evil usage that the world can pour upon
them. There remains a rest to the people of God, Heb. 4.9. their rest
remains for them, it is not to be had in this world.

And therefore it shall be their wisdom to provide for trouble, and not to look
the world should be a better place to them, then it has been to Christ's
Disciples that have gone before them. Oh my beloved, do not deceive your selves
in this particular, do not conceive the world will ever yield you any great
content or quietness, or satisfaction; for this is that which makes affliction
bitter when it comes. But when you live at greatest ease, when you enjoy the
greatest calm, when all things look as if you were confirmed and settled in a
prosperous state, as if your Mountain should not be removed, be sure that you
provide your selves for worse times, that so afflictions may not find you
unprepared when they come. How often shall you hear it from the mouths of many,
when any heavy cross is come upon them, Alas they never dreamt of this, they
never looked to see this doleful and unhappy day! the weaker and unwiser they.
Did they not know that they are here abiding in a vale of tears, and that the
world has always been an evil and uncomfortable place? And why should they
expect it should be better to them then it has been to others of the Saints,
who have perhaps exceeded them in holiness and grace? And therefore in the
midst of comfort and prosperity, let us be wisely casting on the day of trouble
and distress. Let us not reckon upon much felicity and sweetness here, for
certainly it is not to be had in this world.

Is it so that the world has always been and is an evil, etc. why then

Is it so that the world has always, etc. why then should Christ's that do
indeed belong to Jesus Christ, they have a great unwillingness to leave the
world. O what a cutting thing it is to many of them to think of coming forth
out of their earthly tabernacles! it is a burden to them that they cannot
bear. They say with Peter, it is good to be here, though their Savior be not
here, whereas they should say with Paul, It is better to be dissolved and to be
with Christ. Though Christ himself make mention of it as a sad and doleful
thing, that his Disciples were to stay in this world, they look upon it as a
doleful thing that they are to remove from it. And this it seems was Hazekias
case, when he heard that he must dye, he turned to the wall and wept sore, yea
he chattered like a Swallow, and mourned like a Dove. Our Savior Christ
forewarning Peter of his death, John 21.18. tells him, he should be carried
where he would not. By which it is apparent, that even in the blessed Martyrs
there may be a lothness to depart out of these earthly Tabernacles. Though the
righteous soul of Lot were vexed every day, as long as he remained in Sodom,
yet Oh how did he linger when the Lord would take him thence! Genesis 19.16. Even
so the Saints of God, though while they live in the Sodom of this world, they
have a sorry habitation, being continually vexed with the sins and with the
persecutions of ungodly men; yet are they not so unwilling to depart and leave
the world as they have cause to be. When Cyrus made a Proclamation to the Jews,
that whosoever was disposed might return out of the Land of his Captivity, it
is observed notwithstanding that none were willing to go out but those whose
Spirits God had raised up to go. So though this world be nothing but a Babylon
to us, the Land of our Captivity, an evil and a^ uncomfortable place, yet till
the Lord raise up our Spirits by his grace, we are loath to part with it, but
are desirous rather still to serve in this bondage. Now I beseech you my
beloved, you that have senses exercised, look about you; What do you see in
this world, why you should be loath to leave it? There is great reason why you
should be weary of it, why you should look upon it as a sad thing that you must
yet continue in a place where you must always sin and suffer; there is no
avoiding of it. But there is no such reason why you should be so unwilling to
depart out of it.

Eliah did when he fled from Jezabel, 1 Kings 19.4. And thus it is extremely
probable that Moses did, when he conceived his burden was too heavy for him,
Number. 1^.10, 15. For it is said he was displeased, and in that angry fit he said
to God, Wherefore ^^st thou afflicted me? I am not able to hear all this alone.
And if thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of hand; and do not
(...) for my wretchedness. And this is apparent Jonah did, who being crossed in a
punctilio in a point of honor, out of a p^^tish, fo^^sh, childish humor, will
go dye forsooth, God must take away his life. But if you do it out of reason,
and with submission to the will of God, that if he please to take you from a
place that is so sad and so uncomfortable to you, by reason of your daily
troubles, but especially and chiefly by reason of your sins against him, you
shall look upon it as a mercy, this is not to be condemned. When Joseph was in
prison, though he wanted nothing there, yet see how earnest and importunate he
was with Pharaohs Butler to help him to his liberty, Genesis 40.14. Think on me
when it shall be well with thee, and show me kindness, and help me out of this
house. Brethren, our heaven-born souls are but imprisoned in these earthly
Tabernacles; we have the manacles and fetters of our lusts about us. We cannot
walk abroad with liberty and freedom, and enlargement, etc. Oh let us cry to
Jesus Christ to show us kindness, and help us out of this house.

JOHN 17.11. Holy Father, keep through thine own Name, etc.


AND thus of the transition to our Saviors supplication in the behalf of his
Apostles and Disciples, consisting of a heap of grand considerations that
induced him to become a suitor for them to his Father.

Proceed we now to enter on the prayer which he makes for them. And here I
shall take notice only of these two things; The object of it, and the parts of
it.

The object of it, or the person whom he presents it to, is mentioned by his
title, and his attribute. His title here, you see, is Father, and his attribute
is holy. Holy Father; The sweetest title, and the choicest attribute. As for
the first of these, the title that begins the object of his supplication here,
is Father. So he styles him in the entrance of his Prayer, and the same phrase
he uses all along, as you shall see if you survey it, from the beginning to the
end. Indeed he gives him once the attribute of holy, as you have it in my Text
and once the attribute of righteous Father, at the 25. verse. But this is still
the appellation that he uses, and from whence he never varies. If he call him
any thing, he calls him Father; And in this notion he Considers him while he is
putting up his prayer to him. And therefore this you see, my Brethren, is the
first word that he uses when he sets himself to pray. Thus he begins his prayer
for himself in the first verse of the Chapter, Father, glorify thy Son: And
thus also he begins his prayer in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples in my
Text, Father, keep them through thy own Name: So that you see our Savior looks
upon him as a Father still, when he is pouring out his prayer to him, either
for himself, or others. And this would yield us matter of very good
consideration, but that it has been very largely handled heretofore. And
therefore I shall pass on from the title Father, unto the attribute our Savior
gives him here, and that is holy.

But wherefore does our Savior mention this rather then any other attribute of
God, on this occasion why might he not have said as well Almighty, or Eternal,
or Merciful, or Gracious Father? the special reason why he chooses this
Expression (as far as I conceive) cannot be clearly and undoubtedly resolved.
Indeed he prays for holiness for his Apostles and Disciples afterward, and
therefore it was congruous he should seek it of his Father under the notion of
a holy God, who is holy in himself, and who is also the hallower and sanctifier
of his people. But seeing there are diverse other things in his Petitions, this
does not seem of weight enough to bind him up to this Expression. Once, this is
clear and manifest that he picks out this attribute of God among the rest; and
whereas many other lay before him, he fixes upon this only; He comes to God in
Prayer by the name of Holy Father. The thing is evident, though the particular
consideration that induced him to it, be unknown. So that this observation we
may safely pitch upon.

DOCTRINE. As God it holy in himself, so Jesus Christ came to him as a holy
God, and looked upon him as a holy God, when he was making his Petitions to him.
The point you see, has two branches. First, God is holy in himself; Then
Jesus Christ came to him as a holy God, and looked upon him as a holy God, when
he was making his Petitions to him. I shall pursue them in their order.

Holy One (...), very often in the Scripture, to show that he excells in this
regard; so that however there be many others that are holy in a measure, yet he
is the Holy One; there is not one so holy as he is; And he is known in the Old
Testament by the name of the Holy One of Israel, which is ascribed to him more
then thirty times. The Seraphims which stood before the Throne, Isa. 6.3. cried
out three times a row, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts. And so
accordingly the Beasts that stand about the Throne, Apoc. 4.8. rest not day and
night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty. To show that God transcends
in holiness, he is superlative in this regard; for so thrice holy in some
Languages is most holy. To say the truth, this is the attribute that makes him
glorious; He is great in power, fearful in praises, but he is glorious in
holiness, Exodus 15.11. In this respect he is a Nonesuch; none to be compared
with him, none like him, not among men only, but among the Gods too. Who is
like to thee O Lord, among the gods, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises,
doing wonders! And hence he glories in his holiness, and swears by it. Even as
the great men of the world are wont to swear upon their honor, because it is
esteemed among them the most sacred and inviolable thing: So God you see, my
Brethren, swears by his holiness, Psalm. 29.35. Once have I sworn by my
holiness, says God: Once for all, and by my holiness, having no better or more
precious thing to swear by. Let me no longer be esteemed a holy God, and that I
would be very loath, then I inviolably keep the Covenant that I have made to
David in my truth.

So that you see the former member of the point is firm, God is holy in himself.

Now for the second branch, that Jesus Christ came to him as a holy Holy
Father; His thoughts are taken up it seems, more with the holiness of God, then
any other of his attributes, while he is pouring out his prayers to him.

I shall not undertake to show why he did so, he had his reasons in his own
breast, and in his own bosom. Only this is probable, that he did it that he
might be an Example, and a president to us, that we might learn of him to do as
he did; That when we are approaching to the Throne of Grace we might be very
much possessed with deep and serious contemplations of the holiness of God. I
shall add no more for proof, but hasten to the Application.

Now is it so, that even as God is holy in himself, so Jesus Christ came etc.
Then let us learn of Jesus Christ, how to behave our selves when we are making
our addresses to the Majesty of God, and pouring out prayers to him. We are
exhorted very often in the Scripture to be followers of Christ, and so to walk
and act as we have him for an Example. In all his imitable ways and actions,
his practice ought to be a rule to us. And therefore let us labor to conform
our selves to Jesus Christ in this particular, when we are drawing nigh to God
in prayer, let our thoughts be taken up with meditations of his holiness, let
them work much upon this attribute of his. Indeed the Saints of the Old
Testament, when they set God upon his Throne, and clothe him with his Majesty
and glory, (as they use to do in the beginnings of their prayers) do seem to
take more notice of other attributes of God, of his power, of his dreadfulness,
his righteousness, his faithfulness, his truth, his mercy, then his holiness.
But under the New Testament you know, God has been served and worshipped in a
more spiritual way, and here we have the High Priest of our profession Jesus
Christ, the most unparalleld and matchless pattern teaching us by his example,
to exercise our thoughts upon the holiness of God, when we are making our
approaches to him: And therefore when at any time we set our selves to pray,
let us endeavor to affect our selves, and to be taken up with deep
considerations of this attribute of his.

Let our most working apprehensions fix upon his holiness, and make a deep
impression of it in our hearts, that we may carry it along throughout, from the
beginning of our supplications to the end. It will be singularly useful to us
as I shall show you in a few particulars.

1. It will help exceedingly to frame our hearts to put them into such a
posture as the Lord delights in. It Is true, the meditation of other of the
attributes of God, has its work upon our spirits when we are drawing nigh unto
him: But this, me thinks, has somewhat proper and peculiar to it self further
and beyond the rest. It Is true, the apprehension of the Mercy of the Lord will
make us to have comfortable cheerful hearts; the apprehension of his truth and
faithfulness will make us to have bold courageous hearts; the apprehension of
his power and greatness will make us to have trembling and awful hearts: But
now the apprehension of his holiness, will make us to have holy hearts, that so
we may be like him whom we are making our addresses to: And holiness alone
comprises all that has been said, and much more; our cheerfulness, our
confidence, our reverence in prayer, are all but parts of holiness: A holy
frame of heart involves and comprehends in it all this, and more besides then
we are able to express. Indeed what ever God takes pleasure in, as to the
temper of his people when they are pouring out their prayers to him, is all
contained under holiness: Let them come with holy hearts, and all is well; and
this they shall the better do, if they consider with what an infinitely holy
God they have to do. Oh, this will raise the heart if it be duly weighed, to
such a sweet and precious frame, that it will be no longer earthly, it will be
fit to have Communion with the holy God: And therefore David presses the
Consideration of this attribute of God, in those whom he exhorts to worship
him, by way of preparation to that great business, Psalm. 99.9. Exalt the Lord
our God, and worship at his holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy.

2. The meditation of the holiness of God, will quicken us, and stir us up as
far as it is possible, to cleanse our selves from every sin when we are making
our approaches to him. For sin, my Brethren, is against his holiness, yea in
directest opposition: And therefore it is known by the name of filthiness and
uncleanness in the Scripture. Not only whoredom, and adultery, and fornication,
and sins of that kind are unclean, as they are called uncleanness in the
abstract, but sin is generally so, as you may see that place for instance, 2
Cor. 7.1. And hence it is, my Brethren, that it is so odious to the Lord, there
being nothing in the world so contrary and so opposite to him and to his
Nature, as sin is: No man in the world hates any thing, no man's heart abhors,
and loathes, and rises against any thing, as the Lords against sin: By reason of
his pureness and his holiness, he cannot brook it, Hab. 1.13. he is not able to
endure it: He seems, me thinks, to shut his eyes, and to cry out to his people,
Oh do not this abominable thing which I hate: And therefore when men will not
hold, but commit it, the infinitely holy God is vexed and troubled out of all
measure; so he is represented in the Scripture, Isa. 63.10. They rebelled
against him, says the Prophet, and they vexed his holy Spirit. Because he was
so holy, he was vexed the more at sin, which was so filthy.

And truly, my Beloved, if we did seriously consider the holiness of God when
we are about to pray, we would not dare to bring this filthy thing into his
presence, which is so contrary to this attribute of his, and consequently is so
odious and detestable to him. At least we would endeavor to the utmost of our
power to cleanse our selves from all the filthiness of flesh and spirit, to
wash our hands and hearts in Innocence (with holy David) and so to compass Gods
Atar, to offer up the Incense of our prayers to him. Oh we would shake and
quiver every joint to think of coming to the Holy God, in the midst of our
pollutions, unpurged and unhumbled for. We would consider with our selves, What
will the Lord say to me when he sees me in his presence, so defiled? How will
he look on such a filthy and abominable wretch as I am? how is it possible but
he should hide his eyes from me, when he perceives the hands that I spread
forth before him are so full of gore and blood? how can he choose but loath me
and abhor me? Do I expect to find favor in his eyes, and come before him with
that which he so abhors, as if I meant to vex him and provoke him? And
therefore if we ever look to speed with God in prayer, let us consider what a
holy God he is, and let us labor to be holy too. Let us be separate from the
remainder of the world (as he himself advises us, 2 Cor. 6 17.) and touch no
unclean thing, and then we have his promise, that he will receive us.

The meditation of the holiness of God, as it will be very useful to prepare
us, and to make us fit for prayer, so it will be very helpful to us, in the
parts of prayer, and that both in confession, and petition, and thanksgiving.

1. It will help to humble us in the confession of our sins. While we consider
that they are so filthy and unclean: and God upon the other side, whom we
confess them to, so holy. This cannot choose (if it be duly weighed) but shame
us wonderfully in the presence of the Lord, that we have been, and are so
filthy before such an holy God. Indeed we ought to be ashamed to commit
iniquity, being such an odious thing. The Lord has planted shame in man, to be
a bridle as it were to check him, to curb him, and to hold him in from sinful
courses. But if we have not been ashamed in the commission, we ought especially
to be ashamed in the confession, as God advises Israel, Be ashamed and
confounded for your own ways. Ezekiel. 36.2. To review our sins with shame, and
to cry out as Daniel does, Dan. 9.8. to us belongs confusion, etc. And Ezra
in his sad confession, Ezra 9.6. Oh my God, I blush (says he) and am ashamed
to lift up my face to thee. We should remember our evil ways and our doings
that are not good, and loath our selves for our abominations, Ezekiel. 36.30. we
should remember and be confounded, and never open our mouths any more because
of our shame. We should cast ashes on our heads, and rent our hearts, and cry
unclean unclean, Lev. 13.45. And there is no one thing that will confound and
shame us more then the consideration of the matchless purity and holiness of
God, whom by our sins we h^ve offended. Oh this will make us wonder that he
should endure such filthy persons in his presence!

2. As it will humble us in the confession of our sins, so it will encourage us
in our petitions for the cure of sin. As it will make us low in our
confessions, so it will make us high in our petitions. For how is sin, which is
uncleanness removed and cured in any of us, but by holiness? And is it not a
comfort to us when we are making our requests for holiness, that we are praying
to the Holy God? who is holy in himself, and who is the original of all the
holiness that is communicated to the Creature, who is the Sanctifier of his
people. Is it not comfortable that when we come to draw, that we are at the
Wellhead? If you observe, it is the great petition that our Savior has to
make in the behalf of his Apostles and Disciples, verse 17. Sanctify them with
thy truth, and this he prosecutes throughout. And therefore he begins his
prayer for them, Holy Father.

3. It will enlarge us in our thanksgivings to the Lord for holiness, when we
consider whence it came, and by whom it was bestowed. We shall see what cause
we have to praise the Lord, the Donor and Dispenser of it: As David intimates
in that memorable place to this purpose, Psalm. 97.12. Rejoice in the Lord, ye
righteous, (ye that are sanctified, ye that are holy,) and give thanks at the
remembrance of his Holiness. And yet again, Psalm. 30.4. Sing unto the Lord, O
ye Saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.

And thus far of the Object of our Saviors Prayer, as he is mentioned by his
title Father, and his attribute Holy, Holy Father. Proceed we now to enter on
the parts of it.

There are two things especially for which our Savior is a suitor to his
Father, in the behalf of his Apostles and Disciples; Preservation and
Sanctification. To these may be reduced and referred all that he desires for
them, preservation in my text, and onward to ver. 17. Sanctification in the
rest that follow.

First he desires preservation, Keep them through thy own name. And this
desire of his, he backs especially with two reasons, and they are weighty and
of great importance. First he would have his Father keep them now, because he
himself had kept them, and kept them very safe till now. While I was with them
in the world, says he, I kept them; and none of them is lost, but the Son of
perdition, but he who was designed to be lost. And now I come to thee, says
Christ, I am to be no more among them, and therefore I beseech thee now receive
them into thy special care and tuition. Here I resign them safe, and whole, and
sound to thee, I pray thee keep them henceforward as well as I have done to
this time. Secondly he would have his Father keep them, because they were in
such a dangerous place, where they were in great peril every day, and every
hour, where they were hated and maligned upon all hand, and that for the truths
sake. I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them, and so on. And
therefore I beseech thee Father, look to them, and keep them from the evil, as
it is added in the next verse. The evil of fault, and the evil of pain. Some
other things are interposed and touched incidentally, which shall be handled in
their places.

The thing desired, is first in order to be handled, before we pitch upon the
Arguments and Reasons with which our Savior presses and enforces this desire
of his; and this, as we have heard, is preservation. And here we have to be
considered two things: First the means by which our Savior here desires that
his Apostles and Disciples might be kept, and that is by or through his Fathers
name. Holy Father, keep through thy own name, those whom thou have given me.
And Secondly the end for which he prays they might be kept, that they may be
one as we are. So that you see the supplication of our Savior Christ is full,
he prays both for the Means and End, desires that the end might be attained
for them by the means.

Begin we with the means by which our Savior here desires that his Apostles
and Disciples might be kept, and that is through his Fathers name. Holy Father,
keep through thine own name, those whom thou have given me.

The name of God is generally taken for any thing that makes him known to men,
as one man is distinguished from another by his name: Particularly it imports
sometimes the attributes of God, now one and then another of them. Sometimes
his attribute of mercy, as that is called the name of God, Exodus 34.5, 6. The
Lord descended in a Cloud, and there proclaimed the name of God. And what was
that? The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, and long-suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth: Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity, transgression and sin. Sometimes his attribute of Justice, as that is
also called his name in the very same place, who will by no means clear the
guilty, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the children, and upon the
childrens children, unto the third and fourth generation. Sometimes his
attribute of Power is intimated by his name, as you may see that place for
instance, Psalm. 20.1. The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the name of the
God of Jacob defend thee, that is, the power of God defend thee. And this is
that by which our Savior prays, that his, Apostles and Disciples might be
kept, keep them through thy own name, that is; through thy own power. And so
accordingly the point to be observed, is this.

DOCTRINE. They that belong to Jesus Christ, as long at they remain in this
world, are kept by the Almighty power of God himself.
It is the prayer of our Savior for them, in my text you see, Holy Father,
keep them through thy own name, whom thou have given me, and therefore out of
question they are kept by that name, the almighty power of God. For Jesus
Christ is always heard in every thing for which he is a Suitor to his Father.

So that his people are as safe as the power of God can make them. They are
committed by him to his Fathers Custody, and he is able very well to keep that
which is committed to him, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 2 Timothy 1.12. And this is
clearly intimated in our Saviors speech, John 10.29. with reference to his
people, My Father which gave them me is greater then all. Greater, in what
regard? greater in place and dignity? No my beloved, greater in power and in
ability. And therefore it is added presently, and no man is able to pluck them
out of my Fathers hand. Many are willing, but none is able because his power is
infinitely greater then theirs is. So in another place, he shall be holden up,
Romans 14.4. he that is weak shall be held up; how so? For God is able to make
him stand. And Jude to the same purpose, he is able to keep us from falling,
verse 24. you see our preservation and support is still ascribed to the power
and ability of God, by which it is apparent what guards us, that we are kept,
and kept safe by that power. That of the Apostle Peter is express and full, so
that we need to add no more for confirmation, we are kept by the power of God,
says he, through faith unto salvation, 1 Pet. 1.5. The point is plain, They
that belong, etc.

Now to open this a little, because you do not see it in the full extent of it,
you must conceive that such as appertain to Jesus Christ, are kept by the
almighty power of God; Especially two ways. Either by the power of God in
them, or by the power of God for them. Either by the power of God assisting, or
by the power of God protecting. Either by the power of God within them
strengthening, or by the power of God without them guarding and defending. I
shall speak to these in order.

So weakened and enfeebled with his fail, that of himself he is able to do
nothing. And therefore God communicates his own transcendent power to such as
he intends to keep and to preserve, so far as they are capable of it. And thus
however they be weak in themselves, yet they are strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 6.10. He stands by and
strengthens them, 2 Timothy 4.17. And of this inward strengthening it is that the
Apostle speaks. Col. 1.11. Strengthened with all might according to his glorious
power, that is the power of God himself, which he gives in to his people, and
so corroborates them, makes them strong as Oaks, to bear the burden that is
laid upon them. For if you mark it, the Apostle says not, the power of God
bears our afflictions, resists and overcomes our temptations for us but we are
strengthened by his glorious power to both these. And God is able, says the
same Apostle, to do abundantly according to his power that works in us, Ephesians.
3.20. Observe it well; not his power that works for us, but his power that
works in us, and that makes us able. So that you see my brethren, it is an
infused thing, there goes forth power and virtue from the Lord to us, and
becomes inherent in us. Not as one friend may help another that is weak, with
an external succor and support, bearing his heavy burden for him, but giving
him ability himself to bear it. Even as a man that has been much enfeebled
with along sickness, and being now recovered in a measure, and his malignant
humors purged away, increases every day in strength: So we my Brethren,
having been enfeebled by the fall, God makes us sound and strong again, enables
us to do and suffer what he calls us to So that it is an inward and habitual
power that we partake, infused into the soul by God. And God in this respect is
strong in us. His power is perfected, declared to be perfect in our weakness.

Now my beloved, to follow this a little further, this glorious power of his
the Lord conveyeth into a Christians soul through Jesus Christ. The Father has
anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with power, as the Apostle Peter speaks,
Acts 10.38. And upon him the spirit of power does rest, as you have it in the
Prophet, Isa. 11.2. That so from him it might be given out to all his people.
He is the Conduit-pipe through which the spirit and the graces of it run,
obtaining them by virtue of his meritorious intercession from his Father, and
so conveying them to every member, as he (by reason of his near communion with
the manhood, being more deeply touched with the feeling of their wants)
observes their necessities to be. And so to every one of us is given grace;
and what is grace but power to do, and power to suffer? power to stand out, and
not to faint or yield in temptations or afflictions? Habitual grace is nothing
but the inward strengthening of the soul. To every one of us, I say is given
grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, Ephesians. 4.2. that is as he
is pleased to distribute.

And as this power proceeds originally from the Father by and through Jesus
Christ, so it is wrought immediately by the Holy Ghost. And hence the strength
infused into a Christians soul, is called the spirit of power, as you may see,
2 Timothy 1.7. Because indeed it is wrought in us by the spirit. That place of the
Apostle Paul is clear and full to this purpose, Ephesians. 3.16. where he desires
God in the behalf of that people, That he would grant them to be strengthened
with all might in the inner man. How so? Why by his spirit, as you may see in
that place. And thus you see both that, and how they that belong to Jesus
Christ, are kept by the almighty power of God in them.

They that belong to Jesus Christ, are also kept by the almighty Chron. 16 9.
The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth, to show himself
strong in the behalf of those whose hearts are perfect with him. And thus they
are preserved and kept, not only by the power of God strengthing and fortifying
them within, but also by the power of God protecting them, and helping them
without. And therefore it is said the name of the Lord, that is, the power of
the Lord is a strong Tower, the righteous runs to it and is safe, Prove.
18.10. Now security of any person that runs to a Tower for shelter, consists
not in his own strength, but in the strength of the Tower he runs to. A strong
Tower will protect a weak man; if he can get within it he is safe. And such a
stong Tower is the name, the power of God for the safeguard of his people. And
thus you see, he keeps us through his own name, his own power (according to our
Saviors prayer in my text) in a way of protection, by giving outward help and
succor, when we are in great danger. And this outward help he gives us two
ways.

First sometimes immediately by his own power: he helps us himself by his own
almighty arm, without the use of second causes, and then his arm is made bare.
He brings in succor to his people, as he made the world of nothing, and
therefore he is said in Scripture, to create it, as you may see that place for
instance, Isa. 65.18. Be ye glad and rejoice for ever, in that which I create,
for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. And thus he
kept his people in the fire, and in the water, and in the wilderness, where
there were no means at all of preservation, he did it merely by his own name.

Secondly, Sometimes he helps and keeps his people mediately by his power
communicated for that end to second causes: He raises instruments of their
delivery, and makes them able to relieve his people, as he did the Judges
often. And as it is observed of David, when God was pleased to use him for the
help of Israel, in a time of great distress, he furnished him with power
sufficient to go through with the business which he had designed him to. And
therefore says the Lord of that instrument of his, Psalm. 89.19, 20. I have
laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one chosen out of the people,
I have found David my servant, with my holy oil have I anointed him. Mighty he
is to help indeed, but it is because I have made him so, because I have laid
help upon him. And so he stirs up some continually to favor and relieve his
people; he makes the earth sometimes to help the woman, men that have nothing
else but earth in them; but still the power by which they help them is from
him. Their power is his power, and therefore when his people are preserved and
kept by them, they are kept by his name, as you have it in my text, and his
name must have the glory.

This shall suffice for explication of the point, they that belong to Jesus
Christ, are kept by the almighty power of God himself. And there is pregnant
reason for it. For first of all, no other power but his will keep them, and his
is every way sufficient. And secondly his power is mightily engaged to keep
them.

etc. because no other power but his will keep them. Kept they must be, and
none but this alone will do it. Alas the adversaries power that is against
them, is abundantly too strong for any power that can appear for them, but that
of the almighty God himself. The power of all the world, and all the strong
temptations that are in it, of pleasure, profit, honor, which is bent against
the Saints, you will conceive to be a great matter: Yet this is nothing in
comparison; this is the least part of their danger. What think you of the power
of all the lusts and the corruptions that are in them, that are continually
raging, warring? Who is able of himself to overpower and master these? What
think you of the power of Satan, and his black confederates, the power of
darkness, as it is styled in the Scripture? All the united strength of hell it
self? nothing but the power of heaven is able to out wrestle this: and they
that will struggle with it, had need be strengthened by that glorious power.

And hence our Savior places the security of his Disciples in this That they
are kept by him that is greater then all, John 10.29. That is, of greater
strength, as I have showed, so that none can pluck them out of his hand.

etc. because as no other power can keep them, so this is mightily engaged to
be for them: And that especially two ways, by the Sons prayer, and the Fathers
promise.

1. By the Sons prayer, and that must not be denied; For this we need to go no
further then my text; Holy Father keep them through thy own name. It was one of
the last requests he made when he was taking leave of this world, and therefore
certainly it was successful. Simon, Simon, says our Savior, Satan has
desired to winnow thee as wheat. But how is Peter kept now? Why by our Saviors
intercession, I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.

2. By the Fathers promise; he has engaged himself by promise to his people
many times, that his power shall be for them. The Covenant is a Constellation,
and a heap of promises, and he is a God in Covenant with them. So that as he
himself is theirs, so all his attributes are theirs too. His mercy to forgive
them, his justice to avenge them, his power to keep them.

The Romans were in league with many people, and if those people were in
danger, they were obliged in point of honor to defend them; And so they did
with as much diligence and care as they did their own City. Even thus it is
between the Lord and his people; he is in League and Covenant with them, and he
has undertaken their protection: And therefore if they be in any straight, he
is bound in point of honor to set his power on work to save them: And hence it
is that they are kept by the almighty power of God as long as they remain in
this world.

JOHN. 17.11. Keep them through thy own name, those whom thou have given.


IS it so that they that belong to Jesus Christ are kept, etc. Then in etc. but
in the name of God himself. We are kept by his power, and not our own. Our
blessed Savior in his prayer does not commit us to our selves, or any thing
that is in us, but to his Fathers own name, q. d. They cannot keep themselves
by any grace or strength that is within them or without them; and therefore I
beseech thee Father keep them through thy own name.

Well then, my brethren, let none of us be strong in his own strength, let us
not trust to our own abilities to support us and uphold us, to bear us up, and
to safeguard us, in temptations and afflictions. But let us know that grace
received and infused is not sufficient of it self to keep us, unless it be
corroborated and supported still with new assisting grace and strength from
God. And therefore he is said to keep us who are sanctified, that we fall not.
And we are kept not by inherent faith alone, but by the power of God through
faith unto salvation; 1 Pet. 1.4. And thus the Lord has ordered it, that
though we are endued with some degrees of grace and spiritual strength, we
might be held to a perpetual necessary firm dependence on him, notwithstanding:
And therefore when we rely on what we have received already, as if those
measures which we have inherent in our selves were strong enough to cope with a
temptation, the Lord will let us see how weak it is, by the withdrawing of his
succor from us. And this indeed was Peter's case, he was too bold and confident
upon the strength of his inherent grace, he thought no doubt his faith was so
impregnable, that no temptation could prevail so far against it, to cause him
to deny his Lord and Master; No, not the fear of death it self: and therefore
God deserted him in reference to his assisting grace, and so he fell in the
temptation; let us be wary of the same error, lest we find the same issue.

etc. This then should teach us to be bold and resolute in all cases, and not
to cast away our confidence, how desperate soever our condition be: I say as
the Prophet, Who is among you that fears the Lord, that walks in darkness
and can see no light? let him trust in the Name of the Lord, that is, the great
and Almighty power of God, and stay upon his God, Isa. 50.10. And this was that
which Abraham trusted in, and stayed himself upon, in such a case wherein there
was no likelihood, no probability at all to a humane apprehension. He staggered
not at the promise of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, Romans
4.20. And whereupon did he repose and rest his faith? on the Almighty power of
God, being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able to perform:
And so let us, my Brethren, rest on this power in all extremities and
streights, let us hide our selves in the Name of God, and let us not be dashed,
or permit our hearts to sink by reason of improbabilities, or want of means:
But let us seriously consider with our selves, that Jesus Christ has, as it
were, resigned us up into his Fathers hands, to be kept by his Name. And by
that name and power of his, let us be confident we shall be kept, what ever our
distresses be.

And more particularly according to the Explication of the point, let us be
confident, that if the danger be within, we shall be kept by the Almighty power
of God within us strengthening. If our danger be without, we shall be kept by
the Almighty power of God without us guarding and defending.

Job perhaps, Job 6.11. What is my strength that I should hope? Is my strength
the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? But man consider, is it thy
own strength that thou stand in? If it were so, I must confess thy case were
very sad indeed. But if thou be supported by the glorious power of an Almighty
God, why should thou doubt or be discouraged? Thus far perhaps (although with
many bitter pangs of fear) thou have past through the midst of thy temptations
and afflictions; thou have been shaken fearfully, but yet thou have not utterly
been overthrown and cast down, thou have not yet denied the Holy One, as Job
speaks; How have thou been supported hitherto, but by the Name of God himself?
was it not he that strengthened thee in those distresses, fears and agonies of
thine? and cannot he uphold thee still? Is Gods hand shortened, that he cannot
help? is any thing too hard for the Almighty?

Suppose thy burden shall be heavier yet, as that it may be is thy great fear:
Is that any thing to God? is not his glorious Name sufficient to keep and bear
thee up, as well in heavier as in higher trials, that has kept thee hitherto
(it must be yielded) or else thou had been overwhelmed in thy troubles? And
what now will it be too weak, if thou be brought to greater exigencies and
distresses? Indeed if thou were kept by creature-strength, either within thee,
or without thee, the difference were very great, I must confess, between a
heavy and a light affliction. But now it matters not at all; it is all one to
the Almighty power of God, that will be sufficient for thee, let the case be
what it will, or what it can. It may be thou conceivest, that if thy burden
were a little heavier, if but a grain or two were added to it, thou were gone,
thou must be overlaid, and crushed, and broken instantly. Oh but remember that
of the Apostle, Ephesians. 3.16. God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we can either ask or think, according to the power that works in us. He
is able by that power whereby he has sustained thee so long, to strengthen and
support thee still; what ever further trial come upon thee, beyond all that
thou can ask, yea beyond all that thou can think, he is able to do more
then thou art able to imagine.

If our danger be without, from enemies that set against us with all The Lord
is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me. I must confess that we
are apt to cast away our confidence, and to despair of succor and deliverance.
It was the Prophet David's weakness, as himself acknowledges, Psalm. 77.10. But
if we fail at any time with holy David, let us come off as he did; let us
ingenuously confess that it is our infirmity, and let us call to mind with him,
the right hand of the most High. Oh let us think upon the great and the
Almighty power of God; for that is intimated by his right hand, which commonly
is stronger then the left, and so let us uphold our fainting spirits, when they
are apt to sink within us. As Luther did, when one supposed that the Emperor
with all his Forces would fall upon the Duke of Savoy, who was the great
Protector of the Protestants at that time: And where, says he, will Luther be
then? That holy man returned this sudden answer, Aut in Coelo, aut sub Coelo,
either in Heaven, or under Heaven, because he expected protection from Heaven
as long as he lived, and knew he should have possession of heaven when ever he
died.

But may we rest upon it then, that we shall have protection from the Name of
God in all dangers? That he will keep us through his own Name?

To this I answer, if we belong to Jesus Christ, we may be sure we shall be
kept by it, either one way or other, either from the outward danger, or else
from the inward damage; either in a way of deliverance, or if not so, in a way
of assistance. The Prayer of our Intercessor in my text shall not be in all
respects in vain for us. It Is true, the Lord may leave us sometimes in the
outward danger, and may not keep us by his power for us; But then he will be
sure to keep us by his power in us. If he take not off our burden, he will
give us strength to bear it. And if he do not keep us from the evil, he will
keep us in the evil. One way or other we shall have succor from his great
Name. If it be not a shield to cover us and protect us, it shall be an arm to
underprop us and support us; underneath us shall be the everlasting arms, as
Moses speaks. Deuteronomy. 33 27. So that here is comfort still, in any trial or
temptation: If we be not delivered from it, we shall be enabled to bear it.

And here lest any of you should look on this as cold comfort. I must tell you
that it is a richer mercy to be enabled by the power of God within, to bear a
trial, then to be rescued and delivered from it by his power without; this
latter we desire most; but out of doubt the first is best for us: For do but
weigh it, my Beloved, outward help and outward succor and deliverance by the
power of God, is but a common mercy, of which the worst of men partake; yea of
which the beasts partake; in this respect he saves man and beast. How often
does the Lord put forth his power to rescue the vilest of the sons of men, from
outward danger; yea the vilest of the creatures! But he supports and
strengthens by his grace within, none but his own people. It is the proper and
peculiar privilege of those that are given up to Jesus Christ, to be kept this
way by the Name of God. Paul was importunate you know, to be delivered from the
Messenger of Satan that was sent to buffet him; For this thing* besought the
Lord thrice, that is might depart from me, 2 Cor. 12.8. He could not speed in
that Petition, he could not get deliverance, but he got support, which was
abundantly the richest mercy: And when did God ever say to an ungodly wretch in
such a case, as he does there to the Apostle Paul, My grace is sufficient for
thee, and my strength is perfected in weakness? He has very often given wicked
men sufficient outward succor, but he never gave them yet sufficient inward
grace; this is peculiar to his own people.

etc. Then when you are in any danger or distress, have recourse to this power.
Seek not so much to outward means and second helps, but say as David, Psalm.
68.11. Lord, do thou give us help from trouble: If you be kept, it must be by
the Name of God, to which you are committed by your Savior. He says not to
the Father in my text, Let them be kept by humane strength, by worldly succors
and accomodations; But keep them through thy own Name: And therefore when you
know not what to do, run to this Tower, the Name of God: Seek the Lord, and
seek his strength, as the Psalmist counsels you, Psalm. 105.4. For you must
know, my Brethren, it is not enough to make us capable of having sure
protection in the name and power of God, that we belong to Jesus Christ; No, we
may be so careless of our duty, that we may be deserted for the present of the
power of God, and may not have it to relieve us and defend us: And this is that
which Ezra intimates, Ezra 8.22. The hand, that is, the power of God, is upon
all them for good that seek him: If we neglect him, we may miss of favor from
him, as Asa did in such a case, the Lord would not put forth his power to heal
him, because he sought not to the Lord, but to Physicians: And therefore when
we are in danger any way, from within, or from without, let us lift up our
hearts and cry to God, with the afflicted Church, Psalm. 80.2. Stir up thy
strength and come and save us; and let us see that we do it in the way that God
would have us, and that we seek him in the due order, as the expression is, 1 Chronicles. 15.13. And to this end I shall give you some directions.

1. Seek him early while he may be found of you; you must not run through all
your other holds, and fly to all your other stays, and when you find that you
are disappointed in them all, then go to hide your selves, and not till then in
this Name, when you know not what to do; for then perhaps the Lord will shut
the doors against you, and leave you helpless in your troubles: And truly it is
just with God, that they that seek not to him, till they be driven out of all
their shifts, should be neglected by him when they come.

2. Humbly, or else the Name of God will not be a refuge to you. You may come
to him for shelter, but he will not receive you into his protection; No, he
will resist the proud, he will keep them out of doors, he will leave them
succourless in their distresses. They were so proud, and their stomachs were so
high in prosperous times, that they looked not after God, God was not in all
their thoughts, Psalm. 10.4. And therefore now when they come running to him,
because they know not how to live without him, the Lord will look as little
after them; let them do what they will for God. But on the other side, my
Brethren, there are many sweet and precious promises of mercy and protection to
the humble person.

3. Heartily, with all the heart, and all the soul, for so is the direction,
Deuteronomy. 4.29. you must not seek him feignedly with half a heart, with a divided
spirit; for if you do, you may expect such entertainment as is threatened to
those dissembling wretches mentioned Prove. 1.28. They shall call upon me, but I
will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me; and you
may look to speed as hollow-hearted Israel did, Hos. 5.6 They shall go with
their flocks and with their herds to seek the Lord, and shall not find him.

4. Reformedly, in a way of Reformation, and amendment. It is in vain for a
profane and filthy person, so continuing, to run to the name of God in his
distresses; He must not look for any shelter there, he shall not come near God,
for God will be sanctified in all that come near him. He that cannot endure to
look upon profaneness with his eye, will not shroud it with his wing. But to the
Saints, to holy persons, the Lord will be a sure refuge; The Name of the Lord
is a strong Tower, Prove. 18.10. the righteous runs into it and is safe.

5. Constantly, we must hold out in seeking God, and that not only in the act,
but also in the power and vigor of it: And as the Spouse, though she were long
delaid, and though she met with many difficulties and disheartnings; yet she
continued seeking still: She followed Christ through every lane and every
street, and never left till she had found him: So we must follow God, my
Brethren, through all the Ordinances, all the means, all the ways that lead to
him, and though he fly away and hide himself, we must not faint, and languish,
but continue and hold out, till we have found him.

etc. If then we have been kept in any dangers or distresses, let us look up to
this Name: let us not rest in the external means, and secondary causes of our
succor or deliverance; but let us look beyond them and above them, to the name
of God. Let us see this Name of his engraven and enstampt upon them, as the
Prophet counsels, Mich. 6.9. The man of wisdom shall see thy Name; and when we
see it, let us acknowledge it to be the fountain of our help, the cause of all
our succor and deliverance: Let us confess that God (according to our Saviors
Prayer in my Text) has kept us through his own Name. And let his Name have all
the glory.

And thus far of the means by which our Savior here desires, that his
Disciples and Apostles might be kept, his Fathers Name; Holy Father, keep
through thy own Name those whom thou have given me.

The End for which he prays they might be kept, comes now in order to be
handled, That they may be one as we are.

A strange expression, if we look upon it with a superficial view. That the
Disciples of our Savior may be one in some respects, is very easy to imagine:
But how they should be one, as God the Father and the Son are one, who are so
one that they are the very same, the same essence, (for so the union is
identical) though they be not the same person, this is hard to be conceived;
yet this is the expression of our Savior to his Father in my Text, That they
be one as we are.

Which that you may the better understand, my Brethren, you must know that [as]
in Scripture is many times a note of similitude, and not of equality. It
intimates the truth and the reality of that wherein the likeness stands, and
not the measure and degree. I might give many instances wherein that particle
is so taken; you may see that place for instance, Luke 6.36. Be you merciful,
as your Father also is merciful. It is impossible for any man to be merciful as
God, if you look to the degree: For as the Heavens are higher then the Earth,
so are his ways and thoughts above ours, in reference to mercy and forgiveness:
But yet we may be merciful as God is, really and truly so, although not so in
such a measure. We may be merciful as he, though not as merciful as he. So in
my Text our Savior prays in the behalf of his Apostles and Disciples to his
Father, that they may be one (says he) as we are, as thee and I are. The
meaning is not, that they may be one as nearly (that is impossible) but that
they may be one as truly as we are. Not that they may be one by a substantial
and identical, but by a real union as we are. Not that they many be one in all
respects, but that they may be one in some respects as we are.

But you will ask me then, what those respects are? I will show you in a Word.
God and Christ, the Father and the Son are two persons. And yet though they be
two persons, they agree in every thing Though they be diverse, yet they never
differ; No, they do continually mind the same things, they will and nill the
same things, they love and hate the same things: There is an unexpressible
agreement and consent between them every way; even so it is exceedingly to be
desired, that the Disciples of our Savior, though they be many persons, yet
they may be of one mind, and one heart, and one affection: That they may agree
in all things, that there may be no difference, no divisions, no jars, no
strifes, no rents among them; but that they may in this respect be one, even as
the Father and Son are.

And this, you see, is the great thing for which our Savior is a suitor to his
Father, in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples, that they might be at unity
among themselves. This is the end for which he prays they may be kept by the
Almighty power of God himself, that as far as it is possible for men to be,
they may be one, even as the Father and the Son are one; Holy Father keep them
through thy own Name, that they may be one as we are. So that the Observation
clearly intimated here is this.

DOCTRINE. It is a matter of wondrous difficulty, and of high Concernment, for
Christ's Disciples to be at nearest unity among themselves.
Both these particulars, I take it, are apparently suggested in the words,
First, that it is a point of wondrous difficulty; Then that it is a point of
high concernment, that all that are bestowed on Jesus Christ, should (as far as
men may be) be one, as God and Christ are one. I shall clear them in order,
from the Text and other Scriptures.

It is a matter of wondrous difficulty, even for Christ's Disciples to be Holy
Father keep them through thy own Name, that they may be one as we are. He prays
his Father to set his own Almighty power about it, to effect it; by which he
intimates that it is no easy matter. It is observable how the Apostle
struggles for it, 2 Thessalonians. 3.16. The God of peace himself give you peace always
by all means: So that there is no possibility of having peace, unless God
himself bestow it; unless he bow the heavens and come down, and work it in the
hearts of his people. It is beyond the power of any creature to keep the Saints
themselves in unity and peace, unless God himself do it. And so the Apostle
having well considered the wondrous difficulty of it, turns himself to God. Now
the God of peace himself give it. q. d. I see no other means will do it, and
therefore I beseech thee Lord, thou who art the God of peace, do thou thy self
make unity among thy people. That phrase of the Apostle is notable to this
purpose. Ephesians. 4.3. Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace. (...), The word there used, imports the doing of a thing with much
intention, with inward care, and outward diligence, and labor, and endeavor
to the very utmost. The setting of ones self about a business strenuously, and
with all his might, which would not need, if it were an easy matter.
Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. So that you
see it is a matter of wondrous difficulty, for Christ's Disciples to be at
nearest unity among themselves.

But you will ask me how it should be so? A man would think it should be no
hard matter for Christ's Disciples to be all one: for them who are so closely
and so nearly joined so many ways, and by so many ties; who are all one body,
one spirit, who have all one Head, one God, one Lord, one faith, one hope, one
baptism, to be at unity among themselves. Indeed it is a task almost
insuperable to have peace with all the world. To say the truth, it is
impossible, as the Apostle Paul insinuates in his exhortation, Romans 12.18. If
it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men. But to
live peaceably with Saints and fellow members, for such to be at unity among
themselves, what difficulty should there be in this! How comes it to pass that
this is such a hard matter, That the almighty power of God himself is called
down from heaven about it?

Why my beloved there be many things even in the Saints and Christ's Disciples,
that make the matter difficult. And I shall draw them all that I shall mention,
to these two heads. There are some things in which they are too much alike, and
there are other things in which they differ overmuch; and both of them do make
it wonderfully hard even for the Saints to be at unity among themselves.

Paul observes in the Corinthians, 1 Epist. 3.3. Whereas there is among you
strife, and envy, and division, are you not carnal? Is it not very manifest,
that there is much corruption, and much flesh in you? And is not this the cause
of these dissentions? It may be you are apt to think it to be otherwise, but
mark what the Apostle says James 4.1. From whence come wars and fightings
among you? Whence do they come? Why hence they come, will some men say; I am so
troubled and molested, I am so grossly injured and abused that I cannot live in
peace. Never was any man so basely used, so vilely dealt withal, as I have
been, and that by those that are accounted honest men. And hence it is that I
cannot be at rest: No, no, says the Apostle, thou art much deceived, I had as
lief thou had said nothing. It is the wickedness and the corruption that is
in thee, that is the true and real cause of all this. From hence come wars and
fightings among you, even from your lusts that war in your members. And I will
show you what those lusts are, which make it so extremely hard, even for the
Saints to be at unity among themselves.

1. They are too proud: The wise man tells us this has a stroke in all
quarrels, Prove. 13.10. And if in all, then in the quarrels of the Saints too.
And truly my beloved, were it not for this, there would not be such endless and
implacable contentions about matters civil, as there are sometimes between
those that are Christ's Disciples. It is their pride that neither side will
stoop or bow; both are high and both are stiff, and so there can no possible
accommodation or accord be made between them.

And were it not for pride there would not be such endless and implacable
contentions about matters doctrinal. This is the true and real cause, why men
will not endure to be gainsaid and crossed in their opinion, but presently they
fret and fume and fall into an everlasting strife about words, whereof comes
envy, railing, evil surmisings, and perverse disputings, as the Apostle shows,
1 Timothy 6.4, 5. Now would you have the character of such a person as carries
matters in this fashion? says the Apostle, he is proud, knowing nothing. He
thinks himself a very knowing man, but this is nothing but his pride. And hence
it comes to pass that men are so unalterable in their fancies and conceits,
that having once asserted them and owned them, they will not lay them down
again (no though they be convinced) for their honors sake. Remarkable and
exemplary is the resolution and humility of Job in such a case, Job 6.24. Teach
me and I will hold my peace, and make me know wherein I have erred.

In which ingenuous disposition, did those who differ in their judgments
constantly agree, they might be quickly brought, if not wherein they err, to
change their minds, yet to allay them so, with humility and love, that they
should never break forth into bitterness against their brethren. But while they
have such a deal of pride among them (while they are so alike in this regard)
it is impossible they should agree together.

2. It is impossible, even for the Saints, to be in all respects at unity among
themselves, because as they are too proud, so they are too selfish. Herein they
are too near alike easily to close together. This is indeed the great
makebate, it has a special hand, and is a violent eager stickler in all the
quarrels that are driven to and fro among men. From hence it is that men are so
inflexible and so extremly stiff in their opinions, that they will abate
nothing, nor yield to nothing for quietness and peace sake; it is their love,
not to the truth, but to themselves, it is their self-love. And so it is the
selfishness of men that makes them so intent upon their own things that they
will have the utmost in a business, and urge extremity of right, and will not
part with any thing almost to purchase precious peace. It is because they love
themselves too well, and because there is so much of this even in the Saints,
this makes it wonderfully hard for them to be at unity among themselves.

I might name other things in which they are too much alike to close so nearly
as they should, but these shall serve for that branch.



1. They are of diverse tempers and of diverse constitutions, and those will
hardly close together. As diverse strings, unless they be of purpose tuned
alike, will not be unisons, they will not be of one sound: They may be very
sweet apart, but if you strike them all together, they will make a discord; So
it is in this case: some of the Saints are of a melancholy sad, and others of a
sanguine cheerful temper. The melancholy does not like the cheerful, the
cheerful does not like the melancholy Saint. Or if he like him in his
judgment, he cares not to converse with him, or not so much at least as with
another, because he does not suit his disposition. One Saint by reason of his
constitution, (which grace does never wholly alter,) is very hot and very
active: Another Saint is very cold, and very dull. Those two being so unlike,
will continually be disliking one another, and it may be censuring: so that it
will be very hard to bring them to so near a close as should be between Christ's
Disciples.

2. They are of diverse stations and conditions, in the world, and in the
Church. Some are high, and some are low, some are rich and some are poor. The
high are ready to despise the low, the low are ready to envy the high. The rich
are ready to despise the poor; the poor, etc. One of them will be apt on all
occasions to be perking at the other. And this will make a perfect union
extremly difficult between them.

3. They are of diverse interests by reason of their callings, judgments,
opinions, habitations, outward substance and estates; and differences will
arise and grow from all these; So that it will be hard to keep them quiet, and
to hold them close together. Meum and tuum, is the rise of all dissentions; it
is this same thine and mine, that sets men, yea the best men sometimes
together by the Ears. This is my right, and that is thine; this is my place,
and that is thine; this is my opinion, and that is thine. If the interest were
one, they would be one; but sure it cannot be avoided, but it will be so
different, in this world; there will be differences now and then even among the
Saints themselves. It was upon the point of interest that Abraham and Lot fell
out though they were both good men. And it is noted by the Holy Ghost himself
as one especial reason of the strange consent and harmony that was among the
primitive Saints, because their interest was one, Acts 4.32. The multitude of
them that believed were of one heart and of one soul. How so? They had all
things common, neither said any of them that any of the things which he
possessed were his own. The state of those times, my brethren, both admitted
and required it, and we see the fruit of it. It is not so, and to say truth,
cannot be so in our days, and therefore it is much the harder to keep perfect
unity among the Saints. When once they shall come all to be in one place, in
one condition, of one opinion, and to have one inheritance, and so to have one
common interest among them all, when God shall be all in all, there will be no
more divisions; but in the mean time it is impossible they should in every
thing agree together.

4. They are of diverse qualifications. There are diversities of gifts, says
the Apostle, 1 Cor. 12.4. Now these I must acknowledge are intended to beget
union. But yet by accident, by reason of remainders of corruption in the
Saints, they cause divisions. While some are of more judgment, and other some
of more affection; while some are of greater, and other some of meaner gifts,
here are occasions (I say not causes, but occasions) of dissension, while some
are supercilious, and the other envious. As soon as the Apostle lays down the
distinction between strong and weak Christians, Romans 14.1. there follows
disputation and division presently. The one despises, and the other judges. The
strong Christian is ready upon all occasions to despise the weak. The weak
Christian is apt upon the other side to judge the strong. The strong slights,
and the weak censures, and so there is a woeful breach of unity and peace among
them.

By these things it is evident my brethren, that it is a matter of wondrous
difficulty even for Christ's Disciples to be at unity among themselves. And
truly if we seriously consider how like they are in regard of some corruptions,
and how different they are in Constitutions, Stations, Interests and
Qualifications, we will not wonder that the Almighty power of God is invocated
by our Savior to effect it.

JOHN 17.11. That they may be one as we are.


AND this for clearing of the former member of the point, It is a matter of
wondrous difficulty for Christ's Disciples to be at nearest unity among
themselves. Proceed we to the clearing of the second.

It is a matter of high concernment for Christ's disciples to be at nearest that
they might be one: And prays his Father to effect it, by his own almighty
power. Holy Father, keep them through thy own name, that they may be one as we
are. By which he shows that as it is a hard thing, so it is a choice thing, a
thing of special consequence, worthy the putting forth of the almighty power of
God about it.

And therefore the Apostle Paul would have us strain our selves to get it and
preserve it, to do as much as lies in us, even to the utmost, as much as it is
possible for men to do, to set all our abilities and all our faculties a work
to procure and keep peace, Romans 12.18. And to this end having persuaded the
Colossians to adorn themselves with mercy, kindness humbleness of mind, and
with the habits and the acts of meekness and long-suffering as with glorious
robes, he persuades them at length to put on love, which is an uniting grace,
a bond of perfectness, the uppermost garment (as it were) and so the largest,
fairest, richest, and most precious piece of the new clothing of a Christian:
And therefore puts a special Emphasis upon his exhortation to it; Above all
these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness: which will unite
and join you perfectly together. They are not graces of the meanest rank that
Paul commends to the Colossians in the former verses. Yet having run through
all of them, and being come at length to this uniting grace, as to the top and
chief of all, he sets the finger of a hand against it, to point it out as
supereminent: Above all these things put on charity which is the bond of
perfectness. How is the Prophet David carried out beyond himself, and even
ravished in the contemplation of this precious unity among the Saints, and
therefore calls others to join in admiration with him. Psalm. 133.1. Behold
how good and pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
The admirable and surpassing excellency of it, is represented to us in the
Scripture many ways. If God will promise any special mercy to the Church, it
shall be this, Isa. 11.6. The Wolf and Lamb shall dwell together, the Leopard
shall lie down with the Kid, and the Lion with the Calf, and a little Child
shall lead them. And great shall be the peace of thy Children, Isa, 54.13. If
he will give them any choice blessing, The Lord will bless his people with
peace, Psalm. 29.11. If we will pray for any favor worth striving for, it must
be for Church-peace and unity among the Saints. Pray ye for the peace of
Jerusalem, Psalm 112.7. that it may be like a City that is at unity within it
self. And therefore the Apostle is so earnest for it, as it were for life and
death, The God of peace give you peace always, and by all means. By which he
intimates that as it is a thing of wondrous difficulty, so of great
concernment for Christ's Disciples to be at unity among themselves. And this I
shall lay open to you in a few paaticulars.

Acts 4.32. that they were of one heart and one soul. And that which follows
presently, is this, great grace was upon them all. It seems they were in the
increasing and the thriving hand by this means. Where there is great peace
among the Saints, there is great grace too. Much union brings forth much
communion, and much Communion brings forth much holiness and much grace. When
Christians walk on in a sweet and amicable way, they cannot choose but grow
exceedingly. But when dissentions make them to reserve themselves, this is
extremely prejudicial to the increase in holiness which otherwise would be
among them. That place of the Apostle is very notable to this purpose, Col. 2,
19. And not holding the head from which all the body by joints, and bands
having nourishment ministered and knit together, increases with the increase of
God; being knit together it makes increase.

It is of great concernment as to the growth of Christ's Disciples, Paul to this
purpose, Col. 2.2. That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in
love: There is the mercy wished them, that their hearts might be comforted; and
then the requisite condition and qualification to make them capable of this
comfort, being knit together in love. Much union, much comfort; little union,
little comfort; no union, no comfort: Indeed it is a pleasant thing for
Brethren to live together in unity; but it is a bitter thing to live in discord
and dissension; it eats out all the joy and comfort of a man, and fills his
spirit with vexation: When men are over head and ears in Controversies and
Contentions, especially Saints with Saints, it makes their lives unquiet and
uncomfortable to them: You shall observe how restless such men are, who are
embroyled in troubles, and who are deep in Controversies and Contentions; they
cannot eat, they cannot sleep, they cannot talk, they can do nothing cheerfully
and freely, they are so clogged and cumbred with their own impatient and
perplexed thoughts: Listen to them, and you shall hear them ever and anon
complaining that every one is vexing them, and troubling and molesting them, so
that they cannot live in peace. Their wives, their children, and their servants
cannot be at quiet for them, they are in such a pelting humor upon every light
occasion: Their families are like the middle Region of the air, continually
rent and torn with storms and thunders and tempestuous stirs, which rise at
first of a thing of nothing, a thin invisible fume drawn up from the earth: And
all this comes to pass by the dissentions that they have with others, which
takes away the meekness of their spirits, and with that their quiet too: And
therefore you shall find a meek and quiet spirit joined together, and made the
chief adorning of a Christian, 1 Pet. 2.4. Whose adorning let it be that of the
hidden man of the heart, even the adorning of a meek and quiet spirit: It it be
meek, it will be quiet; if enraged, it will be troubled; it will be like the
Sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

It is of so great concernment, as to the growth and comfort of Christ's etc. so
also to their keeping in with God himself; they must have peace among
themselves, if they will have peace with God; if they be angry one with
another, God will be angry with them all. If he come in and find his family
together by the ears, he will be in a rage too. Manasseh against Ephraim, and
Ephraim against Manasseh, and both of them against Judah; and all these you
must know, my Brethren, were within the verge and compass of the Church: There
were rents and breaches there, they were divided into parties, they were up one
against another. And what follows? For all this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still, Isa. 9.21. And is not this our case? Are
not the members of the body mystical of Christ divided into factions, that
struggle one against another (like the twins in Rebecca's womb) that bite, and
even devour one another? And this I make no question, is one cause among the
rest why the wrath of the Lord is not turned away. Our wrath is not turned
away, and therefore his wrath is not turned way neither. Our hands are
stretched out one against another still, and therefore his hand is stretched
out against us all. We are not yet appeased one toward another, and therefore
he is not appeased toward us: We are making and continuing breaches still
among our selves, and God is making and continuing breaches still among us: He
deals with us just as we deal with one another; With the froward, says the
Psalmist, thou will show thy self froward, Psalm. 18.25. We are unjustly froward
to our Brethren, and he is justly froward toward us. As we have done, so God
has requited us; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah,
says the Lord, by taking vengeance, I will take vengeance upon Edom, Ezekiel.
25.12. Edom and Judah, you must know, my Brethren, came out of the same loins;
And truly till we cease from taking our revenge, as we have opportunity, upon
our Brethren, God will not cease from taking vengeance upon us.

Roman gave his sons upon his deathbed) they will not be so quickly broken;
they will find that their union is their strength and preservation; If they
stand fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the
Gospel, they need to be in nothing terrified by their Adversaries, as the
Apostle shows, Phil. 1.27. Indeed they will be terrible and dreadful to them.
When Gods Jerusalem is as a City that is compacted within it self, when she is
at unity, then she is terrible as an Army of Banners, Cant. 6.4.

It Is true indeed, that Christ's Disciples as they have the best friends, so
they have the worst enemies. But let them be as many and as mighty as they
will, if they could but hold together, and if they were resolved as Joab and
his brother Abishai, If they be too strong for thee, I will come and help thee;
and if they be too strong for me, thou shall come and help me: If either of us
be distressed, the other shall come in with all his succor; If thy
corruptions, or temptations, or afflictions be too strong for thee, I will come
and help thee with my Councels, with my Comforts, with my Prayers, and thou
shall deal accordingly with me. If it were thus among the Saints, they would be
impregnable against all the Oppositions that Earth or Hell could make against
them. They are built up to a spiritual house, and if they were cemented well
together, no storms would overthrow them. That is worth our observation, which
Ferus writes of the Primitive Saints. They were wont, says he, to meet
together very often, and there to lay open their several temptations, their
means of resistance, their gracious success and happy deliverance: And so to
council, and to comfort, and to encourage, and confirm and strengthen one
another. As for my own part, I take very much comfort in the great unity that
is to be observed among Gods people here in this place, and in the frequent
meetings which they have together. It is a joyful thing to see their love in
the truth, and I am confident they get much strength by it: while others who
reserve themselves, refrain communion each with other, withhold their Counsels,
Comforts, Prayers, are very weak by this means, and easy to be overcome. And
therefore one observes very well, upon this prayer of our Savior in my text,
that his Disciples are preserved and kept by unity. Holy Father, keep them
through thy own name, and to this end let them be one as we are. As if the only
way to keep them and preserve them, were to make them one among themselves.

It is of great concernment to the furtherance of the Gospel that etc. The work
of Jesus Christ is not to be carried on with much knocking. As in the building
of the old material Temple, there were no Axes, no Hammers, nor any other Tool
heard, 1 Kings 6.7. so in the building of the Church of Christ, and carrying on
the business of the Gospel, the less stir, the less noise, the more progress.
If there were not such knocking as we have heard too much of late, this
Church-work would go on the faster, and come the sooner to perfection. In the
building of Babel, you know there was a confusion, etc. so the work was wholly
hindered and laid by, Genesis 11.7. The workmen understood not one another
language, and so were forced to desist from that business. And truly there is a
confusion happened in another sort of building in this land, the building not of
Babel, but of Sion, which is a very great impediment to that work. The workmen
understand not one another, and by this means the time which should be spent in
laying is spent in knocking of the stones and timber, in making and upholding
parties, and in maintaining endless controversies and disputes which tend to
strife and variance and not a whit to edification. The Axe and Hammer is in
use, but the Trowell is laid by. And verily, my brethren, while it so
continues, the work of Christ will never go forward. Religion will not thrive
among us as it should, till all that appertain to Christ, come to a nearer
unity and a more firm accord among themselves. And therefore it is very notable
that when our Savior Christ ascended, and meant to propagate the Gospel, to
amplify and to enlarge the Church, He gave some Apostles and so on for the
perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we
all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, etc. Mark my beloved, when we come to unity, then the work
goes on amain, then we thrive apace in knowledge, then we grow to perfectness,
then the Church of Christ goes up: But till the stones be joined close together
there will be no edifying, that is in English, no building.

It is of great concernment to the entertainment of Christ Jesus in etc. If
they be always wrangling and contending, others will not come among them. No,
they will stand off from them, and from the Master which they serve, if he be
owned and followed by none but by a company of quarrelsome contentious people.
And hence is that Petition of our Savior in behalf of his Apostles and
Disciples at ver. 23. of this Chapter. In my text he prays the Father that
they may be one even as the Father and himself were one. And in the cited
verse, he renews the same petition, that they may all be one, as thou Father
art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us. And why so? That the
world may believe that thou have sent me. q. d. If my disciples be not one
among themselves, if they be rent asunder by a spirit of division, the world
will not believe that I came forth from thee who art the God of love and peace,
that thou have sent me down into the world to be a Mediator, and a Peacemaker,
to make up all the breaches and the differences between thee and thy people.
They will look strangely upon me, and I shall never bring them to believe, that
I am come on such an errand as this is. And therefore I beseech thee Father,
that I may be entertained under the Notion of a Mediator, that the world may
believe that thou have sent me on this business, do thou take care that my
Disciples may be at unity among themselves.

etc. Among the eight beatitudes, the third in order falls to the meek and
peaceable, Mat. 5.5. And if the meek and peaceable be blessed, then certainly
the fierce and furious are accursed. It is a pretty observation of Ludolphus
out of Bid on that place, Heaven is promised to the pure, blessed are the pure
in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven: Earth is promised to the meek,
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth; So there remains
nothing else but hell for the contentious and impure spirit. Ah my beloved,
would we avoid the curse, and would we be partakers of the blessing? would we
have heaven and earth to be our portion? Let us be pure and peaceable, let us
make and keep peace, and so the blessing of the God of peace will be upon us.
And therefore David having broken out into a passionate and pithy commendation
of the unity of brethren, behold how good and pleasant a thing it is for
brethren to dwell together in unity! it is like precious ointment, etc. Psalm.
133.2. he shuts up all with this conclusion, There the Lord commanded the
blessing and life for evermore. There where brethren live in unity and love,
there the Lord commands blessing; it cannot choose but come upon them, for the
Lord himself commands it. And this blessing it is life, and this life it is
eternal. There the Lord commanded the blessing and life for evevermore.

keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. You hear it is a matter of
great concernment, and therefore it is worth the striving for: It is a matter
of wondrous difficulty, and therefore is not to be had without striving. Now I
beseech you my beloved, let us set our selves to this business. There was never
greater need them now, when God has suffered such a spirit of division to
possess his own people. And when the members of the body mystical of Christ
are of so many minds, and draw so many ways, and have sometimes such vehement
and hot contentions and disputes among themselves: So that the Church had never
greater reason to cry out, as Rebecca sometimes did, when she had parties in
her womb, If it be so, why am I thus? and therefore we had need to put some
spirit into this persuasion, and you had need to put some spirit into your
endeavors, and if the Lord will put his spirit of unity and peace into us, it
may subdue and overcome the spirit of division which reigns too much abroad in
these times. But you will ask me, How may we attain this? and what are we to
do, that we may come to be at nearest unity among our selves? Though it be very
difficult as you have heard, it may be compassed notwithstanding by the
blessing of the Lord, upon the use of these directions.

You must endeavor to the utmost of your power to mortify those lusts If
there were no lusts within, there would be no wars without, as the Apostle
James insinuates. And verily if our corruptions, as pride, and passion, and
self-love, were thoroughly mortified within, those outward provocations would
never cause such woeful rents and such implacable contentions as they do. And
therefore let us set our selves effectually and thoroughly to subdue these lusts
of ours; though they be naturally as dear and near as the members of our
bodies, let us pursue them to the very death, as the Apostle Paul advises, Col.
3.5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth. Let nothing
satisfy us, till we have the life of them. Let us not wound them only, but
destroy them; that ought to be the Christians aim, as the Apostle shows, Romans
6.6. that the body of sin may be destroyed. Our lusts seek our life, either
they must dye or we. And they seek Gods life, Omne peccatum est Deicidium. And
they have sought Christ's life, and brought him to a shameful and accursed
death. And therefore let us seek their lives too, and never satisfy our selves
till we have the blood of them. Let it be far from any of us to nourish or to
cherish our corruptions, to favor them, or to deal kindly with them any way.
No let us dash this Babylonish brood against the stones, let us show them no
mercy; And when they are once destroyed, our differences and debates will end
with them.

As we must mortify our carnal lusts, so we must chase away out of Abraham
that when the fowls came down upon his sacrifice, he drove them away, Genesis
15.11. so when such foul and noisome thoughts as these offer to pitch upon our
heart, let them have no footing there; no, let us watch them narrowly, that we
may suddenly chase them away: And let us follow the advice of the Apostle, Heb.
10.24. Let us consider one another to provoke to love. Let us consider that,
and think on that which may stir us up to love; let our imaginations work and
dwell upon such thoughts as these, and not those which lead on to Contestation
and Dissension.

mark them that cause divisions, and offenses, and avoid them, Romans 16.17. Mark
them, not to join with them, but to decline them and avoid them. Brethren, you
shall observe that there are some of all hands whose work it is to make peace,
and to compose breaches. And there are others on the other side who are as
busy as it is possible for men to be, to make rents and separations and
divisions. And it is our unhappiness that these dividers work goes onward
faster then the others. Indeed it is an easy thing for one to rip faster then
two or three can sow. Alas how many are there in these wrangling times, who are
continually meddling, and who make this their work and business, to see how they
can set men one against another; how they can blow the coals of discord, and
kindle them into a flame; how they can heighten the contention and the
animosity that is too high already among those who are in name at least and in
profession Christ's Disciples. Now I beseech you my beloved, as the Apostle does
the Romans in the fore-alledged Scripture, Mark these men; let them be of what
side they will, if they be of this spirit, do you set a mark upon them, that
you may know them another time, and that you decline them, and avoid them. It
is a bitter imprecation of the Apostle Paul's, Gal. 2.12. I wish they were cut
off that trouble you. Truly I wish that they who are the troublers of our Sions
peace, the main and unwearied sticklers in our Church-divisions, who would not
have things come to an accord and a friendly composition (for ends which they
best know) I wish they were cut off from all communion with the Saints: That
all the people of the Lord on all sides would look aloof upon them, and avoid
them as the pests of this Nation. And certainly if all men would avoid them,
and keep off from them, they would have the less work, and we should have the
less trouble.

For that is gentle, peaceable, easy to be be entreated, full of mercy and
good fruits. Contentious persons may applaud their own wits, and think
themselves extremely wise and subtle, in making good the quarrels which they
undertake: But what says the Apostle? ver. 14. if you have bitter strife and
envy in your hearts, glory not, lie not against the truth. This wisdom
descends not from above; And if it come not from above, from heaven, it
comes from beneath, from earth, from hell, it is earthly, sensual, devilish.
What ever men's abilities, or parts, or reaches are, if they be always
quarrelling and falling out, as many are, it is apparent that they want this
blessed wisdom. To say the truth, my brethren, it is want of wit that is much
of the cause of all this: Anger rests in the bosom of fools; and so the wise
man tells us, that every fool will be meddling, Prove. 20.3. It is an honor for a
man to cease from strife, but every fool will be meddling. It is the property of
every fool to do so.

You have a sort of men, my Brethren, that will be at the end of every quarrel.
If there be any difference or strife near them, they will be sure to have a
finger in the pie, they will never sit out. Now would you know what kind of men
these are? They are a company of fools, a company of busy meddling fools; and
were it not for such Idiots we might have much more peace then we have at this
day. If men were ballasted with wisdom, they would not be a tempering and a
making variance as they do: And if indignities and wrongs were offered to them,
they would easily digest them, and possess their souls in patience; and
therefore let us labor after this wisdom, and let us follow the advice and
counsel of our Savior, Mar. 9 50. Have salt in your selves, and have peace one
with another. First let us have the salt of wisdom in our selves, and then we
shall have unity and peace with others.

If we would be one, and if we would have peace the blessing, we must Paul
exhorts, Col. 3.15. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts. Brethren, when
you are any way exasperated or provoked, so that your passions rise or swell,
and are ready to break out into intemperate words or actions, when you are
hardly able to contain your selves, then let the ruling power of peace appear,
by stilling and composing all again: And let this holy disposition be so strong
within you, that neither pride, nor wrath, nor malice, nor any other lust may
be able to control it. There is a story that the Swevians had a Law among
them, that in a fray where swords were drawn, if a woman or a child did cry but
peace a great way of, they were bound to end the quarrel, or else he died that
struck the next stroke after peace was named. So if your passions be at war
within you, (to use the Apostles phrase) if they be up in arms, and you do but
think of peace, or any friend persuade to peace, let all be hushed and quiet
presently, and let that passion die, let it be crucified that dares to stir
when peace is mentioned: So let the peace of God rule in our hearts, let it
triumph in all, and over all our provocations, that we may bear them all with
an unmoved and undisturbed spirit.

Let us be earnest with the Lord in prayer, that he would make and the God of
peace; It is a name that he delights in, and therefore it is often used; and
he is styled the God of peace, not only because he is formally so (if this
expression be allowable) for Primum bonum summae Trinitatis est indivisio, but
because he is effectively so, because he is the Author of peace, as the Apostle
speaks, 1 Cor. 14.33. For God is not the Author of confusion, but of peace: And
he makes wars to cease, says David, Psalm. 46.11. he breaks the bow, and cuts
the spear asunder: And therefore the Apostle begs this peace of God in such a
manner, as if it were to be obtained no where else, and our Savior of his
Father in my Text, Holy Father, keep them through thy own Name, that they may
be one as we are.

Well then, my Brethren, let us go to him for this blessing, let us not only
strive for peace in the use of other means which have been formerly proposed,
but let us pray for peace; so especially for the peace of Jerusalem: Oh let us
pray, and pray hard for Church peace, for peace among Christ's Disciples, among
Gods own people, for there he uses to bestow it: My peace I leave with you,
says our Savior, and God will give his people the blessing of peace. Oh let
us beg him now in these divided distracted times, to give this blessing to his
own people; that though Jerusalem be not at unity, neither can be at unity with
those that are without, yet she may be at unity with those that are within,
that she may be at unity within her self; and to this end let us desire
especially two things.

1. That God himself would govern all his own people, that he would rule them,
and command them so, that they may not break the peace. By nature we are all of
us inclined to divisions, destruction and unhappiness is in our ways, and the
way of peace we have not known: And if the Lord himself should not appease
those raging and tempestuous waves that are so apt to rise and swell, if he
should not extinguish and put out the fire that is so apt to kindle in the
hearts of men, yea of the best men, the world would flame with nothing else but
discords and dissentions: And therefore let us earnestly beseech the Lord to do
the work which none but he alone is able to perform. To rule and overruled the
hearts (at least of his own people) and by his Kingly power to master and keep
down those raging passions that are so apt to rise and swell, to the
disturbance of the Churches peace; when his household are together by the ears,
when they are in a tumult and combustion, let us entreat him to come in among
them, and he will quickly make them still as Lambs, all will be hushed and quiet
presently. It is his own most gracious promise, and therefore we may urge it
with the greater confidence, that he will make the Wolf and Lamb to dwell
together, etc. That he will quiet the tempestuous hearts of men, and make them
tame: So that how furious and how fierce soever they were formerly by nature,
yet they shall be so meek and gentle now, that they shall yield to any
admonition or persuasion, yea a little child shall lead them, Isa. 11.6. How
weak soever he may seem to be, he shall prevail and overruled them.

2. That God himself would teach all his own people, and the effect of this
would be a strange agreement, and a sweet accord among them, even beyond
imagination. One cause why they that are professed, and are it may be real
Saints, agree no better; and why there are such breaches, and such rents among
them, is, because they are not all of them, at least in all things, taught of
God. Some of them in some particulars at least, are taught of men, and not of
God, and other some are taught of God. And they that are taught of men, will
not agree with them that are taught of God; and they that are taught of God,
cannot agree with them that are taught of men; and so they are continually
wrangling, and contending, and contradicting one another, they can never fadge
together: But now when God shall come to teach them all in every thing, then
they shall think and speak the same things, then they shall quarrel and contest
no more, but they shall all of them agree, and live in unity and love together.

And therefore let us earnestly beseech the Lord to do this, to leave his
children now no longer out at School, but speedily to fetch them home, and to
teach them all himself. That being all of one School, under one chief Master,
and some Ushers under him, they may be all taught one way, and so may all agree
together. We have the promise of the Lord for this too, Isa. 54.13. Oh let us
urge it hard upon him in such times as these are; All thy children shall be
taught of God, and mark what follows presently, great shall be the peace of thy
children; Here is a time for such a promise to be put in suit, and therefore
let us press it home, let us take no nay. Let the Lord have no rest, till he
teach all his own children, and then he will have a great School, and we shall
have great peace.

JOHN 17.12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name.


THE words now read are part of the Lords Prayer, not of the Lords Prayer which
he taught us, but as I showed in the beginning, of the Lords Prayer which he
made for us: Not that which he propounded to us as our pattern, but that which
he presented for us as our privilege; at least for his Apostles and Disciples,
and in them for us also. In which have been considered two things: The matter
of it, and the reasons of it. The things which Christ desires in the behalf of
his Apostles and Disciples: And then the arguments with which he presses and
enforces his desire: The matter of it, or the thing which he desires in the
behalf of his Apostles and Disciples, is preservation; Holy Father, keep them
through thy own Name, which we have fully ended and dispatched.

And now we are arrived at the reasons of the prayer, the arguments with which
our Savior presses and enforces this desire of his. Whereof the first is
taken from his own effectual preservation of them, during the time that he had
been among them; and therefore he would have his Father keep them now, because
he himself had kept them very safe till now. While I was with them in the
world, says he, I kept them, and none of them is lost, but the son of
perdition: And now I am even ready to withdraw my corporal and fleshly presence
from them, and therefore I beseech thee Father, take them into thy tuition,
receive them into thy especial custody and care; I had them from thee, and here
I render and resign them up again safe, and whole, and sound to thee; I pray
thee Father, keep them henceforward, as well as I have done to this day.

This passage of our Savior has two considerable things in it; a general
profession, and a particular exception. First you have here a general
profession, that he had safely and entirely kept all those that were bestowed
upon him by his Father; While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy
Name, those that thou gave me I kept, and none of them is lost. And then you
have a particular exception of Judas, who here is styled, (...), the son of
perdition. An Hebrew manner of expression, that is, perditioni destinatus and
devotus, as Beza reads it, destinated and devoted to perdition. None of them is
lost, but the son of perdition, who was designed and appointed to destruction.
He is lost, and he only.

In the general profession and assertion of our Savior, I shall desire you to
take notice with me of these three things, viz. whom he kept; in whose behalf
he kept them; and how long he kept them. First whom he kept; those who were
bestowed upon him by the donation of the Father, only those, and all those;
Those whom thou gave me I kept, and none of them is lost: Secondly, in whose
behalf he kept them, in his Fathers. As he had them from the Father, so he kept
them as the Fathers, I kept them in thy Name, says he; though they were made
over to him by a deed of gift, he kept them notwithstanding in his Fathers
Name, and not in his own. He keep them as his Fathers goods, and as a servant
in the business to his Father. As if he should have told the world, they are my
Fathers, and for him I keep them. Thirdly, how long he kept them; while I was
with them in the world, says he; He speaks as if he were in heaven already,
because the time of his departure was at hand, he was as good as gone into the
bosom of the Father, while I was with them in the world I kept them.

But did he keep them no longer then he was with them in the world? No, my
Beloved, no longer in the way that he intends: No longer as God manifested in
the flesh, and in a visible, and corporal, and fleshly way; and therefore in
the verse before which I have finished, he yields them up to the tuition of the
Godhead, and adds this immediately; while I was with them (conceive it
corporally) in the world, I kept them in thy Name, those whom thou gave me I
kept, and none of them is lost. You see, my Brethren, here are many weighty
things, if I should undertake to handle all, I should over-grasp my self, and
let fall more then I should hold. And therefore I shall fasten on the first
particular observed, which though it be not first in place, and in the order of
the words, yet it is first in reason to be handled: Whom our Savior kept; and
they, as you have heard, were those that were bestowed upon him by the Father;
Those that thou gave me I kept, and none of them is lost; and here the
Observation lies before us.

DOCTRINE. Christ has been wont to keep them safe who are bestowed upon him by
the Father.
Those whom the Father gives him, he is sure to keep: So he did when he was
conversant upon the earth among them; and so he does now he is resident in
heaven; for he is yesterday and to day the same for ever: Then indeed he kept
them one way, and now he keeps them in another; then he was with them to
preserve them in a visible and fleshly way, by the presence of his body: Now he
is with them to preserve them in an invisible and spiritual way, by the
presence of his Spirit: And however in the verse immediately before my Text he
resigns them to the Father, as if he meant to take no further charge of them;
that Father, my Beloved, is the whole Godhead, of which himself as God makes
one Person: For Jesus Christ as he is man, is not the Son of the first Person
of the Godhead only, but of all the three Persons. And in my text he speaks as
man, for he speaks in prayer here; and prayer is part of worship, and God does
not worship God. And therefore when as man he yields up his Disciples to the
Father (his Manhood being now to be withdrawn) he yields them to the whole
Godhead, which is the Father of the Son as he is Man: And consequently Jesus
Christ as Man, resigns them to himself as God as well as to the other two
Persons; and so in that capacity he keeps them to this day, and will do so to
the worlds end. Still you see he keeps them safe who are bestowed upon him by
the Father.

Now to evince and clear the point, I shall dispatch these two things. First I
shall show you that, and how, the Father gives men to the Son. And then in what
respects, and how far forth the Son preserves and keeps them safe who are thus
bestowed upon him by the Father.

As for the first of these, that some there are, some certain choice selected
Those whom thou gave me I kept; Indeed, originally all the world, and all the
people in it, appertain to God; his they are, for he made them: So that if
Jesus Christ, as he is Man, have any people, it must be by donation from the
Father: And therefore he is often said to give men to the Son in the Scripture,
especially in the New Testament, according to his promise in the old, Psalm.
2.7. Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance. And yet
you must not apprehend that he does so bestow them on the Son, that he does
utterly divest himself of all his interest, and wholly pass away his right in
them: No, my Beloved, the Father gives men to the Son, just as a great
Sheep-master gives his sheep unto his Shepherd, to keep them and to look to
them, to save them and answer them again: So Jesus Christ who is the servant of
the Father (as he calls him, Isa. 42.1. Behold my servant) receives men from
him under that notion: And therefore he is said to keep them in his Fathers
Name, and as his Fathers goods, as a shepherd and a servant to his Father. It
is his own expression in my Text, While I was with them in the world, I kept
them in thy Name; those whom thou gave me I kept, and none of them is lost.
They are his, you see, to keep them, not to sell them or to lose them; for he
is always answerable for them to the Father. Now in this sense the Father gives
men to the Son, especially in two respects.

1. In the first place he gives men to him by election; and this he does from
everlasting; He picks out such a certain company of men, and bestows them upon
Christ in regard of the decree. There are a people for thee, says the Father
to the Son: So many thou shall have among the Jews; and if that be not
sufficient, thou shall have as many more as thou will ask among the Gentiles;
Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, Psalm. 2.7.
And therefore God is said to choose us in the Son, Ephesians. 1.4. as in our Head,
and as by designation members of his body. He does not choose us first, and
then after choose Christ; No, he chooses Christ first; he is his first and
chief Elect, and then he chooses as in him, appoints us to belong to him. It
were unnatural the feet should first come out of the womb before the head; and
therefore God observes this method; First Christ the Head comes forth out of
the womb of his Decree, and then the others follow. First he electeth Christ to
be the head of his Church, and then he electeth us to be the members of his
body. And hence perhaps is that expression of our Saviors to the Father, a
body have thou prepared me, or fitted me, as it is rendered in the Margent, Heb.
10.5. viz. in thy Predestination: Thou have not only chosen me to be a Head,
but in and by the fame decree thou have prepared a body for me. Thou have
culled out a certain company of men, whom thou have preordained to belong to
me, whom thou have chosen as it were in me, and whom thou have bestowed upon me
to be members of my body.

2. And as the Father gives men to the Son by the decree, so more expressly by
the execution and accomplishment of the decree; as he bestows men on our
Savior by election, so further yet by actual union and incorporation. In the
first he assigns them, in the second he delivers them, when he takes those very
men whom he had preordained from everlasting and puts them into Jesus Christ:
There, says the Father, are the members which I appointed for thee from
Eternity. So that now the Son receives them, and has them in his own
possession. And he may say to God the Father as the Prophet does, Here am I,
and the people which thou have given me. Thine they were says Jesus Christ,
Joh. 17.6. They have been thine, I must acknowledge; but now the property is
altered, they are mine. Why, which way came you by them? might the Father say.
The Son replies, By thy donation, by thy own free gift; Thine they were, and
thou have given them to me, as it is added in the next words. So then you see,
my Brethren, that, and how, the Father gives men to the Son.

it, I shall show you in the first place, how far our Savior does not keep
them, who are thus bestowed upon him. And in the second place how far he does.

1. He does not keep them that they do not suffer. Though Christ be with his
own Disciples in the Ship, there may be a storm upon it, and a very dangerous
one. They may be under heavy trials, and afflictions, both within them and
without them. Christ may expose them, though they be his own, to bitter
persecutions in the world; yea to the greatest miseries that humane cruelties
can devise to inflict. And when in the extremity of their distresses they run
crying to him, as they are about to sink, Master save us we perish, Christ may
seem to be asleep, to wink at all this misery of theirs, to make as if he knew
nothing, and as if he did not dream of the intolerable pressures that lie upon
his poor people.

2. He does not keep them that they do not sin; and that most grievously,
sometimes with hideous circumstantial aggravations. How fearfully have many
fallen, who have indeed belonged to Jesus Christ? We have very sad examples of
it in the Scripture. Peter was one of them, concerning whom our Savior tells
his Father in my text, those whom thou gave me I kept. And indeed he prayed
for Peter in a special manner, that his faith might never fail, that it might
not wholly fail, so as to be quite lost and utterly extinct in him. Yet after
this you know, he fearfully sinned notwithstanding, so as in some respect to
deny the Lord that bought him; and that in a stupendous way, with dreadful
Oaths, yea, more then so, with bitter curses, and direful imprecations too.
What sin almost may not Christ leave a person to commit, whom he has taken
into his tuition?

3. But now my brethren, in the third place, though Christ do not keep them
that they do not suffer, and though he do not keep them that they do not sin,
who are bestowed upon him by his Father, both by election and incorporation:
yet he does keep them that they do not perish. All that are so bestowed upon
him he keeps so that they are not lost, as you have it in my text, Those whom
thou gave me, I kept says he, and none of them is lost. They may suffer
grievously, their sufferings may deprive them of the life of nature, but they
cannot deprive them of the life of grace. They may be persecuted, but they
cannot be forsaken totally and finally. They may be cast down, but they cannot
be destroyed, as 2 Cor. 4.9. They may be destroyed as men, but they can never
be destroyed as Saints. In this respect they are like Mount Sion that can never
be removed. The wind may (...) drive away the chaff; but all the storms of
persecution shall never blow away one grain of good wheat.

So they may sin exceedingly, but they can never sin to death. Any sin they may
commit (if you respect the matter of it, for of that I speak, not of the manner
of Commission) but that against that Holy Ghost. There is a sin to death, says
the Apostle, 1 John 5.16. to death, not in the merit of it only (for so is
every sin to death if we look to the desert) but to death, in the event, so
that eternal death and condemnation is the infallible and unavoidable effect
and issue of it. And this Christ surely keeps his people from, so that they
never fall into it. He gives his sheep eternal life, and they do never perish,
as himself speaks, John 10.28. And though they be not kept in all respects to
preservation, either from sinning, or from suffering, yet they are kept unto
salvation, notwithstanding both these, 1 Pet. 1.5.

And thus you see the point is clear, that Jesus Christ does keep them safe who
are bestowed upon him by his Father, in the sense before expressed. Not safe from
sinning and from suffering, but safe from losing, whatever their afflictions,
whatever their trangressions be. Those whom thou gave me, I kept, says he,
and none of them is lost.

but the Son of perdition; none of them is lost but the Son of perdition, so
that one of them was lost who was bestowed upon him by the Father.

Sol.
To this some answer, that the particle But is not exceptive, but adversitative,
and so does not at all imply that Judas was bestowed upon our Savior by the
Father. Those whom thou gave me I kept, and none of them, no not one of them
is lost. But as for Judas, he indeed is gone, being none of that number. He is
not given to me by election, but is indeed the Son of perdition.

But if it be allowed to be exceptive, and so that Judas was in some respect
bestowed upon our Savior by the Father, it will not follow that he was so
bestowed upon him as the rest were. Indeed the Father gave him Judas for
outward Ministration as the rest of the Apostles, but not for inward union and
incorporation as the rest. He gave him Judas for a Servant as the rest, not for
a member as the rest; he was not bestowed upon our Savior by election as the
rest, for he was a reprobate, and therefore called the Son of perdition.

But why then does Christ except him? Because he was in some respect bestowed
upon him as the rest, and for ought appeared then in all respects. And
therefore though our Savior Christ's exception be improper, as to the Grammar
of the words, as Calvin very well observes upon the Text, yet it is not
improper as to the sense of those that heard him. For any thing that they were
able to discover, he was as much bestowed on Christ, as any of the rest of the
Apostles. And therefore though this [but] might have been spared, if all things
had been rightly understood, yet it was very necessary with respect to them who
thought far better of that hypocrite then he deserved. None of them is lost
says Christ, but he who though he be accounted for the present of the number,
yet he is indeed and will in time appear to be the Son of perdition.

may be reprobate to morrow; that he that is to day an heir of salvation, may
be to morrow a child of perdition.

A Doctrine infinitely prejudicial to the honor of our Savior, as if he may
give eternal life to as many as he has given him, John 17.2. And what does
Jesus Christ abandon them to ruin and destruction notwithstanding? No, my
beloved: mark what John the Baptist says, John 3.35. The Father loves the Son,
says he, and has given all things into his hands; you must conceive it, all
things of one sort he has bestowed upon him; so that he has put them into his
hand, to honor them and to keep and preserve them: all his elect and chosen
people: for all things of another sort he has (as the Apostle speaks) put
under his feet to tread upon them and to ruin and destroy them. But what does
Jesus Christ with those his Father gives him in the former way? why as his
Father would he should do: he keeps them and he gives eternal life to them, as
it is added in the next verse. Yea they have everlasting life (as that is the
expression there) they have it in the present world in regard of inchoation,
and are as sure of the perfection of it in the world to come, as if they had it
in their own possession. And to affirm that such may perish and be lost for
ever, is to make the Son of God unfaithful to the Father, which is a horrid
derogation.

Or if not so, at least unable to preserve them from destruction; Save them he
would, but it is not in his power. Whereas the Apostle tell us that he is able
to save his people to the utmost, Heb. 7.25. And he himself who is the truth it
self affirms, that none shall pluck them out of his hand, John 10.28. The world
would, the devil would, the flesh would, many would, but none shall. He has
power to overtop them and to master and control them, so that they shall not
have their will in this business.

And as this Doctrine, that they may be lost whom God the Father they give all
diligence to make their calling and election sure; yea, suppose they make it
sure; Though they be sure they are elect, they are not sure they shall continue
so; by this doctrine, they may be reprobates to morrow; suppose they prove
themselves whether they be in Christ or no; Suppose they prove they be in
Christ; they cannot prove they shall continue so; by this doctrine, they may be
out of Christ to morrow. And is not this cold comfort? Ah my beloved, how will
it sting the soul that is about to take her flight for another world to be at
such uncertainty, when all the consolation she can have is only this, that for
the present she belongs to Christ, but the next hour before she get away out of
the world, he may lose her and disown her, and so she is undone for ever.

John making mention of the Locusts that crawl out of the bottomless pit (and
they are Antichristian Teachers) affirms that they shall torment men, Apoc.
9.5. and that with exquisite and horrid torture: it shall be like the torment
of a Scorpion that strikes a man, as it is added in the next words: which
torment they shall put men to by teaching Antichristian doctrine. And truly, my
Beloved, this doctrine of the possibility of falling quite away from Christ,
and being lost by him for ever, after the most sweet experience of his love,
and after all his dearest kisses and embraces of a poor soul, is one of the
most venomous and bitter stings with which these Scorpions strike men. Oh my
Beloved, what exquisite and racking pangs and agonies of fear and horror, this
may cast a soul into, in the sad hour of temptation, desertion and dissolution,
no tongue of Men or Angels is sufficient to express.

etc. You then that are delivered up into the hands of Jesus Christ by the
donation of the Father, triumph and be exceeding glad in the security of your
Condition. Believe it, you can never perish, be your afflictions, or
temptations, or corruptions what they will, or what they can: depend upon it,
you are safe as to the main. If you belong to Jesus Christ, he has undertaken
for you to the Father, and he will see that you shall not miscarry. Let the
flesh, and let the world, and let the Devil pluck at you with all their power,
and might, it is in vain; they shall not get you off from Jesus Christ. They
may pluck you, and pluck you violently in his hand, but they shall never pluck
you out of his hand: No, my Beloved; he that has received you from the Father,
will be sure to answer you safe and sound to him again: And in the great day of
account, he will bring you forth and say, Here am I, and the people which thou
have given me: Those which thou gave me, I kept, and not one of them is lost.
Indeed, my Brethren, if your preservation depended on your own care, strength,
ability, you were in very great hazard: But seeing this depends upon the care
and power, and faithfulness of Jesus Christ, what can be added to your safety?
Now the better to assure you, and settle you in this particular, I shall lay
down a few particulars as an immovable foundation, upon which this comfortable
truth is built, that Christ will surely keep them safe who are bestowed upon
him by the Father. And they are of three sorts. Either such as respect the
Father who bestows a people on the Son; or such as respect the Son on whom this
people are bestowed; or such as respect the people who by the Father are
bestowed upon the Son.



First he will keep you out of love to God the Father: What do you think that
Christ will lose that which his Father gives him? we would not lose the gift
but of an ordinary friend, especially if he be dear to us, as I have noted
heretofore, and much less would we lose a Fathers gift; we would keep such a
thing with all the care and diligence we can. Now Jesus Christ loves his Father
better then we can love ours; and therefore as he had us from the Father, so he
will surely keep us for the Fathers sake.

Secondly, As he will keep us out of love so out of duty to the Father; For as
Man and Mediator he is a servant to the Father; And as the Father has bestowed
a people on him, so he has given him an express command to keep them, and he
has given him ample power that he may keep them: And consequently Jesus Christ
will certainly preserve them, out of duty to the Father: in reference to his
injunction that he may not disobey him: in reference to his intention and
expectation, that he may not disappoint to him.

First in reference to the injunction of the Father, Christ will surely keep us
that he may not disobey him. For you must know, my Brethren, that the Father,
as he has given us to Jesus Christ, so he has withal commanded him to look
to us, and to see we do not perish. This is the Fathers will, says Christ,
that of all which he has given me, I should lose nothing, Joh. 6.39. And he
came down into this lower world to do the will of him that sent him. And
therefore certainly he will be very careful of this special charge of his: he
will observe it very strictly and exactly. He will be infinitely wary that he
lose nothing of the Fathers goods, which he has given him to keep, and
required him to keep, that so he may approve himself a faithful servant.

Secondly in reference to the intention of the Father, Jesus Christ will surely
keep us, that he may not disappoint him: For as he has received a strict
command, so he has withal received full and ample power to keep us: His
Father has bestowed it on him to this very end, as himself acknowledges, Joh.
17.2. As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he might give eternal
life to as many as thou have given him, and consequently that they might not
perish: So that this is the Fathers aim, you see, which Jesus Christ will never
frustrate; he has bestowed upon him large authority and power to this purpose:
Power over all flesh that he may give eternal life to some flesh, to as many as
God has given him. Indeed if he were only vested with authority and power over
that flesh which God intends that he shall keep and save, it would fall short
in this business; For there is other flesh that would resist and hinder our
salvation. There is flesh within us, I mean our lusts and our corruptions; and
there is flesh without us, I mean the world and worldly men that would oppose
this great work; and therefore God has qualified Jesus Christ with power
sufficient to reach his end in this design of his. He has not only vested him
with power over the flesh to which he means that he should give eternal life:
But he has given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to as
many as he has given him; that other flesh may not resist him and disappoint
him in this great business; and therefore let the flesh without us, and let the
flesh within struggle, we may be confident that we shall have eternal life, in
spite of all their opposition: For God has vested Jesus Christ with full
power, to this end, and to this purpose, that he may give it, and that none may
hinder it.

As Jesus Christ will surely keep us for his Fathers sake, so he will nakedly
entrusted with our Savior as a servant, in which respect he is engaged to keep
us out of duty; but more then so, we are bestowed upon him as a Son, in which
respect he is engaged to keep us out of property, and this is that which makes
us safe indeed. If Jesus Christ were but an hireling, and if the sheep were not
his own, he might leave them as a prey to the devouring and ravening Wolf, as
he himself informs us in that same Similitude, Joh. 10.12. The hireling flees
and leaves the sheep, because the sheep are not his own, and cares not for the
sheep, and the Wolf catches and scatters the sheep. But Jesus Christ is not
the Shepherd only, but the owner of the sheep; he keeps them not for wages, but
for love, and for the property he has in them, and therefore certainly he will
be careful of them to the utmost. Those whom the Father gives him, he will
keep: Indeed they are the Sons portion, The Lords portion is his people, Deuteronomy.
32.9. And what follows? He kept them as the Apple of his Eye. What do you think
that Jesus Christ will lose his portion which his Father gives him? That he
will be so wretchless, that he will not keep his own? his own goods: Nay, more
then so; his own members, the very apples of his Eye. Will he suffer men or
Devils to rent away his limbs from him, to pluck his very eyes out of his head?
take this and take all.



1. We cost him dear; he paid a great price for us, and therefore he will know
how he goes from us. We cost him prayers; he has not one of us among the
Gentiles without asking: Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine
inheritance, says the Father to the Son, Psalm. 2.7. Otherwise I will not.
Christ is faign to beg for us before he gets us of the Father.

Nay, more then so, we did not cost him breath only, but we cost him blood too;
He is the Lord that bought us, as the Apostle Peter calls him, and bought us
not with gold and silver, and such corruptible things, but with his own most
precious blood, 1 Pet. 1.19. And if he lose us in the end, he has a very ill
bargain. No, my Beloved, we may rest upon it, that Jesus Christ will never
suffer the purchase of his prayers the purchase of his blood to perish; he
never spent his breath, and much less will he spend his blood in vain.

2. And as we cost him dear, so we are very dear to him: His heart is
infinitely set upon his Church and people; he loves them out of all measure, so
that you may be sure he will be loath to see them perish. He looks upon them as
his Jewels, Mal. 3.17. and as his own peculiar treasure, Psalm. 135.4. And he
will keep his Treasure and his Jewels safe, take his trash who will.

And thus you have seen the grounds, on which you may be confident, that if the
Father have bestowed you on the Son, he will not lose you; No, you are safe
enough, depend upon it; it is impossible that you should ever perish, or
miscarry.

But you will interpose and say perhaps, This Doctrine serves to make men
negligent, and careless, and secure; For if they be preserved and kept so
absolutely safe by Christ, they need to take no care to keep themselves.

For answer, let it be considered, 1. Sol.
That Christ does keep men by themselves. And hence says the Apostle James,
This is Religion for a man to keep himself unspotted of the world, James 1.27.
And Paul advises Timothy to keep himself pure, 1 Timothy 5.22. And 2. if any of
you who belong to Christ, remit your watch and grow secure, and neglect to keep
your selves, though Christ will not lose you, yet you may lose Christ as the
Church did when she lay upon her bed, and would not open, Cant. 5.6. You may be
woefully deserted by him both in regard of grace and peace: And though you
cannot fall away, yet you may fall most fearfully to the dishonor of the Lord,
and of Religion, and the irreparable wounding of your Names while you have a
day to live. Though you cannot wholly lose the inward habits of your graces,
yet you may lose the exercise of them. And though you cannot lose the Essence,
yet you may lose the sense and comfort of all the graces that you have: Though
it be utterly impossible that you should perish in reality, yet you may perish
in your own conceit and apprehension; you may be brought to such a sad
condition, that you may look upon your selves as reprobates and cast-aways, and
think your selves undone creatures: And though Christ will not suffer you to go
to hell, yet he may make you cry in your heart and in your bones, as David did,
and set you on the rack of such unutterable agonies, and horrors and
affrightments, that you may feel a Hell in this world.

Now for a last use of the Point, this may afford a seasonable admonition

1. Ministers are Christ's Shepherds in the Church, as Christ is the Fathers
Shepherd; and as the Father commits his people to the Son to keep, so Christ
commits them to his Underofficers, and to his Ministers to keep; and therefore
it concerns them to hearken to the advice of the Apostle to the Elders of
Ephesus, Act. 20.28. Take heed to your selves, and to all the flock over which
Jesus Christ has made you Overseers to feed the Church of Christ, which he
has purchased with his own blood; yea, to the admonition of Jesus Christ
himself to Peter, Joh. 21.15. Simon son of Jonas, love thou me? do thou
love me? do thou indeed? why if thou do, Keep my Lambs, feed my Sheep; If
you have any love to Christ your Master, see that none of his be lost by your
default, by want of any pains you could have taken with them, in heat by day,
and cold by night, for want of any admonition, or instruction that you could
have given them: And be assured of th^s, that if any of them perish by your
carelessness, and your neglect, you will have a very sad account to make when
the day of reckoning comes; their blood will Jesus Christ require at your
hands: Oh let it not be said of you that you do not Custodire gregem sed
perdere, non pascere sed mactare. Not keep the sheep but lose them; not feed
the flock, but feed upon it: Be sure that you be faithful to your great trust,
that you may give up your account with joy; and that when Christ shall call you
to a reckoning, you may say to him, as he does to his Father in my Text, and
say it truly, Those whom thou gave me to keep I kept, and not one of them is
lost by my means.

2. So Magistrates are Christ's servants, his Shepherds in the Commonwealth, as
they are called 1 King. 22.17. And they must learn to keep them safe who are
committed to them to be kept as Christ does. They must be very careful of the
sheep of Christ that none of them miscarry in their hands. And to this end they
must do two things.

1. They must chase away the Wolves, that seek to prey upon the sheep of
Christ: The Wolves that prey upon their persons or estates. These you must
either make to fly, or break their jaws, as Job did, and pluck the prey out of
their teeth. The Wolves that prey upon their souls, that bring in
soul-destroying errors, damnable heresies, as the Apostle calls them, 2 Pet.
2.1. There are some errors which whosoever holds them and continues in them,
suffers loss, but he himself is saved, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 3.15. But
there are others in which if any man continue, he himself is lost for ever. Now
they that bring in those, destroy the sheep of Christ: and therefore they that
keep his sheep, must take course with such, according to the power which the Law
of God and Man has put into their hands.

2. They must be very tender of the sheep of Christ, which he has given them
to keep, as David was; Alas those sheep, what evil have they done? And as
Hezekiah was, who, as a Type of Christ, is styled a hiding place from wind,
and a covert from the Tempest, Isa. 32.2. where the poor sheep might fly for
shelter, in a storm, and there find sure refuge. Now I beseech you honorable
and respected, Preached at the Assizes.
who are the Ministers of Christ, be you such to his people; Let them have
protection from you, let them be kept safe by you: Oh do not see them injured
and undone, if you can help them. Oh do not see them lost if you can save them:
Keep them as you desire that Jesus Christ should keep you; let those who will
assuredly find favor at the last day, at the bar of Jesus Christ, find favor
at your bar now. I speak not this that you should boulster any out in any evil;
God forbid; but that you should be very careful that those who appertain to
Christ, be not so far neglected by you, as to be overborn unjustly and
maliciously by those who are the enemies of Christ and them, Oh be a covert and
a hiding place to such. Make them ashamed who report (I hope untruly) that many
times an honest man finds less respect and countenance then an enemy of Christ.
And in a word, in all your actings, and administrations, have a careful eye
upon the little flock of Jesus Christ, to fence it, and to mound it, and
safeguard it, that no damage come to it: that when the Stewardship is out, and
the counting time is come, you may not be dejected, and hang down your heads,
but may appear before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy: that you
may rejoice in Christ, and Christ may rejoice in you, to see how well and
faithfully you have demeaned your selves in his service.

JOHN 17.12. But the Son of Perdition.


AND thus of our Saviors general profession, that he had safely and entirely
kept all those that were bestowed upon him by his Father; Those whom thou
gave me I kept, and none of them is lost.

Proceed we now to his particular exception of Judas; but the son of perdition;
none of them is lost, but the son of perdition.

How, and upon what account Judas is excepted here from the rest of the
Apostles, you may remember I have showed you fully heretofore. And therefore I
shall touch no more at the Exception. But I shall fasten on the appellation
that is given him who is excepted here: The son of perdition.

Now he is called the son of perdition, not only to imply that he was a lost
creature, as considered in himself; but more then so, that he was destinated
and appointed to be lost in the eternal Counsel and Decree of God, that he
designed him to destruction. A manner of Expression very usual with the
Hebrews, as Calvin and some others after him observe upon the Text. Now this
our Savior mentions, not to lay the fault of the destruction of this wretched
man on Gods Decree, or to take it off from Judas; But to make it to appear,
that though he were a lost creature, yet the election of the Lord remained
firm, and stood unalterable notwithstanding: For he was not elected, but
reprobated and appointed to perdition.

This being the intention of the phrase, the Observation clearly offered to us
here is this.

DOCTRINE. That God in his Eternal Counsel and Decree has appointed and
designed some certain special persons to destruction.
This was the case of Judas in my Text; he was Perditioni destinatus ac
devotus, destinated and devoted to perdition: And therefore when he was
destroyed and lost, the Holy Ghost observes of him, that he went to his own
place, Act. 1.25. that is to Hell, the place which was appointed for him from
Eternity: And therefore Bildad speaks of some whom God has cast away, Job 8.4.
And Job of some who are reserved to destruction, Job 21.31. The Wise man tells
us that God has made the wicked for the day of evil, Prove. 16.4. The Lord made
all things for himself, his own glory; yea, even the wicked for the glory of
his Justice to be declared and manifested on them in the evil day, the day
which is so to them: That is, the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men, as the Apostle Peter calls it, 2 Epist. 3.7. to which day they are
reserved, as the same Apostle speaks; you must conceive it in the everlasting
purpose and decree of God, 1 Pet. 2.9. As there are vessels of mercy ordained
to glory, so there are vessels of wrath prepared to destruction, Romans 9.22. Not
only by their own misdeeds, but in some sense by the decree of God.
Meritoriously indeed and in desert they are prepared for it only by themselves,
and by their own sins. But in design they are prepared for it also by the
Counsel and the fore-appointment of the Lord. And this indeed is specially
intended in the place. Or else wherefore does the Apostle for clearing of the
Justice of the Lord in this particular, fly to his (...), his absolute and
sovereign power, which he has over all his creatures, to bestow them at his
pleasure, either to wrath, or to salvation: Even as the Potter is at liberty to
mould his clay, to what shape and to what use he pleases, either to honor or
to dishonor. The answer had been ready and at hand, if God had had no finger
in the business, in preparing men to wrath, no not so much as by determination
and decree, Paul need not have said he did it by his absolute and Sovereign
power. No, if it had been so, he might have said, God did it not all, he
prepared them not at all, ordained them not at all, but they prepared
themselves to wrath and to destruction. But this he could not say; for it were
quite against the saying of the holy Ghost, Jude 4. where he makes mention of
some certain men, who were before of old ordained to condemnation. Not only
fitted for it by themselves, but preordained to it by another, and that is God.
Yea the Apostle Paul does clearly and expressly intimate that God appoints
some to wrath, in that memorable place to this purpose, 1 These. 5.9. where
stirring up the Thessalonians to exemplary holiness of life, he quickens them
with the consideration of the high preferment which he and they and others had
in that which is indeed the richest and the choicest mercy of the Lord, For God
has not appointed us to wrath. Others he has; but this is our prerogative
that God has not appointed us to wrath, (as he has done many others,) but to
obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. So that the Point is plain you
see, that God in his Eternal Counsel and Decree, has appointed and designed,
etc.

To open this a little to you, that so you may the more distinctly understand
it, you must know, that there are two parts or acts of the decree of God, in
reference to these whom he appoints to destruction; viz. a negative, and a
positive act.

David went to fight against Goliath, he chose him five smooth stones out of the
brook; Who does not presently conceive that he refused other some? If all be
taken, it is no election: so that election carries in it the first act of
reprobation, preterition, passing by. When some are chosen, there are other
some refused; when some are taken, there are others left.

2. But now there is another act of the decree of God in reference to those
whom he appoints to destruction, which we have called a positive act. For as
God leaves men, in the first place, in their sins, and in their lost condition,
and does not choose them to salvation: So in the second place, he resolves
with himself to condemn them and to destroy them for the sin in which he leaves
them, and so to glorify his Justice in them. And this is that which some have
styled predamnation, damnation in the purpose and decree of God. For it is one
thing to decree the condemnation of such as are not chosen to salvation: and it
is another thing actually to condemn them, by executing the decree upon them.
Now of this second act of the decree of God it is that we speak in the
conclusion we are handling, That God in his Eternal Counsel and Decree has
appointed and designed some certain special persons to destruction.

But you will ask me, Why has God done so? What is the reason of this Act of
his? What does induce him to ordain men to destruction?

First, I will show you what is not the reason; And in the next place I will
show you what it is.

The sins of men are not the reason why God ordains men to destruction;

But if sin be not the reason then why God appoints men to destruction, what is
the reason then?

Truly there is no reason out of God, no moving or impulsive cause He has
mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth, as the Apostle speaks,
Romans 9.18. And therefore the Apostle in that very Chapter concludes the decree
of God, both of election, and of reprobation, to be absolutely free from any
motive or inducement out of God himself, because it passed upon the children,
Jacob and Esau being yet unborn, having neither done good or evil, as you may
see at large, Romans 9.11, 12, 13. For the children being not yet born, that the
purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of him that
calls, it was said, The elder shall serve the younger, etc. As it is written,
Jacob have I loved, that is to choose him; and Esau have I hated, to reject
him. And consequently neither election not rejection was of works, not of any
thing in them, seeing it took hold upon them before they had a being in the
world.

Yea but it will be said perhaps, though they were yet unborn, and though they
had done neither good nor evil, yet God fore-knew, and God foresaw they would
be born, and that in time they would do good or evil, and so accordingly he
molded his decree, electing him whom he foresaw would do good, rejecting him
whom he foresaw would do evil.

But how then was it not of works, if it were of works foreseen of the one side
or the other? will works foreseen stand better with the freeness of the purpose
and decree of God, then present works or works in being? Not a whit. And
therefore this is clearly and apparently the force of the Apostles reason. The
decree of God is free, and not of works: it is not caused by any thing that man
does: For it took hold of Jacob and of Esau, being yet unborn, before they had
done either good or evil, or were considered doing good or evil as a motive or
inducement to prevail with God to choose the one or to refuse the other.

So then you see the reason of the point. Some certain men God appoints to
perdition. Why? because he will, because it is his pleasure so to do.

This is very hard measure, that God should preordain men to destruction, upon
this account because he will.

Sol.
And is it not as hard measure, that the Creator should not be allowed to have
his will upon his creature? If you could make a thing of nothing, you would
look to have the free disposal of it at your own pleasure. Nay, my beloved, to
use the instance the Apostle gives, the Potter looks to have the free disposal
of his clay, and of the self same Lump to make one Vessel to an honorable,
another to a sordid use. Or if he please, as soon as he has finished them, to
dash the one to shivers, and to save the other. If any ask a reason of him, it
is enough for him to say that he does this because he will, because it is his
pleasure so to do. He made it, and he may destroy it; And yet he gives but form
to what he makes, he works on matter made before by God. But God creates a
thing of nothing; he gives it form and matter too; and why may not he dispose
it as he will? Why should not his authority and power be yielded and allowed to
be as great upon the creature which he makes of nothing, as the Potters on the
clay which he could never make?

And yet what ever Gods decree concerning any man may be, which he reserveth in
his own breast and bosom, he never damneth or destroys a man till he deserve
it. The Potter breaks a vessel it may be for no fault at all, but to satisfy
his fancy, or to manifest his power, and to show what he can do. But God the
great Creator of the world, does never so with any creature; if he dash any man
to pieces, it is because he has deserved it very justly by his sins. If he
condemn him, there is a meritorious cause. And he may truly say to such a
person, Thy destruction is of thy self.

But in the second place it will be said perhaps by some, If this be so that
God in his Eternal Counsel and Decree, has appointed and disigned some certain
special persons to destruction, it is in vain for such to hear and pray, and
use the means of attaining to salvation. They were as good to fit still and do
nothing: for all will be to no purpose. If they be reprobated, they must be
destroyed: the Counsel of the Lord must stand.

If they be reprobated? But who are reprobated, can they tell? Sol.
Have thou known the mind of the Lord? Art thou assured that thou art
reprobated and appointed to destruction? If so indeed, there were some color
for thee to neglect the means of attainment to salvation. But know, my
brethren, that it is impossible for any man to be infallibly assured of his
reprobation without immediate revelation, as perhaps Saul was. Its true, he may
be sure of his election: never of his reprobation. The Scripture urges and
persuades men to assure the one, never to assure the other. It gives marks and
evidences of the one; it gives no evidences of the other. Indeed the sin
against the Holy Ghost (where it is found) follows after of reprobation: but
who is able to determine whether he be guilty of this sin against the Holy
Ghost, or no? As for my own part, I am confident that God has ordered matters
so, that no man shall be able to determine that he is rejected by him; And that
to this intent, that all men may be held in diligent attendance on the means of
reconciliation and atonement with him, not knowing what the issue and event
may be. And what then? will thou take that to be certain which is very
doubtful, and on so weak a ground as this, neglect and slight the means, which
may for ought thou know, be powerful to the salvation of thy precious soul
for ever? Will thou conclude thou art rejected, and do as if this resolution
were infallible, when yet it is apparently a most uncertain thing, of which
thou can not be assured? When the decree concerning reprobation is a secret
and a doubtful thing; and the command requiring thee to make thy calling and
election sure is a plain and certain thing: will thou neglect the precept and
command that lies before thee, and walk by the decree that is obscure and
hidden from thee?

Should thou not rather reason in the case in hand, as Merchants and
Adventurers in worldly things are wont to do? Perhaps the Lord may have a
blessing yet in store for me; Once I am sure he has required me to use the
means, and therefore though there be some hazard in it, I will not be behind in
my endeavor; at his command I will let down the net. Even so perhaps the Lord
may have appointed me to life and glory: once I am sure he has commanded me to
use the means of attaining to salvation: And therefore though I know not what
the issue and event may be, I will attend upon them, be careful in the use and
practice of them, to the utmost of my power. I know, if I neglect them, I must
perish: if I use them, I may live eternally: And therefore I will rather give
all diligence to make my calling and election sure, then thus adventure my
immortal soul upon such hazard and uncertainty as this. And who can tell but
that the Lord may yet be gracious that my soul may live?

etc. hence then it follows that all men are not chosen to salvation; And
consequently they are very much deceived, who hold and teach that God in his
Decree, has not perfectly precisely pitched on any special individual men,
appointing them to life and glory: But that he has elected all upon condition
that they repent, believe and persevere in holiness and grace unto the end. And
on the other side, that he rejects no man absolutely from salvation, but (as
their own expression is) suspenso manet animo, si forte resipiscant, The Lord
suspendeth his determination, expecting their repentance that they may be saved.

A Doctrine evidently crossing with the truth which we have plentifully proved
and confirmed from the Scripture, that there is a particular and special
reprobation, and therefore cannot be an universal election. Now that you may
not be misled in this particular, or drawn to think that God has chosen all
men to salvation on condition, leaving it wholly to themselves and to their own
free wills, either to ratify it, or infringe it; so making his decree like a
Noveriut universi, If men believe not, persevere not, then the election must be
void. Otherwise, if they believe and continue to the end, it must remain in
full power, strength and virtue. I say, that this corrupt opinion (which is so
confidently vented now adays) may not take with any of you, I shall lay down
some arguments against it, and answer others that are brought for it.

This universal and conditional election overthrows the end of God, all which
he aims in all his Counsels and Decrees, and in all his dispensations, viz. the
glory of his free grace. This was that which the Lord had in his eye when he
appointed men to glory, even that he might make known the riches of his own
glory, on those which he prepared to glory, as you have it, Romans 9.22. Now how
shall he attain this end by choosing all men to Salvation, if they will
themselves? how is the glory of his mercy magnified and advanced? where is the
freeness of his grace more to one man then another? since he does alike for
all, electeth all alike to glory and salvation; prepares heaven no more for
one man then another: so that if any man be saved, he may thank himself, he may
glory in himself, and not in God. And therefore it is very notable that the
Apostle making this the end of the decree of God, viz. the glory of his grace,
withal discovers that he electeth men to life, not according to their wills,
as they will either choose it, or refuse it, but according to his own, Ephesians.
1.5, 6. Having predestined us by Jesus Christ, to the praise of the glory of
his grace. How so? according to the pleasure of his will. To show that he works
freely in the business without impulsion or provocation from external causes.
And so he must if he will atttain his end. If it be to the glory of his grace,
it must be according to the pleasure of his will. So afterward, ver. 11, 12.
We are predestined that we should be to the glory of his grace. And to this
end we are predestined according to his purpose who works all things after
the Counsel of his own will. If he will glorify his grace in this business, we
must be saved according to his will and pleasure, and not according to our own.
His will must have the first and greatest stroke in this mercy.

This universal and conditional election, as it overthrows Gods end, Mat.
11.25. and 13.16, 17. And the same course the Prophet David takes with Israel,
Psalm. 147.19, 20. He showed his word to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
to Israel. He dealt not so with other Nations, and therefore you are specially
engaged to praise the Lord. And certainly that soul shall find it self most
quickened and enlarged to the praises of the Lord, that sees his special and
peculiar favor to it self, which millions are rejected from. Oh, will the soul
consider with it self in such a case, Why has God pitched on me neglecting
others? whence was it that he took me into his decree? what did he see in me,
more then in those whom he laid by? why he did choose me? In our elections who
are men (beloved) there is something still that carries and inclines us to a
choice. Some fitness in the object of it, some relation to our selves, some
motive or inducement that prevails upon us. But now my brethren, we are all
alike to God in the act of his election; we lay together in the same corrupted
Mass, all weltring in the same blood, and tumbling in the same gore; and when
he came to choose a little number in comparison of those he left, Oh what a
mercy was it that he should pitch on thee and me! which if he had not done, we
had been lost for ever. Truly, my brethren, did we sit down and weigh it well
in our advised and deliberate thoughts, it would transport and carry us beyond
our selves. It would make us to break out with the Apostle, Ephesians. 1.3, 4.
Blessed be God who has chosen us: us who deserved no more then others, who
were no fitter for his choice then others. And yet us, when he has rejected
others. Oh blessed be the Lord for this mercy. But now, my brethren, none of
this, if all be chosen to salvation with this condition that they will accept
it, they may have it if they will; The damned reprobate in hell by this account
has as much reason to be thankful as the triumphant Saint in heaven. Why, may
this wretched Catiffe say, God did as much for me as him; only indeed I did not
so much for my self. And may the glorified Saint in heaven say, The Lord has
done as much for those in hell, as ever he has done for me. He has elected
them as well as me, and he has assisted them as much as me; for he is to all
alike; only they have not used their own free-wills as well as I have done; and
this is the only cause that they are damned, and I am saved. And therefore I
will ever thank my self and not God. At least I have no greater cause to think
him, then the damned have. If there be any difference between them and me, it
is not God that made it, but my self. God did for them and me alike. And that
they are not in the same condition with me, the only reason is, because we did
not for ourselves alike. And therefore they are every way as much obliged and
bound to God as I am.

you have not chosen me; but I have chosen you, John 15.6. Not you me by your
deserts and the good use of your free will; but I you of my free favor.

I shall add no other arguments against universal conditional election: But
proceed to answer such as the assertors of it bring for it.

Object. They confidently urge that place of the Apostle, 1 Timothy 2.4. God will
have all men to be saved: therefore he electeth all, appoints all men to
salvation.

Sol. But what if we should understand it, not of his will of Counsel and
Decree, but of his will of Precept and Command. God will have all men to be
saved, that is, he wlleth and commands all men to repent and to believe the
Gospel, that they may be saved.

singula generum, but genera singulorum. Not all men universally without
exception, but some of all sorts, of all callings, of all Nations, some of all.
A manner of expression very usual, as I might give you diverse instances out of
the Scripture: It is said that all Judea went to John the Baptist and were
baptized of him in Jordan, that is, some of all parts; That Christ healed all
diseases, that is, some of all kinds. So in the place forealledged, God will
have all men to be saved, that is, some of all sorts. And this was necessary to
be urged in opposition to the Jews, to check their folly and presumption, who
in a kind of envious pride, restrained election and salvation to themselves
alone, as if no other people should be saved but they: And in savor of the
Gentiles, over whom the Jews insulted as a rejected and a lost people, forbad
the Gospel to be preached to them, would not endure to hear of turning to the
Gentiles: Therefore to check the one, and cheer the other, as the condition of
the times required, the Apostle tells them, God will have all men to be saved,
as well the Gentiles as the Jews without exception.

3. Or if he would have all men to be saved, of all sorts and of all Nations,
How is it that they are not saved? for who has resisted his will? Assuredly,
my Brethren, if God would have all men to be saved, all men universally, it is
because he cannot save them, that they are not saved. The only cause why any
one does not what he desires and wills to do, is because there is a failing in
his power; and were it not for want of this, there is no one in the world but
would bring his will to pass. And therefore to affirm that God desires and
wills that all men should be saved without exception, and that the reason why
he does not save them, is the obstinacy and perverseness of their wills, by
which they finally resist the work of grace, and hinder God from doing his
desire and will upon them, is to make God too weak for man, who has the better
of him in the contestation: which is blasphemous.

It is objected further, If God elect not all men to salvation, he is partial,
since

To this I answer, why should he not be partial, if you will call it so, Sol.
in the disposal of a free gift, preferring one before another? Why should he
not do with his own what he pleases? this is not matter of debt, or matter of
justice, but matter of mercy. Suppose he choose a few, what is he therefore
bound to choose all? Indeed he is not bound to choose any.

But if he choose a few only, and leave the rest who are incomparably the

To this I answer, Sol.
That he is infinitely unutterably merciful that he chooses any soul out of the
corrupted mass, takes such a loathsome and polluted creature to himself. And
that he leaves the rest in that forlorn condition whereunto they brought
themselves, and from which he is no way bound to free them, he is manifestly
just; and if he be but just, he is not cruel.

Yea, but he does not only leave them in their sins, but determines to condemn
them for their sins in the pit of Hell for ever. And is not this a piece of
justice to condemn them for their sins? Do not their sins deserve the
Condemnation? So that if you look one way, he is merciful; and if you look the
other, he is just: and if you lay them both together, mercy triumphs over
justice. The Lord is infinitely gracious that any are appointed to salvation;
and he had been but righteous if all had been appointed to destruction. True,
he rejects more then he electeth; but mercy is more glorious in electing one,
then justice in rejecting all. For justice does but take them as it finds them,
but mercy makes them what it finds them not. There is a cause of justice in the
creature; there is no cause at all of mercy. When God rejects men, he
determines to condemn them for their sin and disobedience; but when he electeth
them, he determines not to save them for their grace and their obedience.
Somewhat moves him to damn, nothing without him moves him to save; so that if
any be appointed to salvation, if all be not appointed to destruction, his
mercy has the hand upon his justice.

Yea, but God has received a ransom and a price for all: So that if all be not
designed by him to glory and salvation, he must be unjust to take the price of
their deliverance from destruction, and all the while to appoint them to
destruction. How can this agree together?

Sol.
To this I answer, God has received a price for all indeed, a price of worth
enough for all, but not intended to be paid for all, neither by him the giver,
nor by Christ the sufferer: So that in property of speech the Lord has not
received a ransom for any reprobate: Christ paid it not for any such; he prays
not for the world, and much less does he pay for them; the Father took it not
for any such, but only for his own Elect, who shall assuredly be made partakers
of the glory purchased by is unto all Eternity.

There are many more objections, but some are frivolous, and some blasphemous;
the thoughts of men will work without measure, and without end upon such points
as these are. But I must silence all of them with that of the Apostle in the
same case, Romans 9.20. Nay, but O man, who art thou that replyest, answerest
again, disputest against God! All the objections that are made almost against
the point in hand, are against God too: against his mercy, justice, power, etc.
If you have any thing to say for God, it is worth the harkening to; otherwise
you have your answer, Who art thou that disputest against God? do but consider,
who art thou?

etc. How should this make us to admire at the transcendent riches of his
grace, and love to us, whom he has chosen to salvation! Paul makes it an
especial aim of God in his Decree of Reprobation, To show the riches of his
glory on the vessels of mercy, Romans 9.23. And if we weigh it well, we shall
easily discern that it does strangely heighten the exceeding love of God. Had
he ordained all men to salvation, even so his mercy had been out of measure
great. But that he has ordained any of us to salvation, when on the contrary
he has ordained so many millions to destruction, whose state in Nature was no
worse then ours, whose strength in nature was as great as ours, to exempt them
from damnation, whose care to be reconciled was no less then ours, till God was
pleased in mercy to prevent us; how should this sweeten the favor of the Lord
to us in this respect, and even ravish us with admiration of his free grace!
The Lord delights to amplify his love by this, He took not Angels, but the
seed of Abraham, Heb. 2.16. Was not Esau Jacobs brother? says the Lord; Yet I
loved Jacob, and I hated Esau. Mal. 1.2, 3. Whose soul that has tasted of it,
can choose but be amazed at it? Has God preferred me before Angels? before so
many thousands in the world? Oh the unsearchable depth of his love to me! How
does it pass all knowledge!

JOHN 17.12. That the Scripture might be fulfilled.


AND thus of our Saviors general assertion, that he had safely and entirely
kept all those that were bestowed upon him by his Father; While I was with them
in the world, I kept them in thy Name; those thou gave me, I kept, and none
of them lost. And likewise of his particular exception of Judas, who here is
called the son of perdition. None of them is lost, but the son of perdition.

Now in the following words, that none might be offended at the loss of Judas,
or stumble at his ruin and destruction, our Savior Christ goes on to show,
that as it was designed and fore-appointed in the eternal Council and Decree of
God, so it was foretold in Scripture. It was not only foreordained, but it
was fore-shewed too: So that in his destruction there fell out nothing
otherwise, then as it was expressly and apparently declared before in Scripture.
The Scripture was not crossed and contradicted in it, but verified and fulfilled,
None of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled.

But you will ask me what Scripture? where did the Word of God foretell the
ruin and destruction of this wretched man: I answer, David prophesied clearly
and expressly of it many hundred years before, Psalm. 109.8. Let Satan stand at
his right hand. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned, and let his
prayer become sin; Let his days be few, and let another take his office. Judas
you know was self-condemned, and self-executed too, and so his days were few by
that means. And when he had destroyed himself, his place and Office of
Apostleship was supplied by another. But you will say perhaps, Judas is not
named by David in the fore-alleadged Psalm. And therefore though the prophecy
seem to agree to him and his condition, yet how are we assured that he is aimed
at in particular in that prediction? Why, my Beloved, though the Prophet David
do not name him, the Apostle Peter does apply that Scripture to him, Act. 1.20.
For having said in the foregoing verses, This Scripture must have been
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by David spoke before concerning Judas: He
comes at length to this in the alleged verse, For it is written in the Book of
Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein, and his
Bishopric, or Charge, or Office (...) another take, so that when he was lost
and fell from his Apostleship, y^^ see, that Scripture was fulfilled.

And yet you must not apprehend the loss of Judas to be caused by that
praediction; as if the Prophecy concerning him, did really contribute any
thing by way of active operation and efficiencie to his destruction. Though I
acknowledge the expression of my Text may seem to look a little that way, None
of them is lost, but the son of perdition. And he is lost that the Scripture
might be fulfilled. But you must know, my Brethren, that he had been lost,
though his destruction had never been foretold in Scripture. He was not lost
the rather because his loss was prophesied, but it was prophesied because he
was before from all eternity appointed to perdition: And being prophesied, when
the event fell out accordingly, it looked as if the prophecy had been the
cause of his destruction: So that the particle [that] (as a very learned man
observes upon the Text) Judas was lost [that] the Scripture might be fulfilled,
denotes not the true, but the appearing cause only. Yet thus much it suggests
withal, which shall be our observation;

DOCTRINE. That whatsoever is foretold in Scripture, shall surely be
accomplished and fulfilled.
The issue and event shall answer the prediction every way, in all respects.
And therefore it is often noted, not in my Text alone, but elsewhere
frequently, that such and such things came to pass, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, as you may see that place for instance, Mat. 2.14, 15. Joseph arose
and took the child, and departed into Egypt, That it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my Son: And after
in the following verse, Herod sent forth and slew the children from two years
old and under: Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Prophet, saying,
In Rama was a voice heard, Lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel
weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. And
so in many other places the Apostles very carefully observe the punctual and
exact accomplishment of the ancient Prophesies; and speak sometimes in such a
manner, as if things came to pass for no other cause but this, because they
were foretold in Scripture, and that the Scripture might be fulfilled. Whereas
indeed they had been done, though they had never been foretold, because they
were fore-determined; only they would have us know, that whatsoever is foretold
shall certainly be done in Gods time: It is easier says our Savior, for Heaven
and Earth to pass away, then for one title of the Word of God to fail, Luke
16.17. that is, to miss of execution and accomplishment: Fail it may in the
Letter and Paper of it, but not in the fulfilling of it; No, says our Savior,
Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my Word shall not pass away; Mat. 24, 35.
Heaven and Earth are more inconstant and variable, then my Word is; and
therefore the Apostle Peter, speaking of the Prophesies of Scripture, says
that they are sure, 2 Pet. 1.19. We have, says he, a more sure Word of
Prophecy, whereunto ye do we^^ that ye take heed: Not as if the Prophets words
or writings were in th^^selves more sure then the Apostles, but to the Jews
they were more sure; For they received the Prophets words and writings, but
they rejected the Apostles. Well, sure the writings and predictions of the
Prophets are you see, we may rest safely upon them, and conclude, That
whatsoever is foretold, etc. And it must needs be so my Brethren: For



1. The Author of the Prophesies as well as other parts of Scripture is
unchangeable, He is the Lord that changes not, Mal. 3.6. He is yesterday, to
day, the same for ever, Heb. 13.8. And therefore what be says must come to
pass; men say sometimes that they will do a thing to day, which yet they alter
and revoke again to morrow. But if God say a thing to day, he will stand to it
firm to morrow, he will not change his resolution; He is not as man that he
should lie, and as the son of man that he should repent.

But he has seemed to repent, and to change his resolution in many things
foretold in Scripture: For instance, he foretold by Jonah that Nineveh should
be destroyed, at the end of forty days, Jonah 3.4. yet when they were expired,
he did not as he had foretold, so that he altered in appearance; yea it is said
expressly, that he repented of his Commination, so that he brought it not to
execution; God repented of the evil which he had said, that he would do unto
them, and he did it not, Jonah 3.10.

For clearing this, Sol.
you may remember that universal rule which God lays down, for the better
understanding of all Prophetical Praedictions in a way of Commination, Jer.
18.7. The sum is this, that they have all of them annexed to them, or employed
at least, if not an expressed condition: And so had this against the Ninivites;
Yet forty days and Niniveh shall be destroyed; conceive it, if they be not
humbled, that was the reserved condition. But they were humbled and repented;
though they were preserved, God did not otherwise then he determined, and yet
indeed he is said to have repented because he did so that he seemed to repent:
For as a man if he have threatened that thus and thus he is resolved to do, and
after do not so, if he have power, is said to change his mind, and to repent of
what he said: Even so the Lord when he had threatened Niniveh, and had concealed
the condition, because he spared it afterward, and did not just according the
letter of the Commination, is said to have repented, because he seemed to do
that which in a man would have discovered change and alteration of his
resolution. And even as anger is ascribed to the Lord, Non per affectum, sed
per effectum, as the Schoolmen say; The passion or affection of it is not
properly attributed to God, but the effect and fruit is, Vengeance is mine, and
I will repay it. Even so repentance is not in the nature of the Lord, but the
effect and issue of it is usually ascribed to him. The recalling or undoing of
a thing which as far as we could judge by his words, or by his works, or our
deserts, or any other evidence that was before us, seemed unto us to have been
his intent and purpose to have done.

2. And as the Author of the Prophesies, as well as other parts of Scripture,
is unchangeable, so he is true; Yea, He is the God of Truth, as the Prophet
David styles him, Psalm. 31.5. And therefore that which he foretells must be
accomplished and fulfilled. Observe it well, my Brethren, the Prophet does not
say, He is the true God in himself, and in his nature, but he is the God of
Truth in his discoveries, and in his revelation of himself to men. All that
comes from him is truth; He is the faithful and the true witness, Apoc. 3.14.
Not only true and faithful as a God, but true and faithful as a witness. In all
the testimonies that he gives of himself, or of his Son, or of his works
already done, or intended to be done, there is nothing else but truth. He
cannot be the Author of a falsehood, it is impossible, as the Apostle tells
you, Heb. 6.18. It is impossible that he should lie. He can as soon deny
himself, put off his Deity, cease to be God, as father an untruth; and
therefore that which he foretells must be accomplished in his season.



1. The Word of God is an unchangeable, an unalterable Word; when he has said
a thing, and said it absolutely, that must stand, there is no revocation of it
in the sense that he has said it. Thy Word, O Lord, says holy David, is
settled in heaven, Psalm. 119.89. It is an Established thing, never to be removed
again. And therefore it is said to be settled in heaven; There are great changes
here below continually, but there is none above in heaven: and there the Word
of God is settled above the reach of any alteration. All flesh is grass, says
the Apostle, 1 Pet. 1.24. all the glory of man, as the flower of grass; the
grass withers, and the flower thereof fades away, but the Word of the Lord
endures for ever.

2. And as it is unchangeable, so it is true; yea, it is the Word of Truth. It
is an Epithet that is imposed upon it often: Thy Word is true from the
beginning, says the Psalmist to the Lord, Psalm. 119.160. And so it shall be to
the end. And therefore it is added presently, The judgments of the Lord endure
for ever, not in their being only, but their truth. You know the Scripture is
often called a testimony, or a witness: Either it is a testimony that the
Father gives us of the Son, or that the Son gives us of the Father; either it
is a witness to us of things that have been done, or else (which is a little
stronger) it is a witness to us of things that shall be done. Now this is a
condition absolutely necessary to a testimony or a witness, that it declare the
truth and nothing else. Or else how shall it be depended and relied upon? and
so how shall the Scripture be the Word of Faith, as it is called, unless it be
the Word of Truth? How shall this testimony challenge faith from us, unless it
utter truth to us? How shall it be believed, if it be not wholly true? and
therefore truth is frequently ascribed to it as a witness: The testimonies of
the Lord are sure, says David, Psalm. 19.7. That which they tell, has been;
and that which they foretell, shall surely be accomplished and fulfilled.

Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge! how should the drunkard tremble
when he hears those dreadful woes that are denounced to drunkards, up and down
the Prophets everywhere? How should the wretched worldling tremble, when he
hears that dreadful threatening, that no covetous person has any inheritance
in the Kingdom of Christ and of God? How should the lier, and the dog that
barks and snarls and snaps at holiness, and the unclean wretch tremble when
they hear that such shall have their everlasting portion in the lake that burns
with fire and brimstone! And so for other sinners against whom there are heavy
things foretold in Scripture, how should they shake and quiver, when they read
and hear them!

But alas there are abundance who steel and fortify their hearts against them,
who give no credit to the threatenings of the word, as if they were but bruta
fulmina, but empty cracks: who when they hear them thundered out against them,
say with Israel, Jer. 5.12. It is not he, neither shall evil come upon us, nor
shall we see sword or famine. Oh my beloved, do not belie the Lord in this
fashion; do not delude your own souls. Believe it, Judgment is toward you, as
the Expression is, Hosea 5.1. although it be not actually upon you. The wrath
of God comes, it is a coming still, and in the end, depend upon it, it will
come home. What do you think that if you do such things, you shall escape the
vengeance of God? No, be assured that if you persevere without repentance, you
shall feel it with a witness. There is not any thing denounced against you in
the Scripture, but shall be fulfilled upon you to the utmost.

And Secondly, it serves for sweet and precious comfort to the David) which
shall not fail you when the season comes. And when you meet with any thing that
specially concerns you in such a case or such a condition, that might be a
support and comfort to you in affliction and the like, Oh give not way to one
unbelieving thought, do not forsake your own mercies. Remember it is the word
of the Lord, which (as the Angel said) shall be fulfilled in its season.

And so for any good thing that is foretold in Scripture to the Church, as
there are glorious things you know foretold concerning it in after times, that
God will raise it to an admirable state of glory and felicity, which while the
world continues, shall not be overthrown again: Let us not make any question
but they shall absolutely and completely be accomplished and fulfilled. And
therefore let us strengthen and confirm our hearts in the assured expectation
of it, and let us put those promises in suit in our Petitions, as Isaiah in the
same case, Chap. 62.1. And let us stand upon our watch-towers waiting for the
execution of them. Let us account it our especial happiness, that we live under
promises that shall surely be accomplished, though they should be never
fulfilled in our time. Let us embrace them as the Fathers did, yea though they
be afar off. Oh let us hugg them and take especial joy and comfort in them. And
though the Lord should take us hence, before he bring them into act and
execution, yet let us cheer our hearts with the apprehension of the happiness
and glory that shall be upon the Church, after we are dead and gone. And so dye
with our arms full of promises, and our hearts full of faith, and our souls
full of comfort.



Noah, that he might publish it to all the world, that he would utterly destroy
all flesh from off the earth, and by a flood of water too, was as improbable as
any thing almost could be, as like to be derided by the wise men of the world;
Yet Noah being warned of God, believed it, and so accordingly prepared the Ark,
as you may see, Heb. 11.7. And so that Commination by the Prophet Jonah was
almost incredible, that Nineveh so flourishing, so glorious, and so great a
City, should be destroyed in forty days; and yet it is observed, to the praise
of Nineveh that they believed God, that is, the word of God, his threatening
message sent them by the Prophet, Jonah 3.5.

Abraham, that he should have a Son when he was full a hundred years of age,
and a seed that should be as innumerable as the stars of heaven? and that by
Sarah too, a withered and a barren woman? What strong objections might they
both have brought against it? And yet they did not argue, but believed that it
should be just as the Lord had spoken: as the Apostle speaks of Abraham, Romans
4.20, 21. He staggered not at the promise of God, through unbelief, but was
strong in faith, giving glory to God. Yea, and of Sarah too, though she were
somewhat doubtful and incredulous in the beginning, yet even of her he says,
She judged him faithful that had promised. That great and Master promise of
the resurrection of the body from the dust, is far above the principles of
nature and philosophy, and therefore the Philosophers at Athens laughed at it.
Yet Job believed this seeming Paradox, as he professes, Job 19.26. I know says
he, he uses such a word you see as intimates a full persuasion. I am confident
of this, that though after mys kin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I
shall see God. And so let us, my brethren, whatsoever is foretold in Scripture,
let us steadfastly believe that it shall surely be accomplished and fulfilled.

And thus of the first argument or reason, with which our Savior presses and
enforces his petition to his Father, in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples,
that he himself would undertake the keeping of them; Holy Father, keep them
through thy own name. Which has been taken, as you may remember, from his own
effectual preservation of them during the time that he had been amongst them.
And therefore he would have his Father keep them now, because he himself had
kept them, and kept them very safe till now. While I was with them in the world
I kept them.

Before our Savior adds a second reason to enforce this supplication and
request of his, he interposes a discovery of the end, why he presents it, and
why he is so earnest in it: Says he, I put up this Petition to thee while I am
resident in this world; I do it in the hearing of my Apostles and Disciples,
that they might have their comfort much increased by this means. And now I come
to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy
fulfilled in themselves.

So that the words you see are the account our Savior gives his Father of the
Petition which he makes for his Apostles and Disciples, or rather of the
circumstances of the making of it. Why he makes it in the world, why he did not
defer the making of it till he came to heaven; and sat down at the right hand
of his Father, there to be an everlasting Intercessor for his people, but
rather chose to make it here before he went, in the presence and the ears of
his Apostles and Disciples, while they were by, and harkening to him. These
things, says he, I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled
in themselves. And here we have two things to be examined and resolved.

What our Savior means by his joy, which he would have fulfilled That they
might have my joy fulfilled in themselves, not their own joy fulfilled, but my
joy fulfilled in them. And,

How this joy should be fulfilled by his presenting this Petition for

As for the first of these, our Savior calls the joy which he would his joy.
Not that he was the subject of it, or that it was inherent in himself. But
either, First, because he was the object of it, that they might have my joy,
that is to say, the joy which they take in me, fulfilled in themselves. Or
Secondly, as Calvin thinks, because he was the author of it. That they might
have my joy, the joy which they have from me, fulfilled in themselves.



Truly, my brethren, it might be very helpful to it many ways. Either as it
manifested Christ's affection to them, and his care of them, in which they could
not but exceedingly rejoice. What he would do in their behalf, when he was come
to heaven, was not so clearly known to them. But this he did before he went, in
their hearing, he earnestly besought his Father to take special care of them,
to keep them through his own name; they heard it with their own ears, how
earnest and importunate he was, which could not choose but be an extraordinary
comfort to them, that Jesus Christ should have such dear and singular regard to
them.

Or else it might fulfill their joy, as it assured them of their special
preservation, after Christ was gone from them.

There is no question to be made, they were in many doubts and fears when he
was about to leave them. And had he gone without discovering any care of their
safety, their sorrows would have been increased. If he had only prayed in
secret for them to his Father, and desired him to keep them, this would have
added to their safety; but what would this have added to their joy? But when
they heard him being ready to depart, to yield them up in such a serious solemn
manner to his Father, and to make this his last request to him while he was
here in this world, that he would keep them, this could not but assure them
that they should be kept, and so fill them full of joy. And hence our Savior
having put up that Petition for them, Holy Father, keep them through thy own
name; And that because while I was with them in the world, I kept them; Adds
this immediately, and now come, I to thee: and these things speak I in the
world, before I come; I speak them here among them, that my Discples being
ear-witnesses to my importunate and earnest intercession for them, may have the
joy, either which they take in me, or which they receive from me, the more
abundantly fulfilled in themselves.

The words thus opened, yield us out three Observations.

First, Christ is the Author and Original of the joy of his people. Secondly,
Jesus Christ would have his people to be full of holy joy. Thirdly, Their
perfect knowledge of his intercession for them, is one special means to fill
them full of this joy.
DOCTRINE. Christ is the Author and Original of the joy of his people.
If they have any true and real joy, it comes from him, they have it from the
Lord Christ: And therefore it is called his joy, because originally it is his,
and comes from him to them by way of dispensation and communication, that they
might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. So in another place he tells his
Apostles and Disciples, that if they were obedient to him, they should abide in
his love; And adds immediately, these things have I spoken to you, that my joy
might remain in you, (that is to say) the joy that I give you, John 15.11.
Indeed it is the fruit and the effect of Christ's kingdom, erected in the hearts
of his people, as the Apostle shows us, Romans 14.17. His Kingdom is not meat and
drink, but righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. You shall be
sorrowful, says Christ to his Disciples, but your sorrow shall be turned into
joy, John 16.20. And who can turn it into joy but Christ only?

But you will ask me how and in what respect is Christ the Author of the joy of
his people? Beloved, I might instance in a multitude of things, but I shall
draw them all to three heads. Christ is the Author of the joy of his people,

As he is their Prophet to instruct them. The state of ignorance my Light is
sown for the righteous, and joy for them that are upright in heart.

As he is their King to rule them: you heard but now that his kingdom Psalm.
149.2. Let the Children of Zion be joyful in their King. Now as a King, my
brethren, he is many ways the author of the joy of his people, I will name a
few of them.

1. As he subdues their enemies, and gives them peace. And this he does, my
brethren, for he is the King of Salem, and the Prince of peace. And when he
does it, he is an extraordinary comfort to his people. When he subdues their
enemies within them, and so gives them inward peace. When he masters and brings
under their stubborn and rebellious Lusts and strong corruptions which are such
a daily trouble and vexation to them. O what a joy is it to his people, when
(according to his Covenant) he saves them from those enemies! then they serve
him without fear, Luke 1.75. and if without fear, then certainly with great
joy: So when he saves them from their enemies without them, and so gives them
outward peace, then he gives them joy too. Such times have still been
celebrated and observed with extraordinary gladness and rejoicing. Especially
when Babylon goes down, the arch-enemy of his Church and his people, then
Christ hears many Halelujahs, for the Lord God omnipotent reigns. Then they
that stand upon the glassie sea, are in a very chearie frame, They sing the
song of Moses and the song of the Lamb, Just and true are thy ways, O thou
King of Saints.

2. As a King Christ is the Author of the joy of his people as he gives them
his spirit. For this he does under the notion of a King, and when he does it,
then he fills them full of joy. The Spirit is the Comforter, that is his name,
so he is styled very often, to show us what his Office, work, and business is:
And therefore joy is made a companion of the Spirit, to show us that they use
to go together, Act. 13.52. The Disciples, says the Text, were filled with
joy, and with the Holy Ghost: and the Apostle tells us, that joy is one
especial fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. The fruit of the Spirit is live, joy:
And hence the Holy Ghost is called the Oil of gladness, Isa. 45.7. As it is the
Oil of gladness, it makes glad the heart of man, and it makes his face to
shine: And consequently when our King pours out this Oil upon his people, he
pours out joy and gladness with it. Then his joy is fulfilled in them, because
they have this oil from him; He is anointed with it above his fellows; it flows
down from him the head, even to the lowest members of his body.

3. As a King Christ is the Author of the joy of his people, as he dispenses
recompenses and rewards to them: For this he must do as a King too, and when he
does it, he makes them overflow with joy; and therefore he will have them to be
out of measure glad, even in the expectation of it, Luke 6.23. Rejoice and leap
for joy, says he: and why so? for great is your reward in heaven: And if they
have such cause to be transported in the expectation, how much more in the
fruition? When Christ shall say to every one of his, as Mat. 25.21. Enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord, into the self-same joy which I thy Lord and Master
entered first into, and took possession of before thee: Then indeed the joy of
Christ shall be communicated to them. Then they shall have his joy fulfilled in
them to the very utmost.



1. As he is their Priest to sacrifice, he is the Author of their joy, for by
this means he satisfies the justice of his Father for them, he frees them from
the guilt of all their sins, he reconcileth them to God: And is he not in this
respect the cause of extraordinary comfort to his people? Is it not a sad thing
for a person to live at enmity with God who made him, and will judge him in the
great day? If peace with God be so infinitely sweet, is not enmity with God
full of fear, and full of horror? is it not a doleful thing for any person to
be dead in Law, bound over to the everlasting wrath and vengeance of the great
God; in danger every hour to be haled and dragged away to execution, and to be
cast into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone? and is it not a joyful
thing to be delivered out of such a state as this is? Now this our Savior as a
Priest has done for his people, in a way of satisfaction, and so has given
them cause of exceeding great joy, as the Angel intimates when he informs the
Shepherds where he was born, and what he was to do, Luke 2.10. Behold I bring
you good tidings of great joy.

2. As Christ is his peoples Priest to intercede for them, he is the Author of
their joy: It is an extraordinary comfort to them, that Christ appears in
heaven for them in all causes, to offer up and to second their Petitions, to
plead the causes of their souls before his Father; and therefore in my Text, he
gives them as it were a taste of his future Intercession, that thereby they
might guess what he would do when he was come to heaven; and that to this end
he might replenish them with joy and comfort: These things speak I in the
world, while I am yet among them, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves, That hearing what I do now, while I am here, they might a little
guess what I am like to do hereafter, when I am once sat down at the right
hand of my Father, and so might be full of comfort, yea though I am departing
from them, while they consider with themselves, If he do so much now, surely
when he comes to heaven, he will do much more.

Is Christ the Author and the Fountain of the joy of his people? Then Go to ye
rich men, weep and howl, says the Apostle James, chap. 5.1. Why, might they
say, why should we weep, for we have all things at our hearts desire? yet weep
says the Apostle there, although not for the present misery, yet for the
misery that shall come upon you. There is no peace, and consequently no joy to
wicked men: And therefore this me thinks should cast a damp upon the mirth and
jollity of such people. There are very many of them, who though they be as
lewd, and vicious, and profane as it is possible for men to be, yet they are
out of measure cheerful, they give themselves to nothing else but mirth and
joy. Now I beseech you seriously consider with your selves, whence comes this
joy? you have it not from Jesus Christ, who is the Fountain only of the joy of
his people, and consequently it is feigned and unsound. And therefore say to
this false joy of yours, as the Wiseman counsels you, What is it that thou
do? Is there any true cause why we should be thus over-merry? have we any
reason for it? Examine it, and you shall find that it is mad laughter, as it is
styled in the Scripture: For as a mad man laughs he knows not why, even so do
wicked and ungodly men; they have no reason to rejoice, but rather to lament
and howl, and melt away in sorrow.

Is Christ the Author, etc. Then I beseech you my Brethren; do you thing can
raise in you, such as the world can neither give nor take from you: And
therefore I beseech you who are Christ's, go not to the world, and much less to
the Devil for your joy: Fetch not your comfort from any of these things below;
but go to Jesus Christ, and fetch it there, he has enough in him, and that
which he has is right. Rejoice not in the creature, but in Christ, and then
rejoice with exceeding great joy, with joy unspeakable and glorious; that when
your hearts are dilated to the utmost, when they are full up to the brim, and
even overflow with joy, it may be truly said of you, that not the joy of this
world, and much less the joy of sin, but the joy of Jesus Christ, his joy is
fulfilled in you.

JOHN 17.13. That they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.


DOCTRINE. 2. That Jesus Christ would have his people to be full of holy joy.
THis he declares to be his purpose and intention in my Text, the thing at
which he aims in making this Petition in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples,
while he was in the world among them, and while he was in their hearing: These
things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves. By which it is apparent, that Jesus Christ has a singular regard
to the comfort of his people, that he would have their hearts replenished with
the consolations which they have from him. He is not satisfied that they have
some degrees of joy begun; No, he desires to have this joy completed and
fulfilled in them to the very utmost.

And therefore in the Chapter next before, he gives them counsel and direction
how they might attain to this, how they might come to have their hearts brim
full of holy joy; by which he makes it to appear, that he for his part was
willing that it should be so, Joh. 16.24. Ask and ye shall receive, says he,
that your joy may be full. The Apostle has a phrase that looks much this way, 2
Cor. 1.5. As the sufferings of Christ abound much in us, so our consolation
also abounds by Christ; q. d. The consolation which we have by Christ, which
he dispenses, and communicates to us, is an abundant consolation. He does not
give us slight and slender comforts, his consolations are not small; No, it is
usual with him when his hand is in, to exceed and to abound, to do over and
above for his people; Be you glad and rejoice for ever, in that which I create,
says he, Isa. 65.18. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her
people a joy; Though there be no appearance of it for the present, no
probability from whence it should arise, yet I will do it out of nothing: I
will not only make them joyful, but a rejoicing and a joy; I will make them all
joy.

But not to rest in generals, I shall proceed to show you more particularly and
distinctly, that Jesus Christ has made it sufficiently to appear, that he
would have his people to be full of joy: and this he has done many ways.

By publishing the Gospel to them, which as it is a Gospel of Salvation, good
tidings of great joy. In which respect it is very notable, that when our
Savior was about to preach the Gospel, he was anointed with the Spirit, which
is called the Oil of gladness. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, says our
Savior, because he has anointed me, Isa. 61.1. And what follows? why then he
preaches good tidings to the meek, he binds up the brokenhearted, proclaims
liberty to Captives, and opening of the prison doors to those that are bound
there, which is very joyful tidings: He comforts those that are in sorrow,
appoints to those that mourn in Sion (not to those that mourn abroad, but to
those that mourn in Sion, in the Church,) beauty for ashes, the Oil of joy for
mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness: So that you
see, my Brethren, it is all joy, and all comfort. By which it is apparent, that
our Saviors special aim and drift in publishing the Gospel, is, that the
people might be full of joy. And therefore it is much to be observed, that when
our Savior entered on his Ministry, as soon as he had been baptized and tempted,
he preached his very first Sermon, upon this comfortable Gospel Text, Luke
4.17. to show what was to be the main intent and drift of his ministry.

Christ gives his people precious promises, and seals them with that they might
be full of joy. Indeed this is the great end, my Beloved, both of the promise,
and of the confirmation of it. It Is true, if Christ had been reserved, if he
had kept his purpose and intention in his breast, and in his bosom; if he had
made his people no promise, the execution of his merciful designs had not been
less sure and certain in it self, but it had been less sure to us; we had not
had the less benefit, but we had had the less comfort; For he would surely have
fulfilled his own intentions to his people, though he had never been obliged by
promise to perform them.

So, when the promises were made, there is no doubt they would have been
observed and kept, though they had never been confirmed: yet Christ has
ratified them with his own blood, as the Apostle shows us, Heb. 9.16. Not with
the blood of Bulls and Goats, but with his own most precious blood. And why
has he done this? why doubtless, that there might be nothing wanting to his
peoples comfort. The promise is not made a whit more certain by our Saviors
sealing of it with his blood, but we are made the more certain: The promise is
not made a whit the more sure, but we are the more assured, and so we have the
more comfort. What do we think of God, that he who is the God of Truth, would
not have kept his promises, that he would have broken with us, had they not
been thus confirmed? No, certainly my Brethren, he would have been firm and
constant, but we might have been assaulted with continual doubts and fears, we
should not have attained to such unshaken and such sweet assurance. And
therefore Christ has set his seal to all the promises, he has sealed them
with his blood, to this end, that we might have strong consolation, as the
Apostles phrase is, Heb. 6.18. He has shed his blood you see, that our comfort
might not be weak, but strong comfort; that our joy might not be imcompleat,
but full joy.

David taken with them? How did they fill his heart with joy? when he was
banished from them for a time, how did he melt to think upon the overflowing
Consolations he had sometimes found in them? How did his heart pant and gasp
after them? Oh with what self-consuming wishes did he long to be restored to
them? One thing have I desired of the Lord, says he, Psalm. 27.4. No question
he desired many things, but one thing he desired above the rest, that he might
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of his life, to behold the beauty
of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple where public Ordinances were
dispensed: Which shows the infinite delight he took in them. I might distinctly
show how special Ordinances serve for the comfort of the Lords people; I will
bring them to my Mountain, says the Lord, and make them joyful in my house of
prayer, Isa. 56.7. So for the word, Jer. 15.16. Thy word was to me, says the
Prophet there, the joy and the rejoicing of my heart. With joy shall ye draw
water, says the Lord, out of the wells of salvation, Isa. 12.3. Some
understand the Ordinances by the wells in that place. You see particularly then
what the end of Christ is, in giveing Ordinances to his people, and what use
they serve for. Not only to help onward their Salvation, but their Consolation
too. By which it is apparent, that even in these dispensations he has a great
aspect upon their comfort.

that they might be full of joy: you may observe how they were overjoyed to
whom he showed himself after his resurrection from the dead, they were not able
to contain themselves. And so when Christ reveals himself to any soul at this
day, when he comes in and shows himself to it, it is sometimes almost
transported to an ecstasy of joy. Especially when he has hid himself awhile,
then such discoveries of himself are out of measure sweet and precious. When
this Sun of righteousness has been overcast awhile, so that the Saints have
walked in darkness days and years, without a glimps of this reviving light, Oh
with what inward ravishment does it break forth upon the soul again! The wife
while she enjoyes the constant presence of her loving husband, it may be thinks
not much upon it, she is not much affected with it. But if he have been long
away, so that she has not heard for many years neither where her husband is,
nor when he means to come again, and after all her fruitless expectations of
him, has resolved with her self, that out of question she shall never see him
more, and then at last, when she is wholly our of hopes, in strikes her husband
on a sudden at the door, she is not able to contain her self for joy, his
presence is incomparably sweet and pleasing to her. Even so when poor
distressed souls have waited long for Christ, and thought that they should
never see him more with comfort, and then at length he comes and shows himself
to them; his gracious presence is extremely precious; He makes them full of joy
with his countenance, as the expression is, Acts 2.28.

Christ sends the Comforter to his people, that they might be full of Come, be
not troubled, says our Savior, I will send you another Comforter that shall
abide with you for ever, John 14.16. I have been a Comforter to you, I confess;
but seeing I am ready to depart from you, I will not leave you comfortless; no,
I will send you another Comforter, one that shall comfort you as much as I have
done, and one that shall stick to you too, and shall not leave you, as I am
about to do, but shall abide with you for ever. So that you see one special end
of Christ in sending down the Holy Ghost into the hearts of his people; is to
comfort them and cheer them; to be to them not only a spirit of Sanctification,
but a spirit of Consolation, and so discovers that he has a great regard to
the joy of his people.

Christ gives deliverance to his people, that they may be full of joy. Isa.
66.5. That is the End and Drift of his Appearance.

Christ has purchased Heaven for his people, that they might be full of For
Heaven, as it is a place of the height of holiness, so it is a place of the
height of happiness. Here indeed we are in Bochim, in a place of weeping; we go
through a vale of tears, and digg up Wells, but they are of salt water, the
rain also fills the pools. But when we are arrived at Heaven, we shall weep no
more, but all our tears shall be wiped from our eyes. We shall not have a
wrinkle in our faces, nor a tear upon our cheeks, nor a sad thought upon our
hearts, but all shall be smooth and clear and sweet, and that for ever. Then we
shall be full of joy; Christ's joy shall be fulfilled in us, yea we shall have
the fullness of joy, Psalm 16. ult. Indeed full joy imports nothing but enough
to fill us, so much as we are capable of, as is commensurate to our capacity,
as we are able to receive. But on the other side the fullness of joy imports
all the measures and degrees of it; So that there can be nothing added to it;
there is nothing wanting to it to make it absolute in all respects; It is not
to be raised higher any way; And this has Christ prepared and purchased for
us. By these things it is evident that Jesus Christ would have his people to be
full of holy joy.

But wherefore will he have it to be so? Why would he have his people to be
full of holy joy?

Out of self-respect he would have it to be so, because by reason of the my
text, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves: So upon the other
side, their joy is his joy. And as there is a social glory of the head and of
the members; as the School-expression is; as Christ is glorified in the glory
of his people, 2 These. 1.12. so there is a social joy of the head and of the
members; Christ rejoices in the joy of his people. The Comfort of the members
redoundeth also to the Comfort of the head. As Christ delights in the
prosperity, so in the joy of his people. When they are joyful, he rejoices
over them with joy, and joyeth over them with singing, as his own expression
is, Zeph. 3.17.

Mat. 5.4. That uses to be first with them, they use to begin there; But then
they do not use to end there. And therefore it is added presently, for they
shall be comforted. Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted:
And Christ would have their comfort to be answerable to their sorrow: That as
his sufferings have abounded in them, their consolation also may abound by him,
as the Apostle speaks, 2 Cor. 1.5. Indeed they go forth weeping, bearing
precious seed, as you may see, Psalm. 126.6. They sow in showry weather, in a
weeping time. In such a time did David sow the seed of true repentance for his
sin; he wept so much that he made his bed to swimm, and watered his Couch with
his tears: In such a time did Peter sow the same see; in a time of bitter
weeping, Mat. 26. ult. But then the harvest makes them ample recompense, for
all the dark and sad and showry weather in the sowing time. They come again
with joy, and they bring their sheaves with them. They scatter it by grains,
but they gather it by sheaves; they have twenty, thirty, forty, yea an hundred
fold for one.

So that if any now should ask me, You say that Christ would have his people to
rejoice; but what? would he not have them mourn too? Yes he would have them
mourn, but in order to rejoicing. Sorrow is an unperfect passion, and is not
for it self, but for some higher use, as all the rest of the declining passions
or affections are. As hatred is for love, and fear for confidence, so sorrow
also is for joy, unto which it is subservient. As lancing is not for it self,
but for ease and remedy: and as a potion is not properly for sickness (though
it cause it for a season) but for health: so sorrow is for joy, and joy is the
end of sorrow in the Saints. And Christ intends it to be so; You shall be
sorrowful (says Christ to his Disciples) but your sorrow shall be turned into
Joy, John 16.20. He gives to them that mourn in Zion, beauty for ashes, the oil
of gladness for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of
heaviness, Isa. 61.3. The ransomed of the Lord go out lamenting, but they
return to Zion with Songs and everlasting Joy upon their heads, Isa. 35. ult.

Cor. 2.4. And I appeal for this to those whose spirits are oppressed with
sadness and dejection, whether it do not make them indisposed to duty, unfit to
hear, unfit to pray, and in a word unfit for any part of Christ's service. But
holy joy upon the other side dilates the heart, it spreads it, and it widens
it, and consequently does not only make it fit for duty, but it makes it large
in duty. It makes it to abound, and to exceed in every service that is suitable
to joy; It carries it beyond the ordinary rate. And therefore Jesus Christ
would have his people to be full of joy, that they may be full of fruit, and
that they may abound in his service.

Is it so that Jesus Christ would have his people full of holy Joy? who vexed
the righteous soul of Lot from day to day with their filthy conversation. But
yet this difference we may observe, they did not their prodigious villainies of
purpose to disquiet Lot (for ought we find) What think we, shall their portion
be, my brethren, then, who pass the Sodomites in villainy, whose wicked deeds
are yet set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire?

Is it so that Jesus Christ would have his people full of holy Joy?

Be conversant and studious in the word of Christ. There is the The statutes of
the Lord are right, says David, rejoicing the heart, Psalm. 19.8. Through
comfort of the Scriptures we have hope, says Paul, Romans 15.4. (Philosophers
indeed have taught us many ways to fence and fortify our hearts against
sorrow.) But when the Lord shall set afflictions home upon the soul, and put a
sting into them too, there is nothing in the world that can cement and cheer
us, but the comfort that is fetched out of the Scriture. We may run in our
distress to other means as Saul when he was with a melancholy humor to the
minstrel; but we shall find that nothing goes the right way, and that we grasp
at nothing but some empty succors of contentment, unless we comfort our selves
with these words, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Thessalonians. 4. ult. David was cut
short of nothing that the world could have afforded to revive his drooping
spirit; yet he professes freely, that he must have fainted unless he had been
staid with better comfort: Unless thy Word had been my comfort, I should have
perished in my affliction, Psalm. 119.92. And in another place he cries out,
Remember thy Word unto thy servant, upon which then have caused me to hope;
this is my comfort, my only comfort in my trouble, Psalm. 119.49, 50. And
therefore at this Fountain let us draw if we mean to have comfort; but chiefly
let us wait upon the public preaching of the Word of God, which is called the
Ministry of reconciliation, in which there are divulged glad tidings of good
things, which should carry something in the power and efficacy of it to work
joy: For God does commonly dispense it rather by the way of hearing them by the
way of reading the Scriptures: And hence says David, Make me to hear of joy
and gladness, that so the bones that thou have broken may rejoice, Psalm. 51.8.
It is the Public Ordinance, it is the Public Ordinance that is the
Interpreter one of a thousand that comforts the dejected soul, as you may see,
Job 33.23.

there is fullness of all joy and pleasures for evermore, into which you that
are Christ's, as soon as you are past through the veil of tears, shall enter, and
there continue and abide for ever: There is the place where you shall sigh and
weep, and mourn no more, where all your tears will be wiped away from your
eyes; and surely did you think upon this joy with which you shall be filled
there to overflowing, this would preserve you here from being swallowed up
with overmuch sorrow; we rejoice, says the Apostle. How? not in the fruition;
No, in the hope of the glory of God, Romans 15.4. Indeed the Saints of God while
they compass and carry their afflictions according to their present state, are
very pensive and disconsolate, and so at once they do an injury to Christ, who
has reserved such precious comforts for them in the world to come: And to
themselves who have received good assurance that they shall certainly enjoy
them in their season; but did they walk by faith, and not by sight; did they
not look so much upon the difficulties that they meet with in the way, but on
the things that are not seen, the invisible pleasures of which they shall be
made partakers in the end, they should soon find cause enough of joy
unspeakable and glorious; yea, even amidst the greatest tribulation of this
present life; you see how frolike the poor Worldling is, if he have gotten a
few thousand pounds, and built a goodly house, and bought a little earth about
it; and yet his title to it is so uncertain and unsound, that the very
following night for ought he knows, the Lord may turn him out of all, and take
away his soul from him, and make him roar in Hell before the morning. But you
who by the hand and seal, and earnest of the Lord himself, have a most certain
title to that happiness and joy which neither tongue of men or Angels can
express, if you have but a wicked disobedient child, a froward wife, a sickly
body, or a low estate, do waste away your lives in heaviness and discontent,
and so you undervalue heaven, and the incomparable riches of Christ's mercy to
your souls. And whence proceeds this, but from the fleshiness of your corrupt
hearts, while you walk by sense only? and therefore I beseech you, take a
little pains to make your selves conceive and understand your happiness, and
spend a little time upon the contemplation of the blessedness that is reserved
for you in the heavens, and this will draw and swallow up your present sorrows
and afflictions.

Is it so that Jesus Christ would have his people full of holy joy? you his joy
fulfilled in your selves; for you must know my Brethren, that as there is a
kind of joy that is a fruit and effect of the Spirit, as the Apostle Paul
styles it, Gal. 5.22. so there is another kind that is a fruit and effect of
the flesh; there is a laughter that is madness, a rejoicing that is not good,
as the Apostle has it, Jam. 4.16. And nulla est verior miseria quam falsa
laetitia: There is no truer misery then false joy and feigned felicity. A very
hypocrite may have his raptures and flashes of exceeding comfort. The second
ground you know received the Word of God with joy; and those that followed John
the Baptist, rejoiced in his sight; and such as after fall away, may find a
kind of taste and sweetness in the Word of God, and in the powers of the world
to come. And therefore we had need to prove the joy and comfort that we have,
whether it be Christ's joy, the joy which he works in his people by his Spirit.
The marks to try it may be such as follow.

The joy of Christ which he works by his Spirit, is chiefly moved Act. 14.17.
But this is as if we rejoiced not, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Cor. 7.30. it
is not worthy to be named with the joy that arises from the sense of the
favor of God and spiritual blessings conferred on our souls. Here then
examine, my Beloved, when your joy is most; when you are freed from some
affliction, or when you have obtained conquest over some corruption? when
inward grace, or else when outward wealth, when Corn and Wine, and Oil
increases? Alas, how evidently do the greatest part of men discover the
unfoundness of their joy? who take abundantly more comfort in these outward
things, the thriving of their Trades, their speeding of their pleasures and
past-times, then in the thriving of the means of grace, or any other thing that
most especially concerns Gods glory or the Churches good? They make it to
appear where lies the toot and Fountain of their joy, and consequently of what
kind it is, which if they be deprived of their riches, or honors, their hearts
like Nabal dye within them, their joy is dashed, and their comfort gone.
Whereas the Saint of Christ whose heart is filled with spiritual joy, retains
it in a measure in the loss of earthly things, and professes with the Prophet
Habbakuk, chap. 3.17. Though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall
there be any fruit in the Vine, if the labor of the Olive fail, and the field
yield no meat; if the Flock be cut off from the fold, and there be no Herd in
the stall, yet I will rejoice in the Lord; yea, I will joy in the God of my
salvation.

For our rejoicing, says the Apostle, is this, the testimony of our
conscience, 2 Cor. 1.12. There is as Barnard styles it, Conscientia mala and
quieta, an evil conscience that is quiet, which being lulled asleep by Satan,
says nothing to disquiet him that owns it, and so he lives as jocund and as
metry for a time as he whose heart most really acquitteth him from any thing
that may disturb or interrupt his joy. But yet this kind of comfort, beause it
comes from nothing else but a Vacation in the Court of Conscience, (if I may
call it so) a respit of the accusations there, is most uncertain and unfound.
As Soon as term begins again, when Satan as he sees occasion, shall set the
sins of such a man before his face, when conscience shall awaken and accuse,
that joy and comfort will be turned into sorrow, yea into such tormenting pangs
of horror, that no tongue is able to express. But if thy joy arise from a
conscience testifying good, that in simplicity and sincerity of heart, thou
have had thy conversation in the world, this is the joy that Christ would have
fulfilled in thee.

Paul disswadeth as unsound, Gal. 6.4. Let every man prove his own work, and he
shall have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.

Now men are said to rejoice in another, especially in two cases: As first,
when they compare themselves with such as are extremely vicious and profane,
and finding that themselves are not so bad as many others are, they cheer and
comfort up themselves with this, as the Pharisee did, I thank thee God, says
he, that I am no extortioner, etc. I am not as other men are, nor as this
Publican, Luke 18.11. and yet they may be bad enough for all this. And
secondly, when men take comfort only in the good opinion that others have
conceived of them, and not in any good that has a true and real being in
themselves. And this St. Paul suggesteth is a false deceitful joy, and
therefore presses every man to prove his own work, to sift and try his own
actions; and if on trial they be good indeed, then he has ground and matter to
rejoice in himself and not in another

And now my Brethren, are there not too many such among us, who when they look
on drunkards, whoremongers, blasphemers, and men of the most infamous and
vicious lives, that pass them and exceed them in profaneness, take joy and
comfort in themselves, but never prove their own works, their own lives. And
thus while they compare themselves with others more loose and vicious then
themselves, they rejoice in another and not in themselves; they think
themselves are very good, because others are more evil. And even as Jerusalem
justified Sodom, Ezekiel. 16.5. so drunkards and adulterers justify them, and are
occasion of their joy. Others there are who finding that they have obtained a
good opinion and repute with others, and that they are approved by men of
judgment, and of conscience too, are comforted in this exceedingly; and here
is the foundation of their Joy: Oh such a godly man, or such a Minister
approves of them, and is familiar to them; and hence it comes to pass that when
they once begin to lose the good opinion and conceit of men, they are like
persons stracken in the head, their joy is blasted and their comfort gone,
because the ground and matter of it was without, and not within. O then let us
endeavor my Beloved, to have our comfort in our selves; and if it have a
spring and fountain in the heart, it will not fail; there will be a sufficient
supply of joy and comfort there, though men neglect us, and cast away their
good opinion of us: Whereas if it proceed from that which is without us, it
will be like a standing Pool that is not nourished with the Spring, but with a
sudden fall of rain; as soon as heat of Summer comes, away it dries and is seen
no more.

And now my Brethren, having proved your joy, and found it to be right, the joy
of Christ, which he would have to be fulfilled in you, preserve it as your
lives, and see that neither sin nor Satan steal away this jewel from you; and
to this end, you must especially beware of sinning against Conscience, which is
the subject and the seat of joy. As long as you do well to Conscience,
Conscience will say well to you; but if you wound your Conscience with the
guilt of sin, Conscience will wound you with the horror and the sting of sin;
and if by sinning against light you waste your Conscience in regard of grace,
Conscience will waste you in regard of peace and comfort: yea, it may set you
on the rack of such affrightments as no tongue is sufficient to express. What
was the cause that David cried so often in his bones, and in his heart, that
they were broken, that it was melted in the midst of his bowels, but because he
sinned so grossly against the light of his own understanding, and the
convictions of his own conscience? But if in sincerity you have your
conversation in the world, this will be your rejoicing. And if you walk
according to the rule, peace shall be upon you as upon the Israel of God. This
joy of Christ shall be fulfilled in you, and your joy shall none take from you.

And thus we have dispatched the first and second Observation; Christ is the
Author and Original of the joy of his people; Jesus Christ would have his
people to be full of holy joy.

DOCTRINE 3. Their clear and perfect knowledge of his intercession for them, is
one especial means to fill them full of this joy.
It is the means our Savior uses in my text, and certainly it is available to
this end. That he might cheer the hearts of his Disciples, and replenish them
with comfort, he lets them hear him pleading for them to his Father. He does it
in their presence, and while they are listening to him, as being very well
assured that this will make their joy abound, and overflow the banks. And this
is the account he gives his Father of the business, having been very earnest
with him to keep them through his own name, as he himself had done, as long as
he had been among them, and urged many things in their behalf. These things,
says he, I speak in the world, before I come away to thee, I speak them here
among these men for whom I am a Suitor to thee, in the ears of my Apostles and
Disciples, who are by and listen to me, that being witnesses themselves to my
importunate and earnest intercession for them, they may by this means, have my
joy fulfilled in themselves.

True, you will say; this was an extraordinary comfort to them for the present;
but what was this to them after Christ was gone from them? Or what it this to
us in these times?

Yes, my beloved, it was much to them, even after Christ's departure for the
fulfilling of their joy: For when he was ascended into heaven, they could on
all occasions, reflect upon the prayer that they heard him make in their
behalf, while he was conversant upon the earth: when they were in any fear or
any danger, when they were even ready to be overcome with grief and sorrow,
they could consider with themselves, We perfectly remember that while our
Master was among us, we heard him earnestly beseech his Father for us, that he
would keep us, and that he would Comfort us, and that he would Sanctify us,
and that he would save us, (as all those things and many more you shall observe
along the Current of his prayer here,) and we shall surely find the fruit of it
in such a time as this is. Yea, we have reason to believe that what he did for
us, in a way of intercession, while he was here upon the earth, he does the
same in heaven to this day, and will do till we follow him to that place. And
why then should we not be cheerful in the midst of these troubles? And this
our Savior clearly aims at in the words, These things speak I in the world,
while I am yet among them, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves:
That hearing what I do now while I am here, they might a little guess what I am
like to do hereafter, when I am once sat down at the right hand of my Father
to be an everlasting Intercessor or for them; and therefore might be full of
comfort, yea though I am departing from them, while they consider with
themselves, If he do so much now, surely when he comes to heaven, he will do
much more.

And as for us who live in these times, it is a means to fill us full of
comfort too, Christ's speaking these things in the world, and so giving us a
taste of his future intercession: For hence it comes to pass that this prayer
of our Savior being uttered in the ears of his Apostles, it is pend
accordingly, and left upon record in Scripture. And so we have a specimen, a
form, a model of our Saviors intercession for his people, which he has left
behind him, for us to look upon on all occasions, and to gather comfort from.
What he does in heaven for us, we are not able fully and exactly to discover.
But this he did on earth before he went; he did it openly, and there is a
memorial of it, for ever, in the Church. And by this we may conjecture what he
does in heaven for his people at this day, and will do to the worlds end. For
certainly he is not less regardfull of them now in Heaven (which is the most
proper place of acting the second part of his Mediatorship which consists in
intercession) then he was upon the earth.

So that whatever our Condition be, how sad or sorrowful soever, if we would
know our Saviors intercession what it is for us in heaven, we may survey this
counterpane thereof on earth, which is recorded for this very end, That we may
have an exemplar, and a pattern of it continually lying by us in the Scripture
to have recourse unto, and to fetch overflowing comforts from in all cases.

Now to clear this a little further to you, I shall proceed to show you in a
few particulars, that the perfect knowledge of our Saviors intercession is one
especial means to fill his people full of holy joy.

It is a means to comfort them exceedingly in reference to all the oppositions
Israel, when they had got a Champion to stand up for them, against the daring
insolences of Goliath, who had so long defied the armies of the living God? It
made them even shout for joy. And so it is a comfort to the poor soul, when he
has been long contending with the world which sets upon him mightily with all
its blandishments and its allurements on the one side, and with its threats and
persecutions on the other side, and with the Devil who furiously assaults him
with his fiery darts, and his violent temptations, and with his own corruptions
and his lusts, that war against the soul as the Apostle speaks: And when he is
about to faint and sink away, he considers with himself, Why though I have all
these against me, yet I have Jesus Christ for me, and he is pleading-hard on my
behalf, that I may not have the worst in these Encounters, but that I may be
more then a Conqueror. I seem to hear him saying to me, These enemies of thine
have desired to winnow thee, and to destroy thee, but I have prayed for thee
that thy faith may not fail; Thy courage and thy strength may fail a little,
but thy faith shall never fail. When Christ was here upon the earth, he
earnestly besought his Father for me, that he would keep me through his own
name: and what he did on earth, I know he does in heaven much more; and he
cannot be denied. So that I am as safe as the Almighty power of God can make me.

Oh what a matchless comfort and encouragement is this! The poor perplexed soul
but now was tossing on the boystrous waters of violent temptations, and of
raging passions, and of furious lusts, and even ready to be cast away: But now
as David speaks, the soul is glad because it is at rest, and it is brought to
the desired haven. Ah my beloved, when a man who is mightily assaulted by
corruptions and temptations, and persecutions and afflictions, and when the
stones and buffets are about his soul, can look up as Stephen did, Acts 7.56.
and see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of
God, this cannot choose but fill him full of comfort. Nay says the soul, If
thou art there pleading for me to the Father, and standing up in my defense, I
know it is impossible that I should perish or miscarry.

Satan for his part, is the grand accuser of the brethren, and he objecteth
heinous things against us, and lays it on with full load; And then our
consciences perhaps accuse us, as fast as any of the other two. They are not
able to gainsay the allegations, either of Satan or the Law, but are forced to
acknowledge, that all the curses that are written in the Book of God, are very
justly due to us. What shall we do, or how shall we keep up our hearts from
sinking into utter desperation in such a case as this is? As for our parts, we
have nothing to allege in, or of, or from our selves, why the sentence of the
Law should not be pronounced against us; But this is that which fills us full
of Comfort, that Jesus Christ has enough to say for us, and that he sits in
heaven for this very end to make intercession for us, when any thing comes in
against us there, to appear in our behalf, and to plead our cause. If any man
sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, says the Apostle, 1 John 2.2. and he
is the propitiation for our sins. We have such an Advocate as is a
propitiation: So that when Satan, and when sin accuses, and makes a dreadful
noise against us, he can wipe all off again with one word: Says he. This
person has offended, I confess; but what of that? There is a full propitiation
made, it is well known that I have done it; and what has any one to say to
this man? If he have out-sinned my satisfaction, even let him be condemned. But
if not, let him be acquitted; or what do I sit here for? How can this choose
but ravish and transport the soul into an Ecstasy of joy, and make it to
triumph with the Apostle, Romans 8.33. Who can lay anything to my charge? who is
he that condemns? Let me but see the man that durst to do it. So that no
marvail though our Savior Christ be called (...) in the forecited place, which
signifies both a Comforter and Advocate: To show that Jesus Christ does
comfort us exceedingly, by undertaking for us as an Advocate, and pleading for
us with the Father.

to the Majesty of God. When we are so deserted, and our hearts are so shut up,
that (as Hezekiah once) we cannot speak in prayer, but only chatter like a
Swallow, Isa. 38.14. when we know not what to say, nor what to plead, we are so
barren; when we are destitute of matter and expression, this puts us many times
into a very sad condition and overwhelms our hearts with sorrow; As David once
complained in such a case, Psalm. 77.3. I remembered God, says he, I was
troubled; I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed. But now, my brethren, is
it not a matter of exceeding comfort to consider that we have an Intercessor to
help us out with all this? That he puts in to God the Father for us, and takes
our Suites into his hands; That he excuses what is wanting in our prayers, and
supplies it in his own; That he is lively there where we are dull; that he is
quick where we are flat; that he is full where we are short. My Clyent, says
our Advocate, means this and this; this is the meaning of the spirit in him. He
is not able to express himself as many others can, but this is that which he
intends and aims at. His words are not so ready and so apt, but he has as
sincere a heart as the most voluble and fluent of them all: and he is one for
whom I have laid down my life, and shed my blood, for whom I have deserved all
the good that he can ask and stand in need of; And therefore I beseech thee
Father, let him have what he desires, give him a speedy and a gracious answer
for my sake. Ah my beloved, is it not able to fill our hearts brimfull of joy,
when we remember that we have such an Advocate as this is?

The knowledge of our Saviors Intercession for his people, is a means These.
3.10. and so there is in all the rest which spring from faith. For if there be
a failing in the root, there cannot choose but be a failing in the branches.
And this is that which makes us walk so heavily and sadly many times, when we
consider with our selves how slender the degrees and measures of our graces
are, so that we know not where to find comfort. What shall we do in such a case
to keep our spirits from despondency? Why truly among many other ways, this is
a very special one to fix our thoughts upon the intercession of our Savior for
us, and to consider seriously with our selves, that this is one great business
that he urges to his Father, that he would sanctify his people; That he would
give them out more grace, and more holiness. This prayer of our Savior in my
text, as I have hinted formerly, is but a Counterpane of the perpetual
intercession that he makes for his in heaven. And it consists especially of two
branches, which comprehend the two main things that he desires of his Father
for his people, Preservation and Sanctification. The latter he is large upon,
sanctify them with thy truth, and so on. They were sanctified before, for they
were not of the world, and he desires they might be sanctified yet more; That
they might have larger measures of all the graces of the spirit. And is not
this an extraordinary comfort to those who are but meanly furnished, and who
have but a slender stock of grace, that Jesus Christ is always interceding to
his Father in their behalf for a more full supply? It was a suit that he begun
on earth, and he is still pursuing it in heaven to this day, and will do to the
worlds end, he will never give it over; so that we may be confident we shall
have such degrees of holiness and grace bestowed upon us, as are necessary for
us.

etc. as it assures us of his dear love to us, and his tender care of us. What
our Savior does in heaven in a way of Intercession, if it were unknown to us,
though it might profit us and benefit us very much, it could not comfort as at
all. But when we know that Jesus Christ has such a singular regard to us, and
that his heart and his affections work toward us so sweetly, and so strongly
now he is in heaven, at so great a distance from us (I mean as he is man) that
he is always taking all advantages, to further and promote our business with
his Father, and speaking to him upon all occasions for our good; and in a word,
that he is so extremely kind and loving to us, so infinitely tender of our
welfare every way; This cannot choose if it be duly weighed, but fill our
hearts up to the brim, and make them overflow with joy.

etc. If then we would abound in this heavenly affection, let us exactly study,
and thoroughly p^y into our Saviors Intercession, that we may know as much of
it as we are able to attain to. We are here in an unquiet and unstable world,
in which we meet with many causes of discomfort from within, and from without,
and many times they take extremely deep upon us, so as almost to make our lives
a burden to us. Now if we would be free from such distempers, let us endeavor
to look more into our Saviors Intercession. And if we understand it well, it
will fill us full of comfort, that will swell high, exceedingly above all the
afflictions of this present life. Indeed the intercession of our Savior is of
it self a large volume, too much for us to read over, and that Volume sealed
too, shut up in heaven, that we cannot open it, or look into it: But he has
given us a brief compendium, and a short abridgement of it, in the Prayer that
he made for his Apostles and Disciples, and in them for all the Church, that is
or shall be to the worlds end, that we may read it and acquaint our selves with
it: He spoke that prayer in the world, that they might hear it from him, and so
might have his joy fulfilled in them: And that we might hear it from them, and
so might have his joy fulfilled in us. In which regard, my Brethren, it is left
upon record in public in the Church for ever, that all his people might have
recourse thereto, on all occasions for their Comfort. And therefore when we are
in any trouble, when sorrow seizes deep upon us, let us study this prayer in
all the parts and branches of it, that from thence we may conjecture what he
does in our behalf, now he is fitting at the right hand of his Father. And this
let us depend upon, that if he spoke one word in our behalf in any case while
he was here upon earth, he speaks a hundred for us now he is heaven. And truly
if this Counterpane of our Saviors Intercession were dived into and studied
more, there would be more holy joy among the Saints. Their troubles and their
sorrows would be less, and they would be more full of comfort then they are.

JOHN 17.14. I have given them thy Word, and the world has hated them.


AND thus of the first argument, with which our Savior presses and enforces
his Petition to his Father in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples, that he
himself would undertake the keeping of them: Which has been taken as you may
remember, from his own effectual preservation of them, during the time that he
had been among them: Together with the reason which he interposes why he made
this Petition for them in the world.

Proceed we to the second argument with which he backs it, and it is taken from
the place in which he was about to leave them, wherein he was assured they
would stand in need of special preservation from his Father: And therefore he
desires him to keep them through his own Name, because our Savior for his own
part, was even ready to depart from them, and to abandon them in such a place,
where they would be in danger every day, and every hour, as being hated and
maligned upon all hands, and that for the truths sake. I have given them thy
Word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world.

So that the words have in them a discovery of the condition and estate of
Christ's Disciples in the world, together with the causes of it. First the
condition and estate of Christ's Disciples in the world is mentioned here,
although not in the first place: and it is such as cannot but be grievous and
uncomfortable to them; For they are very ill beloved; yea, they are hated
universally almost; the world has hated them, says Christ. And then the
causes of it are annexed, by what means it comes to pass that they are so
maligned in the world; and this is not for any evil that is in them, or done
by them. But either first, because they receive the Word of God, not into their
knowledge only, but into their practice and obedience too; I have given them
thy Word, and the world has hated them: So that it hates them for the Word,
and for the Truths sake. And secondly because they are not of this world, but
of another; therefore the world is so envenomed, and so maliciously bent
against them: The world has hated them, because they are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world. They like them much the worse, because they are
in this respect like me. At this time let us look into the condition and estate
of Christ's Disciples in the world, the world hates them.

The world is taken diverse ways; I think more differently then any other phrase
almost in Scripture. Sometimes we find it used for elect and sanctified;
sometimes for reprobate and unsanctified persons. Sometimes for the elect and
sanctified, as you may see that place for instance, Joh. 4.42. This is the
Christ the Savior of the world, that is, of all the chosen and elect of God,
not limited to Jewry only, but wheresoever scattered over all the world. God
was in Christ (says the Apostle) reconciling the world to himself, 2 Cor.
5.19. Not all the world at large, but all his chosen people, whatsoever, or
wheresoever living in the world. Sometimes the world is taken for reprobate and
unsanctified men: So that, The world lies in wickedness, 1 John 5.19. as Austin
intimates the distinction, there is mundus mundus, and mundus inmundus. Indeed
it is so differently taken, that sometimes they that are hated, are the world;
and sometimes they that hate them, are the world: And in this latter sense, you
are to understand it in my Text: The world, that is, the reprobate and wicked
of the world, has hated them, says: our Savior to his Father; The^, whom?
why them whom thou have given me, as you may see, if you look a little back on
the foregoing verses. Them whom thou have bestowed upon me, and whom I have
received and entertained for my Disciples, them has the world hated. So that
you see,

DOCTRINE. It is the manner of the world to hate them that are Christ's
Disciples.
They that belong to Jesus Christ are usually but ill-beloved among ungodly and
unsanctified men. The world is generally set against them, to malign them and
oppose them, and do them all the spite and mischief that they can. So it was in
Christ's time, and so it will be to the worlds end: And therefore it is made the
Epithet of wicked men that they are such as hate the righteous; you may see
that place for instance, Psalm. 34.21. They are not only angry with them, but
they hate them, and that to the very death. They desire their extirpatation and
destruction, that they may have no more a being; no nor so much as the memorial
of a being, if it might be possible, that their name may be no mere remembered,
Psalm. 83.4. And therefore you shall find the Saints complaining often of the
hatred of the world, and of the rage and malice of ungodly men against them.
And Christ fore-warning his Disciples what they must expect in this world, You
shall be hated, says our Savior, of all Nations, Mat. 24.9. That seems to be
very much; yet in another place he goes further; You shall be hated of all men;
you must conceive it of all worldly wicked men, Mat. 10.22. I shall add no more
for proof; you see it is the manner of the wicked world, etc.

But what should be the reason why they hate them so? It may be you will ask as
David once, What has the righteous done? what evil has he wrought? what have
Christ's Disciples done, that they are so maligned in the world? Why truly, my
Beloved, if you would know the reason of it, it is not for any evil they have
done, that they are so railed at, and that they have so much ill will on all
hands; there is no just and real cause of all this hatred which they suffer
from the world: No, my Beloved, as they hated Christ himself without a cause,
as David once complained as his Type, Psalm. 35.19. so they hate Christ's
Disciples too, those that belong to Christ, without a cause, without any just
cause. So that you see here is a Doctrine, of which no man in the world can
give you one good reason. It is the manner of the wicked world to hate them
that are Christ's Disciples; but it is without reason, without any good reason:
However they have reasons to themselves, such as they are, of this hatred. And
I might give you many such reasons, more then a good many: For though there be
not any reasons why they should, yet there are many reasons why they do hate
Christ's Disciples, and I might be large upon them: But I shall confine my self
to those which Christ has mentioned in the Text it self.

The wicked world hates Christ's Disciples, because they entertain the I have
given them thy Word, and the world has hated them; as if he should have said
for that cause: I have so given them thy Word, that they have entertained it as
thy Word in their faith, and love, and practice, and obedience; and hence it is
that they are so maligned, and despitefully entreated in the world. And so it
is at this day; As long as men make no account and reckoning of the Word, as
long as they profess it only, but are not very zealous for it, nor very careful
to walk in every thing exactly by it, they may live pretty quiet with their
neighbors: But if they come once to contend, and that with earnestness for
every truth that is contained in the Word; if they will not in any case, by any
means depart in any thing from that Rule, the world will be about their ears
upon a sudden, and show a great deal of malignity and rage against them.

But why should this exasperate the world against them, you will ask me? I
cannot tell you why it should, but I will tell you why it does: For by this
means they cross the world, and they condemn and shame the world. And this is
that which sets the world so much against them.

By this means they cross the world; and this they are not able to endure,

1. First by this means they cross them in their judgments and opinions. Till
men receive the Word of God, they can in every thing conform their judgments
and opinions to the world. They can think as they do, and they can speak as
they do; they can agree and hold with them in every point, and so they walk on
lovingly together; there grows no difference or debate between them. But when
they come to entertain the Word to be their rule in every thing, both in
opinion and in conversation, now they are forced to differ from the world, to
clash with them, in many things to contradict and oppose them, and gainsay
them. And this breeds disaffection and dislike, yea enmity and hatred against
them: Nay, they are forced sometimes, if they will keep exactly to the Word of
God, to cross the world in those opinions which they are most intent upon, and
for which they are most eager; and this they can by no means bear from them: As
they that entertained Christ to be the Son of God, and the Savior of the
world, when he was conversant upon the Earth, and in the times that followed
next after his Incarnation, Passion and Ascension, they did exceedingly enrage
the world against them: The generality of men would not endure to heat of
Christ, or the Religion that embraced and worshipped him; and therefore
whosoever undertook to own him and profess him, was sure to meet with all the
violence and rage and malice that the world could pour upon him. He might have
crossed the world in many other truths, and not have found so ill measure; but
this drew out their rage and malice to the utmost: And this is that (as I
conceive) which our Savior Christ aims particularly at in my text, I have
given them thy Word, thy Gospel Word; of that he speaks, and they have
entertained it and embraced it, and therefore the world hates them. And if you
look into the stories of the Church, you shall observe that whosoever closed
with the Gospel in those early times, and professed the faith of Christ, from
which the world was so exceedingly averse, he was exposed thereby to all the
misery that humane cruelty, etc. could devise to inflict.

But after when this Gospel Truth came to be better settled and digested in the
world, so that they were content to hear of Christ and his Religion with a
little patience, then there rose up other things in which they would not be
gainsaid: As to leap down to Luther, time, who ever stuck to him, and to the
doctrine which he taught, against the Pope and his adherents, got the world
about his ears. And so in every age, there are some passages of holy Scripture,
and the truths delivered in them, against which the world is violently bent:
and whosoever sticks to these, the world hates him out of measure, and does him
all the mischief that it can. And therefore this is called the Word of Gods
patience, Apoc. 3.10. Thou have kept the Word of my patience; that is, thou
have not only kept my Word in general, but more particularly thou have kept
those portions of my Word, and those parcels of my Truth, which must have
patience to the keeping of them. A man may keep some Truths delivered in the
Word without patience, as being universally received by all, opposed by none:
But there are others, which if a man maintain and hold them, he shall surely
suffer, he shall be persecuted for them. And he that keeps these
notwithstanding, keeps the Word of Gods patience. The patience which God works
in his people.

2. They that embrace the Word of God, as they cross the wicked world in their
opinions, so they cross them in their wills: They cannot do in every thing as
the wicked world would have them; they cannot yield to every thing, which they
obtrude and force upon them, and this is another reason why they are so
exasperated and enraged against them. Were it not for the Word of God, to which
they are resolved to yield obedience, they might comply in every thing, and so
the world and they might be very good friends. But when the Word forbids
what the world requires, and that most vehemently too perhaps, they are forced
to cross the world, and and so the Word brings the world and them out. These
men, say they, are so precise and holy, that they must have Scripture for every
thing they say or do, they will do nothing but what they have a warrant for out
of the Word of God. But we will make them stoop and yield, and we will make
them turn another leaf ere we have done: and when they cannot have their wills,
because the other cannot bend or vary from the Word of God when they are crossed
in that which they are so resolved upon, this heats the furnace of their wrath
seven times hotter then ordinary: and this the Prophet David found, Psalm.
119.161. Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but my heart stands in
awe of thy Word: Either he must have them against him, or the Word of God
against him. They threatened him if he obeyed the Word: the Word upon the other
side, that threatened if he disobeyed it. Whom did he fear most? why says the
Psalmist, My heart stands in awe of thy Word; I fear it more then I fear
them: And this was that which got him much hatred and bitter persecution too,
as you may see in that place.

3. They that receive the Word of God, as they cross the wicked world in their
opinions and their wills, so in their conversations too; they do not live and
walk as they do; their ways are of another fashion, and this is another reason
why the world is so maliciously bent against them. Were it not for the Word of
God, and the rules that it prescribes, there need to be no difference between
them and other men, and so there would be no dislike. But now they are not,
neither can they be conformed and fashiond to the world, Romans 12.2. they cannot
walk according to the course and custom of the world Ephesians. 2.2. The world runs
out exceedingly into all licentious courses, but they run not out with them.
They walk not as the Gentiles, Ephesians. 4.17. they sleep not as do others, 1 Thessalonians. 5.5. And this the world cannot abide them for, because they are so
singular, and will not do as they do.

They that receive the Word of God, as they do cross the world, so

Thus we have seen the first reason of the point; the wicked world hates
Christ's Disciples, because they entertain the Word of God, I have given them
thy Word, says Christ, etc.

There is a second also added in the Text, It is the manner of the world
because they are not of this world but of another. Therefore the world is so
envenomed, and so maliciously bent against them. The world has hated them,
says Christ, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world:
If they were of their own society, and of their own Country, they would love
them well enough, as Christ himself informs his Disciples, Joh. 15.19. If ye
were of the world, the world would love his own, but because ye are not of the
world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

etc. Here then you see one especial reason why Christ's Disciples are so
vilified and abused in the world. They dwell among a company of men that hate
them, and that to the very death. And hence it is my brethren, that they do
them all the mischief that they can: It is a wonder to us, many times, that all
the world almost should be upon the skirts of the small number that belongs to
Christ, that they should be continually perking at them, and raising scandalous
reports upon them; we know not what to make of it. Why, what is the matter, think
we, that they should be so ill-entreated, and so unworthily and basely used on
all hands? Truly nothing else but this, the world hates them; and all these
injuries, and wrongs, and molestations are the effects of that hatred.

etc. the greater cause there is of admiration at the power and mercy of the
Lord that keeps them, and preserves them, notwithstanding this hatred. Though
all the world be bitterly envenomed and enraged against them, they cannot have
their will upon them; no, they are safeguarded still, as if a little Lamb were
kept among a company of Wolves and Lions. It Is not for want of multitude or
malice in the enemies of Christ's Disciples, that they have yet a being in the
world, but by the power and goodness of a gracious God, upholding them, and
providing for their safety. This is the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our
eyes; And we shall marvail at it, and admire the Lord the more, if we consider
yet a little more distinctly but these two things.

1. The disparity in number between Christ's Disciples and them that bear such
mortal hatred to them; For Christ's Disciples they are very few, a little flock,
a small number, a petty inconsiderable company of men. But they that hate them,
and desire their ruin, are the world, a world of wicked and ungodly men. So
that you see, there are enemies enough to eat up Christ's people, (as David said
they did in his time, They eat up thy people, as a man would eat bread) to
devour them, and to bring them all to nothing in a moment. And if you do
compare them with the multitude that are against them, and consider what a
deadly and envenomed hatred they bear against them, their preservation will
appear to be a strange thing, the greater and more admirable is the power that
keeps them and upholds them in such a posture and condition as this is.

2. And as there is a great disparity in number between Christ's Disciples, and
them that bear such hatred to them, so in disposition too, which magnifies the
power that keeps them yet more. For Christ's Disciples they are frequently
compared to Sheep and Lambs, poor harmless things that are so far from being
able or desirous to offend and hurt others, that they are no ways able to
defend themselves. And they that hate them on the otherside, are compared to
Dogs, and Wolves, and Bears, and Lions. How easy is it for such strong and
cruel creatures to make a prey upon the silly Lambs? So Christ's Disciples are
resembled to a Lilly for their tenderness and softness; and they that hate them
on the other side, to Thorns for their injurious and offensive quality, Cant.
2.2. They are sharp, and rough, and boistrous; and these alas are sweet and
harmless, and how shall they subsist among them? They are not like to hurt the
world, but the world is very like to hurt them. Thorns you know, are apt to
prick, and rent and scratch; and on the other side, the Lilly by reason of her
tenderness, is very liable to wrong and very capable of such impressions. The
Greater cause there is of admiration at the power of God, by which the Church
of Christ is kept, in such a dangerous condition and estate as this is.

Is it the manner of the wicked, etc. Then surely it concerns Christ's

But since they are amongst their enemies that hate them, it stands them very
much upon to look exactly to their words and ways. And that upon a few
Considerations.

For, First, if there be any thing to be misconstrued, they will be sure David
speaks) and mistake your actions too, and turn them all the wrong way. Because
they hate you, they will lie upon the the catch, that they may pick some matter
of exception and reproach against you. And if there be but any show, or color
for it, they will glory out of measure as you may see Michal for an instance
when David danced before the Ark. And therefore David calls them his observers,
Psalm. 5.8. for so the Hebrew word imports, and so you find it in the Margin.
And if they once get any matter by the end, Oh with what Joy and exultation
will they vent it! Aha, say they, our eyes has seen it, our ear has heard it.
And therefore we have need of wisdom, yea the wisdom of an Angel, to know how
to demean our selves before such persons as these are.

Seconly, And as by reason of their hatred of you, they will be very Titus 2.8.
as being disappointed of that which they expected and desired. For shame you
know, is the fruit of disappointment, that they may be ashamed having no evil
thing to say of you.

If they can mis-interpret any thing you say or do, they will not only

So that it is not a sufficient Plea to say, that we are very well persuaded
that we have done no evil, and therefore if they make an ill construction of
it, the fault is theirs, and we must bear it, we cannot help it, we must endure
their scandals and reproaches; No, my beloved, this is not enough, it ought to
be our care, as much as lies in us, to prevent those ill Constructions, and to
take away occasion from those that long and seek for it. For these reproaches
do not rest in us. If we alone did bear them, if they did reach no further then
our persons, it were well. But God and his Religion, and his Gospel, are
miserably wounded through our sides, by this occasion; and therefore we must
see that we do nothing, as far as it is possible, from whence these enemies of
ours may take advantage to wound such precious things as these are.



etc. Then let it not seem strange to Christ's Disciples, if they be hated in
the world, if they be wronged and injured and abused, on all hands. Let them
not look upon it as a thing to be admired and wondered at, if they be very
coursely used and very ill entreated here. If they be always troubled and
distressed, if they be always followed and persued with spightfull
molestations, and vexations, let them not think much of it, but let them look
upon it as an ordinary thing, and let them seriously consider that they could
expect no other, living in such a place, and with such company as they do. Only
to stay them and support them in such a troublesome condition, let them take
notice of a few things.

1. God and Jesus Christ love you, and love you very dearly, though the world
hate you. And whether do you think the love of God will do you most good, or
the hatred of the world will do you most hurt? I beseech you my beloved, set
the one in opposition to the other, and when you are disquieted at any time, to
think how you are hated and maligned and abused in the world, consider on the
other side, how you are beloved of God; how dear are you to Jesus Christ, who
loved you and gave himself for you. And if you weigh the matter well, you will
find infinitely greater cause to cheer your hearts with his love, then to
deject them with the worlds hatred.

2. Jesus Christ himself was in the same condition with you when he lived in
the world. You fare no worse then he did. And this is that which he himself
propounds to his Apostles and Disciples to the very same end, John 15.18. If
the world hate you, says Christ, you know that it hated me before it hated
you. Are you hated in the world? let not that seem strange to you; you know
your selves, it hated me before you, or else it hated me who am before you; It
hated me (...) It hated me prius, or it hated me priorem, for it may be both
ways rendered. It hated me before you, in regard of time, or me who am before
you in regard of Dignity, as Calvin very well observes upon the place.

And should not this Consideration quiet us and make us patient? we are hated
in the world; why so was Jesus Christ himself. Why should we look to be
exempted from that to which our blessed Savior was exposed? yea, he was hated
in the first place, and we are hated after him, and in reference to him; Though
he were absolutely holy, harmless, separate from sinners, he was hated
notwithstanding. Alas, my brethren, how unholy, how faulty, how injurious many
times are we to others? And then what wonder is it that they take offense at
us? Though Christ were far above us every way, though he were our Lord and
Master, he was exceedingly maligned in the world. And why should we expect in
this regard to be above him, to fare better then he did? No, let it be
sufficient for us, that we are no worse, no nor so ill intreat-as our Lord and
Master was.

3. The hatred of the world is no impediment at all, no bar, no hindrance to
your blessedness. Indeed, it fits you rather and qualifies you for it, as Jesus
Christ himself insinuates, in his Sermon on the Mount, Mat. 5.12. Blessed are
ye when men revile you, and persecute you, and say all evil of you falsely. And
the Apostle Peter, to the same effect, 1 Pet. 4.14. says he, If you be
reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you. So that malignity and injury,
and evil usage from the world, are no way inconsistent with our happiness,
neither with our present nor our future happiness.

1. Our present happiness consists in the title that we have to Christ, the
interest we have in him, and the Communion we have with him. Can the hatred of
the world put an end to this Communion? No, says the Apostle Paul, Romans 3.35.
Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress,
or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? as it is written,
for thy sake are we killed all the day long. Nay, in all these things we are
more then Conquerours through him that loves as. For I am verily persuaded,
that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, not depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord. Nay, to say truth, Christ loves us most, and has most
communion with us, when the world is most against us. Then he is specially
present with us, as he was with Paul, Acts 18.9. and with the Martyrs in the
Dungeon, in the Stocks, in the flames. And it is certain that Christ does then
reveal himself most sweetly to his people, when the world discovers most
malignity and rage against them. So that it is not all their hatred can keep a
Christian from the love and fellowship of Jesus Christ, and so by Consequence
it cannot keep him from his present happiness.

2. And for our happiness to come, it cannot hinder that neither. It does not
lie so loose, my brethren, that all the world can take it from us. No, it is in
Gods keeping; he opens and no man shuts; he shuts and no man opens.
He opened Heaven upon Stephen, when the world was showing the utmost of its
rage against him. And verily a Christian is as near the complement and the
perfection of his happiness, when he suffers all the wrong and ignominy and
contempt that the world can pour upon him, and sometimes nearer then he is at
other times; for that may be the way to it. And hence, says Christ in the
forealledged text, Mat. 5.11. Blessed are ye when men revile you; Rejoice and
be exceeding glad, And why so? For great is your reward in heaven.

JOHN 17.15. I pray not that thou should take them out of the world, etc.


AND thus far of the second Argument with which our Savior presses and
enforces his Petition to his Father in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples,
that he would keep them through his own name, viz. because our Savior for his
own part was even ready to depart from them, and to abandon them in such a
place where they were hated universally almost; the world has hated them,
says Christ.

Why then a man would think the only way were to remove them out of such a
place, where they are so ill beloved, and so maligned upon all hands. If the
world hate them, because they are not of the world, what should they do there
any longer? the best way were to take them thence, and to translate them to a
place where they are likely to have more quiet. No, says our Savior, I disown
that; that is not the intent and drift of my Petition, I pray not that thou
should take them out of the world, etc.

So that these words my brethren, are an Explication of that which is delivered
in the former verse, that it might not be mistaken. Not that our Savior was
afraid his Father would mistake his meaning, but he knew they might mistake
him, who heard him speaking to his Father. And therefore as a learned Writer
notes upon the text, he speaks unto his Father as a man, for men's sake, because
he speaks in their hearing. He tells them plainly and expressly what he does not
pray for, I pray not that thou should take them out of the world. And then he
tells him clearly what he does pray for, but that thou should keep them from
the evil.

Begin we with the first part of the explication, in which our Savior tells
his Father plainly and expressly what he does not pray for; I do not pray that
thou should take them out of the world.

So that the point to be observed hence, is this.

DOCTRINE Removal out of this world, is not the proper subject matter of
Petition.
You see our Savior Christ disowns it clearly in my text, he would by no means
have it thought that he desires his Father to remove his Disciples hence by
death, to take them out of the world: No, says our Savior, that is not the
thing I pray for; I pray not that thou should take them out of the world: And
even as he disowns it in his prayer, so should we; for we must walk in every
imitable thing, as we have him for an example: And out of doubt, he speaks not
this for the direction of his Father, that he might not be mistaken (as I noted
even now) but on the other side, for the instruction of his Apostles and
Disciples, who were by and heard him pray: That they might learn not to exceed
their bounds in their petitions: And when they seriously consider how they are
hated, and maligned, and abused in the world, they might not yet desire the
Lord on this account, that he would take them hence, but rather that he would
preserve and keep them here, as you have it in my Text; I pray not that thou
should take them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from the
evil.

And the ground is evident. that thy days may be long in the land, etc. That
promise is a pregnant one to this effect, Psalm. 91. ult. with long life will I
satisfy him, and show him my salvation. First I will satisfy him with long
life, he shall live so long on earth, till he be full of days, even as the
stomach that is full of meat, till he desire to live no longer, till nature be
spun out to the uttermost extent, and after I will show him my salvation; I
will bring him to the place where he shall live for evermore.

And hence it is, because continuance here is properly and in it self a
blessing (as on the other side the contrary thereto, the rooting out of the
land of the living is properly and in it self a curse) that holiest Saints have
deprecated taking hence: They have been so far from praying that God would take
them out of the world, that they have rather prayed against it; Lord take me
not away in the midst of my days, Psalm. 102.24. How did they plead sometimes
for their endangered lives, as a prisoner at the bar! and when the Lord was
pleased to leave them in the world a little longer, they were exceedingly
affected and enlarged to thankfulness: As Hezekiah was you know, who penned a
Psalm of praise on this occasion, and this was the burden of it, The living,
the living, they shall praise thee, as I do this day.

Some of the choicest Saints of God have prayed expressly to be taken hence, and
therefore it should seem to be the proper subject matter of Petition.

Paul desired to be dissolved and to be with Christ; he could not be with
Christ (he knew) unless he were dissolved first; and therefore that he might
enjoy him, he was contented to be dissolved for that end. Or otherwise he would
have been far enough from desiring dissolution: And therefore in another place
he speaks clearly, We would not be unclothed, says he, viz. of life and of the
body, 2 Cor. 5.4. that is not properly the thing that we desire; But we would
be clothed upon with immortality in heaven. If it might be possible, we would
be clothed upon with that, without the putting off of this. Indeed he says
before, in the Name of all the Saints, We that are in this Tabernacle do groan,
being burdened. But yet it was not life considered in it self that was their
burden; but with its evil adjuncts and associates which do continually cleave
to it, and which cannot be severed from it in this world. So that if you take
life, you must take that which comes with it. In this respect indeed, it is a
burden to the holiest Saints, because it is accompanied with such a burden of
corruption, as makes them groan and faint under it. But if it be considered
simply and abstractly in it self, it is not a burden from which the Saints do
groan to be delivered; no, it is a blessing rather, of which they groan to be
deprived.

2. Most of the Saints who have desired God to take them hence, have failed and
sinned in those desires of theirs. It was their weakness and infirmity, they
did it out of fear and despondency of Spirit, out of passion and impatience.
And thus it seems Eliah did when he fled from Jezabel, 1 King. 19.4. And thus
it is extremely probable that Moses did, Number. 11.10, 15. For it is said he was
displeased, and in that angry fit he said to God, Wherefore have thou afflicted
me? If thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of hand, and do not let
me see my wretchedness. And thus it is apparent Jonas did, who being crossed in a
punctilio, in a point of honor, out of a pettish, foolish, childish humor,
will go die forsooth, God must take away his life; These imperfections of the
Saints are left upon record in Scripture, not as marks to be aimed at, but as
rocks to be declined.

it may be we are weary of it, and ever ready to desire the Lord that he would
remove us from it. To wish with Israel, in a pang of discontent, Numb. 11.1.
Would God we were dead. And with Eliah, It is enough, Lord take away our lives,
1 King. 14.4. It Is that which many of us are too apt to do, when we are
over-loaden with the cares and troubles of this world, to reach after
deliverance, and redress, and ease by this means: And therefore when we find
our hearts are running out in such a way as this is, let us call them in again,
let us correct our selves, and say as our Savior in my Text, O Lord, we pray
not that thou would take us out of the world, we are far from such
impatience, we are content to wait thy leisure to tarry till thy time come. And
here to keep you from such extravagancies and irregular desires, I shall
present you with a few things.

It is a special mercy of the Lord to give us life, and to continue us in David
was in a sorry case, afflicted, persecuted and oppressed when he put up that
prayer to the Lord, Deal bountifully with thy servant, or be beneficial to thy
servant, that I may live and keep thy Word, Psalm. 119.17. He counted it a
benefit to live, how troublesome soever his condition were. It Is that which
even Nature teaches us to reach after; Skin for skin, and all that a man has
will he give for his life. And yet a life with nothing else, some will count
worth nothing. You know my Brethren, all that God himself did promise to some
very gracious men in times of common trouble and calamity, was only this, they
should have their lives for a prey, and that was all, for great things were not
to be looked for, Jer. 39.38. and 45.5. And yet that was a great mercy.

If we be not taken hence, perhaps we may enjoy the mercy to outlive David
promised to himself, when he was almost overcome and overwhelmed with his
afflictions and distresses: I shall not die, but live, says he, and declare
the works of the Lord, Psalm. 118.17. Me thinks he gathers up his spirits, when
he was about to faint; why yet, says he, I shall not dye, but live for all
this, as near as I am brought; yea I shall live to glory and triumph in Gods
works, in that which he shall do for me: to live in dangerous times, and to get
through them, though but with an escape, is mercy. But to get through them with
a conquest, is far greater mercy. To live in troubles, though in the end they
overcome us, is an honor. But to live in them, so as in the end to overcome
them; to be as the Apostle was, in deaths often, and yet to live and to
triumph, this is happiness indeed.

Consider, in the worst of times, and in the midst of greatest troubles, Paul,
who else had certainly desired dissolution, to pitch upon continuance in the
body; For me, says he, to die is gain, it is best to be dissolved and to be
with Christ: But to abide in the flesh is more needful for you, Phil. 1.24. And
therefore that I shall resolve upon, as David once, I shall prefer the Church
before my own joy, yea, before my chief joy.

Eliah, that God must take away his life, when by his own confession, there was
none almost to stand up and appear for God and for his Truth against the great
corruptions in those times, but he only: Then should he have desired to have
lived, when God had greatest need of him: It Is true, that death in such a case
would be a benefit and ease to us; yea, but our life would be a glory to the
Lord; and this we should desire before the other. This world is the proper
place where we bring glory to the Lord; in the world that is to come, we are
glorified by him; Oh let us be so ingenuous to desire to be a while where we
may bring God glory, rather then where we may have glory from him. Let us not
be so eager for our wages, for our rest, till we have finished our work, and
served our generations, and when we have done so, then God will glorify us
with himself for ever.

And thus far of the first part of our Saviors Explication, in which he tells
his Father plainly and expressly, what he does not pray for: I pray not that
thou should take them out of the world. The second follows now in order to be
handled, in which he tells him what he does pray for; But that thou should
keep them from the evil.

There is no difficulty in the terms, requiring any tedious Explication. Some
dispute indeed there is about the meaning of the word Evil, from which our
Savior prays his Father to keep those that belong to him. There want not some
Expositors who understand this Evil here to be the world it self, which indeed
is very evil, which lies in wickedness, as the Apostle speaks, 1 John 5.19. As
if our Savior should have said, I pray not that thou should take them out
of the world, but that thou should keep them from the world, which is evil in
it self, and which will surely draw them into evil too, by her temptations, and
her sugared baits, unless thou keep a watchful eye upon them, and take them into
thy tuition.

Others take evil in the ordinary notion of it, and so it comprehends and
involveth in it all sin, and all affliction, according to the known distinction
of it, into the evil of fault, and the evil of pain, whereof the latter is the
fruit and issue of the former. So that our Savior in their apprehension prays
his Father, that he would keep his Apostles and Disciples from all the evil in
the world; For all may be reduced to these two heads. Not that he would remove
them from it, but that he would preserve them from the evil in it.

Others conceive the Evil mentioned in my Text, to be the Devil. For he is
often called the evil one in Scripture, as you may see that place for instance,
1 John 5.18. Beza is very resolute for this interpretation: For (...) (as he
conceives) is rather taken for a person then a thing: And besides, the Article,
says he, which is adjoined puts the matter out of question, That thou would
keep them, (...), that is, from the wicked one. And so we find the same
expression used by the Apostle, 1 John 2.13. I write unto you young men,
because you have overcome (...), the wicked one, that is, the Devil. As for my
own part, I see no reason to reject this, or either of the other Expositions,
but to take our Saviors prayer in the largest and most comprehensive sense,
which will be most for the support and comfort of the Church. And so
accordingly the Observation shall be this.

DOCTRINE. God can and will preserve those that belong to Jesus Christ, from
all evil as long as they remain in this world.
Whether the evil be the evil of corruption, or the evil of affliction, the
evil of sin, or the evil of punishment. Whether the evil be the world; as some
conceive, or the Devil, as others think; God can and will preserve those that
belong to Jesus Christ from all these in such a sense as I shall open to you by
and by. Both these are manifest in this Petition of our Saviors here; I pray,
says he, that thou would keep them from the evil: From what evil? none is
excepted, and therefore out of doubt, he means from all evil. He prays that God
would so preserve them, that nothing that is really and truly evil (not in it
self and in its nature only, but to them) nothing that is so to them, might
come upon them. And seeing Jesus Christ desires it of his Father, it is very
evident that he is able so to keep them, or else it were a vain Prayer; and it
is as manifest, that he will keep them so, or else it were a fruitless and an
ineffectual prayer. God can and will preserve those that belong to Jesus Christ
from all evil.

For clearing of the observation, I shall show you particularly and distinctly,
that God can and will preserve them from the evil of temptation, and from the
evil of corruption, and from the evil of affliction: And if he keep from these,
he keeps from all; from the world and Devil too, though neither of them be
expressly mentioned; for if the world, or Devil hurt us, it must be either by
temptation or affliction.

God can and will preserve those that belong to Jesus Christ from the

1. Sometimes the Lord preserves those that belong to Christ from the assault
of the temptation. He does not give the Tempter leave to tempt them: For you
must know, my Brethren, that the Devil cannot once inject a wicked thought, or
suggest a sinful motion, without allowance granted him from God: you may behold
him bound and chained, Apoc. 20.2. and that to this end, that he may deceive no
more, until the time and season of his chaining be expired, and after loosed
at the Lords appointment. And he will loose him only when himself pleases. So
that the Devil cannot tempt us when he will; he must confine himself within the
compass of his chain. Indeed if God enlarge him once, he may go forth and
entice us, and prevail, as you may see in that example, 1 King. ^2.22. But if
he limit him, he cannot move, nor meddle with us any way. This roaring Lion
walks up and down, says the Apostle, 1 Pet. 5.8. seeking whom he may devour.
Not whom he will, it is not so, but whom he may devour. There are some whom he
may assault, and others whom he may not; some whom he may devour, and others
whom he may not.

2. If God preserve, not those who belong to Jesus Christ from the assault, he
uses to preserve them from the prevalence of the temptation. Perhaps he gives
the tempter power to tempt them, but then he does not give them up into the
tempters power. And then the Devil or their own corruptions may entice them
long enough, before they can prevail against them, unless he give them up to
Satan, or their own lusts, unless he leave them, as it is said of Hezekiah in
the same case, 2 Chronicles. 32.31. You know that Satan was permitted to set upon
our Savior Christ himself; but though he had obtained leave to tempt him, he
had not leave to overcome him. So at his earnest motion he procured a
commission from the Lord to worry Job. But he had only power to tempt him; Job
was not given up to his power, and therefore though he did his worst, he could
not foll him in the combat. So he desired to sift add winnow Peter, and so far
forth, it seems, he obtained his desire, that he winnowed him indeed; But
though he winnowed him, he could not hurt him, because he had a God to keep
him, a Christ to intercede for him: Simon, Simon, says our Savior, Satan has
desired to have you, that he may winnow you as Wheat, Luke 22.31. But I have
prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.

We want not many sweet and precious promises to this effect dispersed and
scattered up and down the Scripture, that God will either keep us from
temptation, or if he suffer and permit us to be tempted, he will not give us up
into the power of the temptation, but will preserve us so that the very gates
of hell shall not prevail against us, Mat. 16.18. If Satan or the world desire
to set upon us, the Lord will either save us and deliver us from the
temptation, which he knows how to do, be the temptation what it will, as the
Apostle Peter speaks, 1 Pet. 2.9. or else he will support us in it, according
to his Covenant with us, for he is faithful and will not suffer us to be
tempted above measure, as the Apostle shows, 1 Cor. 10.13. And though he do not
free us from it, yet he will uphold us in it, as he did the Apostle Paul, 2
Cor. 12.9. who having received a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to
buffet him, and seeking earnestly to God that he would free him from this
troublesome unpleasing guest, although he could not be delivered from it, yet
he was fortified against it, and had this answer to his prayer, My Grace is
sufficient for thee, and my strength is perfected in weakness. Or,

3. If the Lord preserve not those who belong to Jesus Christ, neither from the
assault, nor from the prevalency of the temptation: at least he keeps them from
the hurt of the temptation. He keeps them from the evil of it, according to our
Saviors prayer in my text, I pray that thou would keep them from the evil. I
must confess the holiest Saints in case may not be assaulted only, but overcome
and foiled in a temptation. David a man who has as large a testimony from the
Holy Ghost himself for his uprightness as any man almost in sacred story, yet
he was tempted of the Devil. 1 Chronicles. 21.1. yea, and not tempted only, but
seduced and drawn away. And that which was David, case, that might be the case
of any other. But then God suffers it for merciful and gracious ends which
himself best knows.

Perhaps to try them, as he permitted Hezekiah to be foiled for that end; God
left him to try him, 2 Chronicles. 32.31. and thus he deals with many that belong to
Christ. It may be they are apt to please themselves with a too good opinion of
their own graces, because they look upon themselves at such a time when there
is no temptation to discover what they are. And therefore God in such a case
permits them to temptation for their good, and then they see those gross
corruptions in themselves which they could not have imagined. Peter did little
think till he was tried, he had been such a Coward as he proved. What, that the
question of a silly Maid should make him flatly to deny his Lord, and Master,
and that with oaths and execrations too! No, it is evident he thought himself a
stout and valiant man, for he was resolute that death it self should never work
so far upon him: And therefore he was brought to the encounter, that he might
see how much he was mistaken of himself, and how far short his real graces came
of his imaginary fancies and conceits.

Sometimes God suffers those who belong to Jesus Christ to be foiled in a
temptation, to make them the more humble, and the more watchful, and the more
prayerfull, and so by consequence the more holy, even all their lives after.
And thus however the temptation does them one way some hurt, yet in another way
it does them much more good, and so upon the whole they are better for it, not
the worse. And thus God keeps them from the evil of temptation.

And as God keeps them from the evil of temptation, so from the evil esse, and
its operari in the holiest Saints. But yet he can and will preserve those that
belong to Jesus Christ, either from the act and guilt or hurt of corruption
that is in them. I shall a little touch upon them in their order.

In a qualified sense he keeps them from the act of their corruption, so They
also, says the Prophet David, speaking of the Saints, do no iniquity, Psalm.
119.3. They sin not says the Apostle, 1 John 3.6. neither can they sin.
Conceive it not so freely and so remorselesly as others; For the seed remains
in them. The spirit lusts against the flesh, so that they cannot do the evil
that they would, at least not all the evil that they would, Gal. 5.15. God
keeps them by this means from much evil, which else they would fall into, as to
instance in particulars.

He keeps them wholly from the great and unpardonable sin, the sin against the
Holy Ghost. There is a sin to death, says the Apostle, 1 John 5.16. to death,
not in the merit of it only, for so is every sin to death, if you look to the
desert, but in the issue and event. And this God surely keeps them from, that
belong to Jesus Christ, so that they never fall into it.

2. He keeps them usually from the grosser acts of sin, which the Apostle calls
(...) the defilements and pollutions of the world, 2 Pet. 2.20. being the
common mire and kennel in which the filthy Swine of this world wallow, and
which are termed by the Apostle Paul, the works of the flesh, which are
manifest even to the the dimmest eye even to the light of nature it self, Chap.
5.19. Such are adultery, drunkenness, perjury, theft, and such like. Now from
these foul and gross corruptions which cross the principles of common life and
honesty, in which the lewdest and prophanest wallow, God usually keeps them
that belong to Jesus Christ.

3. He keeps them from committing any known sin, resolvedly and with full
consent of will. Indeed there may be a velleity, an incomplete and an imperfect
will to sin in those that belong to Christ; but a complete and perfect will
there cannot be. For flesh and spirit being interwoven and commixt in every
faculty, and consequently in the will, the will so far as it is sanctified and
renewed, can never give allowance to the act of sin. And whereas wicked and
ungodly men are totally addicted, and universaly devoted to it, they act it
wholly, and with every part and power, being nothing else but flesh: It is not
so with those that are renewed. And hence says Paul, it is not I that do it,
Romans 7.17. yet in the verse immediately before; he said, what I would not, that
do I. So that there is a double I in Paul, I spiritual, and I carnal; I do it
and I do it not. Not I that am spiritual, or in that part wherein I am
spiritual, but I that am carnal, or in that part wherein I am carnal. It is not
I that do it, but the flesh that dwells in me. And thus God keeps them from
the acts of sin.

I, even I am he that blotteth out thy sin. It is God that justifies, says the
Apostle, Romans 8.33. And with relation to this act of his, he is called a
deliverer, Romans 11.26. There shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and he shall
turn away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my Covenant with them when I
shall take away their sin.

if all things, then all these things work together for the best to them. God
does them good, even by their sins, and by their falls: he makes that to
promote and further their salvation, which seems most directly to hinder it
and to oppose it. Oh the riches of his mercy! Blessings and Ordinances, by
accident, do hurt to wicked men; And even sins by accident do good to Gods
people.

Thus we have showed you, that God can and will preserve those that belong to
Jesus Christ, from the evil of temptation and corruption.

And as God keeps those that belong to Jesus Christ from the evil Many are the
afflictions of the righteous, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 34.19. not of the
wicked only, but the righteous too. Yea their afflictions oftentimes are more
and greater then the afflictions of the wicked are. The Prophet David was too
sensible of this, so that his spirit fretted at it, and he was envious at the
foolish, as himself confesses, Psalm. 73.3. when he saw the prosperity of
wicked men. Their strength is firm, says he, there are no bands in their
death. They are not in trouble like other men, nor are they plagued like other
men, no nor like better men; Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more
then heart can wish: These are the wicked, says the Psalmist, they prosper in
the world. But how fares it with David all this while? why verily, says he, I
have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my bands in innocence; for all the
day long have I been plagued and chastned every morning. And this is that which
Christ forewarned his Disciples of, that in the world they must have troubles,
there would be no avoiding of it. But yet however, God keeps them from the evil
of affliction in the sense that I shall open to you, in a few particulars.

1. Sometimes when he sees it best, he keeps them from affliction, that it does
not touch them for a considerable time together. He environs them with loving
kindness round about, so that no trouble or calamity can find a way to enter
and to seize upon them, according to that precious promise, Psalm. 5. ult. For
thou Lord wilt bless the righteous, with favor will thou compass him as with a
shield. And thus he dealt a while with Job, as Satan enviously suggested to the
Lord, Job 1.10. Have thou not made a hedge about him, and about all that he
has on every side? thou have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance
is increased in the Land. So David, though he were a man of many troubles and
afflictions, yet he had his Halcyon days. There was a time when God had made
his Mountain of prosperity so strong that he was verily persuaded he should
never be removed. And there are many promises of special preservation from
dangers and distresses made to those who have an interest in God and Christ. I
might heap up a multitude of such; but there is one Psalm of David that seems
to be a short Compendium and abridgement of them all, viz. Psalm. 91. He shall
deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome Pestilence. He
shall cover thee with his feathers, his truth shall be thy shield and buckler:
thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that
flies by day, nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor the
destruction that wastes at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten
thousand on thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine
eyes shall thou behold it. Thou shall see it seize on others, but for thy own
part thou shall be exempt from it. There shall no evil befall thee, neither
shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling; For he shall give his Angels charge
over thee to keep thee. Now these and such like promises the Lord makes good to
his, even in the very letter of them, when in the infiniteness of his love and
wisdom he sees it most expedient for them.

2. Or if God do not keep them from affliction that it does not touch them, he
keeps them that it does not stay too long with them. The rod of trouble though
it strike them, yet it does not rest upon them. It is on and off again in due
time. Its true God often suffers those who belong to Jesus Christ to be brought
into affliction, but then he does not leave them there, his manner is to bring
them out again. To deliver them from evil, according to that passage in the
Lords prayer. And therefore he is styled the deliverer of his people, and the
God of their salvation. He that is our God, is the God of salvation, and to the
Lord God belong the issues from death, not from inferior dangers only, but
from death it self. And hence salvation is ascribed to him as his peculiar: It
is of the Lord, sath Jonah, Chap. 2.9. Salvation belongs to the Lord, says
David, Psalm. 3.8. and his blessing upon his people. It is his work to save us
from distresses and afflictions; the secondary means are subordinate to him,
they move but as he acts them. And this is very usual with him; if he prevent
not the afflictions of his people that they do not come upon them, yet he
delivers them at length from those afflictions, as soon as they have done their
work in them, yea, let them be as many as they will, Psalm. 34.19. Many are the
afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of all.

3. Or if God do not keep them who belong to Jesus Christ from the evil of
affliction, by way of preservation, or deliverance from it, he keeps them many
times by way of preservation and delivery in it. So that though it seize upon
them, it is no pain or trouble to them. And thus he kept the three Confessors,
he did not save them from the furnace, but he saved them in the furnace, Dan.
3.27. The fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was a hair of their head
singed, neither were their Coats changed, nor the smell of fire did pass upon
them. According to that precious promise, Isa. 43.2. when thou passest through
the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not
overwhelm thee, when thou walk through the fire, thou shall not be burned,
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.

Or if not thus, he qualifies his people so with inward peace, and comfort, and
assurance, that they feel not what they feel. They are so ravished and
transported to an ecstasy of holy joy, that they are in a sort insensible even
of the greatest torment that humane cruelty can devise to inflict. Unto the
righteous, says the Psalmist, arises light in darkness, glorious comfort even
in the midst of greatest troubles, Psalm. 112.4. Thy light shall rise in
obscurity, says God, Isa. 58.10. And thy darkness shall be as the noonday;
Such light did there arise to some of the blessed Martyrs, when it was darkest
with them, in regard of outward comforts, so that they sung in the prisons, in
the irons, in the flames; they were not able to contain themselves, by reason
of the sudden flash of joy that came breaking in upon them, which made them to
forget the miseries and torments which they suffered; yea, though the fire did
kindle on them, and consume them into ashes: yet many of them warbled out
melodious accents in the flames, professed that they were amidst the fire as in
a bed of down and spices, where they felt nothing else but admirable joy and
comfort. These men you see did more then conquer, they did triumph in the very
midst of their unparalleld and matchless sufferings: so that they might have
taken up that comfortable speech of the Apostle, Romans 8.37. In all these things
we are more then Conquerors. And what were those things? see at the 35. verse,
In tribulation, and distress, and persecution, and famine, and nakedness, and
peril and sword: then which there are no greater outward evils in the world: In
all these things we are more then Conquerors through him that loved us.

4. Or if God do not keep his people from the smart, at least he keeps them
from the hurt of their afflictions. The world indeed may persecute them, and
that to the very death; they may take away their names, their estates, their
lives from them; but though they kill them, they can never hurt them. God keeps
them from the evil of all this, from the evil in the world, as you have it in
my Text; what ever comes upon them, they are no losers in the main, but gainers
rather. All things are for their sakes, says the Apostle, 2 Cor. 4.15. for
their profit and advantage; Yea, though the outward man perish, by reason of
the length or violence of the affliction, the inward man is renewed day by day.
Their afflictions work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory. They may suffer grievously, their sufferings may deprive them of the
life of nature, but they cannot deprive them of the life of grace, or glory:
They may be persecuted, but they cannot be forsaken totally and finally; they
may be cast down, but they cannot be destroyed, 2 Cor. 4.9. They may be
destroyed as men; but they can never be destroyed as Saints: In this respect they
are like Mount Sion that can never be removed: The rain descended, says our
Savior, and the floods came, and the wind blew and beat upon the house, and it
fell not; for it was founded upon a rock, Mat. 7.25. q.d. Nothing can hurt or
overthrow him that is built on Jesus Christ, he shall stand fast for evermore.

Nay to go a little further, God does not only keep them that belong to Jesus
Christ from the hurt of their afflictions, but more then so, he does them much
good by them; that they may say as David does when all is ended, It is good for
me that I have been afflicted. I give you but a taste of this, and I have done
with Explication.

1. Sometimes he awakens them by their afflictions; they are sleepy and secure,
and God jogges and startles them, and rouzes them by this means; When men are
bound in fetters, says Elihu, and held fast in the cords of their afflictions,
so that they are not able to unlooose themselves and get away: what then? why
then he shows them their works, and their transgressions that they have
exceeded in: q.d. At such a time his manner is to represent their sins to them,
with all their circumstantial aggravations: See an example of it in the Lords
own people, Genesis 42.21. when Joseph's Brethren saw themselves taken for spies in
Egypt, and so in present danger of their lives, the sin they had committed many
years ago, came as fresh into their minds, and lay as heavy on their
Consciences, as if it had been newly done. I know that troubles and distresses,
and the approach of death it self, has not always this effect on all men; the
Lord has poured on some the spirit of slumber: but usually they have on Gods
people.

2. Sometimes God abates their pride by their afflictions: There is not any sin
that makes a man more odious to the Lord then pride does, or is a greater bar
to his salvation; All that are proud in heart are an abomination to him, Prove.
16.5. neither is there are any man but has some relics of this leaven in
him, which puffs up his heart, and makes him swell beyond measure: Yea, the
choicest of the Saints, have mighty inclinations to it, especially if all
things go on their side. As it is said of Hezekiah, when he was put into a
prosperous estate, his heart was lifted up, 2 Chronicles. 32.25. and therefore God
exposes them to sharp afflictions, that he may hide the pride of man, as the
expression is, Joh 33.17. that he may lessen and abate, and wear it out, till
it be not to be seen.

3. Sometimes God draws his people nearer to himself by their afflictions. In
their affliction they will seek me early, says the Lord of his people, Hos.
5.15. It seems they had been woefully regardless of the Lord in former times of
happiness, and peace, and comfort; but says the Lord, In their affliction they
will hasten to me, they will be eager after me, and never rest till they have
found me: And this you shall observe to be the disposition of the sons men; yea
of the best and holiest of them; they look not after God so much at any time,
as when they are in greatest exigencies and distresses. And as the sails,
though they be some addition to the burden of the ship, yet they help it on
the faster to the Haven: So crosses and afflictions, though they be a burden
to us, yet they hasten us to God, and draw us on the faster to the port of
happiness: And therefore God relating diverse judgments which he was resolved
to bring upon his own people, by which he meant to strip them naked of all
outward comforts, at length concludes that this should be the issue of it, Isa.
17.7. At that day shall they look unto their Maker, and their eyes shall have
respect unto the Holy One of Israel.

It is a miserable thing, yet so it is, as long as we have any thing on earth
to rest upon, we enquire not after God: With Noah's Dove, if we can find a twig
to pitch upon, we are regardless of the Ark; and therefore God by heavy crosses
and afflictions strips us of these outward helps, and strikes away the earthly
things by which we stand, and when we know not what to do; when we are driven
out of all our holes, then our eyes are upon God; when we look on every hand,
and refuge fails us every way, and no man cares for our souls, then we address
our selves to God, and say to him, Thou art our refuge, Psalm. 142.4. It seems
that David, though he were a holy man, was very apt, while he was furnished
with these outward favors, to rely too much upon them, so far as to neglect the
Lord. But when the Lord by crosses and afflictions took them from him, or made
him see the vanity and insufficiency of them, then he cried out, And now Lord,
what wait I for? my hope is in thee; now I have tried how fickle, and how vain
the creature is; now I perceive by sensible experience, that no help is in it;
Now Lord what wait I for? etc. And thus I think I have sufficiently cleared the
point; God can and will preserve, etc.

To add a word or two for Application. God will withhold no good from them, as
the Prophet David speaks; and then upon the other side, he will keep all evil
from them, as you have it in my Text. Beloved, we are here in an uncomfortable
place, a wicked world, in which we are exposed (as considered in our selves) to
all evil. We are exempt from no temptation; No not the blackest and the
bloodlest, to the very worst of sins. We are secure from no affliction, no not
the sharpest and the most extreme. If there be any worse then other, which we
conceive would be most bitter and intolerable to us, it is going in the world,
and it may seize on us as well as others: Yea, we are always bearing with us in
our bosoms, that which is infinitely worse then both the other, viz. the evil
of corruption: so that we seem to be in a very sad condition. But yet this
comfort waits upon us still, the Lord will surely keep us absolutely free from
the evil of them all. The worst of them may do us good, but it shall never do
us hurt, as long as there is any virtue in our Saviors Intercession, as long
as he has any interest in God the Father.

And therefore when we look upon the world, and see it marching out against us
with bloody persecutions and afflictions; when we look upon the Devil, and see
him ready to assault us with his fiery darts, and fierce tentations; when we
look inward to our own hearts, and see such swarms of hellish lusts and base
corruptions there, and are ready to cry out in the anguish of our souls, Oh
miserable men that we are, who shall deliver us! let us look up to Jesus
Christ, and think upon his powerful Intercession with the Father, that he has
prayed him to preserve and keep us from all the evil in the world, and so let
us be quiet and secure: Let us say as David once, Though I walk in the valley
of the shadow of death, among men, among Devils, among temptations, and
corruptions, and afflictions of all sorts, of all sizes, yet I will not be
afraid; for Christ has interceded for me to the Father, and he will certainly
preserve me from the hurt of all these; He will keep me from every evil work,
and preserve me to his heavenly Kingdom.

JOHN 17.16. They are not of the world, even as I am not, etc.


AND thus far of the Second Argument with which our Savior presses and
enforces his Petition to his Father, together with the Explication of it. To
this he adds a repetition of that which he delivered word for word before, as
you shall see if you compare them both together. They are not of the world,
even as I am not of the world. He said before, I have given them thy Word, and
the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not
of the world. And here again, they are not of the world, even as I am not of
the world.

So that you see my Brethren, Repetition of the self same thing, and in the
self same words in Prayer, is not to be condemned in all cases. Our Savior as
he is our Mediator to pray for us, so he is our Master too, to instruct us how
to pray; Master, say the Disciples to our Savior, Luke 11.1. teach us to pray
as John also taught his Disciples. And he teaches us to pray not by his precept
only, but by example too. And in the latter way he teaches us in this place, to
fetch over things again that have been said before in prayer, yea, sometimes in
the very same expressions. And in another place the Holy Ghost observes of
him, that he prayed a second and a third time, saying the very same words,
Matthew. 26.44. He could have varied, but he would not vary, because his
judgment and affection led him into the very same tract wherein he had gone
once or twice before. And so when repetitions are not of necessity, but out of
choice, because the zeal and fervor of the speaker draws him and invites him to
it, they are sometimes of very good use. Indeed our Savior, I acknowledge,
interdicteth repetitions: but mark, what repetitions my Beloved; Battologies,
vain repetitions: When ye pray, (...), use no vain repetitions, as the Heathens
do, and as the Papists do, who use to babble over so many Pater Nosters, and so
many Ave Mary's, and think to be heard for their much speaking, as it is added
there in that place, Mat. 6.7. Observe it well; our Savior says not, use no
repetitions; but use no vain repetitions. And when they flow from the strength
of the affection, that knows not which way to get off from some considerable
and important thing, as you may note in David, and other Saints in Scripture,
they are not vain, but to very good purpose.

What was our Saviors purpose in the repetition that he uses in my Text, is
diversely conceived by those that write upon it. Once this is evident to me,
there is the same occasion for the repetition, that there was for the mention
of the self-same thing before. Before, the hatred to which they were exposed in
the world, and here the evil which they were like to suffer from the world, of
both which this was the true reason, because indeed they were not of this world
but of another. There, says our Savior, the world has hated them; how so?
They are not of the world, even as I am not of this world. Here says our
Savior, I pray thee Father, keep them from the evil of the world. Why, are
they like to suffer evil from the world? how so? The same again, They are not
of the world, even as I am not of the world. And he would have it to be very
well observed, that all the hatred and injurious dealing, to which his poor
Disciples were exposed in the world, proceeded not from any fault of theirs,
but it was merely upon this account, because they were not of the world, but
were conformable to Christ himself in this particular: The world likes them
much the worse, because they were in this respect like Christ.

I shall not now insist upon the words as considered in dependence, and as they
are a reason of the evil usage which Christ's Disciples use to meet withal in
this world; For this I did when I last met with them; But I shall take them
absolutely as considered in themselves: And so they yield us out this general
Observation.

DOCTRINE That Christ's Disciples are in this respect like Christ himself, that
they are of another world as he is.
There are two things in the point, which I shall clear distinctly and in
order: First Christ himself is not of this world, but of another. Then Christ's
Disciples are in this respect like him. They are like him many ways, in many
things, and especially in this among the rest, That they are not of the world,
as he is not of the world.

As for the first of these, That Christ himself is not of this world, I am not
of this world: He does not say, I am not in this world; for that indeed he
could not say when he made this prayer; Nay, he says the contrary but a verse
or two before, These things speak I in the world. But I am not of this world,
this he affirms here, and in diverse others places: Though he were really a
man, yet he was not like other men, at least not like worldly men in this
regard, as he told the Pharisees, Joh. 8.23. Ye are of this world, I am not of
this world.

Now to open this a little, I shall show you particularly and distinctly that
Jesus Christ when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world, but
of another, especially in these respects. As first because he came from another
world. And secondly, because he lived in another world. And thirdly, because he
went to another world; I shall follow these in order.

1. Jesus Christ when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world,
but of another, because he came from another world: And he was more properly of
the world he came from, then of the world he sojourned in for a little space
only. And thus he argues with the Jews, in the fore-alleadged Scripture, Joh.
8.23. Ye are from beneath, I am from above, says he. And what does he infer
upon it? Ye are of this world, I am not of this world. You see both the clauses
answer one another; Ye are from beneath, and therefore ye are of this world. I
am from above, and therefore I am not of this world; In this respect he is
called the Lord from heaven, 1 Cor. 15.47. Observe it, not the Lord in heaven,
but the Lord from heaven: and that not only with relation to his second, but
also to his first coming; No man has ascended up to heaven, says our Savior
Christ himself, Joh. 3.13. but he that came down from heaven. So that when he
was incarnate, he came down from heaven in a sense; for of this our Savior
speaks in that place: And to this speech of Christ it is that the Apostle Paul
alludeth, when speaking of our Savior Christ's ascension, Ephesians. 4.8. he adds
presently by way of Explication, Now that he ascended, what is it but that he
also first descended into the lower parts of the earth? So then, descend he did
at first from heaven, as after he ascended up again to heaven. And because he
came from heaven, he is more properly of heaven, then of earth; as the Apostle
Paul insinuates very clearly, when he calls him the Lord from heaven, heavenly,
1 Cor. 15.47, 48. Because from heaven, therefore heavenly, not of this world,
but of another.

2. Jesus Christ when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world,
but of another, because he lived in another; Here he breathed, but there he
lived; he did not live the life of this world, but the life of heaven; and that
not in expectation, as we do, but in fruition; He lived the life of perfect
righteousness and perfect holiness, the life of Angels; yea, a life above
Angels while he was here in this world: That life which is to be attained by
us, nowhere but in heaven only, Christ lived here in this world; and this
perhaps was partly aimed at by our Savior in that speech of his, Joh. 3.13. No
man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
of man which is in heaven: He was then come down from heaven, he was then upon
the earth when he spoke these words. And yet he adds, he was then in heaven
too, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And he was then in heaven, not
only as the Son of God, but as the Son of man too. Virtually he was there,
though he were not locally: His life did relish infinitely more of heaven then
of earth.

And therefore it is very notable that he disclaimed all meddling with these
earthly things; he would not once so much as touch with them, neither as a
Judge or a divider, as himself professes, Luke 12.14. nor as possessor
neither. It Is true, he was a King, as he implicitly acknowledges to Pilate;
and he had a kind of Kingdom while he was here in this world, but it was not of
this world; My Kingdom is not of this world, says Christ himself, Joh. 18.36.
And therefore he did nor erect it outwardly, with any outward policy and
splendor among men, but he did only set it up in the hearts of a few despised
people, to whom he said, My Kingdom is within you; Luke 17.21. And so in every
thing, my Brethren, he avoided such a conversation as might intimate him to be
one of this world.

3. Jesus Christ when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world,
but of another, because indeed he was but going to another world; From another
world he came, as you have heard before, and to another world he was about to
go. Only he tarried here a little, about some weighty and important business
which his Father sent him down into this lower world to do, and as soon as that
was ended, he returned to heaven again. So that you see, brethren, he conversed
here but as a Messenger from God the Father, whose errand he came down upon,
and to whom he was to go, as soon as he had finished what he came for. And
therefore he avoided any kind of setlement in this world, any way of making
this his fixed habitation, as he told the Scribe that was about to follow him,
Mat. 8.20. The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have nests, but the
Son of man has not where to lay his head. Yea, he professed that he was not in
the world, while he was here, because indeed he was not to continue here; he
was shortly to depart, he was as good as gone already, as in this Chapter I am
handling, ver. 11. And now I am no more in the world, but I come to th^e. And
this for clearing of the former member of the point, that Christ himself is not
of this world, but of another.

Now for the second branch, that Christ's Disciples are in this respect They are
not of the world, even as I am not of the world. And this our Savior often
minds them of, as you may see that place for instance, to name no more at this
time, John 15.19. Ye are not of the world, says he, but I have chosen you out
of the world. Indeed, as Christ is, so they are in this world, as the Apostle
speaks, 1 John 4.7. So in this world, that they are not of the world. And that
in all the three respects wherein we have clearly showed you that Christ is not
of this world, but of another.

1. Christ's Disciples came from another world, and so in that respect they are
not of the world, as Christ is not of the world. I say they came originally
from another world, although not as they are men, yet as they are Saints and
Christians: So they are from above of God, they are his offspring, as Paul
said to the Athenians, God is their Father, for they are begotten of him, 1
John 5.18. And God is their Mother too, for they are born of him, 1 John 3.9.
So that you see, they are no less then a divine and heavenly generation. And
they are members of the New Jerusalem, which John saw coming down from heaven,
Apoc. 21.2. They are only for a while let down from heaven in a sheet, as the
creatures were to Peter in a vision, and so taken up again.

2. As Christ's Disciples came from another world, so they live in another
world, and so in that respect they are not of the world, as Christ is not of
the world; Their Conversation is in heaven, as the Apostle speaks, Phil. 3.20.
With the woman, Apoc. 12. they tread the Moon, this variable and unconstant
world under their feet. Trample with a disdainful and a holy scorn upon earth
and earthly things. Honors are too ignoble to command them, riches too poor to
buy them, pleasures too fleeting to allure them. Sometimes they are transported
(as it were) rapt and taken up into heaven in sweet Soliloquies, and in holy
contemplations, ravished beyond themselves with clear and comfortable
apprehensions of their Fathers love. Indeed they get above the world, they
soar higher then the earth, their treasure is in heaven, and there are their
hearts also: Their life is Angel-like: they live with men indeed, but walk with
God, as Moses speaks of Enoch. They have their eyes on him (as Moses) they see
him who is invisible, and they are taken up with him in all their ways and
actions. They are acquainted very well with the Almighty, (to use the phrase of
holy Job) they converse with God here, come very often to his house, now and
then sup with him, speak with him twice a day at least, and that in a familiar
way, until at length they be admitted to a more near and intimate enjoyment of
the Lord for ever, 1 These. 4.17. till they be caught up (as they were first let
down,) to meet him, and so to be for ever with the Lord.

3. Christ's Disciples are going to another world, and so in that respect they
are not of the world, as Christ is not of the world, because the world is not
their fixed habitation; It is the character of wicked wretches, that they are
men of this world, and that they have their portion here, Psalm. 17.14. In which
respect the Prophet sets them in opposition to the Saints. And so ungodly men
are styled the inhabitants and the indwellers of the earth, very often in the
Book of Revelation. But now the Christian on the other side, is not a dweller
but a stranger on the earth. And this the Saints of God have frequently
professed in the Scriptures. The Fathers, they acknowledged (as the Apostle
Paul observes, Heb. 11.13.) that they were foreigners and pilgrims here. And
Abraham, as the same Apostle notes, sojourned in the Land of promise. Observe
it well, he did not dwell there, but sojourned as in a strange Country, Heb.
11.9. And why? because he looked for a City where he meant to dwell: he had it
not, but he expected it and looked for it. And this is that which the Apostle
Paul professes in the name of all the faithful, that they had no continuing
City here (no City that they meant to settle in) but they sought for one to
come. This was the City that the Fathers saw a great way of, and made toward.
And so despising all the happiness and glory of the present world, where they
were strangers, and in which they were tarrying only for a little space, they
set their eyes and hearts on this which was their own Country, Heb. 11.19.
They desired a better Country which was an heavenly, where God had prepared
for them a City. And the same disposition you may note in others of the
faithful mentioned there in that Chapter.

we are not of the world as Christ is not of the world; and whether we be so or
no, we may discover by these evidences following.

they fashion not themselves according to the world, Romans 12.2. they walk not
according to the course of this world, Ephesians. 2.2. As Turks and Spaniards are
not like to Englishmen, they have another kind of visage, another garb and
habit, and the like: So they that are not of this world differ manifestly from
it. There is a clear distinction to be made between them and worldly men, by
any man that marks them well, and has his Judgment exercised to discern.
There are none like them in the earth; their ways are of another fashion then
the ways of other men. Now I beseech you, my beloved, think upon it; If you be
fashioned to this world, if you be carried with a swinge of the profane and
vicious times and places where you live, if you run down the stream with
others, if you sleep as others do, 1 These. 5.6. if you swear as others do, if
you run out with others to the same excess of riot, you are surely of this
world, and not the other.

They that are not of this world, but of the other, have a very dear si tamen
Hypocrisis dici debeat, quae jam latere prae abundantia non potest, prae
impudentia non quaerit, as Bernard speaks) who would be taken to be Christ's
Disciples, while their companions and their bosom friends are the men of this
world; yea Traitors to the place to which they would be thought to appertain.
And others hate the very men whom Christ has called out of the world: holiness
wherever they find it being the object of their fury. Suppose thou were in
Italy, or in another foreign land, and there should meet an Englishman,
would thou mock and scoff at him? would thou deride and jear the fashion of
his Hat, and Cloak, and Suit, the manner of his Complement, his Gate, and
Carriage, etc.? would thou procure him to be taken up, imprisoned, put to
death? Thy earthly Country would not own thee, if thou should be so
unworthy: and truly Heaven will not own the men who deal thus basely and
injuriously with the inhabitants of that Country.

They that are not of this world, their language is not of this world but
Canaan, their speech is gracious, and usually to glorify their God, or to
edify their brethren; But they that are of this world, they speak of this
world, 1 John 4.5. Shibboleth never discried so many Ephramites as this does
worldly men. Of what place are they inhabitants whose language is so harsh and
tart, whose mouths are full of cursings and bitterness, the poison of Aspes
being under their lips? Where dwell they (Alas too near us) who cannot speak
almost without an oath, whose tongues are always dipping in that blood which
was shed for man's salvation? Are they inhabitants of the Celestial Canaan,
whose tongues are keen as swords, and sharp as Arrows, to hew and wound their
brethrens names? Shall I say that man or woman is of heaven, whose tongue is
set on fire of hell? To what place do they appertain, whose speech is stuffed
with filthiness and ribauldry, whose words are rotten? as the Apostles speaks.
Brethren, do not deceive your selves; if you cannot speak the language, you
belong not to the Country.

etc. And are not Christ's Disciples of another Country, yea of an other world?
Are they not men of singularity? Are not their ways and fashions diverse from
the fashions of this world? No marvel then though they be men of wonder as the
Prophet speaks, Zac. 3.8. though they be hooted at, and though they be made as
spectacles and gazing stocks to worldly men.

etc. Then let them live like men of another world, shining as lights amidst a
perverse and crooked generation that sit in darkness and in the shadow of
death. Let Heaven appear in their discourses, and their Conversation. Here we
may remain, and must, till God be pleased to call us hence; but our continuance
here must be accompanied with a reserved exemption of our selves from the
Contagion of the times, and with an earnest and unwearied striving against the
stream of the corruptions of the places where we live; not following a
multitude to do evil. We must be separated from the world (my brethren) not in
place but in affection and in Conversation. I pray not, says our Savior, ver.
15. of this Chapter, that thou would take them out of the world, but that
thou should keep them from the evil. We must not on consideration of the
notorious lewdness and profaneness of the inhabitants of this world, who vex our
souls with their ungodly deeds, desire the Lord to carry us to Heaven in a
fiery Chariot, as he did Elijah, to take us presently out of this world: but
rather to preserve us in it, that we may keep our robes pure and undefiled
among so many garments spotted with the flesh; That against the violent and
restless oppositions and temptations of the world and worldly men, we may stand
impregnable, showing our selves the sons of God, by overcoming it and them. The
veriest wretch may keep himself from grosser acts when he has no occasions nor
allurements to them. But in the midst of millions of enticements and commanding
provocations, and in a world that lies in wickedness, to be singular in
goodness, this is indeed like Christ's Disciple, who himself was holy, harmless,
separate from sinners. It was Tullies commendation of Muraena, Non tam
lauda^d^s Muraena quod in Asia vixerit, quam quod in Asia continenter vixerit.
Muraena deserved not so much commendations that he lived in Asia, as that he
lived continently there, amongst such a loose and effaeminate people, where his
Chastity must of necessity suffer many encounters; And Gods, of Job, that there
was none like him in the earth. Such must we strive to be, and come as near the
pattern as we may.

etc. Then let them not regard this world nor the vanities thereof. We see that
Travelers and Strangers do not set their hearts on any thing they meet with in
the way: If they see stately Houses, Orchards, Gardens, if they hear curious
music, etc. they are not taken up with these things. No, they keep on their
way, and are not hindered nor withdrawn by the most pleasing Avocations. Does
any Traveller fall a building at his Inn? a planting or a sowing by the way?
And therefore seeing we are of another world, and consequently strangers here,
let us not set our hearts and our affections on the things that are beneath,
but on the things that are above; let us use this world as though we used it
not, for necessity alone, and not so much for profit or delight; to further us
in holy duties, not to stop; us to help heavenward, not to hinder. O let us not
by scraping up the dung of this world, disgrace our Country, and bring it to a
low esteem with worldly men. Let it not be said to us, as Anacharsis said to
Atticus, opbraiding him because he was a Scythian; Mihi inquit dedecori est
patria, at patriae tu. My Country is a shame to me, but thou art dishonor to
thy Country. No, let us honor it: let carnal wretches know that it is a
wealthy place, that there we have a rich inheritance, and large possessions,
and that our Father (who is king thereof) is well able to provide for all his
children.

Is it so that Christ's Disciples, etc. Then let us not desire nor fancy Moses,
Deuteronomy. 32.29. O that men were wise, that they understood this, that they would
consider their latter end!

Is it so that Christ's Disciples, etc. Why are they so unwilling then Arise let
us go hence. Why (my beloved) what is the matter with you? What, are you loath
to go home? Methinks you should consider with your selves that when you die,
you go to your own world, your own Father, your own friends, where you shall be
as welcome as your hearts can wish: God your Father will receive you, Christ
your brother will embrace you, Triumphant Saints and Angels will rejoice in
you: And after all the troubles of a tedious journey, you shall sit down with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom of Heaven, feasting it in companies,
feeding on the hidden Manna, and drinking deeply of the pure and Crystal
River of Water of Life, proceeding from the Throne of God and of the Lamb. And
who would willingly remain abroad in an unpleasing Pilgrimage, and not choose
rather to come home to such sweet Company, and to such blessed Entertainment as
this is!

And thus we have at length dispatched the first part of our Saviors prayer,
in behalf of his Apostles and Disciples who were then about him, and in it the
first main thing which he desires for them, preservation.

The second follows now in order to be entered on, and here the main thing, that
he seeks in their behalf, is Sanctification. Sanctify them through thy truth,
thy word is truth.

And here we have two things to be considered. A Supplication, and an
Explication. First, We have here our Saviors Supplication to his Father, in
behalf of his Apostles and Disciples, Sanctify them through thy truth. And
then we have this Explication, in which he shows what he intends by truth, viz.
the word of God. Sanctify them with thy truth, thy word is truth.

Begin we with the Supplication, in which you may take notice with me, of these
two particulars. First, the thing desired, Sanctification: Sanctify them,
says our Savior; And then the outward instrumental means, by which he prays
they may be sanctified, the truth of God, that is the word, as he explains it
afterward, Sanctify them through thy truth.

Both yield us our this Observation.

DOCTRINE. The word of God is the ordinary Means by which he Sanctifies his
people.
It is the instrument in Gods hands, by which he does this great work. He
sanctifies them, he is the God of all grace, he calls and he makes perfect,
stablisheth, strengthens, settleth them. But he does it by this means,
according to our Saviors prayer here, Sanctify them through thy truth.

And here I shall distinctly clear these two things.

Acts 2.41. And yet again, as if these had been a few, five thousand by another
Sermon, Acts 4.4. And hence it is my brethren, that the word is called the word
of grace, because it works grace in Gods people. But whether this be the work
of the Law, or of the Gospel, whether one or both of them be the ordinary means
by which God sanctifies his people, will need to be a little further opened and
resolved. And I shall show you from the Scripture, that both of them are
instruments in Gods hand, by which he sanctifies his people.

1. God sanctifies his people preparatively by the Law. The Law converts, and
works grace by way of preparation. It shows a man his sin and his
trangression, it emptieth him of all opinion of himself, it humbles him, and
lays him low in apprehension of his own unworthiness: And so indeed, it makes
him fit to entertain the grace of God; for he will give his grace unto the
humble. John Baptists rough and rigid preaching of the Law you know, my
brethren, must prepare the way for Christ. He must be like a Pioner to go
before him, to bring down every high exalted thought, to make the Mountains
level with the Valleys; He must be like a Harbinger to ride before, and take
up room for Jesus Christ, to write his name upon the heart, This heart is taken
up for Christ; To cause these everlasting doors to be set open to him when he
comes. And when the heart is thus prepared, thus emptied, and thus opened once,
then it is fit for Jesus Christ with all the graces of his spirit to enter in
and dwell there. And this is all that God does by the Law, he sanctifies men
by way of preparation and predisposition only; But

2. The means by which he sanctifies them indeed, and works the truth and the
reality of saving grace in them, is the preaching of the Gospel; and therefore
the Apostle puts the question to the renewed Galathians, Gal. 3.2. This only
would I learn of you, says he; received ye the spirit by the works of the Law,
or by the hearing of faith? q. d. for this I appeal to you, I put the matter to
your consciences, whether the saving graces of the spirit, were not first wrote
in you by the hearing of faith: that is, by hearing the doctrine of faith,
which is the Gospel. And hence the Gospel is sometimes called the grace of God,
as you may see that place for instance, Titus 2.11. and that not formaliter,
for so the Gospel is not, neither can it be the grace of God (neither that
grace which is in God; I mean his free and undeserved favor; nor yet that
grace which is communicated and dispensed from him to us; I mean the gifts of
his spirit, whether they be such as appertain to edification, or
sanctification,) but effective, as the Schoolmen speak, the Gospel is the
grace of God, because the grace of God is the effect and issue of the Gospel.
The Gospel is the instrumental means of grace and holiness which it effects
under God, and works in the hearts of his people. And under this expression
it is set in opposition to the Law. For as the Law does not reveal the grace of
God in Jesus Christ the Mediator and Redeemer as the Gospel does: so neither
does it work the grace of God, I mean the saving gifts of his spirit: and
therefore it is called the Ministration of the Letter, and not the Ministration
of the Spirit, because there goes no spirit with it. Or if it carry any of the
spirit with it, it is the spirit of fear and bondage, and legal humiliation,
and not the spirit of adoption and sanctification. But on the other side, the
Gospel carries spirit in the ministration of it, which it conveyes into the
heart of those that hear it and embrace it, as they ought to do. It operateth
and begets the endowments of the spirit, and works grace and
sanctification.

And as the word of God is the ordinary means by which he begins already for
whom our Savior makes this prayer in my text; the work was begun in them, they
were his own Apostles and Disciples; and yet for them he prays, sanctify them
with thy Truth, q. d. Sanctify them yet more fully, make them yet more
gracious and more humble, and more holy, by a more full discovery of the Truth
revealed in thy Word to them: Sanctify them with thy truth, thy Word is truth.
Indeed the Word, my Brethren, as it is incorruptible seed, by which men are
regenerate and born again to God, as the Apostle shows, 1 Pet. 1.23. Being born
again, not of corruptible, but incorruptible seed, by the Word of God: so it is
milk which nourishes and makes them thrive and grow, while they are but babes
in Christ: and it is also strong meat on which they feed, until they come ad
(...), to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ. This for clearing of the point: proceed we to the Application.

turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Let them
lay out themselves in indefatigable pains this way. Let them be instant (as the
Apostle Paul exhorts Timothy) in season and out of season, and spare no
labor to accomplish such a blessed end as this is.

That they have preached long and labored hard, and yet they see no issue, no
success of all their labors; Their people are not turned to the Lord, no grace
appears in their lives and conversations, so that they are exceedingly
discouraged and disheartened in the work of God.

Sol.
To this I shall reply in two or three particulars, and I shall be brief in
them; for I am very sensible that other things will be more suitable to this
Assembly.

Eliah thought he had been left alone, and yet even then there were seven
thousand men that had not bowed the knee to Baal: Among the Rulers there were
some who were indeed converted and believed in Christ; and yet because they
were but novices, and newly entered, they were fearful to acknowledge and
confess him; Grace is not always wrought with observation, as our Savior
shows, Mat. 13.13. It is compared to Seed in Scripture, which after it is
sown, lies hid and covered in the earth a while, and is not seen. And
therefore faithful Teachers should not be disheartened because they cannot see
the fruit of their endeavors; it may be they have sown the seed, that may
spring up and flourish in another age. And they have laid the good foundation
under ground, and out of sight, on which another faithful Minister may build,
and raise a very goodly frame. And herein is that saying sometimes verified;
(to use our Saviors own word) Joh. 4.37. One sows and another reapeth: The
Prophets labored, and the Apostles entered on their labors; and so it is at
this day.

Though their labor be in vain, respectively to their desired issue and Thou
shall speak my words unto them, says the Lord unto EZekiel, chap. 2.7. whether
they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious house;
And the Apostles exhortation is very apposite to this purpose, 2 Timothy 4.4. They
shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
What now, must Timothy desist from preaching any more unto them? No, says the
Apostle, watch thou in all things, endure affliction, make full proof of thy
Ministry: Be diligent, perform thy duty, and leave the success to God; Waiting
if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the
Truth, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil, by
whom they are led Captive at his will.

If they continue in their ministerial labors, though no apparent good They
are to God a sweet savor in Christ, not in them that are saved only, but in
them that perish too, 2 Cor. 2 15. Though they spend their strength in vain
(with reference to the conversion of the people) yet their judgment is with
the Lord, and their work is with their God: that is, the recompense and reward
of it, Isa. 49.4. And they have their recompense secundum laborem, non secundum
proventum, as Bernard speaks, according to their labor, and not according to
the issue and success.

But in the last place my Beloved, if after all their tiring pains and tedious

And as the Ministers are hence encouraged to preach the Word, so in Sanctify
them with thy Truth, thy Word is truth: And therefore you that are strangers to
the life of grace, be you entreated and prevailed withal to put your selves
under the powerful preaching of the Word and Gospel of the Lord Jesus; O wait
upon the doors of Wisedoms house, be swift to hear, attend upon the Word of
God, lay hold on every opportunity to be partakers of this holy Ordinance, and
then perhaps it may in time become a word of grace unto you, you may be
sanctified by this Truth.

The Dog is turned to his own vomit, and the Sow that was washed to her
wallowing in the mire.

David to be planted by the water side, Psalm. 1.3. Even so the thriving and the
growing Christian, must be planted by the means, he must be near the Word of
God, those waters of the Sanctuary, as the Prophet calls them: That saving
Doctrine must drop down upon him as the rain, it must distill upon him as the
dew, and as the smaller rain upon the herbs, and as the showrs upon the grass,
as Moses speaks, Deuteronomy. 32.2. or else he will be like in time to wither, and
decay, and come to nothing.

sanctifies his people not only in a way of inchoation, but also in a way of
augmentation? Then certainly those men are in an ill condition, who though they
constantly enjoy the preaching of the Gospel, yet do not thrive nor grow by it;
they hear it Sabbath after Sabbath, yea and perhaps repeat it with their
families, and yet are not a jot the better for it any way. Look at what point
they were for knowledge, practice and obedience many years ago, at the very
same they stay; they are the very same men, there is no alteration on them,
they have not gained any ground on their corruptions, they are not grown a jot
more constant and fervent in religious duties then in former times. What is the
reason that the Gospel produces not its genuine effect in these men, and that
it brings forth no augmentation, no increase of inward grace, or outward
obedience? the fault is not in the inefficacy of the Gospel, simply considered
in it self, but in the hardness and deadness of their hearts; and as we use to
say of ground that is manured and dressed, and watered much, if it yields no
increase, that it is very barren ground; just so we may conclude of these men:
And certainly their case is fearful, if they so continue, as the Apostle shows
us in the same Similitude, Heb. 6.7. The earth that drinks in the rain that
comes often upon it, and bringth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
dressed, receives blessing from God: But on the other side, that which
brings briars and thorns is rejected and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to
be burned: And therefore I beseech you my Beloved, as increase and growth in
grace is one effect in Gods Word, so let it bring forth this effect in you; and
that it may so do, I shall prescribe you some directions.

Remove those impediments that hinder growth and profiting by

1. The first is pride and loftiness of heart and spirit; for when a man is
puffed up with a self opinion of his own sufficiency, and thinks he knows as much
as all the Preachers in the world can tell him, how can he profit by the
Gospel! He is so full that when the water of the Word is poured upon him,
either it runs over, and is spilt upon the ground, or else returns back
upon the face of him that poured it. If therefore you desire to thrive by it,
come to hear it my Beloved with teachable and humble spirits; the Lord will
teach the humble his ways.

2. Infidelity or unbelief; for if we give no credit to the Word of God, if we
believe not the report of the Word of God, his arm will never be revealed to
us, we shall not benefit, nor profit by it: And therefore this is yielded as
the reason why the Jews were not a whit the better for the Word, Heb. 4.2. The
Word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.

3. The third impediment is strong passion; for as obstructions in the stomach
hinder growth by bodily and outward food; so vehement and headstrong passions
do keep us from receiving growth and nourishment, and augmentation by the Word
of God. You shall observe it commonly, that men that have such furious and
unbridled passions in them, that will not be subdued by reason, nor by
Scripture, do seldom profit by the preaching of the Gospel; no, it must be
received with meekness if we mean to grow by it, Jam. 1.12. And therefore the
Apostle yields it as the reason why the Corinthians could not bear strong meat,
substantial solid truths, their stomachs were not able to digest them, they
were so cloid with these obstructions, 1 Cor. 3.2.

4. Prejudice against the gifts or person of the Teacher; this will exceedingly
abate the power, and hinder the success and profit of his teaching: If once the
heart be prepossest with jealousies and sinister thoughts and disaffection to
the Minister, there is but little hope of any benefit that such a man will reap
by his labors. These are the lets which we must labor to remove, if we desire
to thrive and grow by hearing of the Word of God.



may plant, and Apollo may water, but the success (if any be) must be from God,
as the Apostle shows, 1 Cor. 3.6. and therefore must seek it at his hands:
Before we go to hear him speaking to us in his Word, let him hear us speaking
to him in our prayers, that he would sanctify his holy Ordinance, and make it
by his blessing to become a means of our increase in holiness and grace, until
we come to be complete in Christ Jesus: Seeing the Word is but an Instrument in
his hand, let us pray that he would manage it, and weild it, and make it
powerful and successful. Let us renew our Saviors supplication in the Text,
every time we go to hear, Lord, sanctify us with thy truth: thy truth alone
and of it self will never do it, unless thou sanctify us by it, and therefore
Lord do thou appear in this business: Sanctify us with thy truth, thy Word is
truth.

JOHN 17.17. Thy Word is truth.


OUR Savior as he is a Mediator of Redemption to his people, so of
Intercession too. He finished the former (as his own expression is) and he
began the latter, while he was here in this world. The Chapter is a model of
it, wherein he gives his Apostles and Disciples a fore-taste, from which they
might a little guess what he was like to do more fully for them, when he was
ascended and sat down at the right hand of his Father, to be an everlasting
Advocate and Intercessor for his Church and people. And here there are two
things especially, which he desires in their behalf, to which at least all the
rest may be reduced, Preservation and Sanctification. He enters on the latter
in the verse now read, and so did we the last occasion.

And here we have as I have showed you, the Supplication and the Explication.
The Supplication, Sanctify them with thy truth. The Explication, what is meant
by truth, the Word of God, Thy Word is truth.

The last Lord's Day I dispatched the Supplication, so that the Explication
comes to be insisted on at this time; Thy Word is truth.

It seems to be an answer to the self same question which Pilate sometimes put
to Christ himself, but would not tarry for a resolution. What is truth? So
sanctify them, says our Savior, with thy truth. But what is truth? you have
the answer in the following clause, Thy Word is truth.

There is the Word God, and there is the word of God. The one is Christ the Son
of God; for he is called the Word in Scripture, and he is the Word God, as you
may see that place for instance, 1 John 1. In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The other is the will of God
revealed and manifested in the Scripture. And it is called the word of God,
because as the words of men discover what their mind is, which else you were
not able to imagine; so the Word of God, the Scripture, discovers to us what
the mind of God is, so far as it is necessary to salvation.

Now this Word, says our Savior here, is truth; Thy Word is truth. It is not
only true, but truth it self; and so indeed is all the Scripture; the Law and
Gospel both of them are all truth, conformable in all respects to the Idaea of
them in the mind of God. But yet the Gospel is the Truth by way of Excellency
above the rest of holy Scripture. Not that the Law, or any other part of the
Old Testament, is not so true as Gospel is; for there are no degrees in truth
as truth. Words are either true alike; or some are true, and others false: But
the Old Testament, and legal truths, are not be compared in some respects to
the New Testament and Gospel truths: These have the odds and the advantage of
the other; And therefore this, I mean the Gospel, is principally called the
Truth in the language of the Scripture, as I shall show you more at large
hereafter.

And this at least is chiefly aimed at by our Savior, when he says, thy Word
is truth; for of that truth he speaks apparently, which is the instrumental
means by which God sanctifies his people. And that is not legal truth; God does
not sanctify men by the preaching of the Law, save only in a way of
preparation and predisposition. The Gospel only works the truth and the reality
of holiness and grace, as I have showed abundantly out of the former member of
the Text. And therefore it is Gospel truth that is especially intended here,
which is the only proper instrument of sanctification. Sanctify them with thy
truth, thy Word is truth. So then the Observation lies before us.

DOCTRINE. The word of God of God, especially the Gospel, is the Truth.
In prosecution of the Point, I have two things to clear to you, before I come
to application. First, That the word of God is all truth; there is no falsehood
or deceit in it, and I shall be brief on that. Then that the Gospel is the
truth by way of excellence, and in a specialty above the rest of Holy
Scripture. I do not say the Gospel is more true then other things contained in
the book of God, but it is truth of more concernment, and of more use, as I
shall make it evidently and distinctly to appear to you.

Thy word is truth. Whether it be the word of History, the things that are
historically represented to us in the Scripture, or the word of precept, or the
word of promise, or the word of threatening, all is truth. If you look to the
intention of the Author of the word, God has delivered nothing in it with a
purpose to deceive. Or if you look to the matter of the word, the things
themselves that are delivered in the Scripture, they are indeed as they are
there expressed. The sayings of the Lord are true sayings, Apoc. 19.9. whether
they be the sayings of the Father, or the sayings of the Son; For God the
Father has his saying, God spoke these words in the preface to the Law. And
God the Son has his saying, Verily I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he
shall never see death, John 8.51. And both of these, the sayings of the one and
of the other, the sayings of the Father, the Law of works, the sayings of the
Son, the Law of faith, are absolutely and exactly true, there is no falsehood or
deceit in them; They are the true sayings of God.

And they must needs be true, because they are the sayings of God. Thy word is
truth, says our Savior in my text. It is thine, and therefore truth. For he
that is the author of it, he is the God of truth, as the Prophet David styles
him, Psalm. 31.5. Observe it well, he does not say he is the true God in
himself, and in his nature, but he is the God of truth in his discoveries and
revelations of himself to men. All that comes from him is truth. He is the
faithful and the true witness, Apoc. 3.14. Not only true and faithful as a
God, but true and faithful as a witness; And his word is his witness, not his
ordinary saying only, but his witness to confirm us and assure us of that which
is delivered to us, to work and strengthen faith in us. And therefore it is
called the Testimony, or the witness of the Lord, I think no less then twenty
times in Scripture.

Thy word is truth, says our Savior in my Text, that is thy sanctifying word
which is the Gospel, Sanctify them with thy truth, thy word is truth.

The Law, (as far as I am able to remember) is nowhere called distinctly by it
self the word of truth; but the Gospel commonly, not in my Text alone but
elsewhere often. Indeed the Psalmist prays to God, Take not thy word of truth
away out of my mouth; but he intends the promises for which he hoped, as you
may see in that place, Psalm 119.43. And all the promises you know are Gospel,
they are in Christ yea, and in Christ Amen. But on the other side the Law is
mentioned as in some respect contradistinct to truth. The Law was given by
Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, 1 John 17.

And yet you must not apprehend the Gospel to be truer then the Law, or any
parts of Scripture. If it be truer, they are absolutely false. But it delivers
truth of greater excellency then the rest of Scripture does, as will appear if
you consider either the subject matter of it, or the Revelation of it, or the
Confirmation of it, or the Operation of it.

Gospel truth excels for the matter of it. Christ is the subject Let the
word of Christ dwell in you richly, not of Christ the Author only, but of
Christ the subject matter: and herein it surpasses and transcends, not all
other Books only that handle other arguments, but even all other parts and
parcels of the Book of God it self. For Christ is the most precious and
delicious matter. He is the richest, and the sweetest subject in the world.

1. Christ the Subject of the Gospel is the most rich and precious subject. He
is the wealth and treasure of the faithful soul; there is in him an endless
Mine and infinite Mass of inestimable riches. And therefore the Apostle having
spoken of the riches of the glory of the Gospel, adds in the words immediately
anexed, which riches is Christ in you, Col. 1.27. In him are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2.3. A treasure is much, but treasures
are more. But when all the treasures that are in the world, shall be gathered
together, and laid in a heap, there must needs be vast and riches. And this
transported the Apostle Paul and swallowed up his thoughts and words, as unable
to conceive it or express it, yea even ravished him beyond himself, that he was
entrusted to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, Ephesians. 3.8. He found no
end, no bottom of them, he could not reach the height, and depth, and length,
and breadth of those treasures, they had such immense and endless dimensions.

2. Christ the subject of the Gospel, is the sweetest and most delicious
subject in the world. It was the only thing that weakened the delight that
Austin took in reading of a certain work of Cicero's, because he could not find
the name of Christ in it. That is a pleasant name indeed to every true
believing soul; and wheresoever that is found, or whatsoever writing has that
high and holy person for the subject of it, whom to know is life eternal,
should be read with full delight and high pleasure. And therefore that which
treats of Jesus Christ, is styled Gospel, good news, and good tidings; yea good
tidings of great joy. It tells us of a Jesus, a Savior, a deliverer out of
bondage to sin and Satan and damnation, out of the most sad and miserable
thraldom in the world; and this is infinitely sweet. Oh with what melting,
self-consuming wishes and desires does the poor distressed Captive long to hear
of a Redeemer? how welcome is this news to him? and such a one is Jesus Christ
to us, and therefore it is sweet to hear of him. And as the Gospel tells us of
deliverance out of bondage, so of admission to such incomparable privileges
here, to such unutterable happiness hereafter, as cannot choose but melt the
heart with ravishing delight that has assurance of a share in them.

that we behold it now with open face, 2 Cor. 3.18. There is nothing now to
hide it; The truth of the Old Testament is likened to the glimmering twilight
in the dawning of the day, or to the faint and dimmer twinkling of a star; But
Gospel truth is likened to the shining of the Sun at noonday. And therefore we
that live under Gospel-revelation are called the Children of the light and of
the day, 1 These. 5.5. And the Apostle tells us that now the grace of God which
brings salvation has appeared, Tit. 2.11. It is a Metaphor in which the Gospel
is resembled to a glorious Light, that having been obscured and masked awhile
(even as the Sun when it is overcast and mufled with a dark and gloomy cloud)
at length shines forth with admirable brightness and shows it self with
darling splendour to the world. Though it were hid from ages and from
generations, yet it is now made manifest unto the Saints, Col. 1.26.

He has sealed it with his blood, and therefore we have reason to believe it.
Indeed the truth of the Old Testament was ratified and confirmed, yea it was
confirmed in blood: But this was but the blood of Bulls and Goats; But now it
is confirmed by the blood of Christ himself, which is a better and a more
effectual confirmation. And this is that which the Apostle shows at large, Heb.
9.16. and in the following verses. So that the blood which ratified the Old
Testament, was but the shadow and the Type of that which ratifies the new; and
therefore this has the advantage of the other. I must confess that the Old
Testament was ratified by the death of Jesus Christ in destination, for so he
was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world: But this is ratified by
the death of Christ in actual execution, which is if not in it self, to us at
least, a cleerer and a better confirmation.

the word of grace, the word of life.

1. Gospel truth works grace. Not common grace, and common sorrow, and
humiliation, and repentance as the Law does, but saving grace: And therefore it
is called the word of grace, Acts 20.32. It is so exclusively, it works grace
alone, without the help and the assistance of the Law in that business.
Something the Law may do toward us indeed, but it does nothing in the work of
grace. Of his own will begat he us says the Apostle, by the word of truth,
that is the Gospel, James 1.18. That, only that is properly and strictly
sanctifying truth, Sanctify them with thy truth.

2. Gospel truth infuseth life, and that no other truth can do. The Law indeed
can kill, but it cannot make alive; It is the Ministry of death and
condemnation. The Gospel only is the Ministry of life and of Salvation. And
therefore this exceeds the other, and surpasses it in glory, as the Apostle
shows at large, 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, etc. In this respect we find the Gospel called
the word of life, 1 John 1.1. because it is the word that works life. It is
the quickening word that raises men from death to life, to the life of grace in
this world, and to the life of glory in the world to come.

And thus, I think we have sufficiently cleared the point, the word of God,
especially the Gospel is the truth. Proceed we now to make some application of
it, according to the diverse branches of the point in order. I shall but touch
upon the first, because I would no be prevented in the second.

Is it so, my brethren, that the word of God is all truth? then certainly For
what is faith but the belief of truth? as the Apostle Paul defines it, 2 These.
2.13. He has chosen us to Salvation through Sanctification of the spirit, and
belief of the truth. So that if the word be truth, it ought to be believed by
us. And this our Savior Christ insinuates in his expostulation with the Jews,
John 8.46. If I say truth, why do you not believe me? Though that which is
delivered in the word of God be never so improbable, never so much above
corrupt reason, never so impossible to a humane apprehension, yet it admits
not of doubtful Disputation and Expostulation, but rather calls for absolute
belief.

And therefore they are deeply to be censured, who give no credit to the word
of truth, further then their private spirits close with it, who do not answer
Gods truth with their faith. They read it and they hear it preached, but they
yield no assent to it. No, they oppose it and dispute against it, they are mere
Scepticks in religion; There are a multitude of such in these times. They
consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
the Doctrine which is according to godliness, as the Apostle Paul speaks, 1 Timothy 6.3, 4. Whereas they that have ever felt the saving power of Gods word,
have their thoughts captivated to it, and will say as the Apostle, we can do
nothing, we can speak nothing against the truth, 2 Cor. 13.8. These men upon
the other side, when they hear the truth of God delivered to them, speak
against it, contradicting and blaspheming, as the stubborn Jews did; Acts
13.45. They do not only ask with Mary, how shall this be? A question not of
opposition, but of inquisition, Luke 1.34. But even peremptorily determine they
can never be. And thus they belie the Lord, like those of whom the Prophet
speaks, Jer. 5.12. This in a word for application of the former member of the
point. We shall now apply the latter.



First, Let us give it the due preferment in our inquisition, let us dive into
it most, and labor more to be acquainted with it then with any other truth.
Let us read those books, let us hear those Preachers, and let us nourish those
studies, which help us most to this knowledge; let us make this our main
endeavor to be seen in Gospel truth: let us undervalue and neglect all other
knowledge incomparison of this. It is the dangerous mistake of the greater part
of men, who had rather be acquainted with the matters of the world, and to be
skild in secular and humane learning, then in the doctrine of the Gospel. How
do abundance plod to dive into the secrets and depths of nature, and set their
wits upon the tenter-hooks, to search into the mysteries of Arts and Trades!
how do they beat and work their brains to get abundance of experience and skill
in worldly dealings and employments! but take no pains at all in hearing,
reading, meditation, to dive into the mysteries of Jesus Christ. Tell me my
beloved, have you ever among all your earnest strivings after insight either
into humane knowledge, or into matters of the world, been half so studious and
industrious to search into this Gospel truth, to be acquainted with Christ
Jesus who is the subject of the Gospel, to know that he was born, and lived and
dyed for you, to know him and the virtue of his resurrection, not by
speculation only, but experience, raising you up to newness of life, to know
that he loved you, and gave himself for you? Alas the hearts of a great many of
you, cannot choose but tell you, that you have hardly ever spent a serious
thought on this. And the very best among us cannot choose but say that we have
been too slight and careless in our enquiries into this knowledge. Ah my
beloved, had we the spirit of the Apostle Paul, or of those blessed Angels, who
desire to peep and pry into the Gospel truth as you may see, 1 Pet. 1.12. we
would not foolishly mispend so much of our precious time, in empty, frothy and
unnecessary studies, nor waste away that Lamp of reason in our bosoms in
unprofitable blazes, but we would set more time apart to look into the Patent
of salvation, and to acquaint our selves with Jesus Christ before hand, that
when we come into his presence at the latter day, we may be entertained as
friends and not as strangers. You hear that Gospel truth is the study of the
Angels, they had a little inckling of it, and it was so ravishing, that they
must dive and pry into it; they were not able to forbear it. Oh Fools and
Idiots that we are that now the Lord has made it plain to us we should be so
careless of it, that now the knowledge of it is attainable, we should wilfully
neglect that precious truth which was so studied and enquired into in Heaven,
which Angels reached after, and yet when all was done, came short of the
discovery.

Secondly, Since Gospel truth excells all other truth, let us give it the
preferment, as in our Inquisition, so in our acceptance, and let us value it
and prize it above other truth. Every truth of God is precious, but this truth
is most precious, and therefore should be most esteemed and laid up with most
care. All the sayings of God are worthy of acceptance, but Gospel sayings are
worthy of all acceptance; 1 Timothy 1.15. all that is possible to entertain them
with. And therefore the Prophets call the time of the Gospel tempus
acceptabile, the acceptable time, the year of the Lord, Isa. 16.2. And if we
look into the Scriptures, my beloved, we shall see what worthy acceptance it
has found. Zacheus made haste and received our Savior gladly into his house,
Luke 19.6. So did the brethren at Jerusalem receive the Apostles because they
brought the Gospel with them, Acts 21.17. So did the Bereans receive the Gospel
it self with all readiness of mind, or forward affection, (...), Acts 17.11. So
did the Galathians receive the Apostle with the honor of an Angel, even as
Jesus Christ himself, because he preached this excelling truth to them, Gal.
4.14. The Merchant in the Parable (you know) did dearly purchase it, the Saints
did earnestly contend for it, and took the Kingdom of heaven by violence. And
has it found the like esteem with you my brethren? have you received and
entertained it as a transcendent and excellent truth? have your souls been even
ravished with the knowledge of it? have you preferred it in your thoughts and
your desires before all other knowledge, yea before all other things? Alas how
many are there that never valued it, who think it to be foolishness in
comparison of that which brings them worldly profit or advantage! It is a
miserable thing to see how this incomparable Gospel is slighted in the world.

Now I beseech you my beloved; think upon it, what is it that you despise? The
wisdom of God in a mystery which is adorned with so many glorious Titles in
the Scripture to raise our hearts and our affections to it, without which all
the wisdom and all the learning in the world is nothing else but loss and dung.
And who is it that you despise in it? for the contempt and undervaluing of the
Gospel carries in it more dishonor to every person of the Trinity, then any
other sin. It is a shameful undervaluing of the Fathers wisdom, which he has
showed in no one thing so much as in the revelation of the Gospel, and
therefore it is called the wisdom of God, as if the Gospel were the short
abridgement, the sum and the Epitome of Gods wisdom. It is a fearful
slighting of the Fathers love, as if in all the business of our Saviors
passion he had but put himself to needless compassion, and showed such love to
men, as he might very well have kept in his own bosom, for any thing we either
need it, or care for it. It is an horrible contempt to Jesus Christ, to suffer
him to stand waiting at our doors, even till his head be full of dew, and his
locks with the drops of the night, to put in his fingers by the hole of the
lock, to humble, empty and deny himself, to suffer the indignities and wrongs
of men, the heavy wrath of God himself, and after all to have that precious
blood which was drawn out with such woeful agonies, and with such exquisite and
horrid tortures, counted no other then the blood of a common Malefactor, no
more regarded nor looked after, no, though presented and offered to us, and that
with obsecrations and entreaties too; who is able to express such baseness as
this is! It is a high indignity to the blessed Spirit of grace to suffer him to
wait in vain, to move, and to persuade in vain, to beg and to beseech in vain,
till we do even weary him, and send him sad from us. Oh let us tremble of such
contemptuous usage of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, in the
contempt of their Gospel; And henceforth let us receive it and embrace it as an
excelling truth, as that which is of singular behoof and use, and consequently
calls for singular esteem from us.

it should be glorified by us, and among us, as the Apostles phrase is, 2 Thessalonians. 3.1. As it is excellent in it self, so it should be presented to the
world as excellent by us, while we adorn it by our holy lives, as the Apostle
Paul exhorts, Tit. 2.10. that we adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all
things.

And in a word, my Brethren, We must walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ,
this excellent Gospel, Phil. 1.27. And to this end I shall commend unto you,
but these two things: First you must maintain it as an excellent truth.
Secondly, you must obey it as an excellent truth.

Paul insinuates, 2 Cor, 13.8. I can do nothing against the truth, but for the
truth. But you must stand for Gospel truth rather, and more then for any other
truth, because it is of more concernment, and of more use. We are more eager
and earnest in asserting the right and interest we have in things of worth,
then in things of smaller value: That which is excellent, will have more to
stand for it, then that which is comparatively mean and much inferior to it:
and men will do it much more vehemently for a jewel then for a trifle: so let
us in this case; and more particularly and distinctly let us earnestly maintain
this excellent Gospel truth both by arguments and sufferings.

1. Let us earnestly maintain it by our Arguments and Reasons. The more
excellent a truth is, the more we must appear for it, the more extremely tender
we must be of any opposition that is made against it, the more we must
endeavor to vindicate it and evince it, and to convince the gainsayers. It is
no wisdom for a man to lay out all his strength and heat on points of small
consideration, as many men who are as earnest and as hot in petty matters as it
is possible for men to be, and strive as much about words (as the Apostles
phrase is) as they will about things. But when the weighty points of Gospel
truths come once in agitation, when they are contradicted and opposed (as they
have been exceedingly of late days) then it behooves us to bestir our selves, to
draw up all the arguments that we are able, to call in all the reason that we
have, to defend and to make good such excellent and precious things as these
are: We must contend for such truths, for they are worth the striving for with
all our might; so the Apostle Jude would have us, (...), earnestly contend or
struggle for the faith delivered to the Saints, Jude 2, 1. I think he does not
mean the grace of faith, but the doctrine of faith, which is the Gospel; and
therefore it is added presently, for there are certain men crept in among you,
turning the grace of God (which is the subject of the Gospel) into
lasciviousness; so that you see my Brethren, Gospel truth must be contended
for, and that with earnestness, even to an Agony; as once Apollos convinced the
dissenting Jews (who doubted of that great point of the Gospel, whether Jesus
was that Christ or no) and he did it mightily, Act. 18.28. he did it as it were
with all his might, being fervent in spirit, as it is said at the 25. verse; so
that if any in these latter times have been too earnest and too vehement (as
some have thought) in asserting Gospel truth, either in preaching, or
discourse, they may the better be excused.

2. Let us earnestly maintain this excelling Gospel truth, as by our arguments,
so by our sufferings, if God shall call us thereunto. It is an extraordinary
honor and establishment to any truth, when some are raised up to suffer for it.
As on the other side it is a shame and a disparagement when the professors of
it give it over, and relinquish it as soon as times of trial come. Oh let not
this dishonor come on the Gospel by our means: Let us stick to it, even to the
loss of goods, and liberty, and life it self, let us seal it with our blood.
Our Savior Christ himself you know, did not think his blood too dear to
ratify the New Covenant, and to establish and confirm the Gospel, to seal the
truth of Gospel promises. Let us not think that our blood is ill bestowed, if
it may serve in any measure to that end for which Christ shed his.

And as we must maintain this Gospel truth as an excellent truth both obedience
to the Law, but of obedience to the Gospel too, 2 Thessalonians. 1.8. And do you yield
it this obedience? Do you live, and do you walk by Gospel rules? Brethren, I
make no question all of you expect salvation by the Gospel: but do you hearken
to the counsel and instruction of the Gospel? You expect deliverance by it, but
do you yield obedience to it? I pray stand still a little, and consider with
your selves, and accordingly resolve. When you profane Gods holy day, neglect
the duties of his worship, either in public or in private, blaspheme his
name, defraud and overreach your Brethren; when you please your selves with
actual or contemplative uncleanness; when you drink to drunkenness, or walk in
any other sinful courses, be they what they will: what does the Gospel teach
you these things? I say as the Apostle, have you so learned Christ out of the
Gospel?

Does the pure and holy Gospel of the Lord Jesus give any approbation to such
courses? and do you think my Brethren, that the Gospel will ever save you, if
it do not guide and rule you? that it will ever make you happy, if it do not
make you holy? Now I beseech you my Beloved, ponder it and weigh it well, and
look for no salvation by the Gospel, unles you yield obedience to the Gospel:
For if you do, first you dishonor it; and secondly, you disappoint yout selves.

1. First you do exceedingly dishonor it, you cast a blemish and a stain upon
it, you do not walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ, but cause it to be evil
thought, and evil spoken of by wicked men: as if Christ saved men that live and
walk and persevere in lewdness and profaneness, as if he favored and allowed of
such courses; as if he fitted and provided heaven for swearers, drunkards and
unclean persons. What kind of Doctrine may they think is that which holds out
such beatitude to be expected and enjoyed by such wretches? Thus you prejudice
the Gospel, you cast contempt upon it, and take away its excellency in the eyes
of wicked men.

2. Whiles you expect salvation by the Gospel, and do not yield obedience to
the Gospel, you strangely disappoint your selves, and woefully delude your own
souls; You may be confident of heaven while you persist in such courses; but
when you come thither you will be ashamed, as Job speaks, chap. 6.20. Believe
it Brethren, salvation and instruction will not be divided: you must take them
both together; you cannot have the former, without obedience to the latter. If
you will hear and learn and practice what the Gospel teaches, you shall enjoy
that which the Gospel offers. If you will be obedient to the Gospel, you
shall be saved by the Gospel, otherwise you cannot. As Christ is the Author, so
the Gospel is the Instrument of life and salvation to them that obey it. As Soon
those black Infernal Legions, that are already damned to everlasting chains and
darkness, shall be saved by the Gospel, as they that cast behind their backs
the precepts of the Gospel, and will not walk accordingly in their lives and
conversations.

It is a dreadful sentence to this purpose, able to break the hearts of wicked
men, and to shake their joints in pieces, 2 Thessalonians. 1.8. The Lord Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendering vengeance
to them that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Indeed as Gospel truth is most excellent, so disobedience to this Gospel truth
is most dangerous; we know what a fearful doom and dreadful sentence the
Apostle thunders out against it, Heb. 10.26. If we sin wilfully after we have
received the knowledge of the truth (the Gospel truth) there remains no more
sacrifice for sin. From which perversely wrested, though Novatus did extract
that desperate Heresy of his, denying hope of pardon unto those who after they
were once baptized, relapsed into sin: Yet (those uncomfortable inferences
being laid aside) this is most evidently taught us in that Scripture, viz. That
where the mind has been enlightened once with Gospel truth, it tends
exceedingly to the increase and aggravation of those sins that are committed
after and against it. And therefore upon these considerations, labor to walk
worthy of so glorious a Gospel, and so great a Salvation.

JOHN. 17.18. As thou sent me into the world, etc.


AND thus far of our Saviors Prayer in the behalf of his Apostles and
Disciples for Sanctification; Sanctify them with thy truth, thy word is truth.

Proceed we to the arguments and reasons with which he urges and enforces
this Petition and request of his. And they are two. Whereof the first is taken
from the business and employment that he is setting them about; viz. the very
same (in some respect at least) which he himself has hitherto sustained and
undergone by the appointment of the Father; As thou have sent me into the
world, so I have sent them into the world, I am now about to send them, it is
as good as done already: (For yet they had not their Commission to preach the
Gospel to all the world, to every creature.) And therefore thou had need to
sanctify them, says our Savior to his Father, by a more full discovery of
thy truth to them, that so they may be fitted and enabled for such a service as
this is. It is extremely necessary that they should be qualified with all the
gifts and graces of the Spirit to the very utmost, being to go upon the very
self same errand and business on which thou have employed me; Sanctify them,
says our Savior. Why, might the Father answer, why so? Cause enough says
Jesus Christ; for as thou have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world.

There are two things to be considered in the words. There is something
positive, and there is in the second place something comparative.

1. There is something positive in these words, which Christ affirms
positively of himself and his Apostles. That which he affirms positively of
himself, is, that his Father has sent him into the world. That which he
affirms positively of his Apostles and Disciples, is, That he is sending them
into the world.

There is something Comparative, in which our Savior Christ compares his
Fathers sending him with his own sending his Apostles; As thou have sent me
into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

I shall but touch on that which Christ affirms positively of himself, and
that as you have heard, is, that his Father has sent him down into the world;
He would not suffer him to stay in heaven, but sent him forth upon some weighty
and important business; so that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ was sent into the world, by the appointment and
command of God the Father.
The word in the Original imports an authoritative sending, which is
accordingly submitted to and yield to by the person that is sent. (...), says
our Savior to the Father; Thou have sent me into the world, so sent, that I
accordingly am come into the world, I have stoopt to thy mission; But this has
for the substance of it been handled on the third verse, and therefore I shall
wave the further prosecution of it here, and pass on to the following words.

JOHN. 17.18. Even so have I also sent them into the world.


AND thus of that which Jesus Christ has affirmed of himself, in relation to
his Father, Thou have sent me into the world. Proceed we now to that which he
affirms of his Apostles, and in them of his succeeding Ministers, in relation
to himself, I also have sent them into the world.

And here we have to be considered three things. First the author of the
Mission I; I stands for Jesus, I have sent. Secondly, the term or local object
of the Mission, the world, without restraint or limitation, all the world. I
have sent them into the world. Not into Judea only, but into the world.
Thirdly, the comparison, between our Saviors mission of his Apostles and
Ambassadors, and his Fathers mission of himself, suggested in the word also, I
also have sent them into the world; as thou sent me into the world, even so
have I also sent them, etc.

As the parts, so the Observations are three. First the Apostles and Ministers
of Jesus Christ are sent by him, they are of Christ's own sending: Secondly,
Christ does not send them particularly, or restrictively to any Country, or to
any Nation: But their Commission leaves them free to all the world. Thirdly,
Jesus Christ sends his Apostles and his Ministers, even as his Father sent him.
There is a great similitude between Gods sending Christ into the world, and
Christ's sending his Apostles and Ministers into the world. I shall handle these
distinctly, as God shall give ability and opportunity: Beginning with the first.

DOCTRINE. The Apostles and the Ministers of Jesus Christ are sent by him, they
are of Christ's own sending.
For the Apostles they have their very name from sending. The word in the
Original imports such a one as is dispatched upon the errand of another, upon
the business that another sends him in: And Christ is often said to send them.
There are two memorable missions of them, mentioned in the Gospel story. The
first a little after he had called them, Mat. 10.1, etc. When he had called his
twelve Disciples (and they were his twelve Apostles, as they are styled, ver.
2.) he gave them power against unclean spirits. And these twelve he sent forth,
ver. 1. and after at ver. 16. Behold I send you forth, says he, as sheep among
Wolves. The second memorable mission of them was a little after he was risen
from the dead, and was even ready to ascend, Joh. 20.21. Even as my Father sent
me, so send I you. And this is that which the Apostle Paul acknowledges, that
he was sent by Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. 1.17. Christ sent me; what to do? not only,
no not chiefly to baptize, but to preach the Gospel.

And as for ordinary Ministers, I take the seventy Disciples to be such. And of
them it is observed in the story, Luke 10.1, etc. After these things the Lord
appointed other 70. also, and sent them two and two before his face; and adds
presently, Behold I send you forth as Lambs among Wolves. It is a rule that the
Apostle Paul lays down, Romans 10.15. How shall they preach except they be sent?
He does not say unless they be gifted, but unless they be sent. How shall they
do the work and business of the Ministers of Christ, unless they be sent by
Christ? so that the point is clear you see, that the Apostles and the Ministers
of Christ are sent by Christ.

But least I be mistaken here, I must interpose a caution. You must not
understand that they are sent by Christ Exclusively, that is, by him, and none
but him: Neither as to the sending of the Father and the holy Ghost, the other
Persons of the Godhead: Nor yet as to the sending of the Church: Neither of
them is excluded, when we say, That the Apostles and Ministers of Jesus Christ
are sent by him.

They are not sent by him Exclusively as to the sending of the other Persons of
the Godhead, the Father and the Holy Ghost. The works of the Trinity without
are undivided; and certainly it is their work as well as his, to send forth
Ministers into the Church; and hence it is not only said, that Christ when he
ascended up on high, he gave some Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, and
Teachers. Ephesians. 4.11. Some extraordinary, some ordinary Ministers in his Church:
But it is also said, That God has see some in the Church, first Apostles,
secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, etc. 1 Cor. 12.28. God has sent them,
and that not God the Son only, but God the Father, and Holy Ghost too. Indeed
the Scripture is express for this, that all the three concurred in this
business. The Father thrusts forth Laborers into his Vineyard, Mat. 9.38. The
Son gives Ministers in the forecited Text, Ephesians. 4.11. The Holy Ghost makes
Overseers, Act. 20.28. Take heed to your selves, says the Apostle to the
Elders of Ephesus, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you
Overseers: So that you see, Christ sends not Ministers exclusively as to the
sending of the Father and the Holy Ghost.

2. Nor does he send them in the second place exclusively as to the sending of
the Church: She also has a hand (my Brethren) under Christ, and by authority
from Christ in this mission. Election appertains to her, according to the rule
of Christ, she chooses out fit men, Act. 6.3. So Ordination appertains to her;
I mean, she does it by her Officers, as Act. 14.23. And Ordination as it is a
Designation to the Ministry, so it is at least a virtual and implicit sending
forth to the work of the Minstry: And therefore Ministers are called the
Messengers of the Churches, 2 Cor. 8.23. Not the Messengers of Christ alone,
but of the Church of Christ too: They are not only sent by him, but they are
sent by her also; she is the Wife, the Spouse of Jesus Christ, and so he
suffers her to have a hand in sending of her own servants; For so are Ministers
the Churches servants (though in some respects the Rulers, in other some the
servants also) the servants of the Wife, and not the servants of the Husband
only, as the Apostle insinuates, 2 Cor. 4.5. We preach not our selves, but the
Lord Jesus Christ, and our selves your servants for Jesus's sake: This shall
suffice for clearing of the Observation by way of Application; here are some
things that concern the Ministers, and some things that concern the people; I
shall proceed with them in order.

Israel, Jer. 23.21. I did not send them, yet they ran faster then a good pace:
They were forward of themselves, but they were never sent by me. Brethren, men
may not call themselves, or send themselves, because they think themselves
sufficient; No, Jesus Christ will call and send whom he pleases: For though he
call not men immediately from heaven now, as in the times of the Apostles, he
calls and sends them mediately still, by the Churches suffrages, as you may see
Act. 6.3. and by the laying on of the hands of the Presbyters, as the Apostles
phrase is, 1 Timothy 4.14. And as it was a rule to the Levitical Priesthood under
the Law, Heb. 5.4. No man takes this honor on him, no man does de jure take
it, but he that is called of God as was Aaron: So to the Ministry under the
Gospel, no man takes this honor on him, but he that is sent of Christ. There
may be many private Soldiers in an Army, that may be fit to be Commanders,
every way it may be fitter then some of them that do command, and yet they may
not take upon them to be so, without a regular and due admission. There may be
many in the Commonwealth that may be fitter to be Justices of Peace then some
of them that bear that Office, and yet they may not take upon them to be so,
until they have received a Commission: Or if they should, it were impossible
that their sufficiency should advantage the Army or the Commonwealth so much,
as the ill president which they would give, and the disorder and confusion they
would make, would do it hurt; and so there may be many private Christians, that
may be fitter to be Rulers and Pastors of a Congregation, then many that do
rule and teach, and yet they may not take upon them to be either, until they be
sent by Christ: For if one may call himself, and send himself, a second may,
and so a third, and then they may be all Teachers, which is the thing that the
Apostle implicitly at least forbids, 1 Cor. 12.19. And if all were one
member, where were the body? as the same Apostle speaks. And indeed, if any man
put himself into an office merely upon this account, because he thinks himself
sufficient, the weakest will be most forward and most conceited of their own
sufficience: and on the other side the ablest men most modest, because they
best know their own weakness. And if you look on those who call themselves to
be the Teachers of public Congregations, and who impose themselves upon them
by force, and by a strong hand, as some have done in these times, you shall not
find them of the ablest and the most judicious sort of men; No, not of those
who are it may of their own opinion.

But you will interpose, and ask me then; What are not private Christians to
employ their gifts for the common benefit? Yes, to the very utmost, my Beloved;
As every man has received the gift, so let him minister the same one to the
other, as good stewards of the manifold graces of God, 1 Pet. 4.16. Their gift
they have received to profit withal, and that not themselves alone, but others
also; But still within their own sphere, within compass of their own calling:
They may and ought as they are able, to teach, etc. as the Apostle speaks, Col.
2.12. in a way of conference; and this lies as a duty on them all, in some
degree: For this is no Evangelical counsel, but an Evangelical precept; it is
not permitted only, but required: But none of them may take upon him to be the
public Teacher of the whole, without a due Vocation and Ordination thereunto.
How shall they preach except they be sent? says the Apostle, Romans 11.15. How
shall they do it lawfully? He does not say except they be gifted, but except
they be sent. Qualification is not enough, without mission: he must not go
forth of himself, but must be sent forth by Christ.

Is it so, That the Apostles and Ministers of Christ are sent by him? Christ,
it comes from them, by reason of his Ordinance, with more assurance to the
Conscience, then from any private person.

etc. This then may serve to mind them what their duty is, and I shall give it
you in two words.

1. They must do his work, and deliver his message, the errand which he sends
them in. They must not bring their own devices to the people, their own fancies
and conceits, the issue of their own brains, the froth of their own spirits, as
many do in these times. No, they must speak the words of Christ, and speak them
fully and completely. They must fulfill the word of God, as the Apostle speaks,
Col. 1.25. They must without respect or fear, deliver all their Masters
message, to any man to whom he sends them, how great soever he may be. They
must not out of base and servile dread of any, suppress or mince their errand
in the least degree, or deal so mannerly with men, that they become unfaithful
to the Lord Christ. No, they must seriously consider that though themselves be
mean and despicable persons, yet they are Ministers and Messengers of Christ
himself, who is higher then the highest among men. And therefore as the Noble
Roman said, non ita memor sum dignitatis vestrae ut obliviscar me esse
consulem; So they must say when they are dealing with the great ones of the
world; I am not mindful of dignity so far, as to forget that I am the
Ambassador and Messenger of Jesus Christ. They must be bold and resolute, with
this assurance, that he that sends them, will bear them out, according to his
many precious promises which he has made for their encouragement to
faithfulness in his service.

2. And as they must deliver Christ's errand, and not their own, so for Christ's
ends, and not their own; they must not seek their own profit, or their own
honor, but the honor of their Master. As Christ who was the Fathers
messenger, glorified not himself, as the Apostle speaks, but him that sent him,
Heb. 5.5. so they that are the messengers of Christ must not glorify
themselves, but Christ that sent them. They must act for him, and woo for him,
and win the souls of men to him. Their work must be to set him up, and to
advance him that he may appear: They must with John the Baptist be contented to
decrease, to wither in their reputation and esteem, so Christ may be in the
increasing hand. They must not endeavor to take such a course in the work of
the Ministry, that they may seem witty, and learned and eloquent, that men may
admire them, and applaud their abilities, but that they may admire Christ, that
the thoughts and affections of men may be carried to him; They must not preach
themselves, but the Lord Jesus Christ as the Apostle did, 2 Cor. 4, 5.

etc. Then let the Church be here directed, and advised to prove those that
pretend they are the Ministers of Jesus Christ, whether they be sent by Christ
or no. The Church of Ephesus is much commended for her care and diligence in
this regard, Apoc. 2.2. I know thy works, (says Christ there) and thy labor,
and thy patience, and how thou can not bear them which are evil, etc. And
thou have tried them who say they are Apostles, and are not, and have found
them liars. They said they were the Messengers of Christ; and that they were
sent by Christ (for that's the meaning of the word Apostle) but indeed they were
not. The Church did not give them credit till she tried them, and so discovered
them to be impostors and deceivers.

And truly there are many such in these times, who say they come from Jesus
Christ, when indeed he never sent them. They are Messengers of Satan, and not
of Christ: and therefore it concerns the Church to prove them well who come
with these pretenses, and to sift them to the bottom, that they may know not
the speech of these men only, but the power, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. 4 19.

And here you are not only to consider, whether they have obtained the election
and ordination of the Church or no; for many reach to this who are never sent
by Christ. But there are other things to be observed. I shall lay them down in
order.

They that are sent by Jesus Christ, are furnished with competent ability He is
ascended up on high, on purpose to give gifts unto men, for the work of the
Ministry, Ephesians. 4.12. He makes able Ministers of the New Testament, 2 Cor.
3.6. If he make them, they are able; and if they be not able, they are none of
his making. Now this ability consists especially in two things.

1. Ability of knowledge. The Messenger of Christ is to deliver to the people
the mind of Christ, the mysteries, the depth, the secrets of the Gospel; Such
depths as the Angels desired to pry into, but could not find the bottom of
them. And therefore Jesus Christ endueth them with more then ordinary
understanding in these things. They may not upon pain of being guilty of the
blood, conceal the very Counsel of God; they must be able to evince the truth,
and to convince the gainsayers, Tit. 1.9. To clear the doubts of the erroneous,
and satisfy the scruples of the tender conscience. They must be filled with
knowledge, their lips must be a storehouse of it, and at their mouths it must
be sought for by the people, Mal. 2.7. They must be ready upon all occasion, to
drop down the balm of Gilead, the sweet and precious comforts of the Gospel
into the sores of those whom God has wounded: To speak even to the hearts of
Gods people, to utter a word in due season, to which alone is required the
tongue of the Learned, Isa 50.4. To preach Christ, and to deliver his errand
with all wisdom, Col. 1.28. And therefore whomsoever Christ sends, he fitteth
them accordingly in some measure. He gives them that which the Apostles calls
understanding in the mystery of Christ, Ephesians. 3.4. and makes them Scribes
taught to the Kingdom of Heaven.

2. Ability of utterance. Behold I give you wisdom, and a mouth, said Christ to
his Apostles, Luke 21.15. So when he sends forth his Messengers, he does not
only give them wisdom and understanding in the message that he sends them in,
but he gives them a mouth too, to utter and communicate that wisdom to the
people. Or else what does their wisdom and their knowledge serve for, as
Messengers or Ministers, unless they have a mouth to bring it forth and to
declare it to the people? I do not say that all the messengers of Christ must
have voluble tongues and fluent expressions. There was among the Prophets a
stammering Moses, as well as a smooth and eloquent Aaron: A pla^^ blunt Amos
for the Country, as well as a Rhetorical Isaiah for the Court: among Gospel
Ministers there was a chief speaker, Acts 14.12. But yet however all that are
sent by Jesus Christ, have in a measure that which the Apostle calls a door of
utterance, Col. 4.3. a faculty to speak to edification. The Priest of Old must
have knowledge in his lips as well as in his head, as Mal. 2.7. And the reason
is annexed, because he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts. And you know a
Messenger or an Ambassador must not be dumb, but able in some handsome terms to
utter and express the errant of his Master. And this is intended, when the
Apostle speaking of a Minister, says, he must be apt to teach, 1 Timothy 3.2.

a ready mind to feed the flock, 1 Pet. 5.2. and a good will to deal to the
people the Gospel of Christ, 1 These. 2.8. Suppose he have ablility, yet if he
have no mind to use it for the benefit and profit of the Church of Christ, no
zeal to stir up the gift that is in him, but is remiss and idle, and prefers
his ease and pleasure before the bringing in of souls to Christ, it is a shrewd
presumption that Jesus Christ did never send him.

But if he can be well content to spend himself and to be spent for the
salvation of the peoples souls; if as John Baptist, he be a burning and a
shining light, wasting himself and burning out, that he may give the people
light: If he account it (as his Master did) his meat and drink to do the will
of him that sent him, John 8.34. so that he is not in his Element unless he be
about his Ministerial work; If he resolve with the Apostle, this will I do if
God permit, and think no peril nor no pains too great that he may finish his
course with joy, and the Ministry which he has received, it is very probable
that such a one is of Christ's own sending.

In doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that
cannot be condemned, Tit. 2.7. And this is that which Paul himself professes he
had done, 2 Cor. 2.17. We, says he, are not as many that corrupt the word of
God; but as of sincerity, and in the sight of God, speak we in Christ. The
Steward and the Messenger of Christ, as he is wise, so he is faithful; a
faithful and a wise steward. He does not for his own ends adulterate the
Message of his Master, or coin a Message from him, which he never sent him in.
And hereby you shall know him from another, that was never sent by Christ. As
Christ speaks of false Prophets, by their fruits you shall know them, Mat.
17.16. that is, by their fruits as Prophets, not as men; Not by the fruits of
their persons, but the fruits of their doctrine: The same may be applied to the
false Messengers of Christ, by their fruits you shall know them. If the
doctrine which they teach, and the message which they bring, be not the same
which they have received from Christ; if they speak not the words of Christ,
but fancies and devices of their own; if they deliver that which is against
Christ, against the Word and Spirit and Ordinances of the Lord Christ; which
tends to looseness and licentiousness (as many do in these times) believe it
they are none of Christ's sending.

Is it so that Apostles and Ministers, etc. then certainly they ought to be

And here to be a little more distinct, the welcome entertainment we should
give them, consists especially in two things, to name no more at this time.

1. You must give them honor, as those that come from Jesus Christ; Yea double
honor, the honor of reverence, and the honor of maintenance. The Messengers
and the Ambassadors of Jesus Christ, must be received and entertained with all
respects by you; Or if they be not, he esteems their dishonor as his own. He
that despises you, despises me, says Christ. And verily, if this be true, he
was never more despised then in these days. Oh my beloved, what floods of
ignominy and contempt and scorn are poured out upon the Messengers of Jesus
Christ, those that are most faithful to him? so that abundance of them are
hardly able to bear up against the venom that men spit upon them.

2. You must give them audience as those that come from Jesus Christ,
considering that the message they deliver is Jesus Christ's and not their own:
and therefore when at any time you are advised by them to come in and stoop to
Christ, Oh think that Christ himself does counsel you and call upon you. And
when they offer peace and mercy and atonement, and beseech you to accept it; Oh
think that Christ himself beseeches and entreats you by them, and therefore do
not baffle him and slight him, and put him off with a denial; for if you do, it
is a most unsufferable provocation. O think as often as you hear them speaking
to you, that you are hearing Christ himself from heaven, and then consider how
you dare to slight them. For you despise not men but Christ, as the Apostle
speaks in this case, 1 These. 4.8.

Is it so that the Apostles, Ministers, etc. this then should teach you in you;
Considering that they are but servants and cannot but deliver the message of
their Master; its that to which their place and calling, and the trust which
Christ has put into their hands does bind them: which trust they must
discharge and not betray, be the hazard what it will; and therefore be
prevailed withal to take all in good part, and not to think them injurious to
you, because they dare not to be unfaithful to Christ.

JOHN 17.18. Even so have I also sent them into the world.


DOCTRINE 2. Christ does not send his Ministers particularly or restrictively
to any Country, or to any Nation, but their Commission leaves them free to all
the world.
YOU see, he does not tell his Father, I have sent them into Jewry only, or
into any other Region of the earth, but I have sent them into the world; That
is the local object of their Mission, the world at large without restraint or
limitation, all the world.

Indeed our Savior once professed of himself, I am not sent but to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel, Mat. 15.24. And so accordingly when first he sent
forth his Apostles, his express injunction was, Go not into the way of the
Gentiles, but go ye rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, Mat. 10.5.
At his ascension he appointed them to be his witnesses, first in Judaa and
Jerusalem, Acts 1.8. This course and method the Apostles very carefully
observed, as you may see, Acts 13 46. It was necessary (say Paul and Barnabas
unto the Jews) that the word of God (the Gospel) should first of all be
preached unto you. But if you mark it well, my brethren, the final and the last
Commission of our Savior was, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel
to every creature, Mark 16.15. Go ye and teach all Nations, Mat. 28.19.

But you will say that this was a Commission proper to Apostles, and does not
any whit concern succeeding ordinary Ministers, and Pastors in the Church, who
are restrained to special places, and fixed in special Congregations.

I grant indeed that many ordinary Ministers are restrained and fixed so; but
all are not so restrained, neither are any so restrained, but that they may in
case remove to other places and to other Countries. And in that any are
restrained and fixed, it is not merely as they are Ministers of Christ, but as
they are the chosen Officers and Pastors of such a Congregation or of such a
people. Their Commission as from Christ, does not fix them anywhere, but leaves
them free as I have said, to exercise their Ministry wheresoever they are
called in all the world. Indeed the Apostle tells us that God has set some in
the Church, some Ministers of all sorts, as you may see, 1 Cor. 12.28. He has
placed and fixed them there. But that is out of all dispute the universal
Church which is not limited to any Country, but is to be extended over all the
world. For if you mark it, the Apostle says not, God has set some in the
Churches, in the plural number, but (...) in the Church, and that in such a
latitude as that it comprehends in it all gifts, all members, all officers of
all sorts, which cannot be intended of the Church of Corinth, or any single
Congregation, but only of the universal Church of Christ on earth. There Christ
has set his Ministers, not his Apostles only, but his ordinary teachers; and
if they be confined to narrower limits, it is not properly by his Commission,
but by a call from men, or by some other secundary means. And as for that
Commission mentioned even now, Go ye and teach all Nations, though it were
given immediately to the Apostles, it cannot be restrained to the Apostles,
being evidently meant, in and with them, of all the Ministers and Preaches of
the Gospel that should succeed them in the Church to the end of the world. And
therefore it is added presently in the next verse. Lo, I am with you always to
the end of the world. They were not to continue for their own parts, by many
hundred years so long, and therefore it must also stretch to those who were to
follow them in the office and work of Gospel-preaching, till it be published
universally to all Nations: which was not done you know by the Apostles; it was
but begun by them, and must be carried on till it be finished by other
Ministers of Christ in ever age successively to the end of the world; So that
the point is clear you see; Christ does not send his Ministers particularly or
restrictively to any Country or to any Nation, but their Commission leaves
them free to all the world.

And there are two great reasons of the Point, viz. because his Kingdom

1. His Kingdom is to be erected over all the world. It is not bounded or
confined to any Country, or to any Nation, but it is to stretch and to extend
it self to all places, and to all people. And hence the Kingdom of the Lord
Christ is likened to a stone that swells into a Mountain, and in the end
replenishes the world, as Dan. 2.35. The stone that smote the Image, became a
great Mountain, and filled the whole earth. A very fit resemblance of our
Saviors Kingdom. First it is a little stone, it lies within a little compass,
it is confined within very narrow limits; but yet at length it grows into a
Mountain, yea a great Mountain, it stretches and extends out it self
exceedingly, and in the end replenishes the whole earth. The beginnings are but
small, a little stone, a man may put it in his pocket, but the stone becomes a
Mountain, and the Mountain fills the world. And this is that which the same
Daniel in his vision did foresee, as if it had been done already, Dan. 7.14.
And there was given him, says he, dominion, and glory and a Kingdom, (speaking
of the Lord Christ) And what Kingdom shall he have? See in the following words;
he shall have such a Kingdom, that all the people, Languages, and Nations in
the world shall serve him. There is a Prophecy to this purpose, Psalm. 22.27,
28. All the ends of the world shall turn to the Lord, and all the kinreds of
the Nations shall worship before him; For the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is
the Governor among all Nations, with which accords that, Psalm. 72.8. He
shall have Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the
Earth: and yet again, Psalm. 86.9. All Nations whom thou have made (and you know
there is no Nation which he has not made) shall come and worship before thee,
O Lord, and shall glorify thy Name: This is the meaning of that famous
Proclamation of our King himself, Mal. 1.11. From the rising of the Sun unto
the going down of the same, my Name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in
every place incense shall be offered to me, and a pure offering; for my Name
shall be great among the Heathen, says the Lord of Hosts: And when all these
predictions shall be brought to execution, then shall that which was
represented in a Vision unto John be really accomplished, Apoc. 7.9. I beheld,
says he, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations
and kinreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the
Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands: and then shall that
triumphant voice take place, Apoc. 11.15. The Kingdoms of the world are become
the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and
ever.

Now how shall this be brought to pass, my Brethren, but by the preaching of
the Gospel over all the world, which by our Savior Christ himself is called
the Gospel of the Kingdom? Mat. 24.14. because his Kingdom is erected by it;
and that is the first reason, why Christ sends forth his Ministers to preach
the Gospel over all the world, that so his Kingdom may be erected by it over
all the world. This Gospel of the Kingdom (says our Savior in the
fore-alledged place) that is, this Gospel by which my Kingdom is set up, and
propagated and enlarged, shall be preached in all the world, to all Nations,
and then shall the end come: When this is done, this Gospel preached, and this
Kingdom thereby propagated unto all the world, then (says our Savior) and not
till then shall the end come.

2. And as the Kingdom of our Savior is to be erected, so Churches (in the
second place) are to be planted over all the world: And that is another reason
why Christ sends forth his Ministers to preach the Gospel over all the world;
for Gospel preaching serves as to erect the one, so to collect and plant the
other.

The Church indeed was anciently shut up among the Jews, but now it is let out
to all Nations, so that neither Jew nor Grecian, neither Scythian nor
Barbarian, is excluded from the Church. Thou have redeemed us by thy blood, say
the Elders to our Savior, Apoc. 5.9. not out of one, but out of every Kindred,
Nation, Tongue and People.

This enlargement of the Church is clearly taught us in the Prophecy of Hosea
2.23. which may serve instead of all; And I will sow her to me in the earth,
says God there, which is a Metaphorical or borrowed speech, by which the Lord
fore-shews the great extension of the Church in these latter Gospel days; For
as the Husbandman that means to have his Corn increased and multiplied, first
sows it in the ground, that so it may take root and spring and bear him many
grains for one; so God affirming he will sow his Church, insinuates he will
make it do as corn when it is sown, to grow and multiply exceedingly. So that
from a very small, it shall increase to a great number. And hence he says not
I will sow her in the land of Canaan only, but in the earth at large without
restraint or limitation. In former times, he made his breach in Iewry only; his
field the Church was but a little corner of the world; but here the Lord
fore-shews, that he will multiply her so, that she shall be dispersed over all
the earth; And I will sow her to me in the earth: And for this reason, Jesus
Christ sends forth his Seedesmen into all the Earth, that they may sow the
Church in all Countries. This shall suffice for clearing of the point.

And is it so that Jesus Christ does not send his Ministers particularly, etc.
This then may serve my Brethren, in the first place at least to justify the
practice of those Ministers of Christ, who for the propagating of the Church of
Christ and elarging of his Kingdom, have done as the Apostle Paul professed he
had strived to do, Romans 15.20. says he, I have strived to preach the Gospel
not where Christ was named, least I should build upon another man's foundation;
but as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of they shall see, and they
that have not heard shall understand. Preached when a Collection was made for
propagation of the Gospel in New England.
You heard even now of many zealous Instruments of Christ, who have had the
same design, viz, to preach the Gospel in America, where Christ was never named
till within these few years. To lay the first stone of the Foundation of
Religion there, to gather Churches, and to erect the Kingdom of the Lord Christ
among the poor blind Indians, in the remotest quarter of the world, That so the
Fathers promise may at length be made good to Jesus Christ, Psalm. 2.8. Ask of
me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost
parts of the earth for thy possession. And verily in this my Brethren, they
have not gone beyond their line, they have not strayed beyond the bounds of
their Commission. Christ does not send his Ministers, as you have heard,
particularly or restrictively to any Country, or to any Nation, but their
Commission leaves them free to all the world: Even the Commission, not of
Apostles only, but of the ordinary Ministers of Christ, as I have showed before
in Explication of the point: so that they are within their compass still,
though they be among the Indians, even at the other end of all the Earth.

And it is to be very much observed, that Christ has given abundant testimony
to this glorious work of theirs, in the incredible success of their endeavors
there, so that poor naked souls come continually to Jesus Christ, stoop to the
Government and Scepter of his Kingdom, desire to be acquainted with his will,
to be instructed in the way of his worship, to have their children brought up
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; And in a word, they shame us who
have so long enjoyed the Gospel, that we are even weary of it, and begin to put
it from us, and so to judge our selves unworthy of eternal life. The Lord in
mercy grant it go not from us to the Indians, who prize it more, are more eager
after it, and more fruitful under it, according to their light, then multitudes
of us professed Christians are.

Now I beseech you my Beloved, cast an eye upon them, travail thither in your
thoughts and meditations; there you shall see some Ministers of Jesus Christ,
once our Fellow Laborers, spending themselves, undergoing difficulties without
number or measure, to convert souls, and gather Churches among blind Heathens.
There you shall see the Gospel blossoming, the Church enlarging her Tent, and
stretching forth the Curtains of her habitation, the Doves flocking to the
windows of the Ark, the Church of Christ, the fullness of the Gentiles now
beginning to come in; and in a word, that great work going on, which is
incomparably the most remarkable that Christ has yet to do in this world.

What shall we do now, my Beloved, and how shall we behave our selves under
such a dispensation? shall we (as many have done heretofore, and it may be yet
do) condemn the Instruments, as if they went beyond themselves in this
business? Shall we mock at these beginnings of the building of the Temple?
shall we despise the day of small things? shall we as Gallio care for none of
these matters?

Truly the least that we can do, is to comply with Jesus Christ in this design
of his, for which he sends his Ministers into the world, and to promote this
glorious work to the utmost of our power. It is in the hands of those for whom
(as you have heard) it is too heavy, so that they cannot manage it, they are
not able to go through with it. They seem to call over to us, as the man of
Macedonia, Come to America and help us. Oh let not such a work miscarry, and
fail of being driven on, for want of any help that we can yield to it, a work
that is so purely Christian as this is.

But which way can we help it on? it may be you will say to me. Truly my
Brethren, if no other way, we may promote and help it on at least without
purses and our prayers. This we may do at this distance. I shall speak a word
to either.

1. We may promote it with our prayers. This was the course the Prophet took as
you may see, Isa. 62.1. In the precedent chapter he is very large, and eloquent
on this business; showing the future glory of the Church, by the addition of
the fullness of the Gentiles in all Countries and in all Nations. And having
done with the description of it in two whole Chapters, me thinks he is an end
to hasten the fruition of it: For Zions sake I will not hold my peace, says
he, and for Jerusalems I will not rest. So we, my Brethren, having heard of the
beginning of this great work in America, let us do as Isaiah did, let us be
always crying to the Lord, let him be hard beset on all hands, let him not have
a quiet hour. The Lord has set his Watchmen on the walls of his Jerusalem, to
this purpose, Isa. 62.6. that they may watch such opportunities as these are.
And least he should forget this great work, when it is upon the wheel, he has
appointed some remembrancers to mind him of it, and therefore let us be
continually minding God of this business, beseeching him to go on with this
work, till he has brought it to perfection, till the whole fullness of the
Gentiles be come in, till Christ inherit all Nations. Let us remember that we
have a little sister in America, and that now is the day of speaking for her,
for now her case and business is in agitation; and therefore now let us be
earnest with the Lord, let us pray and pray hard, let us not be cold or dead in
such a suit as this is.

We may promote it with our purses and estates: And this is that especially we
have in hand at this time. There are very many things in that great business
now on foot, that need pecuniary helps, as has been said. The charge that lies
on these that are the agents in it, is exceeding great, and indeed too heavy
for them; and therefore we (me thinks) that share not in the difficulties and
the labors that other of our Brethren undergo among the Indians, should be
content to share a little in the costs; for who would willingly sit wholly out
in such a blessed work as this is?

Alas, my Brethren, how much idle money do we spend a hundred ways, that might
be saved for such a purpose! And truly I believe, we never had occasion to lay
money out to a better end then this. Now we may help, in a qualified sense, to
purchase souls with money, to further the accomplishment of the Gospel promises
with money; we may make temporal and earthly things serve spiritual and
heavenly ends.

And therefore I beseech you, my Beloved, enlarge your bounty more then
ordinary, in such a choice and extraordinary work as this is. Let love to
Christ and to his Church, compassion to those blind Americans, draw out your
very hearts to them, that those poor Indian souls, whose Conversion and
Salvation you may further by this means, may bless you. Thus make you friends
of the unrighteous Mammon, that you may render up a good account when the day
of reckoning comes.

Is it so, That Jesus Christ sends forth his Ministers into the world, and

Let our hearts be lifted up in faith, with reference to this work;

If you had seen him here upon the Earth, and his fishermen about him, you
would not have imagined that so many Nations would ever have been brought in to
him, as there are at this day. When he sent out a company of poor despised men
to preach the Gospel, and to draw men in to him, by telling them they must deny
themselves, and they must take up their Cross and suffer persecution for his
sake; they must forsake all, leave all and follow him; you would have thought
this had been an unlikely way to do very great matters. And yet by such
improbable, unlikely means as these, has Christ been entertained in many
Nations, and many Countries, and multitudes of people have been brought to
stoop to him. And therefore seeing he has done so much already, and that in
such a strange way, as you would never have believed, if you had not seen it
done, you may the better cast your selves upon him, with this assurance that he
will overcome the difficulties that are yet behind, that he that has begun the
work, and prospered it so far as he has done, will finish it until he has
brought in the fullness of the Gentiles to his Church and Kingdom, from one end
of the earth unto the other.

What, would you have us to believe that all the people of the world shall
accept of Jesus Christ, and receive him for their King, and be the Subjects of
his Kingdom? Why then it seems there should be no tares, no Goats, no wicked
when that time comes.

Sol.
No, my beloved, this is not the thing at which I aim: And therefore you may not
be mistaken, you must remember that distinction of the Kingdom of Christ Jesus,
into the Kingdom of power, and the Kingdom of grace.

The first of these indeed is universal, and does already reach to all places
and to all persons. Though all be not the subjects of the grace of Christ, yet
all are subject to the power of Christ. And hence the Psalmist tells us, that
his Kingdom rules over all, Psalm. 103.19. And that he is the King of all the
earth, Psalm. 47.7. he is King of all the places in the earth, yea and of all
the persons in the earth either one way or the other. Either he is a gracious
King to rule them, or a powerful King to break them. And thus his Kingdom does
already reach to all Countries, and to all people.

But now my brethren, for the second Kingdom which we have called the Kingdom
of grace, that is also in a sense, to stretch and to extend it self to all
places, and to all people. I shall clear it very briefly.

1. It is to stretch and to extend it self to all places and to all Countries.
The Church of Jesus Christ is to be Catholic in this respect, and so by
consequence his Kingdom too, it is to be erected and set up in all Nations. And
hence the Holy Ghost affirms, that all the people, Languages, and Nations in
the world shall serve him. And the Apostle tells us that in the business of
sanctification, or setting up the Kingdom of Christ Jesus in the hearts of men,
there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither Scythian nor Barbarian, but Christ is
all in all. That is, the Jew is not preferred before the Greek, and neither of
them is preferred before the Scythian and Barbarian, but all of them are one to
Christ, and Christ is one to all of them: and he will have a Church and Kingdom
as well among the Scythians and Barbarians, as among the Jews themselves.

2. And as this Kingdom is to stretch and extend it self to all places, and to
all Countries, so it is also to extend it self to all people; That is, to all
degrees and sorts of people, though not to all of those sorts. And as there is
no Nation, so there is no condition or estate or rank of men excluded from the
grace of Jesus Christ, nor barred from being subjects of his gracious Kingdom
here, and of his glorious Kingdom hereafter.

Let our hearts be lifted up in expectation of this glorious work. Isa. 62.1.
And so let us, especially now we behold it in the execution, let us lift up our
heads and look, let us get up on our watch-towers where we may have more
advantage to see, if by any means we can discover more of it: and let our
spirits be continually reaching after the fufilling of it, as being full of
hope about it.

Let our hearts be lifted up in supplication for the accomplishment I will
build the ruined, and I will plant the desolate and desert places, says the
Lord, Ezekiel. 36.37. I will build the ruined Nation of the Jews, which was a
Church in former times, and I will plant the desolate and desert places of the
Gentiles; I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it; But yet on this
condition, that I will be enquired of by my people. The Lord will surely come
(my brethren,) in his own appointed season, and gather Churches, and erect his
Kingdom over all the world. But in the mean time he will have his people pray,
Thy Kingdom come; he will have them hasten him and fetch him by their prayers,
that he may say unto them, as the Angel did to Daniel, Dan. 10.12. From the
first day that thou did set thy self to understand, thy words were heard, and
I am come for thy words, And here to quicken you a little, I shall present you
with a few Considerations.

1. The Lord expects you should be very earnest and importunate with him this
business. He hearkens after supplications; and looks that men should ply him
hard. Thus says the Lord, the holy one of Israel and his maker, Isa. 45.11.
Ask of me things to come concerning my Sons, command you me. q. d. There are
great things to come that I am doing for my Church; what is the reason that ye
are so still, and that I hear of no Petitions from you touching these things?
You are always plying me for present things, but I delight to hear you
pleading with me for those glorious things to come, which I will surely do for
my people. Come put in your Petitions and requests concerning them, and I will
stoop so low to be commanded by your prayers. Ask of me things to come,
concerning my Sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.

2. Consider in the second place, to quicken you in prayer, that this is such a
business as is worth your earnestness; assure your selves you cannot lay out
too much heat and zeal upon it. When once the Lord has gathered in a people to
him over all the world, the Church shall have perfection of beauty. It is a
very high expression, but you shall see it is applied to Sion, Psalm. 50.2. And
it is meant apparently (my bretren,) of the Gospel Sion, of the Gospel Church;
for in the following parcel of the Psalm, the Lord rejects Jewish worship.
Indeed the Churches happiness shall be so great in those days, that it is
called heaven very often in the Scripture. And so the Saints who are to be the
Members of that Church, are said to dwell in heaven, Apoc. 13.6. Indeed my
brethren, it shall be heaven upon earth.

3. Consider that the bringing in of people over all the world to Christ, will
be an extraordinary honor to him: the enlargement of his Kingdom is the
enlargement of his glory. It adds exceedingly you know, my brethren, to the
Luster of a Kingdom, when it has many people under it, and when the
territories of it are amplified and enlarged. Its no such glory my beloved, to
be the King but of a little City or a little Island or of a small and
inconsiderable company of men. But to be the King of many Nations, and of many
Kingdoms, to have a multitude of people in subjection, this is a glorious thing
indeed. In this respect the Empire of Christ Jesus in the latter times shall be
unparalleld, when once the Jews come in and bring the fullness of the Gentiles
with them. And therefore out of love to Jesus Christ, and regard to his glory,
we should be intent upon it.

4. Consider that the bringing in of people over all the world to Jesus Christ,
will be very beneficial and advantageous to our selves. Perhaps we do not
apprehend it to be so: this Country is come in already to the profession of
the Gospel, we are come in already, and what need we care so much for other
Nations, and for other people? We are well enough our selves, and why should we
look after others? Yes, my beloved, we have reason to look after others: for
till all others that belong to Christ of all the Nations of the world be
gathered in, we are not in so good a case as we shall be afterward; We are in
Christ perhaps, and that is well for us indeed; but others of his people by
election, of many other Countries, are as yet without: and we without them
cannot be made perfect, as the Apostle shows, Heb. 11. ult. We without them are
members in a sense of an imperfect body. We without them have but imperfect
grace, nay though we were in heaven already, we could have but imperfect glory.
Till all that appertain to Christ be gathered in of all Nations, so long as
there is but a man without, there can be no day of judgment, and so no full
reward, no complement of our beatitude. And therefore we have reason to help on
this glorious work to the utmost of our power, because till it be accomplished,
it cannot be so well with us as it will be afterward; we without them cannot
be made perfect.

Is it so that Jesus Christ sends forth his Ministers to gather Churches, and
to erect his Kingdom over all the world? Here then is matter of rejoicing and
thanksgiving for us, the once rejected and neglected people of the Gentiles.
There was a time my brethren, when we were set without the verge, the reach of
mercy; When the poor Gentiles lived, and we too lived without God, without
Christ, without a promise, without Gospel; when Christ did never send to them,
to invite them to come in, and when he had no Scepter but in Jewry, no subjects
(in a manner) but among that people. Alas my brethren, Christ was a King in
those days, to break the Gentiles by his power, but he was not a King to rule
them by his grace. But now, my brethren, in these Gospel days, there is no
such respect of persons with him, as the Apostle shows, Acts 10.34. In every
Nation, and in every people he has or shall have some to serve him, and to be
accepted with him.

And therefore whereas formerly, he sent his messengers to none but to Go not
into the way of the Gentiles: In which respect it was that Peter was scrupulous
to preach the Gospel to Cornelius: Now he sends forth his Ministers to all the
world to all Nations: now he enlarges their Commission, Go preach the Gospel
to every Creature; So that we Gentiles are included in it. All Countries,
People, Callings, Nations, are alike to Christ in this respect; the publication
of the Gospel and the tender of Salvation, belongs to them all alike, and if
they entertain it and embrace it, whether they be Jews or Gentiles: whether
they be Males or Females, whether they be bond or free, they shall have
salvation by him.

How great a cause have we my brethren, that are Gentiles, of rejoicing and
thanksgiving, that Jesus Christ should send to us, that the word is come to us
as it is to all the world, that we should have the Gospel published and
revealed to us! That we, who formerly were utterly shut out from the enjoyment
of the means of our salvation, should have as full and free a title to them
now, as the very Jews themselves. Nay that we should have the preferment of the
Jew, in that by the abundant blessing of the Lord upon the means, the Churches
of the Gentiles (which were wholly desolate and barren heretofore) should be
more fruitful, and have more increase of children then she that sometimes had
an husband. Oh let us magnify the grace of Jesus Christ, let us adore the
infiniteness of his mercy that he has cast us on these happy times, wherein he
takes such care of poor Gentiles, wherein he sends to them, and wherein he
looks after them as if they were some rich purchase. Ah, my beloved, did we
follow this mercy as far as we could reach it in our thoughts, we should at
length (finding no end or bottom in it) cry out with the Apostle, Oh the depth
of the riches, both of the wisdom and goodness of Christ, etc.

JOHN. 17.18. Even so have I also sent them into the world.


DOCTRINE 3. There is a great similitude between the Fathers sending Christ
into the world, and Christ's sending his Apostles and Ministers into the world.
THis is apparently suggested here in the particle as, and the particle also.
As thou have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the
world. My sending them is much like thy sending me. So he compares them each
with other in another place, almost in the same words, John 20.21. As my Father
has sent me, so send I you. The thing is plain enough, that so it was in some
respects.

But wherein, and in what respects this likeness stood, will need to be
explained with much Caution. Because as there was great likeness between the
Fathers sending Christ, and Christ's sending his Apostles and Ministers into the
world, so there was a great unlikeness too. As the similitude was great, so
certainly the dissimilitude was great too. And therefore while I show the
likness, I will show you the unlikeness, both of them at one veiw, That you may
see the one the better for the other.

All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth, Mat. 28.18. he adds
immediately in the very next words, Go ye therefore and teach all Nations and
baptize them. q. d. because I have received such ample power my self, therefore
I give you this Commission, by which I put a part of this authority and power
on you; Go forth and exercise it over all the world. And this is that which the
Apostle calls the power which Christ has given him, 2 Cor. 13.10. To intimate
that he received his power and his authority by way of delegation from the Lord
Christ, as Christ received his power and his authority (as he is man and
Mediator) by way of delegation from the Father; and as the Father gives the Son
a Key of power, as you may see in that remarkable place, Isa. 22.22. The Key of
the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder, (that is, upon the shoulder of
Eliakim who was in that respect a figure and a Type of Christ,) and he shall
open and none shall shut, and he shall shut and none shall open: so Christ
gives Keys of power to his Apostles and his Ministers, as you may see
exemplified in Peter, Mat. 16.19. I will give thee (says Christ) the Keys of
the Kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shall bind on earth, shall be bound
in heaven, and whatsoever thou shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,
viz. either in the preaching of the word, or in the regular administration of
the censures of the Church.

Here is a great Similitude you see between the power with which the Father
sends Christ, and the power with which Christ sends his Apostles and his
Ministers into the world. As Christ has power to shut and open from the
Father, so have they from Jesus Christ; as Christ has power to bind and loose
from God the Father, so have they from Jesus Christ. As Christ has power to
remit sins, and to retain them from the Father, so have they from Christ; and
therefore having said to his Apostles, As my Father has sent me, so send I
you, he adds immediately in the next verse save one, Whosesoever sins ye remit,
they are remitted, and whosesoever sins ye retain they are retained.

But yet as the similitude is great in this respect, so is the dissimilitude:
The power which Jesus Christ received from God the Father, is an universal
power. All power is given to me, says our Savior, both in heaven and in
earth, Mat. 28.19. And in another place, he minds his Father, That he had given
him power over all flesh, Joh. 17.2. But now that power which the Apostles and
the Ministers of Christ received from him, is more particular and more
confined. Jesus Christ has all power, all sorts and all degrees of power; they
have but some power, some sorts, and some measures. The power which Jesus
Christ receives from God the Father, is a Kingly power; he sets him up as King
upon his holy hill of Sion; and so accordingly he crowns him: The power which
they receive from Christ, is but a Ministerial power. Christ has a Legislative
power to make laws, while they have but a Legis-narrative or Declaratory power
to publish laws: Christ does jus dare, and they do but jus dicere: Christ binds
and looses, shuts and opens, remitteth and retains sins, authoritatively as a
Sovereign Lord; they do it but declaratively as his Ministers and servants.

There is a great similitude between the Fathers sending Christ, etc. in The
Spirit of the Lord is upon me, he has anointed me to preach, Isa. 61.1. And so
accordingly when he first began to preach, he took this very Text to preach
upon, as you may see, Luke 4.18. Behold my servant (says the Lord) whom I
uphold, Isa. 42.1. and mine Elect in whom my soul delights; I have put my
Spirit upon him, and that to qualify him for his Office, as is apparent in the
following words; for it is added presently, That he shall bring forth judgment
to the Gentiles. A bruised reed shall he not break, etc. And this is that which
is suggested in the Prophecy, Isa. 11.2. The Spirit of the Lord shall rest
upon him, and it shall rest upon him in those graces and endowments that fit
him for the places to which he is designed. And hence it is immediately
annexed, The Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and
of might, the spirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. So then you see
the Father as he sends Christ, so he endues him with the Spirit, to fit him for
the business that he sends him in.

But does our Savior so with his Apostles and his Ministers? yes, my Beloved,
just so: he qualifies them with the Spirit too: and therefore having said to
his Apostles and his Messengers, Joh. 20.22. As my Father has sent me, so send
I you. The very next words are, And when he had said thus, he breathed on them,
and said unto them, receive the Holy Ghost. And so accordingly the Holy Ghost
fell upon them abundantly to fill them and enable them for their Ministerial
Office, even as they were about to go abroad and preach. Act. 2. Here is a
greater similitude you see, between the Fathers sending Christ into the world,
and Christ's sending his Apostles and Ministers into the world, in regard of
qualification.

But yet as the similitude is great, so is the dissimilitude in this too. The
unction which the Ministers of Christ received from him, though it be like the
unction which Christ himself receives from the Father in the thing, yet it is
nothing like it in the measure and degree. Though they be both the unction of
the Spirit, Christ's is surpassingly, transcendently beyond theirs; He is
endowed with all the graces of the Spirit of every sort, and every kind, so
that not one of them is wanting in him: And therefore it is said in Scripture,
that in him all fullness dwells; that is, the fullness of all graces whatsoever.
But now, my Brethren, in the Ministers of Christ it is not so, in them there is
a division of graces (though not of the graces of Sanctification) yet of the
graces of Edification, and one is made partaker of a gift which another has
not. There are diversities of gifts, says the Apostle, 1 Cor. 12. to one is
given by the Spirit the word of knowledge, to another prophecy, etc. But all
these concur and ^^er in Jesus Christ, so that he is in this respect inricht
above them all.

And as our Savior is qualified by the Father, with all kinds and sorts of
graces, so with all measures and degrees; As he has all graces in him, so each
of them is raised and intended to the highest measure, so that there can be
nothing added to it, to make it more complete and perfect. Indeed, my Brethren,
he received not the Spirit by measure from the Father, as the Evangelist
observes, John 4.32. but beyond all measure. But now the Ministers of Christ
receive from him but a measure of grace, as the expression is, Romans 12.3. So
much as he sees fit to qualify them for the work that he imploys them in, as
you may see, Ephesians. 4.8. When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto men, for
the work of the Ministry, and for the edifying of the body of it.

God who in times past spoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, has in these last
days, spoken to us by his Son; To preach the Gospel to the world: He has
anointed me to preach, says Christ, Luke 4.18. To preach what? to preach the
Gospel to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the
Captives, etc. And why did Christ send his Apostles and Ministers into the
world? Why to preach the Gospel too. That is the sum of their Commission, Mar.
16.15. Go preach the Gospel to every Creature. The Ministers of Christ are
separated to the Gospel, as Romans 1.1. They must preach all Gospel, or else all
for Gospel ends. They must preach Law with Gospel purposes, and Evangelical
intentions. So that the Father sends the Son, and the Son sends his Apostles
and Ministers upon very the same errand; here the similitude is very great.

But then the dissimilitude is very great too, in that the Son whom God the
Father sends, is transcendently above the Ministers whom Christ sends, in the
very same business; both are Apostles, but Christ is the chief Apostle; both
are Preachers of the Gospel, but Christ is the chief Preacher: He preaches it
with such authority as they are not invested with, and with such efficacy too,
as they can never reach to; He preaches by the Spirit to the heart and to the
inward man; and so he does it with infallible success: They can preach only to
the ear, and to the outward man, and hence they often fail of the desired
issue: they spend their strength in vain, as the Prophet once complained.
Indeed the efficacy of their preaching depends wholly on the work and power
of Christ. So that you see he is transcendently above them in the same business.

And then besides, Jesus Christ is sent on business which they are not to touch
with. He is sent about the work of man's Redemption, of satisfaction to the
justice of his Father, by his bitter death and passion, which is too heavy and
too hard for any Man or Angel to go through with, or to have a hand in.

There is a great similitude between the Fathers sending, etc. in relation Mat.
1.21. In which respect his Father would not have him called Apollyon, a
destroyer, but Jesus a Savior. It Is true, that Christ is set and appointed by
his Father, for the fall and rising again of many: As for the rising of
believers, so for the fall of unbelievers. But this is but by accident, and
besides the main intention of God in sending, and Christ in coming. He does not
cause the fall of such as perish, so properly and so directly, as the rising of
such are saved by him. Indeed he came into world to save sinners, 1 Timothy, 1.15.
not to destroy sinners. It Is true, that sinners are destroyed by him, but this
was not the proper end of his coming. God did not send his Son to condemn the
world, but to save the world, Joh. 3.17. And so our Savior Christ himself
professes, Joh. 12.47. I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
Even so he sent his Ministers for the very same end, to work together with him
in the Conversion and the Salvation of his people, by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe, 1 Cor. 1.21. To save themselves and those
that hear them, 1 Timothy 4.16. Here the Similitude again is great, between the
Fathers sending Christ, etc. in relation to the end that both of them are sent
for.

But then the dissimilitude is great too, In that the Father sends the Son to
save his people by his merit and his Spirit. The Son sends his Ministers to
save them by the application of his merit and his Spirit to them in the
preaching of the Gospel: The Father sends the Son to save them by dying for
them; the Son sends his Ministers to save them by preaching to them, and so by
crucifying Christ again before their eyes, as Gal. 3.1. The Father sends his
Son to save his people meritoriously, and by way of effectual operation: The
Son sends his Ministers to save them Ministerially, and by way of vocal
Declaration; so that Christ only is the proper Savior, and Ministers at most
are but the Instrumental Saviors of his people.

etc. Here then, my Brethren, is a perfect pattern for all the Minsters of
Jesus Christ: they must look on him that sent them, and see what power he was
endued withal, what errand he was sent on, and for what ends, and so act
accordingly. As God invested him with power, and sent him into the world to
preach the Gospel, and to save his people: So Jesus Christ has invested them
with power to do the same thing, for the same end; So that they must not aim at
the destruction and the hardening of the people; No, they must make this their
business, how they may bring about their conversion and salvation. It Is true,
they must be sons of Thunder now and then, as well as sons of Consolation; they
must preach the Law sometimes, as well as the sweet comforts of the Gospel;
they must threaten men sometimes with wrath, and hell, and eternal
condemnation: But then they must not do it so as wishing that these things
might come upon them, but rather that they might avoid them. They must threaten
them with wrath, that they may flee from the wrath to come; and threaten with
hell, that they may escape the damnation of hell; they must preach the Law with
Gospel purposes and Evangelical intentions; they must send out the avenger of
blood to dog them at the heels, that they may fly to the City of refuge: They
must use sharpness now and then, it cannot be avoided; But it must be for the
same end that the Apostle speaks of, 2 Cor. 13.10. where having minded the
Corinthians, that in case he must use sharpness, according to the power the
Lord had given him, he had authority from Christ to do it; but mark in the
succeeding words to what end; for edification, and not for destruction;
according to the power the Lord has given me for edification, and not for
destruction: And therefore it is very notable, that when our Savior Christ had
said to his Disciples, All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth:
and having put a part of that power and authority of his on his Apostles,
having sent them as his Father sent him, he does not say to them as God does to
the Prophet, Jer. 1.10. I have set you over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms,
to root out and to destroy; but I have sent you to the Nations to teach them,
and to baptize them, that they may be saved: He does not make them rooters, but
planters; he does not bid them to go out, and preach damnation to the people in
the first place; but go and preach the Gospel to them, that they may be saved.

And the Apostle speaking of the execution of this Commission, and authority in
the Administration of the censures of the Church, says, he would give a foul
offender up to Satan, for no other end but this, even for his good, and his
salvation, 1 Cor. 5.34. I have already judged, says he, concerning him that
has so done this deed, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver him
to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, the carnal part, that the spirit
may be saved in the day of the Lord: So that when we threaten judgment, when
we retain the sins of men, when we give them up to Satan either in preaching or
in Church-censure, our aim is, that their corruption may be mortified, and that
their spirits may be saved by this means: And all the Ministers of Christ ought
to have this continually in their eye, how they may reach this great end; they
must remember that Jesus Christ has sent them, as God the Father sent him, and
that was not to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be saved.

And thus of the First Argument, with which our Savior presses and enforces
his Petition to his Father, in behalf of his Apostles for Sanctification, which
has been taken from the business and employment that he is setting them about,
viz, the very same in some respect, which he himself has hitherto sustained
and undergone by the appointment of the Father. Sanctify them with thy Truth,
thy Word is Truth. Why, might the Father answer, why so? Cause enough says
Jesus Christ; for as thou have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world; and therefore thou had need to sanctify them, that so
they may be fitted and enabled for such a service as this is.

JOHN 17.19. And for their sakes I sanctify my self, that they also might be
sanctified through the truth.


PRoceed we to the Second Argument with which he backs the same Petition, and
it is taken from the end, for which he sanctified himself; And for their sakes
I sanctify my self, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. q.
d. It was the very end at which I aimed in sanctifying of my self that they
might be sanctified; it was my scope and drift in that business; and therefore
I beseech thee Father, let me not be disappointed of my purpose, let not this
great design of mine be frustrated, but do thou sanctify them with the truth,
because I sanctified my self for their sakes, with this intent, that they might
also be sanctified through the truth.

Two things we have apparently presented to us in the words; what our Savior
did, and why he did it. First, what our Savior did, He sanctified himself:
Secondly, then why he did it; and this is in the first place generally expressed,
that it was for their sakes, for his Apostles and Disciples sakes, that he
sanctified himself: And then it is particularly and expressly specified in what
regard it was for their sakes, that they might also be sanctified through the
truth.

The difficulty of the text lies especially in this, how Christ is said to
sanctify himself, and what he means by that expression, for their sakes I
sanctify my self. To sanctify, is properly to make holy; now a person or a
thing is made holy especially two ways, viz. by qualification, when holiness
and grace is put into it, when a man is made partaker of the saving gifts and
graces of the holy spirit, then he is said in Scripture to be sanctified; By
consecration a person or a thing is made holy, when it is set apart for holy
uses. In this respect the Sabbath day is holy, in this respect the Temple, the
Utensils and Vessels of the house of God, in this respect the Priests were
holy. Thus all the first born of the Jews were holy, and set apart for God. And
therefore having charged Moses to sanctify the first born, thus he explains it
afterward; Exodus 13.2, 12. Thou shall set them apart to God: and in a word,
thus all the Sacrifices and oblations under the Ceremonial Law, were holy, they
were consecrated things; For consecrated things are sanctified things, as I
might give you instances enough in that particular. Thou shall anoint them,
says the Lord, speaking of Aaron and his Sons, Exodus 28.4. and thou shall
consecrate and sanctify them that they may Minister unto me in the Priests
office. So after speaking of the Ramm of consecration, Aaron and his Sons shall
eat it, says the Lord, to consecrate them and to sanctify them, Exodus 29.33.
Now all the question is, in which of these respects, our Savior here is said
to sanctify himself, whether by way of qualification, or of consecration.

I must acknowledge, I have heretofore conceived it in the former way, as in a
way of qualification, that he made himself holy, by the communication of the
gifts and graces of the holy spirit, to his humane nature. For though it be a
certain truth, that Christ was not, neither could be made holy of not holy
privatively, as man who by the fall had wholly lost his holiness, is sanctified
and made holy by regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost; Yet it is
very manifest, that Christ was sanctified and made holy of not holy negatively;
for there was once a time when Christ as man had not this holiness inherent in
his humane nature, because there was a time, viz. before his incarnation, when
his humane nature had not a being in the world. And thus Christ was sanctified
for his Apostles and Disciples sake, his peoples sake; That they might be
sanctified, That is, he was endued abundantly with the gifts of holiness and
the graces of sanctification to this end, that he might communicate them and
dispense them to his people, and that they might be sanctified by this means,
That of his fullness they might all receive, and grace for grace. So that this
looks extremely well you see, as the meaning of the Text. And for their sakes I
sanctify my self, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

But yet I find interpreters even universally running in another stream, and
understanding it of being sanctified in a way of consecration. The former I
suppose they leave, because indeed it is not consonant to Scripture phrase; For
Jesus Christ to say (as man) that he sanctified himself in a way of
qualification, That is to say, that he endued himself with the sanctifying
gifts and graces of the holy spirit. It is usually affirmed that God the Father
sanctified him, That it pleased the Father that in him should all the fullness
of the holy spirit dwell, Col. 1.19. That God, even his God, did anoint him
with the oil of his spirit, Psalm. 45.7. And therefore he is called him whom the
Father sanctified and sent into the world, John 10.36.

Besides it seems not to be congruous that Christ should pray his Father to
sanctify his Apostles and Disciples, because for his part he had sanctified
himself with the graces of the spirit, to this end, that they might be
sanctified by communication of those graces to them.

And therefore I shall run down with the common stream of exposition, and
understand our Savior here to tell his Father that he sanctified himself by
way of Consecration; That he set himself apart to be a Priest, an Altar, an
Offering, and a Sacrifice to God the Father, for the sins of his people. And
that to this end, that they might be sanctified by this means. Not only that
they might be justified, but that they might be sanctified too. And sanctified
through the truth, through the effectual revelation of the Gospel to them,
which is called the truth in Scripture; Or truly sanctified, as it is rendered
in the Margin; not only in the Type and Figure (as the Offerings and Sacrifices
of the Ceremonial Law) but in reality and truth.

And on this ground, our Savior prays his Father, to sanctify his Apostles
and Disciples, that he might not be disappointed of his great end for which he
sanctified himself, and made himself an offering to his Father; Sanctify them
with the truth. And why so? Why, for their sakes I sanctifice my self, I set my
self apart to be a Sacrifice to thy justice, that they also might be sanctified
with the truth.

The words thus opened yield us out two Observations. First, Jesus Christ did
willingly and freely set himself apart to be an Offering and a Sacrifice to God
the Father. Secondly, he did this for his peoples sakes, and that to this end,
that they might be sanctified, by this means.

DOCTRINE 1. Jesus Christ did willingly and freely set himself apart to be an
Offering and a Sacrifice to God the Father.
He was not forced to become an Expiation for the sins of men. No he did it of
himself; and of his own accord, I sanctify my self (says our Savior in my
text) by consecration.

So he is said to offer up himself, Heb. 7.27. To humble himself and to become
obedient (conceive it passively obedient) to the death, even the death of the
Cross, Phil. 2.8. It Is true indeed the death and passion of our Savior was
necessary if we look to God the Father, and his eternal Counsel and Decree; for
he was slain in that respect, i. e. appointed to be slain from the beginning of
the world. It was determined to be done, as the Apostle speaks, Acts 4.28. And
therefore it behoved him to suffer, as himself speaks, Luke 24.46. and he must
be lifted up upon the Cross; an unavoidable necessity was laid upon him, John
3.14. And as his death was necessary if we look to God the Father, so it was
violent (my Brethren) if we look to men. With murderous and wicked hands they
slew him, Acts 2.23. They killed and crucified the Lord of glory. But if we look
to Christ himself, his death and passion was a voluntary thing, to which he
willingly resigned and yielded up himself. His life was not extorted from him,
but he laid it down himself, John 10.17. He was delivered up to death by God
the Father, Acts 2.23. He was delivered up by Judas and the Jews too, Mat.
27.2. And yet he freely yielded up himself; he loved us and gave himself for
us, Gal. 2.20. he gave himself for us an Offering and a sacrifice to God, Ephesians.
5.2. He sanctified himself for our sakes, and set himself apart to this hard
and sharp service, so that the Point is plain you see, That Jesus Christ did
willingly and freely set himself apart to be a Offering and a Sacrifice to God
the Father.

No man takes my life from me; the meaning is, no man can take my life from me,
and therefore it is added in the following words, I have power to lay it down,
that is, to lay it down of choice and free election, so that I cannot be
constrained to it, and I have power to take it up again. And certainly if he
had power to take it up again when he had lost it, then he had much more power
to keep it when he had it and enjoyed it. So that you see he was not, neither
could he be enforced to die, but of his own accord he willingly and freely gave
himself to it.

John speaks, love in the height and with a witness, this was unparalleld and
matchless love that Christ should willingly and freely lay down his life for
us. Had his life been taken from him for our sakes, this had been no great
love, but that himself should lay it down freely of his own accord, here was
love, and here was mercy to be spoken of, and to be wondered at in all ages.
What? that he should abase himself, that he should not be made obedient by
another, but that he should himself become obedient to the death, yea to that
shameful and accursed death, that he should willingly expose himself to such
abasures, to such indignities, reproaches, scorns, and to such unsufferable
tortures, to such a heavy and intolerable burden of his Fathers wrath, and all
for those that were not undeserving only, but even ill deserving too, that were
not friends but enemies; Oh, let us stand astonished at such a mercy. We need
not wonder that he whose love and kindness was so full of wonder should be
called wonderful, Isa. 9.6.

Is it so that Jesus Christ did willingly and freely set himself apart to be

DOCTRINE 2. Christ did not set himself apart to be an Offering and a Sacrifice
to God the Father for his own sake but for his peoples sakes: and that to this
end, that they might be sanctified by this means: Not that they might be
justified only, but that they might be sanctified also.
He did not do it for his own sake, for there was no sin in him, and so in that
respect he need not to be made a Sacrifice for sin. There was no transgression
in him, and why then should there be an expiation for him? But it was for his
peoples sake. To say the truth, all that he did, all that he suffered, was for
their sakes. For their sakes he became man, for their sakes he became Mediator
between God and man, for their sakes he became a King, a Prophet and a Priest.
And as a Priest, so a sacrifice and offering to the Father, for he offered up
himself. All was for their sakes.

And that to this end, that they might be sanctified, by this means. Not only
that they might be justified, but that they might be sanctified also. That
which was the scope and aim of Gods election, Ephesians. 1.4. He has chosen us in
him, that is in Christ to this end, that we might be holy and unblameable
before him; of Gods Vocation, 1 Thessalonians. 4.7. he has not called us to
uncleanness but to holiness: The same (my brethren) was the end of Christ's
redemption. He sanctified himself, that is, he set himself apart to be a
Sacrifice to God the Father for his peoples sakes, that they also might be
sanctified, as you have it in the Text. He loved his Church, and out of the
abundance of this love of his he gave himself for her, as the Apostle speaks,
Ephesians. 5.25. What, that he might redeem and justify her only? No my beloved,
more then this; that he might sanctify and cleanse her too through the washing
of Water by the word, and that he might present her to himself a glorious
Church, not having any spot or wrinkle, but being holy and without blemish. He
bare our sins in his own body on the Tree, that we being dead to sin might
henceforth live to righteousness, as the Apostle Peter speaks, 1 Pet. 2.24. he
dyed for us, that we which live, should henceforth live no longer to our
selves, to our lusts, and to our ends, but to him who dyed for us. He has
performed the mercyes promised, he has remembered his holy Covenant, he has
saved us from our enemies, and from the hands of those hate us, Luke 1.74.
What, that from henceforth we might be our own Masters, and live at liberty and
walk according to our own humors? O no, but on the contrary, that we might
serve him who has saved us, in holiness and righteousness all the days of our
lives: By one offering of himself, he has perfected for ever them that are
sanctified, says the Apostle, Heb. 10.14. Not them that are justified, but
them that are sanctified. And hence the blood of Jesus which he shed when he
was a made a sacrifice to God the Father, has not a pacifying only but a
purging quality in it. It has not only a value to satisfy, but a virtue to
sanctify. The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin, 1 John 1.7. Completely
from the guilt of all in justification, and inchoatively from the filth of all
in sanctification. I might be copious in the proof, but this may satisfy to
clear the point. Christ did not set himself apart to be an offering and a
sacrifice to God the Father for his own sake, but for his peoples sakes, and
that to this end, that they might be sanctified by this means.

utmost, as the Apostle Paul speaks. Now my beloved, had he justified us only
from the guilt of our transgressions, he had done but one of these; for guilt
is nothing but the obligation or binding over of the sinner to damnation; so
that in quitting us of this, he had but saved us from the wrath to come (as the
Apostle speaks) he had not brought us to the happiness to come. And therefore
since he had a further aim, that he might bring his whole intent about, he has
not justified us only, and so delivered us from death and condemnation, but he
has sanctified us also, and so prepared us for life and salvation; For without
holiness it is impossible to see the Lord; To be admitted as inhabitants into
that holy habitation concerning which the holy Ghost has said, There shall no
unclean thing enter into it. Rev 21.27. And therefore our Redeemer sanctified
himself to be a Sacrifice for us, not that we might be justified only, and so
delivered from Hell and utter darkness, but that we might be sanctified also,
and so made meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints in light.

Our Savior sanctified himself to be a Sacrifice for us, not only that

1. It was the project and design of Christ in this great work of his, to
glorify himself in us, and therefore it was necessary that he should not
justify us only, but sanctify us too: For had he justified us only from the
guilt of our transgressions, his glory had appeared indeed upon us, to wit, the
glory of his mercy; but which way had his glory showed it self in us? But now
by sanctifying us, and by enriching us with all the saving graces of his holy
Spirit (which far exeeed the brightest and Orient Pearls both in luster and in
value) his glory shines forth in us. Now he us glorified in his Saints, as the
Apostle Paul speaks. The glory of his grace appears in them, and sparkles
forth with dazzling luster. And as in the Creation of the world is seen his
wisdom and his power and Godhead, and the like: So in the renovation and the
new creation of some certain persons in it, is seen the riches of his grace. He
does it that he might make known his glory, as the Apostle tells us, (...),
that he may declare it in the vessels of his mercy prepared by him unto glory,
Romans 9.23. And as the greatness and magnificence of any Prince is seen in the
Revenues and the Titles and the Dignities of those whom he has raised and
advanced: So in our present gracious privileges and endowments, preparing us
for glory in the world to come, are seen the unsearchable riches of Christ.

2. It was the project and design of Christ in this great work of his to
glorify himself by us: And therefore it was necessary that he should not
justify us only but sanctify us too: For had we not been sanctified, we
should have dishonored Christ in our whole Conversation. But being once
regenerated and endowed with saving grace, and purified as a peculiar people to
himself, then we glorify our Savior; Then we show forth the virtues, and with
them the praises of him that has saved us. We cause our works to shine before
men, and Jesus Christ (who strengthens us) to shine in them.

Now is it so, my Brethren, that Christ did not set himself apart, etc. that so
they might be sanctified by this means? My Exhortation shall be somewhat
suitable to that of the Apostle on the like occasion, Gal. 5.13. Take heed you
use not this incomparable grace and mercy of the Lord Christ, as an occasion to
the flesh, by taking any kind of license thence to give it satisfaction in the
lusts thereof. It is a dangerous and desperate course of many men who
apprehending, that they are delivered by the death of Christ from all their
sins, and that the Justice of the Lord is satified and appeased for them, are
by this means imboldned and encouraged on in their evil ways. And when they
are reproved for their licentious courses, they satisfy themselves with this,
that Christ has satisfied for them; and that not only for their past and
present sins, but for their sins to come also; so that they need not be afraid
to act them, nor to be humbled for them, after they have done them. But I must
tell them, Christ has not satisfied for them, if he do not sanctify them. He
has not set himself apart to to be a sacrifice for them, if he do not set them
apart to be a holy and peculiar people to himself. And unto such as turn this
grace into licentiousness, I say as Moses did sometime to Israel, Do ye thus
requite the Lord O foolish people and unwise! Oh Hellish people and profane!
yea I protest against them, in the words of the Apostle, Gal. 5.2. that Jesus
Christ shall profit them nothing.

etc. Oh, how should this provoke and stir us up to strive and labor after
holiness, and to endeavor every way to cleanse our selves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit? What motive more prevailing can be tendered to our
thoughts then this is? Ah my Beloved, were there nothing in the world but this
alone, to quicken us and egg us on to purity and a holy conversation; no peace
of conscience waiting on it, no inward joy and comfort of the Holy Ghost, no
fruit of sanctity, no reward of it, neither in the present life, nor in that
which is to come (whereas it has the promises of both) I say my Brethren, were
there nothing else to move us, this of it self were sufficient to persuade,
viz. That Christ in all those torments, those abasures, those agonies and
horrors which he suffered, when he sanctified himself and set himself apart to
be a sacrifice to God the Father, aimed at this, that he might sanctify us to
himself: that we for whom he suffered might be holy. And shall we now like base
unthankful and unworthy wretches, endeavor to the utmost of our power, to
thwart and cross him in his purpose, to frustrate and make void his end? Has
he laid down his life to this end, that we might be pure, and shall we
notwithstanding be profane? Has he shed his precious blood to this end that
we might be holy, and shall we notwithstanding be unclean? Is this the
reckoning that we make of all those exquisite and those unutterable pangs and
tortures which our Savior suffered, when not his body only, but his soul was
made an offering for sin, that we regard not, though he suffer them in vain? I
say to you my Brethren, as the Church, Lament. 1.12. Is it nothing to you all
ye that pass by? Shall all those wounds, those stripes, those horrors he
endured, those streams of precious blood be shed in vain?

Oh think upon it you that rot away in your corruptions, and that by weltring
in the goar of your abominable sins: and though you have been frequently
advised and entreated and besought to wash you, and to make you clean, yet are
resolved to be filthy still: For you make the Son of God (as much as in you
lies) to suffer and to die in vain: you spill this precious blood and tread it
under foot: And be assured of this, your sin is infinitely great, and your
damnation will be heavy in the world to come. And therefore as King David once
when his three Worthies had adventured to fetch him water from the Well of
Bethel, with the apparent and extremest hazard of their lives, refused utterly
to drink it, or to taste of it: Be it far from me says he, for is not this the
blood of these men? 2 Samuel 23.17. Even so say you when you are tempted and
enticed by Satan or your lusts to any fin, to be drunken, or unclean, or to
defraud, or overreach your brother, or the like; Oh be it far from me to do
this thing: for is not this the blood of Jesus Christ? He shed his blood to
purify me, and to make me clean from such sins as these are.

Is it so, that Christ, etc. Oh, how should this astonish all profane that
they might be sanctified, he will ever justify and save them whom he never
sanctifies? That he will fall short of that which was his scope and aim in
this business. Oh foolish fancy and absurd imagination! Nay Jesus Christ
himself has said, yea he has sworn the contrary; and if you will not take his
word, I hope you will believe his Oath: This the is oath that he has sworn,
that all they that are saved by him from the guilt and from the punishment of
all their sins, shall serve him too in holiness: So that if any filthy and
unsanctified person should be saved, Jesus Christ must be forsworn, which were
blasphemous to imagine.

And thus we have at length dispatched the first part of our Saviors prayer
for the Church; and are arrived at the Second. In the first place he prays, as
I have showed you, for his Apostles and Disciples then about him, the members
of the Church that then was, who were already called and sanctified, whom God
had given him out of the world: I pray for them, says he, I pray not for the
world; and this part of the prayer he shuts up with the verse which we have
even now ended.

And now my Brethren, in the second place, he comes to pray for those who were
after to be called by their preaching, or their writing, who were to be the
members of the Church that was to come; Neither pray I for these alone, but for
them also that shall believe on me through their word. And here we have in
general these two main things to be considered:

1. Christ's description of the persons for whom he now becomes a Suitor to his
Father, them which shall believe on me through their word.

2. The matter of the prayer which he makes for these persons, That they may
all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, and so on.

At this time we shall enter on the first of these, and that is Christ's
description of the persons for whom he now becomes a suitor to his Father: and
they in general are true believers, who are described three ways. First, by the
time of their faith; they are not such as did believe when Christ put up his
Supplication to his Father, but such as should believe in aftertimes.
Secondly, by the object of their Faith, they should believe in Jesus Christ.
Thirdly, by the instrumental means of this faith; they should believe in Christ
through the Apostles word.

I shall speak a word or two of the circumstance of time by which our Savior
here describes those for whom he prays; they are not such as did believe, when
Christ put up this supplication to his Father; but such as should believe in
aftertimes; Neither pray I for these only, for my Apostles and Disciples who
believe in me already, but for them also who shall believe on me through their
word. So that you see,

DOCTRINE. Our Saviors Intercession is not confined to those who believe, but
it extends to those who shall believe, though for the present they have no
faith at all in them.
It reaches to believers by Election, to all that are appointed to believe to
the end of the world; I pray, says Christ, for them also (for all them) which
shall believe on me, through their word. And as God loves believers by
Election, though for the present they be unbelievers, (as I have showed you
very lately) so Christ prays for all such. Indeed he died for all such, for all
such as shall believe (and not for such alone as do believe) and therefore he
must needs pray for all such: For both the branches of his Priesthood must of
necessity be co-extended: and so for whomsoever he is a Priest to sacrifice,
for them also he is a Priest to intercede: as he has offered up himself for
them, so he has offered up his prayers for them, and will do to the worlds end.

Ask of me and I will give thee. And therefore let us not grow cold or faint in
such a suit as this is, but let us follow and pursue it to the utmost: Let us
not cease to pray for such a person, let us not cast him out of our prayers,
whom Jesus Christ has not cast out of his; I pray, says he, for such as shall
believe; and this for ought we know, may be one of that number.

And thus far of the first particular, by which our Savior Christ describes
those for whom he prays, viz. the time of their believing. They are not such as
did believe when Christ put up this supplication for them to the Father, but
such as should believe in aftertimes.

Proceed we to the second thing by which he sets them forth, and that is, by
the Spirit of this faith of theirs, they should believe in Jesus Christ;
Neither pray I for these alone, says Christ here, but for them also which
shall believe on me: He does not say, for them which shall believe on God, or
for them which shall believe the Word of God, but for them which shall believe
on me; so that the point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. That true Believers do pitch their Faith on Jesus Christ, and make
him the object of it. Christ is the object of a true beleiving faith.
So he is represented in my Text you see; The faithful do believe on him. It Is
true indeed, that faith in general (which even Reprobates and Devils have)
looks with an equal eye on all the Book of God, assenteth to the truth of all
in gross: But justifying faith, whith is the faith whereof we speak, picks out
this special object Jesus Christ which is embraced and received. By him, says
the Apostle Paul (that is, by Christ, and none but him) all that believe are
justified from all those things from which they could not have been justified
by the Law of Moses, Act. 13.39. The Law will never justify us, but condemn
us: No, we are justified by faith in Christ and him alone who is revealed and
manifested to us in the Gospel: The Rightousness of God, that is the
righteousness which makes us righteous; the righteousness of man will never do
it; No, it must be the righteousness of God himself, This is ours by faith in
Christ, as the Apostle shows, Romans 3.22. He that believes in the Son has
life, Joh. 3. ult. Observe it well, he says not in the Father, nor the Holy
Ghost, though certainly we must believe in both these; But Christ is the
immediate object of the faith which justifies, or of it as it justifies. He
that believes in the Son has life, the life of holiness, and the life of
righteousness, for both of them are very clearly meant in that place.

Object. But you will say perhaps, Is not the Word of God, and is not God
himself, and is not everlasting life the object of our faith? how then is
Christ as I have said, and Christ alone the next and the immediate object of it?

Sol. To this, because it is compounded as it were of diverse things, I must
answer diverse ways.

1. For the Word of God, that is not properly the object of the faith that
justifies, but is so called by a figure, because it holds forth and exhibits
Christ who is indeed the proper object of this justifying faith. Or secondly
the Word of God, although it may in some respects be called the object of faith
that justifies, yet not qua justificat, not as it justifies, as the School
speaks. It Is true, that justifying faith believes other things propounded in
the Word of God. But faith as it justifies, lays hold on Christ and him only,
not knowing any other thing here but Jesus Christ and him crucified.

2. As for the second thing propounded in the Querie, True it is that God the
Father is the Object of our faith (I mean the faith which justifyeth;) but not
the next and the immediate Object of it. Christ must be first laid hold upon,
and God in Christ. Such trust have we through Christ in God, says the Apostle,
2 Cor. 3.4. Even Turks and Jews and Arrians boast of faith in God you know, amd
yet because they apprehend not Jesus Christ, they miserably lose their own
souls. He that denies (and so by consequence,) believes not in the Son, can
never have the Father, as you may see, 1 John 2.23. He is like a man goes about
to grasp a thing that is too big for him, a large and smooth round-bodyed Cup,
it slips away out of his fingers, whereas he might have held it by the handle.
The faith which justifies us, my beloved, apprehends Christ, receives and
lays hold on him, and then as it is added in the fore-alledged Scripture, He
that has the Son, has the Father also.

3. As for the third particular propounded whether salvation and eternal life
be the object of our faith. To say the truth, salvation and eternal life is not
so properly believed as hoped for. Nor can it be so fitly called the object, as
the consequent and end of faith. So the Apostle calls it, 1 Pet. 1.9. Receiving
the end, says he, (Conceive it the perfection, or the reward of your faith)
even the salvation of your souls. Salvation then you see my brethren, is the
end, Christ is the object of our faith.

believe and tremble. They believe the word (historically you must understand
it) and because it makes against them the greater their faith is, the greater
is their fear. As therefore you desire to be absolved and acquitted from the
guilt of all your sins which else will sink you down into the pit of Hell for
ever, to be invested with the righteousness of Christ, without which you can
never have admittance to the marriage of the Lamb, nor to those joys and
pleasures at the Lords right hand for evermore, lay hold on Jesus Christ, and
clasp the arms of faith about him: Men and brethren, to you is this salvation
sent, and we declare unto you glad tidings, preaching through Christ the
forgiveness of sins: and that by him all that believe are justified from all
things from which they could not have been justified by the Law of Moses. We
offer and exhibit Christ unto you, and we beseech you to accept him, that you
may be saved. We stand and cry, Ho every one that thirsts, came to this
water. Now as you tender the salvation of your precious souls, let faith make
out to Jesus Christ that comes toward her; let her fasten on her object. And
that you may the better know what I persuade you to, I shall show you very
briefly, that there are four acts of the soul in reference to Jesus Christ,
wherein the essence and the being of justifying faith consists: Whereof the
former two, are of the understanding, and the two latter of the will. I shall
but only touch at them.

1. Well then, the first thing you are to do, you must endeavor to know Christ
aright: distinct explicit knowledge of him in a measure, is necessary to the
being of this justifying faith. And therefore knowledge is sometimes put for
faith in Scripture; by his knowledge or the knowledge of himself, shall my
righteous servant justify many, says the Father of the Son, Isa. 53.11. And
here to be a little more distinct, you must know that Christ is a complete and
all-sufficient Savior to free you from the wrath of God, and to bring you to
eternal life; That he is offered by the Lord to you, as well as any other: for
so the messengers of God have their Commission to make an universal tender of
him to all to whom they preach without exception; Go preach the Gospel to every
creature, Mark 16.15. And what is it to preach the Gospel to them, but to say
as the Angel to the Shepherds, Luke 2.10, 11. I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people: for unto you is born this day in the City of
David, a Savior which is Christ the Lord? And as Peter to the Jews, Acts 2.39.
The promise is to you and to your children, yea and to all that are afar off,
as many as the Lord our God shall call. Yea you must know that Christ is
offered to you, so that you are peremptorily commanded and required to believe
in him. Come to me, says our Savior, Mat. 11.28. i. e. Believe in me, (for so
himself expounds the phrase as you may see, John 6.35.) all you that labor and
are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. This is the first thing requisite to
justifying faith, of which Christ is the proper Object.

2. The second act is the Assent and Credit of the mind to this, that Christ is
such a one indeed, and that God offers him indeed in such a way as has been
said. And that in this his gracious offer he intends as he says: That Christ
and all his merits will be yours if you accept him. This you must consent to;
you must say with the Apostle, 1 Timothy 1.15. This is a faithful saying; and in
relation to this act it is that faith is called believing, John 3.36. and
elsewhere often in the Scripture.

3. The third act is the yielding of the Will to this external exhibition of
the Son of God, this blessed offer of him in the Gospel, not only for the
certain truth, but the incomparable excellency of it; when the heart accepts
of it, and embraces it, and says with the Apostle in the fore-alledged
Scripture, 1 Timothy 1.15. This saying as it is a faithful one, so it is worthy
of all acceptance. It is a faithful saying, says the Understanding, and
therefore I will give assent to it: It is a saying worthy of all acceptance,
says the will, and therefore I will close with it. So the faith of the Fathers
is described, Heb. 11.13. in which all the three acts which we have mentioned
are wrapped up together. They saw the promises; conceive it with the
understandings eye, they knew them and they understood them. They were
persuaded of them, they gave assent to them, and they received them and
embraced them: for both these terms are there used, not the words and surface
of them, but Christ in them. In which respect this act of faith is sometimes
called receiving of Christ, as see John 1.12. To as many as received him, etc.
So that believing and receiving are all one; this is the third act.

4. The fourth and last act, is a resting, a relying, and recumbency on Christ
for mercy and salvation: this is the great act of the soul in faith: A roling
of it self on Jesus Christ, expecting life and happiness no other way, and by
no other mean but him only: And this is that which is so often called believing
in the Son of God, believing in his name, trusting in him, as the Apostle Paul's
expression is, Ephesians. 1.12. or trusting to him for all the good that we expect
or look for. These are the four great acts of faith, and Christ you see is the
immediate and proper object of them all: So that you easily perceive what I
intend when I persuade you and exhort you to fasten on this object and to
believe in Jesus Christ.

Object. But you will say perhaps (as that is now a great Objection) the
Creature is not able to believe: it is an impotent and dead thing: what can the
Creature do? And why do you persuade it to believe?

Sol. True my beloved, it can do nothing, and you would have it to do nothing
by this Rule. Keep away the means from it, and when will it attain the end? It
has no faith: it is not able to believe: but faith comes by this means, by the
persuasions and entreaties of the Gospel: Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10.17.
When the Apostles persuaded sinners to believe, (as that was very usual with
them) might not a man have said to them, What do you speak to them? They cannot
do what you persuade them to; and yet you know what multitudes sometimes were
brought to believe by one Sermon. So that the word is not in vain, though men
be dead and unable to believe, because when God is pleased to work with it, it
quickens them, and begets faith in them.

Adams fall, so that there was an utter failing of it, an absolute deficiency
in our selves, Faith was provided to supply us and to furnish us again, by
fetching in the righteousness of Christ, so that this laying hold upon imputed,
apparently implies the absence of inherent righteousness; And therefore when we
shall be raised again to that perfection which we once enjoyed in Adam in the
state of Innocence, which shall be done you know my brethren, in the other
Paradise, in heaven, in the state of glory, this justifying faith shall cease,
at least with reference to the receiving of Jesus the Lord our Righteousness,
because we shall have righteousness enough in heaven of our own. And this is
that which the Apostle means in that memorable place, 1 Cor. 13. ult. And now
abides faith, hope and charity. Now they abide; conceive it in the present
life; they all continue; for that is his intention there, but the chiefest of
these is charity, the chiefest in regard of permanency and duration, because
that never fails as he affirms in the eighth verse of that Chapter, No not
in heaven in the state of blessedness where justifying faith and hope shall
fail, and be taken both away.

Is Christ the Object of a true believers faith? This then as it discovers
complete in him (as the Apostle speaks) amidst our many unallowed imperfections
and defects; And though we should be humbled for our failings, with refererence
to sanctification, yet we should not doubt our selves and our estates, with
reference to justification: for having once received Christ by faith we are
complete in him, though imperfect in our selves. If all the Righteousness which
is in Christ will make us righteous, we are righteous; for he is made to us
righteousness, 1 Cor. 1.30. Oh, how should this support their drooping spirits,
who pine away in endless sorrow for their failings and defects! If they be sure
they have laid hold on Christ by faith, they may conclude his righteousness is
theirs, and that is perfect though their own be weak and wanting; And though
they be discouraged in themselves, they may encourage and cheer up themselves
in Christ's; And certainly in doing so they honor Christ, and advance his
fullness.

JOHN. 17.20. But for them also that shall believe on me through their word.


WE are at length arrived at the third particular considered in the words,
viz. The instrumental means of their believing, whom our Savior prays for in
my Text, Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also that shall believe
on me through their word. There has been noted, as you may remember, the time
of their believing, not the present, but the future time, they shall believe;
The Object of it Jesus Christ; The instrumental means of it, through their word.

Through their word; through whose word? why through the Apostles word, for
whom our Savior is a Suitor to his Father in the foregoing parcel of his
prayer, and adds in my Text, Neither pray I for these only, but for them also
that shall believe on me through their word. Their word, as the Publishers and
Penmen of it, not their word as the Authors of it; For the Apostles were the
Preachers and the Writers, though not the Authors of the Gospel. This word our
Savior makes the instrument of faith in this place. Mark it, not the Prophets
word, but the Apostles word; Their word. Them that shall believe on me through
their word. So that you see

DOCTRINE. It is the Gospel word that maks believers; the Gospel is the
instrumental means of faith.
If faith be wrought in any soul, it is by the Apostles word, the word of the
New Testament, not of the Old; Of the New Covenant, not of the Old; In brief,
not of the Law, but of the Gospel: And this is that which the Apostle shows
expressly, Romans 10.15, 16, 17. How beautiful are the feet of them, says he,
that preach the Gospel! But they have not believed the Gospel. For Isaiah said,
Who has believed our Report? So then faith comes by hearing, viz. by hearing
of the Gospel. And hence the Gospel is said to be the power of God unto
salvation, to every one that believes, Romans 1.16.

Q.
But what then, has the Law no hand at all in the working faith?

A.
No hand in working it, but only in preparing to the work. Indeed it shows a man
his sin and his transgression; it empties him of all opin on of himself; it
humbles him, and lays him low, and so it makes him fit to close with Jesus
Christ by faith, as the Apostle shows, Gal. 3.24. The Law was our Schoolmaster
to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. John Baptists rough
rigid Ministry must prepare the way for Christ. He must be like a Pioner to go
before, to bring down every high exalted thought, to make the Mountains level
with the Valleys. The Law must bite and sting men with the curses and the
terrors of it, and so work inclinations in them to look up to Jesus Christ who
is the brazen Serpents Antitype erected in the Gospel.

And this is all the Law can do, it can but fit a man for Jesus Christ, and
prepare a man for faith, which is indeed and properly effected in him by the
Gospel. This is the royal and triumphant Chariot in which the Son of God comes
riding gloriously into the soul, and so dwells there by faith, as the Apostle
Paul speaks, Ephesians. 3.17. And hence the Gospel has the name of faith in
Scripture, as you may see that place for instance, Gal. 1.23. because it
works faith in the hearts of Gods people.

Is it the Gospel word that makes believers? Then surely they are in without
which there is no salvation; No, they are shut up under unbelief, as the
Apostle speaks, Romans 11.32. God has concluded them in that condition. There
they are, and there is no coming out, the door of wrath is shut upon them,
whose miserable case in bowels of compassion we have cause to pity, though
they pity not themselves.

Is it the Gospel word that makes believers? then certainly it is no I pray for
them that shall believe on me through their word; For them and none but them.
He that believes through any other word, you see, is out of Christ's prayer.

Faith comes by hearing, and therefore hear that you may believe. You that are
strangers to the life of faith, be you entreated and prevailed withal to put
your selves under the powerful preaching of the Gospel, as the Apostle speaks,
be swift to hear, lay hold on every opportunity to be partakers of this holy
Ordinance, and then perhaps it may in time become a word of faith to you: Wait
diligently on the doors of Wisdoms house, listen attentively to them that teach
you Apostolical doctrine, and who knows but you may yet believe through their
word?

And thus of Christ's description of the persons for whom he here becomes a
Suitor to his Father: Them which shall believe on me through their word.

Proceed we to the matter of the prayer which he makes for these persons; And
there are two main things that he desires in their hehalf. First that they may
be one; next that they may be in one place together.

The first of these he proposes in the verse that I have read, and prosecutes
in the succeeding verses. 1. He proposes it in the verse that I have read, that
they may all be one as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may
be one in us. 2. And then he prosecutes this Suit of his with diverse arguments
and reasons to ver. 24. as (God permitting) we shall see hereafter.

In the proposal of this Suit of his, you may observe that it is both expessed
and amplified. First it is nakedly expressed in plain terms, that they may all
be one. Secondly, then it is amplified by a Similitude in which our Savior
shows how he would have them to be one, as thou father art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may be one in us. A strange expression if you look upon it
with a superficial view: That the Disciples of our Savior may be one in some
respects, is very easy to imagine. But how they should be one as God the
Father and the Son are one: how they should be in God and Christ, as they are
in one another, is very hard to be conceived: Yet this is the expression of our
Savior to his Father in my Text, That they may all be one, as thou Father art
in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.

For clearing this, beloved, you must know, that [as] in Scripture many times
is a note of similitude, not of equality; It intimates the truth and the
reality of that wherein likeness stands, and not the measure and degree. I
might give many instances wherein that Particle is so taken. See Luke 6.36. Be
merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful. It is impossible for any man to
be as merciful as God is, if you look to the degree; For as the heavens are
higher then the earth, so are his thoughts above ours in this particular. But
yet we may be merciful as he is, though not as merciful as he is. So in the
Text our Savior prays for his Disciples, That they may all be one as thou
Father art in me and I in thee, that they also may be one in us. The meaning is
not that they may be one as nearly (that is impossible) but, as truly as we
are: That as we are in one another, so they may (in some respect) be all in us.
How and in what respect they may be so, I shall show at large anon, in the mean
time the point is this.

DOCTRINE. It is the will of Jesus Christ that his Disciples should not only be
one among themselves, but that they also should be one in God.
Indeed it is the will of Jesus Christ that his Disciples should be one That
they should be all one, as you have it in my Text: Indeed he shed his blood for
this purpose, Ephesians. 2.14. that though they be of diverse Nations (as for
instance, Jews and Gentiles) yet they may be both one, as in the fore-alledged
Scripture. He is our peace, says the Apostle there, who has made both one,
having abolished in his flesh the enmity, to make in himself of twain (of Jews
and Gentiles) one man. Though they be of diverse places, some in heaven and some
on earth; and though they that are on earth, are many of them many thousand
miles asunder, yet he would have them to be all one. It is his project and
design to gather all things into one, which are in heaven and which are in
earth, as Ephesians. 1.10. But you will ask me, How can this be done, that they
that are so distant should be one?

I answer, Very easily, because the bonds of this conjunction are not carnal
but spiritual: So that they may be one, without a corporeal or local union.
From him the head (says the Apostle) all the body by joints and bands is knit
together, Col. 2.19. Part of the body is in heaven, and part of it is on earth,
and here some persons are in one, some in another quarter of the earth: yet all
the body so divided and so distant as you see, by joints and bands is knit
together. And you will easily conceive it, when you consider what these bands
are.

1. They have all one spirit, and so in that respect are one. I speak not of
the spirit or soul of a man, but of the spirit of the Lord Christ, which being
one, dwells in all the Saints at once, and so makes them one too; yea let them
be as distant as they will. And as the formal reason of the union of the
members of the body natural, consists not so much in contiguity as animation
by the same soul; so that if any part be mortified, and if the soul give over
to enliven it, it is no more to be esteemed a member, notwithstanding its
external and corporeal inherence to the body: So though the Saints be far from
one another in regard of place, yet they are closely knit together by the same
spirit, being joined to the Lord, they are all one spirit, and so indeed are
all one.

2. They have all one faith, (one at least in fundamentals) and one faith makes
one, as Ephesians. 4.4, 5. They that are of many faiths in fundamentals, cannot
come so close together to be all one; and therefore Jesus Christ when he
ascended up on high, gave gifts unto men for the work of the Ministry, and for
the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come, all, both Jews and
Gentiles come, in the unity of the faith, etc. So that there is a unity in the
faith you see; and to say truth, my Brethren, faith will make a union at a
distance, as well as if the persons joined were all together: What does th the
corporal or local presence of the parties contribute to the union that is made
by faith, which is a spiritual and invisible thing, and consequently joineth in
a spiritual and invisible manner, which no division or distance in regard of
place can hinder?

3. They have all one heart, and one affection, and so in that respect are one.
The multitude of believers were of one heart, Act. 4.32. Though they were
multitudes, yet they had but one heart; and when there is but one heart, there
is a great Oness. The understanding is the principle of speculation, the heart
the seat of love and of affection. And the Saints are so united and linked
togther in affection, as if they had among them but one common principle of
this affection, as if they had but one heart; and therefore the Apostle
speaking of the faithful, says, that they were knit together in love, Col.
2.2. The term there used imports such a knitting as is between the diverse
parts and pieces of a building. For so the Saints, though there be Millions of
them in the world, yet they are built up altogether to a spiritual house, 1
Pet. 2.5. And love is as it were the mortar and the pins, the ligaments and
ties of the connection; and elsewhere it is called a bond, Col. 3.10. Above all
these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness, with which we are
perfectly joined together, 1 Cor. 1.10. Now love will make a union at a
distance (as well as near at hand.) The nearness of the place (simply
considered in it self) contributes nothing to the nearness and to the strength
of the affection: No, love will reach a person at the other end of all the
earth as well as if he were just by us, in the very next room, or in the very
next dwelling.

You see both that, and how, it is the will of Jesus Christ, that his Disciples
should be one among themselves, which is the first thing in the point.

That they may be all one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they
also may be one in us: Not one among themselves alone, but one in us; which is
indeed a very high thing.

Now that you may the better know what Christ intends in this particular, you
must consider that he speaks to God the Father, as man and Mediator in this
place: For he speaks in prayer here; and consequently when he says, As thou
Father art in me, and I in thee; he speaks not of the union which is between
his Father and himself as he is God: For in that consideration the Father and
the Son are so in one another, that they are the very same; The same Essence
(for so the union is Identical) though they be not the same Person: And in this
sense it is impossible for Christ's Disciples to be so one in God and Christ, as
God and Christ, the Father and the Son, are the one of them in the other.

Well then our Savior speaks here of the oneness which is between his Father
and himself, as he is the Mediator, and as he is the Head of his Church: For so
they are both one, as Jesus Christ himself speaks, Joh. 10.30. And in another
place he uses the very same expression in my Text, and tells us that he is in
the Father, and the Father in him, Joh. 14.10.

Now the Father is in Christ as he is Mediator of the Church, and Christ is in
the Father in the same respect, that is, they are both one, especially three
ways.

1. By Hypostatical union of the Manhood to the Godhead in the Person of our
Savior; for the Manhood being joined to the Godhead in the Person of the Son,
it must be mediately joined also to the Father, to whom the Son as God is
joined in the nearest tie that can be. We have no higher phrase you know my
Brethren, to express the closest union, then to affirm of two that they are
one, they two are are one, and we cannot say more. There is a union between
faithful friends, for there is one heart in two bodies, as the Philosopher
expresses it: There is a nearer union between man and wife, for they two are
one flesh, as the Apostle Paul speaks, Ephesians. 5.31. and therefore they have one
name. But there is the nearest union between the Father and the Son: for they
two have one Essence, one Nature, one Name: And so the Godhead being joined to
the Manhood in the Person of our Savior, that Manhood by and through that
Godhead must needs be nearly and indissolubly joined to God the Father.

2. God the Father and the Son are one by dear affection. Thus they are in one
another, and they live in one another (as it were) by inexpressible and tender
love, which they bear to one another. How does the Father love the Son beyond
expression, and that as he is Mediator? for under that capacity he speaks of
him, Isa. 42.1. and he seems to glory in it, Behold my servant, mine Elect, in
whom my soul delights! and in another place he gives this attestation out of
heaven to him, Mat. 3 17. This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, q.
d. I have some other children that I love well, but This is my Beloved Son
above the rest, take notice of him, this is he. And hence he lays him in his
bosom next his heart, Joh. 1.18. acquaints him with his counsels, tells his
secrets to him, entrusts him with the revelation of them, sets him in the
highest place next to himself, advances him above, yea far above all
principalities, and mights, and Dominions, and puts more honor on him then he
does on all the creatures: And hence the Son is often speaking of the Fathers
love to him: and on the other side professes his affection to the Father, and
he would have the world to know it too, Joh. 14.31. That the world may know
that I love the Father, so do I. So that you see here is union of dear love.

3. The Father and the Son are one by unexpressable agreement and consent
together. Though they be diverse, yet they never differ; No, they continually
mind the same things, they will and nill the same things, love and hate the
same things; and this agreement is between the Father and the Son, not only as
the Son is God, but as the Son is Man and Mediator too. The will of Jesus
Christ as he is Man, in all respects accords and consents with the will of
God the Father. Or if it were not so, it must be sinful and irregular; and
therefore he submitted still, yea even in those things which were against the
Nature that he had assumed; Not my will, but thine be done.

And thus you see how the Father is in Christ as he is Man and Mediaator, and
how Christ as Mediator is in God the Father, how they are both one, viz. by
hypostatical union, by dear affection, by unexpressable agreement and consent
together.

Now we shall easily discover how he would have his Apostles to be one, in his
Father and himself, which is the second thing to be unfolded in the point. It
is the will of Jesus Christ, that his Disciples should not only be one among
themselves, but that they also should be one in God, in the Father and the Son.
This is the special thing for which he prays, That they may all be one, as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.

1. Then as the Father is in Christ as Mediator, and Christ as Mediator in the
Father by the Hypostatical union: so Christ would have his Disciples to be in
both of them by the mystical union: That as the Manhood of the Son is mediately
in God the Father, in being joined to the Godhead of the Son, which is one with
God the Father; so we should also be mediately in the Father, in being joined
to the Godhead and the Manhood in the Person of Christ: That we should be in
the Father by and through Jesus Christ: And so indeed are all the members of
the body mystical, by reason of their union with the Lord Christ. Christ is one
with God the Father, and we are one with Jesus Christ; and therefore (in a
sense) we are one with God the Father; Jesus Christ is in the Father, and we
are in Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 1.10. We all are gathered into one in him; and
therefore we are also mediately in the Father: And hence it is that all the
Saints are said not only to be one among themselves, and to be one in Christ,
but also to be one in God the Father, as in my Text you see, I pray for them,
says Christ, that shall believe on me, that they may all be one, as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; not one among
themselves, but one in us. Not in me only, but in thee too; Not one in me, but
one in us: So that you see, believers all of them are in the Father by the Son.

2. As God the Father and the Son are one by dear affection; so Christ would
have all his Disciples to be one both with the Father and himself in the very
same manner: He would not have them only to be one among themselves by love,
but he would have them also to be one in God by love: He would have their
hearts to live in his Father and himself by unexpressible and choice affection:
That they should find no rest, no quiet anywhere but in God and Christ only: To
be so closely and indissolubly joined to the Father and himself, that nothing
in the world should be able to divide them, to separate them from the love of
God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

3. As God the Father and the Son are one by will and by consent; so Christ
would have all his Disciples to be one with the Father and himself in the very
same manner. And as the Father and the Son agree in every thing, and never
differ in the least degree; that which one wills, the other wills: So true
believers should agree in every thing, not among themselves only, but with God
and Christ too. God and Jesus Christ and they should so accord in every thing,
that they should be as it were all one. Look what God and Christ wills, as soon
as it is manifested and revealed to them, they should will the very same, yea
though it be against them in their honors, profits, pleasures, and delights.
They should conform their wills in all respects to the will of God and Christ.
And even as Christ said to the Father, Not my will, but thine be done: So we
should say to the Father and Son, Not our wills, but yours be done. As you
agree together, so we agree in you; and then indeed, my Brethren, we are like
to agree among our selves, when we agree in God and Christ, and when our wills
are suitable to their wills: Or otherwise agreement without this is combination
and not union. And therefore Christ desiring that his Disciples should be one
among themselves, desires also that they might be one in God, in his Father
and himself, That they may all be one as thou Father art in me, etc.

Now to descend to Application, and therein to proceed with all the

This being in the Father and the Son, implies most intimate Communion Joh.
1.3. All of us are far from God, and far from Jesus Christ by nature: we dwell
a great way from them in a strange Country, and so have no commerce with them;
and when we are converted, we are said in Scripture to be made nigh to them,
Ephesians. 2.13. To have access by one Spirit, to the Father and the Son, verse. 17,
18. And this indeed imports near and sweet Communion with them, such as the
world is not acquainted with. But to be in them, imports yet more near and
close Communion: Indeed the nearest, and the closest, and most intimate that
can be. It is much to be with God, with the Father and the Son; there must be
heavenly communion if it were but so: But to be in them as they are in one
another, this must needs be much more.

This being in the Father and the Son, imports special interest in God. The
greatest interest that can be when we express the interest that any man has in
such or such a great man, we use to say that he is in with him. And truly it is
much to say that we are in with God the Father, and with Jesus Christ, this is
a very great matter; It shows that we have much of their regard and love; That
God and Jesus Christ, and we are great friends; That while all the world are
out with the Father and the Son, we are the only people that are in with them:
This I confess is very much: But what is it then to say that we in them? That
God and Jesus Christ, and we, are in a sense all one; That as the Father is in
Christ, and Christ in him, so we are one in both of them. Here is interest
indeed, such as is impossible to be expressed.

They know the secrets of his heart, Psalm. 25.14. and the mystery of his will,
Ephesians. 1.9. And even as Christ is said to be in the bosom of the Father, and
so to be the only one that is acquainted with him fully, and can reveal him to
the world, Joh. 1.18. No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son
which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him: So true believers
are in the bosom both of God and Christ, and so are infinitely more acquainted
with them, then any in the world besides. And here to be a little more
particular, they know God more immediately, and more distinctly then others do.

1. They know God more immediately then others do: they do not know him at a
distance, and at second hand, but they know him by himself; they have their
knowledge of him at the Fountain head, for they are in him. Others hear of him
by the hearing of the ear, but they see him, Job 12.5. and they taste him,
which sense requires the nearest application of the object, 1 Pet. 2.3. They
know him at first hand, they are taught of God himself; they do not only hear
what others speak of God, and so accordingly discourse of him, as many do by
memory: but they speak with God himself; God shows himself to them, as his own
phrase is, and so accordingly are more immediately acquainted with him.

2. And as they know him more immediately then others, so they know him more
distinctly then others; they have not a confused knowledge of him only as we
have of strangers, or those whom we behold a far off: as when we see a person
at a great distance, it may be we discover that it is a man, or a woman in the
general, but are not able to distinguish whether it be such a man, or such a
woman, whether it be such a friend, or such a one of our acquaintance, yea, or
no: But they have a clear knowledge, they see God evidently, and distinctly, in
a measure, for they are near enough to him, they are in him: so that they can
distinguish God, and Christ, from any other that comes in his Name, or that
pretends that he is God, or Christ. And therefore, my Beloved, when there are
any such abroad (as some have been in our days) who say that they are Christ,
you shall do well to call one of them who are in Christ, to tell you whether
this be Christ indeed, or no.

This being in the Father and the Son, imports ready, easy, and familiar
Pharaoh was in such a case; Send for Moses and Aaron, and let them use their
interest in my behalf, let them pray to God for me.

This being in the Father and the Son, does carry in it a more immediate Apoc.
21.23. The Creatures shall not give us comfort, as they do in this world; No,
God shall be our Sun and Moon there: he shall be every thing to satisfy us,
and content us, and to make us happy: He shall be all in all, 1 Cor. 15.18. Now
if the Lord have not as much in him as all the creatures which we leave, when
we are taken hence by death, we are losers by the bargain, whereas we know the
height, and the perfection of our happiness is there where we have nothing
else but God: And therefore certainly we stand in need of nothing else to make
us absolutely and completely happy. And whenever we have least of creatures,
and most of God in this world, then we are nearest to that full beatitude. Now
God we have, if we be in him, my Beloved, and so we have the Fountain of all
happiness and satisfaction: He that is in God, in the Father and the Son, must
needs have all that is in God, so far as it is necessary for him: And that
indeed is all that can be.

house, a habitation in the Scripture; and to make up the Allegory, the Saints
are said to dwell in God, 1 John 3.24. He that keeps his Commandments
dwells in him, and he in him: So that believers are in God as in a house,
where they are warm, and well, and safe, however matters go abroad, what ever
storms there be upon land; they are not like to the Egyptian servants in the
storm of hail: they are not left abroad in the woods and in the fields to be
smitten and destroyed; No, God has fetched them into house, into himself; they
are in God, who is the habitation of his people, and there they are secure
enough, as the Psalmist intimates, Psalm. 91.1. He that dwells in the secret
of the most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty: So that when
the storm is fiercest, he can stand quiet, and look out at window, and see
others perish in the tempest. He is in the Ark, in God, and a few more with
him, while all the world besides are drowned in the deluge: It matters not to
him what waves and floods there are abroad, he is where he is safe enough.

Nay, God is not resembled to an ordinary habitation only, but to a place of
refuge and defense, Psalm. 18.2. A Castle and a strong Tower, etc. So that they
that are in God, are in a Castle and a strong Tower, that never was, and never
will be taken by assault, and what need they fear there? They that are without
indeed, are in very great danger, they are exposed to the mercy of the Enemy,
because they know not whether to betake themselves for shelter; but they that
are within, may say as David, when the Drums beat, and the bullets fly, I will
lay me down in peace, and sleep, for thou Lord only make me dwell in safety,
Psalm. 4. ult. and that because I am in thee: thou art thy self my Castle, and
my refuge, and my strong Tower.



Now here Beloved, is the fullest and the best assurance against this
discomfort that is contained in the Book of God. You hear that true believers
are in God, in the Father and the Son, yea, they are so in God, so in the
Father and the Son, as they are in one another; I pray for them, says Christ,
that they may all be one as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, so that they
may be one in us: Now my Beloved, do but seriously consider, how is the Father
in the Son? how is the Son in God the Father? What, so that they may be out
again? and that they may part again? No, surely, they are so in one another,
that they can never be divided each from other. Just so are true believers in
them both: So that if God cannot be out of Christ, if Christ cannot be out of
God, believers cannot possibly be out of either. When God and Christ are rent
asunder each from other, believers shall be rent asunder from them both: When
God and Christ do come to part with one another, believers must expect to part
with both; and that would be a sad parting, if God the Father should go one
way, and Christ another, and believers a third, never to come together any
more: But in the mean time, while they stay together, believers shall continue
with, and in them both: while God the Father is in Christ, and Christ in God
the Father, believers shall be one in them. It is the will of Jesus Christ as
he declares it to his Father, That as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, so
that they also should be one in us; and he will surely have his will in this
business.

JOHN 17.21. As thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one
in us.


IS it the will of Jesus Christ, that his Disciples should be one in God
Elizabeth, Whence is this to us? Why, is it possible, that God should ever
honor dust and ashes thus? Whence is it? Oh, my Beloved, how humble and how
thankful should we be? Let us not brag of this honor, as some do in these
times, who never were advanced to it, who say that they are taken in to God, so
that they are God himself, and thus they swagger and blaspheme beyond measure.
Oh, my Beloved, let it not be so with us; let us not brag of this honor, but
let us tremble to consider what a weight of duty and obedience lies upon us, to
walk answerably to it: and how exactly pure and holy they should be who are in
any sense in God, in the Father and the Son.

And this conveys me to a third use, which shall be for admonition live and act
as men that are in God, in the Father and the Son. There is a suitable
expression of the Apostle Paul to this purpose, Col. 2.6. As ye have received
Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him. As you have taken him by faith, and so
are made one with him, As you are in him, so walk in him. Even so say I to you,
my brethren, As you are in God, in the Father and the Son, so walk in God; Take
such a course in the whole tenor of your conversation, as they should do who
are in God: And truly my beloved, that must be a strict, a holy and exact
course: As far as it is possible there must be no exorbitancy, no uncleanness
in it. It was the protestation of the Lord to Moses, which he repeats to Aaron,
when his Sons were cut off for drawing nigh to God with strange fire, Lev.
10.3. Then Moses said to Aaron, This is that the Lord spoke saying, I will be
sanctified in them that come nigh me. Ah, my beloved, will God be sanctified in
them that are nigh him, and will he not be sanctified in them that are in him?
And if they must be holy who are nigh him, how holy must they be, my brethren,
that are in him? in the Father and the Son: How precisely and exactly must they
live who live in God?

And therefore I beseech you, my beloved, who are advanced to this high
Prerogative, look narrowly to all your ways, and keep your selves, as far as
it is possible, from every sin; And that upon these three Considerations: For,

1. Your sin is strangely and unutterably heightened by the station that you
have in the Father and the Son. It is such an aggravation as I am no ways able
to express. What, my beloved, will you sin in God? shall God have wickedness
counted in him, by your means? will you be intemperate, will you be wanton, and
lascivious and unclean in any kind? will you be covetous and worldly? will you
be unjust in God? you do what lies in you to draw the infinitely pure and holy
God into Communion with you in your sin. Indeed sin cannot be committed by him,
but by your means it is committed in him, which is a horrid and amazing thing
to think upon. You do what lies in you, to defile and pollute the holy God with
the impurest and uncleanest thing in all the world, (for so is sin) with that
which is most against his nature, which is most odious and abominable to him,
which he is no ways able to endure. And you are so audacious, that you do not
only do it nigh him, and do it by him, but you do it in him. Ah, my beloved, me
thinks your hearts should not be strong enough to bear up under that weight of
such wikedness as this is, but that they should even faint and sink within you.

Why my beloved, for those that are without God, and who are far from him (as
wicked men are said to be) their sins do not so much concern God, they cannot
be so grievous and so vexatious to him. But to have sin committed in him, this
is a most unsufferable provocation; This goes very near him, because it is done
so near him. I beseech you think upon it, and let it have a mighty operation on
your hearts; The sins of other men are committed out of God, but yours are
committed in him.

2. As they are committed in him, so in the second place they cannot choose but
be observed by him: For God takes special notice of them, and their carriage
and behavior who are in him. So that they cannot do amiss, they cannot step
awry in any thing, but he spies them, he knows their lying doing and rising up,
takes notice of their very thoughts, observes them how they go to bed, and how
they rise, whether they think of him, whether they call on him, or no; They are
so near him that he cannot choose but mark them. For others that belong not to
him, that are without God and without Christ in the world, he looks not so much
after them: But for those that are within him, they cannot but be under his
immediate care, and special eye: He searches out their ways: he does not
superficially observe them only, but he searches deep into them, he sees their
very grounds and ends, so that they cannot fail in any thing, no not so much as
in a circumstance, but he spies them.

And this me thinks, should make us very circumspect in all our ways, and
infinitely cautious that we sin not. That of the Prophet is remarkable, Jer. 8
19. Is not the Lord in Sion? is not her King in her? why then have they
provoked him to anger? And I may say upon the other side, Is not Sion in the
Lord? are not true believers in him, in the Father and the Son? why then have
they provoked him to anger? They that are far away from God, perhaps may be the
bolder to offend, because they may conceive (with those in Job) that he is shut
up in the Clouds, and that he cannot see them at a distance; or if he do, he
cannot reach them: But they that are in God, me thinks should be very
circumspect; They should consider with themselves that it concerns them to be
wary how they walk, and what they do, because he is at hand to spy their
faults, and to observe their provocations.

3. And as the sins of those that are in God, cannot choose but be observed by
reason of their nearness to him, so neither can they choose but be corrected
and chastised. The Lord will take a course with them, if they miscarry, and if
they misbehave themselves, sooner and quicker then he will with other men. And
it concerns him so to do in point of honor; for their iniquities reflect with
more disparagement upon him then the sins of others do, who are further from
him. It would be much for God to suffer sin by him: but do you think that God
will suffer sin in him? That he will let it nestle there without control, as
if he liked it, and as if he took delight in it? Would not this be a very great
dishonor to him, that God should not reform those that are in him? Assuredly,
my brethren, if God will be sanctified in them that are nigh him, he will be
sanctified in them that are in him; either one way or the other, in their holy
Conversation, or in their visible Correction, as he was in David's case, that
those that are without may not blaspheme, as if he suffered sin and approved it
well enough in those that are near to him. No, they shall know, that he
mislikes it most of all in them. If he see many aliens to him, doing any
wickedness, he may bear with them long perhaps, for it concerns him not so much
to deal against them; But if he spy one of his own among them, one of them that
is in him, he will single such a one and cull him out from all the rest and
say, You are in me, and in my Son, you are united to me in the nearest bonds;
and what will you do as these vile abominable wretches do? Come, I must order
you (though I let the rest alone) I must not suffer you in such courses.

Jacob, you have power with God, and therefore you must seek him more in
streights, in difficulties, and in hard cases, because you can do more with God
then others can.

Brethren, there are some streights upon us at this time: we are involved in
difficulties, more then every eye sees. I speak as unto wise men, judge ye what
I say. And therefore you that are in God, that are more prevalent with him then
others are, be sure that you plead hard before him, night and day in such a
time as this is. The businesses that are in agitation now, are of a very great
concernment, and therefore see that you improve all the respect and interest
you have in God, about them.



1. Being in God, they will have opportunity on all occasions to complain
against you. Be wary how you wrong these little ones. For though they be of
little reckoning and reputation in the world, and though they be of little
power to make defense, or right themselves when they are injured, they are so
near to God, that they are in him, and they will readily tell him of it. You
that are men of earthly might, do not oppress them by your power, least they
cry and God hear: And he will very quickly hear them, being in him. You may
abuse and injure others with infinitely less danger, for they are far from God,
they are a great way of, and so may cry, yea cry aloud and not be heard: But
they that are in God, are certainly within hearing. And therefore be advised
how you meddle with them, and make them cry so close to God, least the Lord
hear and it displease him.

2. Being in God, he will certainly redress them when they make complaint to
him. It cannot be but he must be extremely tender of those who are so near to
him. What do you think that the Almighty God will suffer men to be abused in
him? A wicked wretch may touch another man indeed, and yet never touch God,
because he is without God, there is no union between God and him. But whosoever
touches him that is in God, must touch God in touching him. And hence says the
Lord himself, Zac. 2.8. He that touches you, touches the apple of mine eye.
In touching you, he touches me, and that in the most tender place, the very
apple of mine eye. And do you think that God will ever suffer such audacious
boldness as this is? That he will quietly sit still, and let ungodly wretches
thrust their fingers into his eyes, and pluck the very apples of his eyes out
of his head? Take this and take all.

If true believers be in God, you then that are out of God, endeavor Moses did
a good turn for Pharaoh more then once, when he knew not what to do, and when
he could not help himself. Alas, poor miserable man, he was an alien, he lived
without God in the world: and therefore sends for Moses still (who was in God)
to speak a word for him: and he was ready to solicit hard in his behalf, and
diverse times prevailed for mercy, till in the end his heart was hardened to his
utter ruin. And therefore if you love your selves, make much of such friends
as these are.

And thus far of the application of the first branch of the Explication of the
point. I shall be briefer on the other two.

Is it the will of Jesus Christ, that true believers should be one in God,

You then that are believers, let your hearts be knit to God and Jesus Christ,
by this indissoluble bond; Let love make you all one. And as the Father and the
Son are one among themselves, so be you one in them by love. Let your
affections to them be so high, as to unite you to the Father and the Son. And
even as dear affection joins you to your fellow-Saints that you are knit in
love (as the Apostle Paul's expression is) so let it join you much more to the
Father, and the Son; for they are infinitely more to be beloved. Oh let your
hearts no longer live in creature comforts, and in creature satisfactions
(which do so often fail you and deceive you) but let them live in God, by
inexpressable and choice love; There live, and there rest, and there dwell, and
there nestle, as it were in the bosom of the Father and the Son.

Mark that expression of the Apostle, John 1.4.16. God is love and he that
dwells in Love, dewelleth in God, and God in him. God is love essentially:
for whatsoever is attributed to God, is God. And he is the Original and
fountain of the love that is Communicated to the Creature. All the Love with
which we love him, or the Creature regularly, comes from him: It is a ray of
the divinity, a beam of God, a part of the divine nature. And seeing God is
love in the sense before expressed, essentially, originally, it follows thence,
as the Apostle John infers, that he that dwells in love, must dwell in God. He
that dwells, that is, continues and abides in love, to fellow Saints and
fellow members, dwells in God: But he that dwells in love to God himself, dwells
in God much more. And therefore I beseech you, let your hearts set up their
rest in love to God and Jesus Christ; there let them fix and dwell; let not
your love be scattered up and down among the creatures as it is, but let it be
united all in God: and let it join and unite you all to God: that nothing in
the world may ever separate you, or divide you from him.

Brethren, you may be the losers by Love of other things, or other friends; For
after your affections and your hearts are set upon them, they may forsake you,
and be unfaithful and unkind to you. And besides, you must bestow some pains,
and travail and expense on those who are indeed beloved by you. Or else it is
but a dissembling, feigned love; for love where it is sound and real, is very
bountiful and very active. And hence it is, my brethren, that there is so
little true affection in the world. The love of men is for the greater part, in
complement, in show and in appearance only: they will do nothing, they will
part with nothing for those whom they are pleased to call their friends, as
they must do if they love in deed and truth.

But now in loving God, my brethren, (though I acknowledge you must part with
all for him) yet you shall be no losers by it. Though you forgo your friends,
your houses, and estates, and all for him, you shall have him instead of all;
Yea, you shall not have him only, but you shall be in him by this means.

And therefore, I beseech you my beloved, grow up into this uniting grace in
these divided and distracted times, which will not only make you one among your
selves, but one in God. But you will ask me how may this be done? I will give
you some directions.

1. Let prayer struggle for it at the throne of grace. It cannot choose but be
a pleasing lovely suit indeed to be importunate with God to make us love him,
and to draw up our hearts to him. A man would think that such a sweet request
as this, should not be turned off with a denial. Its true that prayer is the
great Catholicon and universal means in all cases. But yet it is expedient in a
special manner to the attainment and enlargement of this grace of love, which
is a special gift of the spirit It is the great work of the spirit of God to
make us love God, and to endear our hearts to him. I know that Hope and
Patience, etc. are graces of the Spirit, but Love is a prime grace. It is a
grace of the first magnitude, and therefore placed first by the Apostle in that
Catalogue of his, Gal. 5.22. The Love of God is shed abroad into our hearts,
says the Apostle, Romans 5.5. how so? by the Holy Ghost that he has given us.
And in another place he tells the Saints, Ye are taught of God; says he, to
love one another, 1 These. 4.1. None in the world can teach you this but God
only. And if none but he can teach us to love our brethren whom we see, then
much more none but he can teach us to love him whom we do not see, and
therefore let us earnestly beseech him to help us to take forth this Lesson.

2. Let us endeavor to grow up in the knowledge of the Lord, and as we know
him better, we shall love him more. That which one affirms of Learning, may be
well applied to God, Non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem. He has such matchless
excellency and beauty in him, that he that knows him, cannot choose but love
him. Indeed while we are unacquainted with him, the admirable worth and luster
that is in him, does not take a whit upon us. The Philosopher will tell us,
that the judgment must be first of all convinced of the worth and value of a
thing, before the heart will close with it, and the affections cleave to it.
Nec enim potes aut amare quem nescias, aut habere quem non amaveris, Thou can
not love him thou know not, nor have him whom thou love not. And hence it
is that wicked and ungodly men love not God or Christ at all, because they know
him not at all; Or if they know him any way, it is not under such a notion as
makes him beautiful and lovely to them. Perhaps they know him as a Judge, or
an Avenger, not as a Father, and a Savior. And this is indeed the cause why
the triumphant Saints in heaven love him more then the Saints militant on
earth, because they have a fuller, clearer and distincter knowledge of him. We
see him darkly in a glass, but they see him face to face. And this is the
reason also why we love not God so much on earth, as we shall do in heaven,
viz. because we know him not so well here, as we shall do in that place. So
that our love to God you see, is answerable to our knowledge of him: as we know
him more, or less, so we love him more, or less. And therefore if we do desire
indeed to love him more, let us strive to know him more.

3. Another means to grow up in the love of God, is to have daily more
communion and intimacy with him. And this, as I conceive it, is a means
distinct from that which goes before: For it is one thing to know him, and
another to have communion, and to be familiar with him. We know abundance with
whom we have no intimacy in the world. No, we know them too well perhaps to be
familiar with them. So we may have a speculative knowledge of the Father, and
the Son, and yet may have no intimate acquaintance with them.

And this is very necessary to increase love. To kindle and inflame affection
(as the Philosopher observes) there must be Convictus and crebra conversatio.
They must dine and supp together, they must walk and talk together. And
wheresoever there is strangeness, there can be no great love. And therefore if
we would abound in the love of God and Christ, let us have more communion with
them.

Beloved if we be not wanting to our selves, we may be very much with God. We
may speak with him often in a day: we may talk with him face to face in our
addresses to his holy Majesty, we may give him many visits; he does not
interdict us, but invite us to come and sup with him, and be acquainted with
him thoroughly once; he is so precious and so sweet a friend, that we shall love
him out of all measure.

4. Endeavor to the utmost of your power, to dispossess your hearts of the
unlawful love of worldly things; for this is incompatible and inconsistent with
the love of God. If any man, says the Apostle, love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him, 1 John 1.15. Let him be what he will (my Brethren) if he
love the world, he loves not God: And therefore ler not any covetous and
wretched worldling make show of having any love to God; For certainly it is not
in him. The friendship of the world, says the Apostle James 4.4. is emnity
with God. And therefore if we would be friends of God, we must dissolve this
friendship with the world. Inordinate, irregular, unlawful love of worldly
things, must be expelled: And as this love is cast out, the love of God will
come in.

5. Be often in the company and fellowship of those that love God; Converse
with those who are most endeared to him, and they will be continually speaking
of him, and seting forth his excellency, beauty, love, and so will kindle and
inflame your hearts toward him. They who are full of sweet affections to the
Lord, if you be much among them, will work you to the same temper: You may
observe it in Cant. 5.10. and the following verses, that when those daughters
of Jerusalem who at first despised Christ, and wondered why the Church his
Spouse should praise him so, and make such a stir about him, yet when they had
a while conversed with the Church, and heard her speak of Christ with such
affection, admiring and extolling him above the skies, they also fall in love
with him, and they will go together with the Church to seek him out; Whither is
Beloved gone? say they, O thou fairest among women, whither is thy Beloved
turned aside, that we may seek him with thee? And thus you see, my Brethren,
frequent intercourse and holy conference with those that love God, is one
effectual means to fill and to inflame our hearts with love to him.

6. Labor to comprehend with all the Saints, the greatness of the love of God
to you, and to assure it to your own souls. It is not all the beauty and the
excellency in the world, that will allure us to the (...) love one that we
imagine does not love us: But if we see and be assured of the love of God to
us, this will kindle love to him, and make our hearts to melt toward him: When
we consider with our selves what kindness he has showed to us, what he has
done for us, what matchless and unfathomed love he has discovered to us, this
will raise our affections high to him again, and make us even sick of love: And
therefore I beseech you strive to be more and more assured of this; for at this
flame you must kindle your fire. Here you must fetch your little spark of love
(whereof the Saints are capable in this life) from the love of God to you:
which being kindled in your hearts, it will never leave aspiring, and flying
higher and higher still, till it have joined it self unto that infinite and
endless flame from whence it issued and proceeded.

And indeed, as Bernard very well observes, we cannot answer God or Christ so
well in any thing as love. To say the truth, we must not answer him in other
things. If he be angry, or displeased with us, we ought not be angry or
displeased with him again. If he condemn and censure us, we ought not to
condemn and censure him again; If he chide us, we ought not to chide him again.
But if he love us, we may, we must love him again; Yea, he expects that we
should return him love for love, for he loves to be beloved.

Is it the will of Jesus Christ, that true believers should be one in God,
Hezekiah to the Prophet, when he received a heavy threatening, Good is the word
of the Lord which he has spoken. Take heed there be no difference between God
and you in any thing; let not him say one thing, and you another; will one
thing, and you another: But say you as God says, and will you as God wills,
that so you may be swallowed up in God, and that you may be one in him: And to
this end I propound three things.

1. If God and you agree not every way in all respects, you are out, and not
he: And therefore it is best in all things to conform your minds and wills to
his: His mind and his will is always right; and yours if they dissent, are
always crooked and oblique; and therefore it is best to bring your minds and
wills to his, and not to think to bring his to your own. The Malon when he
tries the wall that he has builded, by his rule, and finds them not to suit
together, he does not go and cut the rule and bring it to the wall, but he goes
and mends the wall, till he have brought it to the rule. So if your minds and
wills do not agree with God's, the fault is not in his, but yours; and
therefore you must bend your minds and wills till you have brought them
straight like his; and not endeavor to make his crooked like your own.

2. If God and you agree not every way, as you are irregular, so you are
undutiful. You are his servants, and you are his creatures, and therefore ought
in all things to be ruled by him. The Masters will must be the servants will,
in lawful things; and therefore in the Civil Law the servant is accounted in
the Master, and not as a distinct person: And much more the Creators will must
be the creatures will. He gives it being, both the beginning and continuance of
it; and he that gives being, may give Law to regulate the motions and the
operations of the being that he gives, and may not be contested with in any
particular.

3. If we agree not all in God, our agreement and accord among our selves is
worth nothing: So far it is to be approved, as it does unite in God. Then it is
good and right indeed; when as the Father and the Son agree together, so we
agree with both of them in the very same things. If we be of one mind and
heart, in things wherein the Father and the Son are not of one mind with us, it
were better we did differ then unite; for we unite not in a right center. But
if as we be one among our selves, so we be one in the Father and the Son, this
is indeed a blessed union: If Brethren so dwell together in unity, that all of
them do dwell together in this one God, this is a happy and a heavenly
conjunction: And therefore I beseech you, my Beloved, let us look to this, that
as we all agree, so we all agree in God and Jesus Christ. Let us examine still
whether our consent in any thing do meet and unite with theirs: Let us see what
their mind and will is, and let us all accord in that together; For though we
be not one against another, if God be against us all, it is a very sad case.
The Apostle John makes mention of love in the truth, 2 John 15. Love in error
is not to be accounted of, but to be avoided rather; but love in truth is very
precious; consent in error is not to be rejoiced in, but consent in truth, my
Brethren, is a comfortable thing: For this is consent in God, who is so often
called Truth in Scripture. And if we so agree, and so consent, we may depend
upon it, we have Gods agreement and consent with us; and therefore let this be
our great care, that Jesus Christ may have his will in this business, according
to his prayer in my Text, That they may be one as thou Father art in me, and I
in thee, that they also may be one in us.

JOHN 17.21. That the world may believe that thou have sent me.


WE are upon the matter of our Saviors Prayer, for them who should believe in
him by his Apostles word. And there are two main things, as I have noted
formerly, that he desires in their behalf: First that they might be all one;
Then that they might be all in one place. The first of these requests of his he
propounds and prosecutes; propounds it in the verse which we have even now
insisted on, That they all may be one, etc. And then he prosecutes it with
diverse arguments and reasons, in this and the succeeding verses.

Whereof the first is taken from the furtherance, that this near unity of
theirs would be, to the acceptance of our Savior in the world; That the world
may believe that thou have sent me: That they may all be one, as, etc. Why so?
That the world may believe, etc.

For Explication of the terms, the difficulty lies especially in this, viz.
what sort of people our Savior Christ intends by the world here; For to say
truth, the world is taken diverse ways; I think more differently then any other
phrase almost in Scripture: Sometimes we find it used for elect and sanctified,
and sometimes for reprobate and unsanctified persons: Sometimes we find it
taken for believers, and sometimes for unbelievers, as I could give you
instances of both these. And when for unbelievers; sometimes for those who
believe not for the present, but shall believe in after times; sometimes for
those who neither do believe nor shall believe. Now all the question is, which
of these three sorts of people our Savior Christ denotes by the world in this
place.

There is no color to conceive that the world should here be taken for
believers, for such as did then believe when Christ spoke these words; the very
next word that he adds does evidently cross and dash that; That the world may
believe that thou have sent me: So then the world in this place apparently
imports unbelievers. But whether such as believed not for the present, but
should believe in after times: Or such as neither did believe, nor should
believe: Whether elected unbelievers, or reprobated unbelievers, will need a
little briefly to be enquired and resolved.

Some of no small authority conceive, that by the world is meant elected
unbelievers; such as did not then believe, but should believe in after times
(conceive it with a saving and a justifying faith) and that the rather for
Christ's Disciples unity among themselves. And hence he prays, That they may all
be one as thou Father, etc. that the world may believe that thou sent me. But
if our Savior had intended justifying faith in these words, in probability he
would have said, that the world may believe in me. They are but poor believers
that come no further then barely to assent to this, that Jesus Christ is sent
of God the Father; a reprobate may do this.

Besides (which carries me exceedingly) me thinks the world is here apparently
opposed to such as did believe, and should believe with a justifying faith. Our
Savior mentions it as opposite to both these. In the first place you know, he
prays for such as did believe, when he made this prayer; and then for such as
should believe in after times: Neither pray I for these only, but for them also
that shall believe on me, that they may all be one, etc. That the world, who
neither do believe, nor shall believe with a justifying faith, may yet by this
means be so far convinced, as historically to assent to this, That thou have
sent me, q. d. This is that which I desire, that they who shall in after times
believe by my Apostles word, may by their unity so far convince and work upon
the world that never shall believe, as that they may be brought to this at
least, to acknowledge that thou have sent me: For so believing here is nothing
else but knowing or acknowledging: and therefore in the 23. verse that word is
used, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the
world may know that thou have sent me. You see the meaning of the words. The
point to be observed is this:

DOCTRINE. The unity of Christ's Disciples is one especial means to cause the
world to have the better thoughts and apprehensions of their Master.
Though this will not convert the world, and bring them to be true believers,
yet this will very much convince the world, and make them look with a better
eye on Christ, and on the Doctrine of the Gospel, when they that teach it and
profess it, harmoniously agree among themselves: And hence is this Petition of
our Savior here, that they may all be one, etc. that so the world (although it
be an enemy to me) yet seeing the consent and love, and unity of my Disciples,
of them that own me and profess me, may be even forced to acknowledge and
confess that I am sent of God, that my Doctrine is of God, and that I am not
(as the world is apt to think) a seducer and impostor, q.d. If my Disciples be
not one among themselves, if they be rent asunder by a spirit of division, the
world will never yield that I came forth from thee, who art the God of love and
peace; That thou have sent me down to be a Mediator and a Peacemaker, to make
up all the breaches and the differences between thee and thy people. They will
look strangely upon me, and they will never be persuaded to acknowledge that I
am come on such an Errand as this is. And therefore I beseech thee, Father,
that I may be entertained under the notion of a Mediator, and that I may be
looked upon as sent by thee; do thou take care that my Disciples be at unity
among themselves.

Now here I shall a little more distinctly show you, that the unity of Christ's
Disciples in Doctrine and Opinion, and in Affection and in Conversation, is one
especial means to cause the world to have the better thoughts of Christ himself.

etc. If they maintain and hold the same things, if they teach the same things,
they will the sooner gain the approbation and assent of those that are without;
But if they wrangle and contend, this will make them more averse from Jesus
Christ and from the Gospel. And truly no one thing almost has kept men more
aloof from Christ, and the Doctrine of Salvation, in and by and through him,
then the perpetual, hot and endless controversies and Disputes that have been
among the Teachers of the Gospel. Nay, if they be not able to agree among
themselves, say they that are without, even let them all alone, we will carry
till they do. And therefore the Apostles still were very circumspect to
manifest agreement and consent among themselves in that which they delivered to
the people, because they knew of how great consequence it was to further the
success and efficacy of their Doctrine. It is observable that Paul joins one or
two together with himself in his Epistle, sometimes Sylvanus, sometimes
Sylvanus and Timotheus, who were not inspired men (as it is probably conceived)
and so could not add a whit to the divine authority of his Epistle: But yet he
shows how they accorded all together, for the better satisfaction of the
people. So the Apostles and the Elders and the Brethren go jointly all together
in the Resolutions of the Synod at Jerusalem, Acts 15.23. that their decrees
might find the readier entertainment among those to whom they sent them. And
though it be a certain and confessed truth that the agreement and consent of
teachers, neither does, nor can work saving faith in any (The word it self, my
brethren, as it is the Object, so it is the isntrumental cause of faith:) yet
it may prepare the heart and work it up to better thoughts and apprehensions
both of Christ and of the Gospel.

The unity of Christ's Disciples in affection and in conversation is one etc. If
they live in unity and love and sweet accord together, they that are Aliens to
religion, strangers to Jesus Christ and to his Gospel, will think the better of
them for their sakes. But if they be continually brawling and opposing one
another, this keeps others off from Christ. If he be owned and followed by none
but by a company of wrangling, quarrelsome contentious people, they will never
close with him. So that you see my brethren, it exceedingly concerns the honor
of our Savior Jesus Christ and of the Gospel, that they that appertain to him,
avoid dissentions with their brethren, for they reflect with very great
disparagement on him and it. And therefore the Apostle is so sharp with the
Corinthians, because they showed their malice, and had their suits and
controvesies each with other before unbelievers, 1 Cor. 6.1. By which it seems
they set them off the further, both from Christ and from the Gospel. This shall
suffice for the clearing of the Observation; proceed we to the application.

Now, is it so my brethren, that the unity of Christ's Disciples is one etc.
Here then we see the reason, my beloved, why Jesus Christ, and religion, and
the Gospel, are so despised and undervalued and neglected, why they are so ill
thought of in these times. As certainly Christ and the Gospel had never less
esteem and credit in the world, then they have in these days; And this is one
great cause of it, there is so little unity among Christians. Nothing but
disputes and quarrels, and contests among them everywhere; whither we look upon
the Teachers or the Professors of Jesus Christ and of the Gospel.

If we look upon the Teachers, how strangely do they differ each from other
everywhere! how do they cross and thwart with one another, as if there were
many Christ's, and many Faiths, and many Gospels, and more ways then one to
heaven! In the Apostles times it was Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus, they did
harmoniously agree together. But now Paul is of one mind, and one way, and
Timotheus of a second, and Silvanus of a third; So that the people are
distracted, and in the end regard neither. They that are yet without, and to
seek of their religion, know not what to pitch upon, but are the more estranged
from Jesus Christ and from the Gospel. If the Trumpet give an uncertain sound,
now here and now there: now this way, and now that: how shall the confused
people gather themselves into a body, and come to be at one among themselves?
If this Pulpit sound with one thing, another with that which is directly
contrary to it; a third with that which contradicts both; where think you then
shall poor unstable souls settle? how is it possible but they that have not
senses exercised to discern, should be carried up and down and really adhere to
nothing, as it is at this day? And thus our Gospel is exposed to contempt, our
Religion undervalued, and Jesus Christ himself is slighted and despised.

2. If we look on the professors of Jesus Christ, and of the Gospel, how are
they rent asunder into factions! Oh what a spirit of division is there up and
down among them, such as never was abroad till these times! They are of so many
minds, and draw so many ways, and have such vehement and such hot contentions
and disputes among themselves, that they are no way to be pacified and
appeased, unless the God of peace himself appear, and above all that we can
think. All that time and pains, and heat, and zeal, and strength which was wont
to be bestowed in private duties, in prayer, and examination, and humiliation,
etc. and to be set a work about their own hearts, in mortifying, and subduing
the corruptions and the lusts that are there, is now laid out in making and
upholding parties, and in maintaining controversies, and disputes, in doting
about frothy frivolous, and vain questions, that tend to strife and variance,
and not one whit to edification.

And this is that which alienates and keeps off those that are without from
closing with religion. This takes away the beauty and the luster of it, that
may invite them, and allure them to it. When carnal men see nothing else but
rents and breaches among professors of religion, the glory of it is extremely
darkened in their eyes, and it is sure a stone of stumbling to them, and such a
rock of scandal and offense as they cannot get over. When we show all our
weakness in our passion, and in our violent and hot contentions, before the
watchful eyes of scornful enemies: when we uncover our selves in the sight of
the wicked as a fool uncovers himself, they disdain us in their hearts, and
with us our profession too. Nay if this be their Religion and profession, to
brawl, to wrangle, and to quarrel thus, I am even at a point (says the
profane and graceless heart) I will have none of it. It is a choice and
curious observation of the Holy Ghost (if you observe it) upon the difference
that fell out between the servants of Abraham, and the servants of Lot, that at
the very time when the contention grew, the Canaanite and Perezite was in the
Land, Genesis 13.7. There was a strife between the Herdsmen of Abraham's Cattle,
and the Herdsmen of Lots Cattle, and the Canaanite and Perezite dwelled then in
the Land. Their strife was much the more vile, and the more disadvantagious to
religion, because it was before them.

etc. Let this prevail exceedingly with every one of us, who are or would be
taken to be Christ's Disciples to strive and labor after this oneness. There
have been many Arguments and Reasons used heretofore often, to stir us up to
this endeavor, but none like this, that Jesus Christ will be the more
respected, and the better thought of in the world by this means. Now for the
honor of Christ Jesus, leave your wrangling and contending, and agree among
your selves; Do not so carry and demean your selves, as to persuade the world
that he was never sent of God. He suffered shame and ignominy, and contempt for
you; Oh, do not cause him now to suffer ignominy and contempt from you. You
have seen the sad effects of breaches and divisions, many ways, and this way
among the rest in these times: How much our blessed Savior and the Gospel
suffers by the hot contentions of those who call themselves Saints. Ah, my
beloved, if you have any love to Jesus Christ, any regard at all to his esteem
and credit in the world, if you would have him in account and reputation, make
up your breaches and differences, deny your selves for his sake.

See how he beggs his Father for it in my Text, Let them be one, says he, as
thou, etc. that the world may believe, etc. that they that are without may not
be so ill persuaded of me as they are. And if Christ be so earnest for it, if
he beg for it of his Father, with so much affection, will you slight it, and
look upon it as a small matter? Oh labor to help onward that which he is so
intent upon, that so without hypocrisy you may say Amen to this Prayer.

And thus of the first Argument with which our Savior prosecutes his suit to
God the Father, that his Disciples might be all one: Which has been taken from
the furtherance that this near unity of theirs would be to his own
entertainment in the world.

JOHN. 17.22. And the glory which thou have given me, I have given them: that
they may be one even as we are one.


THE second follows now in order to be handled. And it is taken from the end at
which he aimed in glorifying his Disciples, in giving them the glory which he
had received from God the Father, and this was that they might be one; And the
glory which thou gave me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we
are one. q. d. Since I have glorified them so much as I have done, to this end
that they might be one, I pray thee Father, let me not be disappointed of my
purpose, but let me have my end in this business.

Two things we have to be considered in the words. First Christ's communication
of the glory which he received from the Father to believers. The glory which
thou gave me, I have given them. And secondly the end of this communication,
that they may be one, even as we are one. At this time I shall make a little
entrance on the first of these, and that is Christ's communication of the glory
which he received from the Father to believers. The glory which thou gave me,
I have given them.

If there be any question what glory is intended by our Savior here, whither
that which he as God, enjoyed together with the Father from eternity; Or that
which he as Man and Mediator of the Church, received from the Father: It is
apparently resolved in the words themselves. The glory which thou gave me.
Christ has no glory given him as he is God; but as he is Man, and Mediator, he
has much bestowed upon him by the Father. Now that which he receives as man,
he communicates to men, he gives it out again in some sense and in some degree,
to true believers, to all the living members of his body. As he affirms here
expressly, the glory which thou gave me, I have given them. Them, whom? Why
them that believe on me, as you shall easily discern, if you observe the series
of the Text; Neither pray I for those only, but, etc. That they may all be one,
etc. And the glory which thou gave me I have given them. So that we have two
Observations clearly pointed at in these words.

First, God the Father has bestowed much glory on the Son, as he is Man and
Mediator of the Church.

Secondly, The self same glory which the Son as Man receives from God the
Father, he communicates again, and gives it out in a sort to all believers.

DOCTRINE 1. God the Father has bestowed much glory on the Son as he is Man
and Mediator of the Church.
You see he has the Sons receipt to show for it, the glory which thou have
given me, says Christ; It is his own acknowledgement in writing here, that he
has glory given him by God the Father. Indeed my brethren, God the Father has
honored Jesus Christ exceedingly, Heb. 1. per tot. for that is the intention
of the whole Chapter, as I have showed you largely on the first verse, to which
I shall refer you for further prosecution of this Point: and so I pass on to
the second Observation.

DOCTRINE 2. The self same glory which the Son as man receives from God the
Father, he communicates again, and give it out in a sort to true Believers.
That which he receives as man, he communicates to men; as he partakes it in
the humane nature, so to the humane nature he dispenses it again to all the
members of his body. This is the thing which he affirms expressly to his Father
in my text, The glory which thou have given me, I have given them, q. d. As
thou gave it me for them, so I have given it to them. I have not kept it in
my own hands, but have as freely parted with it, as I did receive it. I have
been true to thee and them in this business.

Now for the through clearing of the Point, I shall review the glory which God
the Father has bestowed upon the Son as Man and Mediator of the Church, and
that in all parts and branches of it. And then proceed to show you particularly
and distinctly, that this very glory, in all the parts and branches of it,
Christ has dispensed again in some degree to true believers; And when I have
done this, I hope it will be evident, that the self same glory, etc.

Then the Son, as man, receives most honorable titles from the Father, Adonai
alone, but Lord Jehovah; which is indeed the highest and most glorious Title
that belongs to God himself.

But does Christ make these Titles over now to true believers? yes, my beloved,
all of them without exception. As God makes him a Prince, so he makes them
Princes; And as God makes him a King, so he makes them Kings, as the Church
acknowledges, Apoc. 1.6. He has made us Kings to God. As God calls him
Jehovah, so he calls the Church Jehovah, at least she is so called by his
means, by reason of her union with him: For even as Jer. 23.6. it is said of
Jesus Christ, This is his name by which he shall be called, Jehovah our
righteousness; so Jer. 33.16. it is said of true believers, of the Church which
consists of true believers, This is her name, by which she shall be called,
Jehovah our Righteousness. A man would think, Christ should have kept this
glorious and transcendent title to himself, concerning which the Lord
professes, Isa. 42.8. I am the Lord, I am Jehovah (for it is Jehovah there, not
Adonai or Elohim) that is my name that is in a sense, my proper and peculiar
name; and my glory, the glory of that name, will I not give unto another. But
when the Father gives it unto the Son as Mediator, he does not give it to
another; for he is one with God the Father; and when the Son as Mediator, gives
it to the Church, he does not give it to another neither; She is so near him
that he will have her one way or other, to partake with him in this high glory.

The Son as man receives much glory from the Father, as in the Titles the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the Father of Israel, but the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. He calls himself no more the Lord their God
that brought them out of land of Egypt, but the God that brought again from
the dead the Lord Jesus Christ.

Now as he calls Christ so, so Christ makes him to call all true believers so.
He will have them to share with him by any means in this honor. Is God the God
of Christ? why Christ makes him the God of all believers. Is God the Father of
Christ? why Christ makes him the Father of believers. Is he the God that brings
again from the dead the Lord Jesus Christ? why he is the God too that will
surely bring again from the dead all true believers, as the Apostle tells us,
them that sleep in Jesus, will he also bring with him, 1 Thessalonians. 4.14. Me thinks
it is as if Christ should have said to him, That which thou art to me, thou
shall be to them too: That which thou do for me, thou shall do for them too.
I will have none of this honor, unless they partake with me.

The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father, in that he sets

Why now the self same glory does the Son bestow upon the Church in that he
sets her at his own right hand, in the next place to himself. If Jesus Christ
be raised so high, how high is the Church raised? If Jesus Christ be so
transcendently exalted in this, that he is set in the next place to God, how is
the Church exalted then that she is set in the next place to Christ! Look upon
Christ, and you shall see that God has highly exalted him, and set him at his
own right hand, Ephesians. 1.21. and then look upon the Church and you shall see,
that Christ has highly exalted her, and set her at his own right hand, Psalm.
45.9. On thy right hand did stand the Queen, (i.) the Church. Now, my beloved,
is the place of Christ high? How high then is the Churches place? Is Christ at
the right hand of God? She is at the right hand of Christ. Is Christ in the
next place to God? She is in the next place to Christ. Is there none above
Christ but God? None is above the Church, but Christ and God. Is he exalted far
above all principality and powers, might and dominion, not only in this world,
but in that which is to come; not only above all principalities and powers on
earth, but even above all principalities and powers in heaven too; above the
very Angels, yea, the highest orders of them? She is exalted far above them. As
Christ comes between them and God, so she comes between them and Christ, she is
nearer Christ in union, nature and dignity. The Angels are but Ministers and
servants whiles the Saints the members of the Church are heirs. Yea, they are
Ministers to these heirs. They are all the best of them, ministering spirits,
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation, Heb. 1. ult.
So that no marvail, though our Savior tells his Father here, The glory which
thou gave me I have given them.



Why now, the same power he dispenses to the Church, to be executed by her
Officers. And therefore having said All power is given to me both in Heaven and
in Earth, Mat. 28.18. he adds immediately to his Apostles in the very next
verse, Go ye, and teach all Nations, baptizing them. q. d. the power which is
given me, I give you in some measure. As God the Father has given me all
power, so I give you some power, so much as you are capable of. And as the
government is put upon my shoulders by the Father as the Prophet speaks, Isa
9.6. so I put over some part of this Government to you my Underofficers, whom
I depute to manage and negotiate the affairs of my Kingdom. As God the Father
has set me over his house, so I set you to be my Stewards under me, to whom I
give the Keys of this house. As God the Father has given me the King-key of
David's Princedom which I keep my self, so that I shut and no man opens, I
open and no man shutts: so I give you the Ministerial Keys, which I entrust
with you who are the Stewards and the guides of my household: To whom I give a
special power to open and to shut the doors of my house, to let in and put out.
And though it be my own prerogative, and a chief flower of that Imperial Crown
which God the Father has been pleased to set upon my head, to seal pardons,
and to forgive sins, viz. to do it in the Court of heaven, and Conscience: yet
I commit to you my Viceroyes, and my Underofficers, a Ministerial power both
to remit, and to retain sins in the outward Court, that is, the face and
presence of the Church, in regard of declaration. Verily I say unto you,
whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, etc. Mat. 18.18, 19. And
in another place, whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted; and whosesoever
sins you retain, they are retained. And in a word, as God the Father has
committed all judgment unto me, so I commit some judgment to you. And hence
it is, my brethren, that the Church assisted by her Officers, judges them that
are within, although she judge not them that are without, as Paul speaks, 1
Cor. 5.22. over whom no power is given her by the Lord Christ: But those that
are within, she judges and condemns too if there be cause, and casts them
out, and gives them over to the Executioner; There take them Satan, disquiet
them, afflict them, for the destruction of the flesh the carnal part, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.

The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father in the great

Why now the self same glory has the Son communicated to believers, in that he
has advanced them to the self same Offices to which he is himself advanced by
the Father. As God the Father has made Jesus Christ a King, a Priest, and a
Prophet to himself; so Christ does make all true believers Kings and Priests to
God his Father: for both those Offices are mentioned Apoc. 1.6. He makes them
to become a royal Priesthood, 1 Pet. 2.9. A Priesthood, and a royal Priesthood.
And as he makes them Kings and Priests, so he makes them Prophets too, to teach
their families, and make known his ways to them: to teach their neighbors and
acquaintance, and to admonish one another within the compass of their own
Spheres, Col. 3.16. In which respect it is the Counsel of the Apostle in the
cited place, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in you the people of
Colosse, not in the learned Doctors only, but in the private members of the
Church: So that you see Christ has advanced all true believers with him, to
all the offices to which he is advanced by the Father, and so has made them
sharers with him in the glory. None of the Types of Christ were so advanced in
the figure. Melchizideck was both a King, and Priest, as you may see, Genesis
14.18. but he was no Prophet. David was a King and Prophet, 2 Samuel 23.2. but he
was no Priest. Ezechiel was a Priest and a Prophet, but he was no King. But all
believers are so advanced in the truth; they are Kings, and Priests and
Prophets, all three as Christ is; and so they have the same glory that Christ
receives from God the Father.

The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father, as by the

The self same honor do believers receive in some degree from Christ again. As
God the Father has anointed him with the Holy Ghost and power, thereby
enabling him to be an all-sufficient King and Priest and Prophet to his people;
so God the Son has given down some part of his anointing to believers, by
which he has enabled them to all those Offices to which he has assumed them
with himself: It runs down from him the Head to the skirts of his Garment: And
hence, says the Apostle, speaking to believers, ye, says he, have an unction
from the Holy One, 1 John 2.20. Christ has an unction from the Father, yea
from Christ. Jesus Christ immediately from the Father; ye mediately in, and by,
and through Christ. Indeed, my Brethren, all believers partake with Christ in
this anointing of the Spirit. He suffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved
even Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine anointed, Psalm. 105.15. But
who were these anointed, you will ask me? They were not Kings as some expound
it: for God reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not my anointed. But
they were the Lords people, as you may easily perceive, if you survey the scope
of that place. And hence the Prophet having said, God, even thy God has
anointed thee, he adds immediately above thy fellows, Psalm. 45.7. so that
Christ has his fellows in the unction, although not in the measure of the
unction: All believers share with him, though they do not share like him. And
if they be his fellows in the unction, they must be his fellows too in the
honor of the unction. They are partakers with him in the self same glory,
which, etc. By this time I suppose the point is cleared; the self same glory
which he receives from God the Father, etc.

etc. Here then you see what great regard he has to them that do indeed
believe in him, and what a mind he has to honor them, even to the utmost: So
that he does not grudge them to be sharers with him in his own glory. Rather
then they shall want it, they shall have of that which God the Father has
bestowed on him, to make him glorious in the world. It satisfies him not to
shine alone; no, he must have believers shine with him and sparkle with him. O
what an admirable thing is this, that Christ should have such singular regard
to poor wretches! His glory is the thing which he is most tender of, which he
is lothest to forego: And yet he is content, you see, to part with this to true
believers, to give them of his own allowance from the Father. His blood was
dear, but his glory is dearer; yet let it be dear and precious as it will, it
is not too dear for them: If he have any, they shall have a part with him, and
that in the same glory; not in another kind of glory, but the very same that he
is endued with; so he tells his Father here; The glory which thou gave me, I
have given them, q. d. There let them take it with my heart, and much good may
it do to them.

etc. And therefore if at any time we receive any honor any way, let us not
keep it in our hands, but let us give it up to Jesus Christ. If we have done
any act that draws applause or commendation, if when we have performed any duty
with more then ordinary zeal, or power, or profit, or success, men admire us,
and advance us, let us not do as Herod did; Let not this glory cleave to our
fingers; but let us shake it off from us, and say with David, Not unto us, not
unto us, but to the Name of Christ be all the glory; And when these Crowns of
honor are set upon our heads by men; O let us with the twenty four Elders cast
them down before the throne of Jesus Christ. And as Christ says to God the
Father here, The glory which thou gave, me I have given them: so let us say
the same in sincerity to Christ, The glory which men gave us, we have given
thee.

JOHN 17.23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.


AND thus far of the Second Argument with which our Savior prosecutes his suit
to God the Father, that believers might be one; Which has been taken from the
end at which he aimed, in giving them the glory which he had received from God
the Father: and this was that they might be one. The glory which thou gave
me, I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one.

The third comes now in order to be handled: And it is taken from the end of
Christ's inhabitation in believers, and of the Fathers inhabitation in himself,
and this is also that they may be one, yea, that they may be perfect in one, I
in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.

You easily discern that there is some word defective to make the sense
complete in this place, I in them, and thou in me, what is that? Either it must
be I am in them, and thou in me; or I have been in them, and thou in me; Or I
shall be in them, and thou in me. Either all or one of these, or some such
thing as this is.

Modern Interpreters take little notice of it, that I can observe, and ancient
Writers supply it diversely, according as their apprehensions lead them. As far
as I can dive into it, it is thus expressed of purpose because our Savior had no
mind to bind it up either to the past, the present, or the future tense, but
that it might be left indifferent to them all. If he had said expressly, I have
been in them, and thou in me; this could not have been properly applied to
those which then believed for the present, or should believe in after times. If
he had said I am in them, and thou in me exclusively, this would not have been
properly applied to them which had believed in former times (supposing that I
am excludes I have been) or should believe in after times. If he had said, I
shall he in them, and thou in me, this could not have been properly applied to
them which had believed, or did believe; So that which way soever he had fully
set it down, he had seemed to exclude past believers, or present believers, or
future believers, which he had no intent to do; And therefore he does purpo ely
express it so (as I conceive) that he might take in all of them, without
exception, I in them, and thou in me, to which you may add, have been, are, and
shall be.

I have been in them that did believe, I am in them that do believe, and I will
be in them that shall believe: That so they may be all of them by this means
closely linkt together; One special end of my inhabitation in believers past,
present, and to come, of this inhabitation in my self, (the Mediator between
thee and them) is this, That they may all be one; yea, that they may be perfect
in one; and therefore I beseech thee Father, let us have our end in this
business. For Explication of the words, we have three things to be enquired and
resolved. First, how Christ as Mediator is in true believers. Secondly, how God
the Father is in Christ as Mediator. Thirdly, how the Mediator being in
believers, and God the Fathers being in the Mediator, do serve to this great
end whereof our Savior speaks (viz.) to make believers one, yea, to make them
perfect in one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
one. I shall be brief upon the former two, because they are more easy to be
apprehended; and the third indeed is the main thing in the Text.

dwell in the heart by faith, Ephesians. 3.17.



Now in our Saviors humane Nature the whole Godhead dwells, as the Apostle
shows, Col. 2.9. In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Others
are partakers of the Divine Nature, as the Apostle speaks, 2 Pet. 1.4. but he
is partaker of the Divine Essence. Others are partakers of the properties of
God; but he is partaker of the Godhead it self: Others are partakers of the
grace of God; but he is partaker of the God of grace; And therefore the Apostle
says not that in Christ dwells (...), that is, the Divinity, but (...), that
is, the Godhead; And that the fullness, all the fullness of it; In him dwells
all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; Because it is indeed and really united
to the humane Nature, to the body of Christ Jesus, as I have somewhere noted
heretofore. You see how Christ is in believers, and how God is in Christ.

viz. to make believers one, yea, to make them perfect in one; I in them, and
thou in me, that they may be perfect in one; This will need a little further
Explication.

That Christ is in believers by his Spirit, to this end, that they may be one
among themselves, and with the Father and the Son, is very manifest in
Scripture. But is God in Jesus Christ to this end? Yes, my Beloved, to this
end. God had never been in Christ as Mediator, but that believers might be
joined to himself, in, and by, and through Christ. True, my Beloved, the Father
had been in the Son as God however, so he was from everlasting: But God had
never been in Christ as Man and Mediator, but for effecting this union: so that
as the Apostle says, God was in Christ reconciling the world, the world of
believers: so I may say as well, God was in Christ uniting the world, the same
world of believers to himself. Originally they are disjoynted and divided each
from other, and which is worst of all, from God; But down comes Christ, and
dwells in all of them together, and down comes God and dwells in Christ, that
so they may be all one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in
one.

Not only that they may be one, but that they may be perfect in one; what does
our Savior mean by that expression, That they may be perfect in one? Truly
nothing else but this, as I conceive, that they may so be one, that there may
be a perfect union. There is a twofold perfection, a perfection of parts, and
a perfection of degrees. The first of these is specially intended here, that
there may be a perfect union in regard of parts, that is, that all the parts
that should be joined may be joined together: Therefore am I in all of them,
says Christ here, and thou in me that am in all of them; I in them, and thou
in me, that they may be perfect in one; that there may be such a union, to
which no part that should be joined is wanting, so that there can be nothing
added to it (in regard of parts at least) to make it more consummate and
complete.

If I were not in them (though they were never so indissolubly joined among
themselves) that would not be a perfect union; for there would be Christ
wanting. If thou were not in me as Mediator (though I were never so
indissolubly joined to them) that would not be a perfect union neither; for
there would be God wanting. And therefore I in them (says Christ) I have been
in them that did believe, I am in them that do believe, and I will be in them
that shall believe to the end of the world. And thou in me: thou have been,
art, and wilt be still in me; that they may be perfect in one; That they may be
so one, that there may be a perfect union.

You see the meaning of the words, as far as I have attained. There might be
many things observed, which have been diverse times insisted on from other
places. The doctrine proper to the Text is this.

DOCTRINE. That the perfection of believers union stands in this, that even as
they are one among themselves, so God and Christ, or God in Christ is one with
them. This is that which makes it perfect.
There are three things required, you see, to this perfection, and all of them
apparently suggested in the Doctrine and the Text. First, Gods being one with
Christ, being in Christ as Mediator, thou in me. Secondly, Christ's being one
with true believers, being in believers, I in them. Thirdly, believers being
one among themselves, or each with other, that they may be one: And when all
these are joined together, then there is a pefect union, perfect in regard of
parts; there can be nothing added to it. I in them, and thou in me, that they
may be perfect in one.

For clearing of this, my Brethren, you must know that it has been the project
and design of God from everlasting, that all believers shall be joined among
themselves, and joined to Christ as Mediator, and in and through Christ as
Mediator, to himself: That Christ who is the middle party between God and men,
God in Heaven, and men on earth, should reconcile, and reconciling join things
in heaven and earth together; That in the dispensation of the fullness of time,
he should gather into one all things in heaven and earth together in himself,
Ephesians. 1.10. So that till all these things be joined together, it cannot be a
perfect union, because all things are not united, that are appointed to be
joined together. I shall a little touch upon them in their order.

1. That there may be a perfect union, perfect in regard of parts, believers
must be joined together all of them among themselves: As long as one believer
by Election, is without, and is not gathered in to Jesus Christ (for in him
they are knit together) it is not a perfect union, because there is a member
wanting. The body mystical remains imperfect, in regard of integrals, as the
Holy Ghost insinuates, Ephesians. 4.13. And hence (says the Apostle) we without
them cannot be made perfect, Heb. 11. ult. We without them, are members, in a
sense, of an incomplete body: But when all are once come in, when all, both
Jews and Gentiles come in the unity of the Faith, unto the knowledge of the Son
of God, then he is a perfect man (conceive it in his mystical Body) then is the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: And therefore says our
Savior, I in them, that they may be perfect in one: As I have been in them
that did believe, and as I am in them that do believe, so I will be in them, in
all of them that shall believe to the end of the world. And of these last
especially he speaks, as is apparent by the scope; Neither pray I for these
only, says our Savior, (for these only that believe) but for them also which
shall believe on me through their word; for them, and all of them; I in them,
in all of them; as I have been and am in all that do believe, so I will be in
all that shall believe, even to the worlds end: That all believers being joined
together, past, present, and to come, there may be a perfect union; That they
may be perfect in one, That is the first thing.

2. That there may be a perfect union: as believers must be joined together,
all of them among themselves: so Christ must be united to them all; he must be
in all of them, as you have it in my Text; For God has given him to be the
Head over all things to the Church, Ephesians. 1.22. over all things of the Church,
or that are members of the Church; And it is the Fathers pleasure which he has
purposed in himself, That in the dispensation of the fullness of time, he might
gather together in one, all things in Christ, Ephesians. 1.10. so that if all
believers could be gathered into one among themselves, and not into one in
Christ, that would not be a perfect union, because they are appointed to be one
in him; If all the members of the body mystical, could be completely joined
among themselves, and not united unto Christ their Head, that would not be a
perfect union, because God has appointed him, and given him to be their Head:
The joining of the members all together, you will say, will make but an
unperfect and a maimed body, unless the Head be joined to them.

3. That there may be a perfect union, as believers must be one among
themselves, and Christ must be one with them: so God must be one with Christ,
and in and through Christ with them. I mean with Christ as Head and Mediator of
the Church. Indeed the end for which Christ took upon him the Office of a
Mediator, was to join God and man together, who were divided by the fall:
Therefore God sent him down into the world, that he might be in Christ
reconciling the world unto himself, 2 Cor. 5.19. Now suppose Christ could
reconcile believers each to other, suppose that he could reconcile them and
unite them to himself as man: if he could not reconcile them and unite them
unto God, this were an unperfect union, there were a great defect in it. Where
God, my Brethren, is left out, it is a very poor conjunction: And therefore God
is in Christ reconciling the world of believers, that while Christ reconciles
them to himself, he may eadem opera reconcile them unto God, who is in him,
that so the union may be perfect, and there may be nothing wanting, as you have
it in my Text; I in them, and thou in me, thae they may be perfect in one.

Now, is it so that the perfection of believers union stands in this, that one
mind, as the Holy Ghost speaks, Apoc. 17.13. they seem to be as firmly joined
together in a bond of love, as it is possible for men to be. But God and Christ
are not united with them, they are out of this conjunction: Nay my Beloved,
they are so far from being one with them, that indeed they are against them.
This is a most unhappy and accursed union. I wish all such would think upon it,
who are as Simeon and Levi, brethren in iniquity, who are confederate against
God, as David speaks, Psalm. 85.5. who set themselves and take counsel together
against the Lord, and against his Christ, Psalm. 2.2. who combine themselves
together, to oppose the truths of God, the ways of God, the servants of God,
the glory of God, to do such things as are contrary to God. Is God and Christ
in their confederation? Do God and Christ join with them, and combine together
with them? They are all one among themselves; touch one and touch all: but is
God and Christ one with them? Why, they are against God, and therefore
certainly God is not with them, but against them, and that is a sad union.

The peace, and friendship, and confederacy of such, is like the tempering of
iron, brass and clay together, that will by no means soder or unite; The knot
will certainly untie at last, the union will dissolve, if God and Christ be not
engaged in it: And as the Hebrews note of the name of man and wife, Ish, and
Ishah, that if you take away the letters (...) and (...) which make the Name of
God, there remains nothing else but Esh, and that is fire the fire of discord
and dissension: So certainly if God be out of any union, yea let it be as near
as that of man and wife, which is one of the nearest in the world, there will
be fire among the parties to it, the fire of jealousy and rage, that will
devour them and destroy them in the end: And it will prove like the unhappy
combination between Abimelech and them of Shechem, concerning which the Holy
Ghost foreshewed, Judge. 9.20. that fire should come out of Abimelech and devour
the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; And fire should come out from the
men of, Shechem, and the house of Millo, and devour Abimilech.

etc. Then truly they have cause to bless the Lord that he is pleased to unite
with them; to be one with such worms as they are, and so to make the union
perfect. Ah, my Beloved, if God did not join with you, if he stood aloof from
you, what would your Union or Communion each with other profit you, or comfort
you? what would it do without God? But seeing God and Christ are in you, seeing
they are one with you, this is indeed a perfect union, (all are joined that
should be joined) this is a happy and a heavenly Conjunction. O my Beloved, I
beseech you labor so to walk, that God and Christ may not withdraw from you.
It Is true, I must confess, he never really and totally and finally forsakes
those in whom he dwells: but he forsakes them sensibly, so that he seems to be
no more with them: and therefore let it be your study and endeavor, to walk so
humbly and so holily, that God and Christ may still delight to dwell with you,
and to dwell in you, and to show themselves to you, that you may know that they
are with you. Be sure you never join in any business, in which they will not
join with you: Be sure you never venture upon any action that will provoke them
to withdraw from you: Oh, do no wicked, no unclean thing that may offend the
holy God: Allow no evil in your hearts, that may make his being in you
uncomfortable and unpleasing to him. Do not defile the Temple that he dwells
in, least you cause him to resolve, as once he did in reference to Israel, Hos.
5. ult. I will go and return to my place, I will stay no longer with you.

And thus of the Second Argument with which our Savior prosecutes his suit,
which has been taken from the end at which he aimed in giving them the glory
which he had received from God the Father.

And likewise of the third, which has been taken from the end of Christ's
inhabitation in believers, and of the Fathers inhabitation in himself, I in
them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one.

A fourth is added in the following words, That the world may know that thou
have sent me. But that is but a repetition of the very same that has been used
in the 21. ver. and in the very same words. Only this difference there is, in
that knowing here is put for believing there: For there it is that the world
may believe, and here it is that the world may know, etc. To show that Christ
intends not justifying faith in that expression, but such a knowledge or
acknowledgement of his being sent from God, as the very world themselves, who
never did, nor never shall believe, are capable of: And in that sense I handled
it in that place.

I shall not here insist again upon it, but pass to the fifth Argument, with
which our Savior prosecutes the self same suit. And it is taken from another
fruit that it would have in worldly men: It would convince them that believers
are exceedingly beloved of God. If they observed them to live in nearest unity
and peace together, they would be persuaded thence that they were very much in
Gods favor; That they may be perfect in one, that the world may believe that
thou have sent me, and that thou have loved them as thou have loved me. So that
here I might observe:

DOCTRINE. That it is an apparent evidence of Gods love, when true believers
live in unity and peace together.
It is a sign he bears a singular regard to them, when he makes and keeps them
one among themselves; yea, it is such a sign of Gods love, as worldly men who
have but half an eye to see, will mark and take special notice of. Let them be
one, says our Savior in my Text; why so? That the world may know that thou
have loved them: If they be knit together in holy indissoluble love, the world
will see, and be satisfied thereby, that they are much in thy affection, and
that thou have a very dear regard to them.

And hereby you may see, my Brethren, That the world may know that thou have
loved them; but that thou have loved them as thou have loved me. This out of
question is a truth in some sense, or else he would not have the world to know
it; How it must be understood, I shall show you by and by; In the mean time the
point is this.

DOCTRINE. That God the Father loves believers, even as he loves Christ himself.
This is much, I must acknowledge: And yet you see it is the clear express
assertion of the Text; Thou have loved them, says Christ, even as thou have
loved me. To make way to the opening of it, this must be premised as a thing to
be fore-known, that Christ must here be looked upon as Man and Mediator of the
Church: so he has been considered all along this prayer. Now under this
consideration, the Father loves believers, as he loves him.

But you will ask me, How, as he does him? what is the sense of that
expression? there lies the weight of all indeed, and therefore I shall lay it
open to you in a few particulars.

1. God the Father loves believers as really and truly, as he loves Christ; as
he has loved Christ, so he has also loved them. He has not loved Christ and
not them, but he has loved Christ and them. The one of them as well, that is,
as truly as the other. And even as all the love which he declares to Jesus
Christ is real, and from the very heart-root, (if I might express it so) so all
the love which he discovers to believers is of the very same stamp. It is a
love without dissimulation, in all respects as high and dear, and cordial, as
it seems to be.

2. God the Father loves believers everlastingly, even as he loves Christ. And
everlastingly he loves them upon both hands, a part ante, and a part post,
from everlasting to everlasting.

First, he loves believers from everlasting, even as he loves Christ; for as
the time cannot be mentioned (look back as far as you are able) wherein the
Father did not love the Son; so neither can the time be mentioned, wherein he
did not love believers. You know Election was from everlasting, and therefore
love must be from everlasting too, which is indeed the Cause and Fountain of
Election, as Ephesians. 1.5. Having predestined us to be his children in Christ
Jesus according to the good pleasure of his will: You see Election flows from
the good pleasure of the will of God, that is, not only from that pleasure of
his will which in it self is good; for so does Reprobation too; but from the
pleasure of his will which is good to us his creatures. It issues from his
love, that is, his free and undeserved favor: So that you see he bears good
will to true believers, even in the instant of Election, which is from all
Eternity, and so by consequence, before they have a being in the world. And
this he does in Christ, as the Apostle shows, Ephesians. 1.3. he chooses us in
Christ. In the first place he chooses Christ, and then he chooses us in Christ.
He loves and chooses him first, as Man and Mediator of the Church, and then he
loves and chooses us in him, with the same love with which he loves him.

Secondly, God the Father loves believers to everlasting, even as he does love
Christ; as he does never cease to love Christ, so he does never cease to love
them: His love to them is like his love to Christ himself, immutable, he never
alters it, nor takes it off again. The Mountains may depart, and the Hills may
be removed, but his kindness shall not depart from his people: neither shall
the Covenant of my peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy upon thee,
Isa. 54.10. No, it is an everlasting kindness, ver. 8. an everlasting love,
Jer. 31.3. A mercy that endures for ever, Psalm. 106. So that as he loves
Christ from the beginning to the end, so he loves believers too; He loves them
in this respect even as he loves him.

But has not God been very angry, and displeased with those whom he has
seemed to love in former times? have they not most bitterly complained of it?
as the Church, Lament 5. ult. where she concludes her discourse though not her
misery with this woeful Epilogue, But thou have utterly rejected us, thou art
very wrath against us. And how then shall we take it for a truth, that God does
never cease to love believers, as he does never cease to love Christ?

True it is, the Lord is many times offended with believers, Sol.
as he was with Christ himself. He was offended with our Savior for believers
sins: he is offended with believers, for their own sins. Iniquity, wheresoever
he finds it, whether by imputation, or commission, makes him angry.

But you must know my brethren, that it is one thing to be angry with a person,
and another thing to hate him. Its true indeed that hatred cannot stand with
love, for it desires the not being of the object of it: but anger may consist
with it. And even as we are angry many times with those we love best, and who
are infinitely dear to us, so God was angry with his dearest Son, and he is
angry with his dearest Saints, and with his best beloved people: and yet his
love is firm, and constant, and unalterable to them notwithstanding, as will
appear if you consider, First the shortness, Secondly the fruits of this anger.
First, Gods anger with his people is no lasting anger. There is so great a
mixture of love and kindness and compassion in it, that it is overcome again
upon a sudden, it is very quickly gone. Indeed his anger to the wicked, is an
anger like his love to his people, everlasting: They are a people with whom the
Lord is angry for ever. But his anger to his people is but short: It is but
little, and that little is nothing, it is but for a moment, Isa. 54.8. and that
is recompensed with everlasting kindness too. In a little wrath have I hid my
face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy en
thee. Its true that David said in his distress, that God had cast him off, and
that his love and mercy was clean gone for ever. But he corrects himself again
in his advised and deliberate thoughts, and ingenuously confesses that he spoke
the former in his haste, Psalm. 31.22. and that the latter was his infirmity,
Psalm. 77.10. Secondly, as for the second, the effects of Gods anger are such as
relish strongly of his love to his people: They are not such as he is wont to
show on reprobates and vessels of wrath: They are not rigorous punishments to
satisfy his justice, but loving chastisements to hinder and prevent the
execution of it. For when they are afflicted, they are (not punished in
propriety of speech, but) chastned, and that to this end, that they may not be
condemned, 1 Cor. 11.32. They are not such as fit them for destruction and
border on damnation, as those which he inflicteth on the wicked, such as are
given up to strong delusions, and to vile affections, and leaveing them to the
hardness of their hearts to walk according to their own counsels; but such as
make them fit for the inheritance with Saints in light, and work out for them,
a far more exceeding and transcendent weight of glory.

God is love, 1 John 4.16. so that if any ask Whether God love believers as
much as he loves Christ? I answer, there are no degrees in that which is
infinite. He loves believers out of measure, beyond measure, and just so he
loves Christ.

Indeed there are degrees in the effects and declaration of the love of God;
and this way it is certain, God has showed more love to Christ then he does to
true believers; and yet they share together with him in most of these
expressions of his love to him; They share together with him in his grace; of
his fullness they receive, and grace for grace; They share together with him in
his glory, as I showed you very lately; And as his glory is eternal, so is
theirs, an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory.

Isa. 42.1. why so he loves believers too. Does he love Christ as his servant?
so he loves believers too. Does he love Christ as his Son? so he loves
believers too. Nay to go beyond Relations, does he love Christ as himself,
because he is one with him? so he loves bevers too, for they are one with him
in Christ. So that you see it plain enough that God the Father loves believers
even as, etc. And it must needs be so. For,

Cor. 12.12. are both involved and wrapped up together in the same love. He loves
them not asunder but together, and therefore certainly, he does not love them
differently (as to the kind of the affection) but alike. Christ is his beloved
Son in whom he is well pleased; not with whom he is well pleased, but in whom
he is well pleased with all that are in him, and that are members of his body.
Whom he loves, he loves in him, and therefore whom he loves, he loves as him,
even as he loves him.

Christ to them; in the first place he love Christ, and then he loves them
through Christ; so that is the same (for kind at least) wherewithal he loves
Christ. He is the way from God to us, the pipe the mean, conveyance between God
and us, and that which he receieveth from the Father, (as Head and Mediator of
the Church) he conveyeth down to us: The very same and no other. The same grace
which he receives from God the Father for himself and all his members, he
conveyeth down to them. The same glory which he receives from God the Father,
he bestows on them, as I have showed you: And so the same love which comes
flowing from the Father into him, he carries down to them too; By which it is
apparent, that God loves believers even as he loves Christ.

JOHN. 17.23. And thou have loved them as thou have loved me.


AND thus far we came on the last occasion, by way of explication of the Point.
Proceed we now to the Application of it, according to the branches of the
explication in their order.

Is it so that God the Father loves believers as really and truly as he

Is it so that God the Father loves believers as really and truly as he
pretended love; that would be an ill requital. We all profess a great deal of
affection to the Lord, we say we love him: but if he should examine us, and
sift us man by man, as once our Savior did Peter, Love thou me? do thou
love me? do thou indeed? could we reply with him Oh Lord thou know that we
love thee; Thou know that our hearts are right to thee. If God should ask
us, as Jehu did Jehonadab, 2 Kings 10.25. Is thine heart right as my heart is
with thy heart? can you reply, as he? It is. So you may think indeed, and yet
you may decieve your own souls. The Apostle speaks of some who love the Lord in
sincerity, Ephesians. 6.24. by which he intimates that there are some who do not so,
who love him hypocritically, not sincerely; whose love to God is like the love
of many to their brethren, in word and in show, not in deed and in truth: and
therefore it concerns us to examine whether the love we bear to God, be (...),
without dissimulation, yea or no, as the Apostles phrase is, Romans 12.9. And
thus far of the Application of the Point, in reference to the first branch of
the Explication of it: Proceed we to the second.



And therefore do not fear of falling from the love of God, though you have
many failings, many imperfections in you; do not doubt that they will cause the
Lord to hate you. No, no, the love of God is large enough to cover a multitude
of them, and none of them shall separate you from the love of God which is in
Christ Jesus our Lord, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 8.39. Observe it well, it is
a love in Jesus Christ; he loves us in loving Christ, as being part of Christ;
we are involved and wrapped up together with him in the same love: so that if our
infirmities should separate us from the love of God, they must separate Christ
with us. If God and we part, God and Christ must part too. Oh think on this, my
brethren, when your fears of losing Gods favor are most prevailing with you,
and have greatest power upon you. This take for all, and rest upon it, he can
no sooner cease to love you, then you can cease to love Christ.

Does God the Father love believers infinitely even as he loves Christ?

When penal miseries are desperate and extreme, when they are very sore upon
you, that you know not what to do, Think with your selves, Is it a likely thing
that God will suffer you to perish or miscarry? the God that loves you
infinitely even as he loves Christ himself? Indeed if he did love you only with
an ordinary love, you had some color then to doubt, that he might be
regardless of you. But since he loves you so unmeasurably, as he does, how can
you think that he will stand and see you sink away to ruin, and not stretch
out his hand to save you? Suppose Christ were in your case (if it were to be
supposed) that he were brought to such an exigent as you are, how tender would
the Father be of him? how would his bowels yearn upon him? how would he hasten
to relieve him? What is it thou, says God, that are brought to such distress?
and art thou likely to be ruined and undone? what thou my dear and pleasant
child, my own beloved son? Alas, I pity thee, I melt upon thee, I will help
thee presently, I will not see thee to continue long in such misery as this is.
Why my beloved, just as God would deal with Christ in such a case, even so will
he deal with you; for he loves you, even as he loves him.

So when your sins lie heavy on you, and you are even afraid that God will
never pardon you, your provocations are so many and so great, you vex him every
day, and every hour without ceasing: you do not give him any breathing time:
and therefore you are apt to think sometimes, his patience will be out at last,
and you shall pay for all together. Indeed my brethren, if his love were but as
the love of man, you had ground enough to fear it. For who is able always to
forgive injuries without number, and without measure? But since his love is
infinite, and there is no end of it, it cannot be too narrow, and too scant for
you. What may you not expect from an infinite love? Oh my beloved, I beseech
you, do not limit it, do not set bounds to it: do not think thus far the love
of God may cause him to forbear us, and forgive us, but beyond this it will not
go. Ah my beloved, if you be humble and believing souls, it is a bottomless and
boundless love to you: it will go beyond all that you can think, further then
you are able to imagine. And therefore do not cast away your confidence, but
roll your selves on this unmeasurable love of God in all cases. Your sins are
finite: that is infinite: your sins have limits: that has none.

Does God the Father love believers, under the same relations as he loves
blessed privileges and carries high things in it, as I shall show you in their
order.

Saul and Judas. But he chose Christ out of a special and peculiar love, never
to be reversed again. And just so he chose us in and by and through Christ, out
of the very same love, and with the very same intentions (in reference to
revocation) that he chose Christ. And what will God cast away his people, whom
he has foreknown from everlasting? whom he has chosen in his Son Christ,
before the foundation of the world was laid, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 1.4.
No, no; his choice of us, is as unalterable as his choice of Christ himself.
And when he casts away Christ, then and not till then (my brethren,) will he
cast away us.



1. He will uphold us, as he did uphold Christ. A Master will uphold his
servant in any business or employment that he sets him about: Especially a
servant that he loves. So did God uphold Christ, and he seems to glory in it,
and to call us to observe it, Isa. 42.1. Behold my Servant whom I uphold; I am
resolved to bear him out, meddle with him he that dare. Indeed when the
appointed time was come, he gave him up to suffer what he had designed him to.
But in the interim, he bore him out, so that no projects, no attempts could
take against him; they could not seize upon him, they could not hurt him (says
the Gospel story) because his hour was not yet come. Even so will God uphold
us, until our hour be come too. For we are servants whom he loves even as he
loved Christ. And as he is a loving, so he is an all-sufficient and almighty
Master, as he said to Abraham, when he took him to be a Covenant-servant to
him, Genesis 17.1. And therefore he will be not only a reward, but a shield to his
servants; a shield and an exceeding great reward, as his own expression is,
Genesis 15.1. A reward for their salvation, and a shield for their protection.

2. God will assist us in his service, as he did assist Christ. Christ had a
piece of work you know in hand that was very difficult, so that he sweat, and
that not ordinary sweat, but drops of blood trickling down upon the earth. Yea,
more then so, he fainted, while he was about it: But God his Master that
employed him, took a special care of him, and sent an Angel down from heaven of
purpose to comfort him, and strengthen him, Luke 22.43. And when as man he
feared how he should hold out and how he should go through with the business
(as to any self sufficiency as a Creature) and so wept and cried to God, he had
a very sweet return as you may see, Heb. 5.7. When in the days of his flesh he
had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him
that was able to save him, he was heard in that he feared.

Just so does God support us in the work he calls us to; for we are servants
whom he loves, even as he loved Christ. If he perceive the service that we have
in hand, to be too difficult and hard for us, then in comes God, and puts his
own hand to the work. What, can thou not go through with it? Come let me help
thee, says the Lord. It is observed of the Levites, that God helped them, 1 Chronicles. 15.26. And the Apostle tells us, that the spirit helps our
infirmities, Romans 8.26. he stands against us, and bears up the burden with us.
So that the weakest servants of the Lord need not fear the hardest service, or
the heaviest burden, when he has such a one to help him, and when those
everlasting arms are underneath him, as the Prophet speaks, Deuteronomy. 33.27. What
said the Lord to Paul, when he was hard bestead, and when he was about to
faint? My grace is sufficient for thee. And this made Paul to say, I can do all
things through Christ that strengthens me, Phil. 4.13.

3. Out of this love, God will reward us for the service that he enables us to
do, as he did reward Christ. As soon as he had done his work, he had his wages
down upon the nail, for he was heard in that prayer, John 15.4. I have
glorified thee upon earth, I have finished the work which thou gave me to do:
and now Oh Father glorify me with thy self. And so as soon as we have ended
and dispatched the business that God has put into our hands, we shall receive
our own reward according to our own labor. Having had the fruit to holiness,
we shall receive the end eternal life. If we be faithful to the death, we
shall receive the Crown of life, Apoc. 2.10. If we continue in the Vineyard to
the Evening, we shall have our penny. If we hold out to the period of our
lives, when we shall come to dye, we may conclude with God, as Christ does in
the forealledged place, We have glorified thee on earth, we have finished the
work which thou gave us to do: and now O Father glorify us with thy self;
and we may sing our dying Song with the Apostle, 1 Timothy 4.7. We have fought a
good fight, we have finished our Course: henceforth there is laid up for us a
Crown of righteousness which God the righteous Judge will give us.

Does God the Father love believers as his Children, even as he loves Christ?
does he affect them under that relation too, and that as he does

1. He will hear them as he does hear Christ. You know it is but ask and have,
with Christ. Thou art my Son, says God the Father to our Savior, Psa. 2.6.
this day I have begotten thee. And what follows? Ask of me and I will give
thee. And this is that which Christ himself acknowledges, John 11.42. Father, I
thank thee because thou have heard me. Yea so he might in that particular, and
yet he might deny him in another. But mark what follows presently, and I know
thou hear me always. Thou art my Father, and I am thy Son, and hence it is
that thou art so inclinable to hear me, to let me have my own asking. Even so
will God hear us in every thing that we desire according to his will, for we
are Children also whom he loves, even as he loves Christ. And therefore as it
was but ask and have with Christ, just so it is with us too. Ask and it shall
be given you, Mat. 7.7. And that because he is our loving Father, as he is
Christ's. Our heavenly Father will undoubtedly give good things to them that ask
him.

2. He will provide for us, as he does for Christ. You know he has provided
well for Christ. He is not his Son only, but he is his heir too. Yea, he has
made him heir of all things, Heb. 1.1. Why just so he has done by us, for we
are children whom he loves even as he loves Christ. As Christ is his Son and
Heir, so we are heirs of God through Christ, Gal. 4.17. Joint heirs with
Christ, Romans 8.17. Not heirs divided and apart from Christ, but joint with
Christ. And even as Christ is heir of all things, so we are heirs of all things
too. All is ours, and we are Christ's, 1 Cor. 3.21. A man can have but earth and
heaven: and we are heirs to both in Christ: The meek shall inherit the earth,
says the Psalmist, Psalm. 37.11, etc. And as we are heirs to earth, so we are
heirs of heaven too, and that by virtue of our Sonship: we are begotten to it,
as the Apostle speaks 1 Pet. 1.3. He has begotten us to an inheritance, etc.
So that the child of God you see engrosseth all: earth is his, and heaven is
his, and nothing else remains for other men but hell only. Oh the unutterable
happiness of those whom God the Father loves even as he loves Christ! he gives
his own Son nothing but they have a share with him.

And thus far of the first main thing which Christ desires of God the Father in
the behalf of true believers, that they may be all one: Which suit he
prosecutes with many arguments, as you have heard. The second follows now in
order to be handled, and this is, that they may be all in one place. They may
be one by such an union as our Savior means (a spiritual and a mystical union)
though they be in diverse places. But Christ is not content with this, you see;
he will not only have them to be all one, but he will have them also to be all
in one place, the same place where he is. Father, I will that they also whom
thou have given me, be with me where I am, etc.

And here you may take notice with me of these two particulars. First, the
manner how our Savior Christ propounds this suit of his: And then the matter
of it, or the suit it self. First the manner how our Savior here propounds
this suit of his, and that is boldly and confidently, as you see: Father, I
will: he says not, as in other places, Father, I pray, or I desire, or I
beseech thee and entreat thee, that it may be thus: but I will have it to be
thus. No more but so, Father, I will, that they whom thou have given me.
Secondly, And then you have the matter of the suit which he propounds, the
thing which he will have to be, That they also whom thou have given me be with
me, where I am.

Begin we with the manner, how our Savior here propounds this suit of his,
confidently as I said, Father, I will.

I shall not hence conclude (as Austin did sometimes against the Arrians) the
Sons equality with God the Father, because he speaks in such a peremptory
manner to him, if I may express it so, Father, I will, or elsesaith he, he
would have spoken in a supplicating and entreating, not in a willing and
commanding way. That Christ as God is equal with the Father, is a certain
truth, and manifestly to be proved from other Scriptures: But certainly it is
not to be gathered hence: for in this Chapter all along he speaks as man, and
as man he is inferior to the Father. And therefore usually before, he says, I
pray, or I entreat, he speaks in a submissive way, though here he uses such a
term as seems to to carry more authority, Father, I will.

Now since, he speaks as man and mediator, as that is very evident, we must
understand him here in such a way as is agreeable to Christ in that capacity,
and under that consideration. And consequently that he does not here
imperiously require of God the Father: and yet upon the other side, he does so
express himself, as being very confident that he shall have his own pleasure,
and that his will shall surely carry it with God the Father, without any
contradiction. If he will it, it is done without any more ado. Father, I will
have it so, and there is an end. And so accordingly the point shall be.

DOCTRINE. The will of Christ as Mediator, is as it were a law with God the
Father, or Christ may have even what he will of God the Father.
And therefore praying here that all believers might be together with him in
the same place, he says no more but this, Father, I will that they also whom
thou have given me be with me where I am: And this is that which Martha was so
steadfastly persuaded of, that Christ was sure to speed with God in any suit
that he would make to him: She had no doubt at all concerning this, as you may
see, John 11.22. I know, says she, that whatsoever thou will ask of God, God
will give it thee. Let it be what it will, God will not turn thee off with a
denial. And least you should conceive that this was but a groundless confidence
in her, you shall find it seconded by Christ himself, ver. 42. of the very same
Chapter, which puts it out of all question. If you survey the supplications
that he made while he was here upon the earth, you shall perceive what force
they had with God the Father. The Apostle Paul observes that he was very
earnest with him in a weighty business, Heb. 5.7. and what was the event and
issue of it? he was heard as it is added presently, no more but so, he was
granted out of hand. So in another place he prayed for Peter in a special
manner, that his faith might never fa^l, Luke 22.32. that it might not wholly
fail, so as to be quite lost, and utterly extinct in him. His faith was shaken
after this indeed, but it was not overthrown: it fainted, but it did not fail;
So that Christ had his full desire in that particular, I shall add no more for
proof: you see the will of Christ as Mediator is, etc. And there are many
Reasons of it. For,

He is the Fathers own Son. And Fathers use to be indulgent to their Holy, once
the attribute of Righteous Father. But this is still the appellation that he
uses, and from which he never varies. If he call him any thing, he calls him
Father: And therefore he presumes much upon him, because of this relation to
him, that he shall not be denied; he is the bolder, while he considers he is
speaking to a Father, as that is his expression in my Text it self; Father, I
will; Come, I must have my will in this particular, thou must not put me off
with a denial; for I am thine own Son.

This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. And that is a second reason,
why Christ may have even what he will of God the Father, because he bears such
dear affection to him: And this is intimated also in the Text it self, says
Christ, in the words mediately before, which we have even now dispatched, thou
have loved me, says he; and what follows? Father I will, q. d. I know thou
will let me have my will, because thou love me.

Ye know not what ye ask. But Jesus Christ is none of those sons; he never
fails in the least degree, in the matter or the manner of his prayers. He
never asks what he should not ask: he never asks what he should, in such a
manner as he should not. And that is a third reason, why he may have even what
he will of God the Father, because as he is a Son, and a beloved Son, so he is
such a Son as never asks any thing amiss; he never prays but just according
to his Fathers own will. His will as he is Man and Mediator, agrees in every
thing, and all respects with the will of God the Father; And therefore while
the Father lets our Savior have his will, he has his own; and if he should
not let him have his will, he should not have his own neither. We that are
adopted sons, are many times mistaken in the supplications that we make to God;
we do not ask according to his will; and hence it is, my Brethren, that he does
not always hear us. But Jesus Christ who is the Fathers own begotten Son, is
never at a loss in this respect. He never misses of conforming his desires to
his Fathers own pleasure; and hence it is that his Will is a law with God the
Father.

His Intercession, as Divines observe, is nothing else but the presenting of
his merits to the Father. And this is that which makes him bold and confident,
as you see him in my Text: Father, I will have it thus; That which I seek, I
have purchased with my blood, and therefore let me not be wronged, but let me
have what I have paid for. Father, I will that those whom thou have given me,
be with me where I am: q. d. Thou know that I have bought that place for
them, and I have satisfied thee for it, to the very utmost, and therefore I
will have them to be there, and I must not be denied.

Now is it so, my Brethren, that the will of Christ is as it were, etc.

Is it so, that the will of Christ, etc. why then, if we have any suit

But how shall we make Christ to be our Spokesman, and our Advocate in all
supplications that we make to God? I will give you two directions.

1. We must walk by his Rule, the Rule that he would have us guide our prayers
and our supplications by. We must be sure to put up such petitions, and none
but such as are agreeable to his will. For as the Father will not grant the
suit that is not suitable to his will: if we ask any thing according to his
will he hears us, otherwise he does not: so Christ will not take the suit that
is not suitable to his will. And to say truth, that is the reason why the
Father does not grant it, viz. because the Son does not present it and pursue
it; for if he do, it never fails of audience or success. If Christ undertake it
once, his Father never puts it off with a denial. His will is as it were a Law
with God the Father.

Brethren, our Savior is not such an Advocate as pleads for fees, and
undertaketh any thing that any Clyent puts into his hands; No, what he likes,
and what he has a mind to, he pursues and prosecutes with God the Father, and
never leaves till he obtain a grant from him; but if he mislike the suit, if it
agree not with his mind, or will, he never speaks a word in it, and then it
never speeds with God. For as the Father grants all that Christ desires, so
he denies all in which he does not show himself an Intercessor. If Christ the
Mediator do not own it, the Father never gives assent to it. And therefore he
must be engaged and interested in every suit we make to God, by framing it
agreeably to his will.

2. We must act by his Spirit, who knows his mind as the Apostle tells us, 1
Cor. 2.11. and what will surely take and relish with him. Beloved, if the
Spirit draw up the Petition, Christ will present and follow it, and get it
signed. But if the Spirit have no hand in it, Christ will have none neither. We
have two Advocates and Intercessors to the Father. An Intercessor or an
Advocate within us; an Intercessor or an Advocate without us: An Intercessor to
plead in us, and to plead by us; and an Intercessor to plead for us. In the
first sense, the Spirit is our Intercessor, so the Apostle calls him, Romans
8.20. In the Latter Christ only. Now these two Advocates or Intercessors are
agreed: you get not one of them without the other. Christ will not be your
Lawyer, unless you make the Spirit your Attorney. And as the Father never
grants that which Christ does not present and plead before him: So our Savior
never pleads that which the Spirit does not frame and draw up. If the Petition
which you tender be of the Spirits forming in you, Christ entertains and urges
it without any more ado, and so the Father gives assent to it.

If then you would have Christ to be your Advocate, you must engage him by his
Spirit; your Supplications and Petitions must be the voice of his Spirit in
your hearts; the Holy Ghost must raise and frame them there: you must take heed
they be not barely natural desires, as the Petitions of abundance are, which
seek for nothing else but that which nature craves for, on natural principles,
and for natural ends: And that they be not: only the voice of your own spirits,
but that they be the voice of Christ's spirit; and if Christ's Spirit make you
prayers, if he make Intercession in you with sighs and groans, Christ will make
Intercession for you, and then the Father will be sure to hear you: For if he
deny you, he must deny Christ too that pleads for you, and that he never does,
as you have heard. His will is as it were a law with God the Father, he may
have what he will of him.

JOHN 17.24. Father, I will that they also whom thou have given me.


AND thus far I proceeded on the last occasion, to discover to you how we may
have Jesus Christ to be our Spokesman, and our Advocate in all Petitions that
we make to God. We must walk by his Rule, and we must act by his Spirit.

But now because the thing is weighty, and of very great concernment, and it is
no easy matter for every one to judge and to determine, whether in his
supplications he walk by Christ's Rule, and act by Christ's Spirit: I shall give
you some directions in reference to both these. And in the first place, I shall
show you how you may discover, whether in the Petitions that you make, you walk
exactly by the Rule of Christ or no, whether you pray according to his will or
no.

And to this end, my Brethren, you must search the Scriptures in which the will
of Christ is manifested touching this as well as other points of duty. And then
compare your prayers with the Rule in all particulars, to see whether they
agree with it, or dissent from it; as the Apostle stirring up the Romans to
offer up acceptable service to the Lord, Romans 12.1. to this end in the
following verse advises them to prove and to find out what the will of God is:
the same advice I give you; See what the will of God and what the will of
Christ is, and then examine how your prayers suit with it: whether they be
framed and ordered by your own invention, or by his direction.

And here you must take notice what the will of Christ prescribes touching the
preparation to them; the matter, and the manner, and the ends of them; it
regulateth all these.

Well then, the first thing that you are to do, is to consider what the Be not
rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before
the Lord. Our hearts must be prepared to the duty, as the Prophet David's was.
And this consists in diverse things; I will name a few of them.

1. That our hearts may be prepared, they must be purged, they must be washed
and cleansed from every known sin. If thou prepare thine heart, says Zephar,
Job 11.13. which preparation is to prayer, as it is apparent by the following
words, and stretch out thine hands toward him. Well, if thou so prepare thy
self, what must thou do then? Why, If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far
away from thee, and let not wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacle, as it is added
in the next words. And hence, says David, If I regard iniquity in my heart,
any known iniquity, if I do not commit it only in my life, but regard it in my
heart, my heart is not fit to pray, the Lord will not hear my prayer, Psalm.
66.18. The promise of acceptance with him, is made to such, and none but such
as fear him, so far at least as to desire and to endeavor to depart from
evil; He will fulfill the desire of such as fear him, he also will hear their
cry and save them, Psalm. 145.19.

2. That our hearts may be prepared, they must be humbled, both in the sense of
the transcendent Majesty and Glory of the Lord, and of our unworthiness. We
must endeavor to possess them with an awful apprehension of the greatness of
the Lord, whom we are making our approaches to, that we may pray in reverence
and holy fear, according to the Psalmists exhortation, Psalm. 2.11. Serve the
Lord with fear, says he; and according to his practice and example, Psalm. 5.7.
in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy Temple. And hence the Saints in the
beginnings of their prayers, when they have buckled to the duty, have been wont
to set the Lord upon the Throne, and there to represent him in his greatness,
by reckoning up his glorious attributes: And then to vilify and to abase
themselves exceedingly before him: That they might bring their hearts by this
means to a frame and temper fit for prayer. In such a disposition was the heart
of the Centurion when he sought to Christ for mercy, Luke 7.6, 7. He did not
think himself worthy, that Christ should once come under his roof: And so the
prodigal that said to his Father, I am not worthy to be called thy son, Luke
15.21.

3. That our hearts may be prepared, they must be fixed. They must be settled
upon God, and on the words we utter to him. They must not rove and wander up
and down, as they are very apt to do. They must attend the business that they
are about. In such a disposition was the heart of David, when he was about to
praise the Lord; My heart is fixed O God (says he) my heart is fixed, I will
sing and give praise; Psalm. 57.7. There has been much talk of late concerning
fixing arms: but surely this of fixing hearts is the most necessary business.

4. That our hearts may be prepared, they must be awakened: they are naturally
dead and dull, and sleepy; especially at sometimes, by means of some corporal
or spiritual distemper. They cannot watch to prayer one hour, and though the
spirit is ready, yet the flesh is weak: And therefore we must quicken them, and
rouse them up from drowsiness, before we set about the duty; and while we are
in the performance of it, we must call upon our hearts as Deborah, Judge. 5.12.
Awake, awake Deborah, awake awake, utter a song. And as David on his Harp,
Awake Harp; so we, awake heart, I my self will awake early, Psalm. 108.2. You
see in brief, the Rule of Christ in reference to preparation. Now let us see
what he prescribes both for the matter, the manner, and the end of prayer.

the sacrifice of fools, as they are called, Eccles. 5.1. And God will never
look after them, nor show respect to them, as Elibu teaches us, Job 35.13.
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.



1. It is in the will of Christ that we pray without wrath; for so is the
express direction, 1 Timothy 2.8. I will therefore that men may pray everywhere,
lifting up pure hands without wrath. We must not come to God with hearts
distracted and disturbed with passion, but with composed, meek and quiet
spirits. It was the fault of James and John, who when a certain Town of the
Samaritans repelled Christ, and refused to receive him, would in a fit of rage
and anger, have prayed for fire to come down from heaven to consume them, Luke
9.54. And so when the malicious enemies of Christ, have done his cause or
people any great mischief, it may be we are ready in a heat to call for
vengeance out of heaven upon them. But if we pray in such a manner, we may look
for such a censure as James and John had in the fore-alleadged Text, Ye know
not what spirit ye are of; You think it may be you are zealous, but you are
very much mistaken; you are choleric and angry; you do know not the temper and
disposition of your spirits.

Brethren we must not go to prayer in a fit of anger, and a pang of discontent,
as it seems Eliah did, 1 King. 14.4. It is enough Lord, take away my life, for
I am not better then my Fathers: And as it seems Job did, Job 6.8. Oh that I
might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for;
Even that it would please God to destroy me, that he would let loose his hand
and cut me off: And as it is extremely probable that Moses did when he
conceived his burden was too heavy for him, Numb. 11.10, 15. For it is said he
was displeased, and in that angry mood, he said to God, Wherefore have thou
afflicted me? You see he calls the Lord to coram, to see how he can answer his
proceedings; Wherefore, etc. I am not able to bear all this alone: And if thou
deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of the way, and do not let me see my
wretchedness: And thus it is apparent Jonah did, who being crossed in a
punctilio, in a point of honor, out of a pettish childish humor, will go die,
God must take away his life: We must not come to God in such a temper, to empty
and disgorge our choler, and to vent our passions to him; No, Tempus
mansuetudinis, est tempus orationis. The time of meekness is the time of prayer.

2. It is the will of Christ that we pray without doubtings, and this is also
added in the Text before alleged, 1 Timothy 2.8. Pray, lifting up pure hands
without wrath or doubting. He would have us come to God with confidence and
strong assurance, as it beseems those to do who are indeed in Covenant with
him. You know a household servant, that is in Covenant with his Master, calls
confidently for his breakfast, and his dinner, and his Supper, whereas a
beggar or a stranger does not so. So he that is in Covenant with the Lord,
should come with boldness to the Throne of Grace, relying formerly on the
promises of God, as David did, I cried and I hoped in thy Word, Psalm. 119.147.
Lord, I want faith, give it me; I want patience, let me have it; I find my
heart is out of order, joint it, mend it, unite it to thy self.

It is for those that are without, and that are strangers to the Lord, that
live on nothing else but common providence, to come doubtfully to God, when
their distresses force them to his presence. But if those that are his friends,
and that are in Covenant with him, come in such a posture to him, he may justly
say to such, Why, what is the matter that you are so strange, and that you are
not bold with me, as you have wont to be? you shall fare near a whit the better
for coming to me after such a manner. And verily, my Brethren, unless we draw
nigh to God in faith well grounded on the promises, we can have no hopes to
speed in our petitions. He that would ask any thing of God, says the Apostle
James, chap. 1.6, 7, let him come in faith, nothing doubting. Otherwise let him
not think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.

3. It is the will of Christ that we pray with much zeal, that our Petitions be
not formal, cold and drowsy prayers, but that there be some heat and fervor
in them. You know the prayers of Gods people are compared to Incense, Psalm.
141.2. And Incense sends up no sweet savor till the fire come to it. It is the
fervent prayer only that is effectual with the Lord, as the Apostle teaches us,
Jam. 5.16. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. And
hence says David, Hear me, O Lord, and why so? I cry with my whole heart,
Psalm. 119.145. so runs the promise of the Lord to his people, Jer. 29.13. Ye
shall seek and find me when ye search for me with your whole heart. And thus
you see in brief what Christ prescribes for the manner of your prayers.



Now he will tell the Father, There is such a suit of such a member, such a
Saint of mine, I pray thee hearken to it, and dispatch it out of hand, for it
concerns me as well as him: Fain he would have more grace, but I assure thee
(for I know his heart) it is not to be proud, or to be lifted up himself, but
to lift up me with it, and to glorify my name. Poor soul he never thinks he
gloryfieth me enough, and therefore he would have more strength from thee to do
it. Thou see how I am interessed in this suit of his, and therefore I beseech
thee do not put him off, but answer him for my sake. It is thy great design to
glorify me in the world, and if thou will but give this Saint of mine more
grace, he will give me more glory. Come, let me set thy Treasure open, and give
him out a large share, for I my self shall be a gainer by it.

And thus far I have showed you, how we may have Jesus Christ to be our
Advocate in our Petitions. We must walk by his Rule, and pray according to his
Will, as I have laid it open to you, both in relation to the Preparation, and
the Supplication, both for the matter, manner, and the end. If thus we do, we
may be confident of the good word of Christ for us. But what if we fail in
this? I answer in a word, and so an end.



If we fail in the manner of our prayer, either it is a total failing, or a

If it be but a partial failing, and that failing strived against, and prayed
against, the case is very different. By Evangelical allay we do what we desire
to do, in Gods gracious acceptance: We pray in faith, if we desire to pray in
faith: we pray with zeal, if we desire to pray with zeal: We pray according to
the Will of Christ, if we desire to pray according to the Will of Christ, as to
the manner of our prayers. And if we pray according to his Will (but in such a
sense as this) Christ intercedes, and God hears. Our Advocate strikes in with
us, and begs his Father to regard the matter, and not the manner of our
prayers. He is an Intercessor for us to his Father, in reference to both these,
both to the thing desired, and the manner of desiring, that he would give the
one, and that he would forgive the other.

And thus far of the first sort of directions, how to judge whether in the
Petitions that we make we walk by the Rule of Christ or no. Proceed we to the
second sort, how to determine whither we act by the Spirit of Christ, or no.

If in our prayers we act by Christ's Spirit, there are some measures He shall
baptize you (says John the Baptist speaking of our Savior) with the Holy
Ghost, and with fire: that is, with the Holy Spirit, which is not like water
only, but like fire too, in those that are baptized with it; so that where the
Spirit is, there is an holy heat in those that are partakers of it, which shows
it self in prayer as in other duties. They are fervent in spirit serving the
Lord. And though their heat may be allaid and cooled sometimes, by outward
means, like water cast on this fire, yet still there is an inward striving and
disposition to be fervent. The Holy Ghost within them is like fire to this
incense: I mean the incense of their prayers. And though it may be smothered
sometimes that it cannot flame or burn up, either by afflictions, or
temptations, or desertions, yet it is never utterly extinguished in the Saints.
Although there be not flames perhaps, yet there are coals continually on the
Altars of their hearts, which though they may be raked in the ashes now and
then, yet at some other times they burn amain; Their hearts are hot within
them, and the fire kindles,

If we act by Christ's Spirit, our prayers are not purely natural, but spiritual
to the use of any means which it conceives may be effectual to such an end as
this is: So that this man for all his earnestness, may not act by Christ's
Spirit, but his own: as it is very manifest those wretches did, who when they
saw themselves environed round about with dangers, and thought that none but
God could help them, cried vehemently to the Lord, Exodus 14.10. and yet in the
succeeding verse it appears what they were: They show themselves in their own
colors.

But when a man is carried high in prayer upon such grounds and reasons as his
spirit naturally is not likely to suggest, because they do not any way concern
him as a natural man: as when upon the apprehension of some great dishonor
that will come to God, if such a thing should be denied, a man is much enlarged
and quickened in his prayers; yea, when his prayers are against his natural
desires; when he is earnest with the Lord in secret, to help him to pluck out a
right eye, or to cut off a right hand, to mortify, and curse, and kill those
lusts, and those corruptions which naturally are extremely dear to him, and
that upon such grounds and motives, wherein there is no self respect: When he
shall seriously and sincerely beg the Lord to give but a little wealth, a
little honor, if he perceive that more will do him spiritual hurt, that it
will puff him up and make him proud as Agur did, Give me not riches, feed me
with food convenient for me, left I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the
Lord? this man is like to act by Christ's Spirit.

spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, as the Apostle calls
them? Ephesians. 1.3. Is it a likely thing, my Brethren, that the Spirit should
make us struggle more for bodily and outward things, then for those things that
are more agreeable and suitable to it, more near to its own nature? I make no
question, David acted by the Spirit, in that Petition and request of his, Psalm.
4.6. There be many that will say, Who will show us any good? you must conceive
it, any temporal or worldly good; many that look after this: But this is that
which I desire, says he, Lord, lift upon me the light of thy countenance, and
when thou have done this, Thou have put gladness in my heart, much more then in
the hearts of worldly men when their corn and wine increases.

end of them. But now my brethren, on the other side, he that has not Christ's
spirit desires these outward blessings that he may consume them on his Lusts,
as the Apostle speaks, Jam. 4.3. Ye ask and receive not, because you ask amiss
that you may consume it upon your lusts; That you may make provision for the
flesh with it, and that it may be oil to nourish and to feed the sinful
flames that are within you.

And thus it is my brethren, with a multitude of men: they pray to God for some
thing to bestow upon their sensual appetite, to serve their carnal turns, to
satisfy their brutish and voluptuous pleasures and desires: They would be in
place and power, that they may raise their names and families, that they may
swell and swagger over their inferiors, that they may plague their enemies,
and pleasure those that are observant of them. They would have wealth and
riches in abundance, that they may swimm in full delights, and fare delitiously
every day. Agur measures the convenience or inconveniency of his outward state,
as it would fit him more or less for Gods service: Not poverty, least I deny
thee; not riches left I forget thee. But these men measure it by nothing but
their sensual appetite: and so their prayers serve their lusts, and they would
have God himself to serve them too, if they could prevail with him. And are
such desires as these, like to be raised by the spirit of Christ? what will the
spirit stir men up to pray for any thing to nourish and maintain the flesh, the
carnal part, which is the spirits enemy. The flesh lusts against the spirit,
and the spirit lusts against the flesh, for those two are contrary one to
another: And will the spirit notwithstanding strive for that which shall uphold
and feed those lusts against which the spirit lusts? Believe it brethren,
they that pray for any blessings to maintain their lusts with them, their
pride, intemperance, etc. do not act by Christ's spirit.

Object. But you will ask me then, How shall we know whether we pray for
blessings to consume them on our Lusts? how shall we discern that? I shall give
you some discoveries.

1. If you will observe and deal impartially and freely with your selves, you
shall know it by your thoughts. The end is first in the intention, and last in
execution: and therefore certainly the heart works much upon it. Now my
beloved, consider what runs often in your thoughts; when you are sick, and
pray for health and continuance of your lives, are your aims as David's were,
that you may praise and glorify the Lord among the living? Psalm. 6.5. as
Hezekiahs were? Loath he was to die, poor man: but wherefore was he so averse
from death? The grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate, Isa. 38.18.
Or do you feed your minds with nothing but preapprehensions of the carnal
pleasure and delight and satifaction you shall have when you recover. So when
you pray for outward things, do you entertain your spirits with pleasing dreams
of honor and ambition? by this you may discover what your aims are.

2. You shall discern it by the manner of your prayers, whether you pray for
blessings to consume them on your lusts, or no. If so, you will be absolute and
peremptory in your prayers. Carnal desires will make the spirit of a man
impetuous and impatient of denial. He that aims at satisfaction of his lusts,
will not be at Gods disposal, there will be no sweet submission to the will of
God. No, he must have this or that, and he cannot bear a check: as Rachel must
have children or she dies; when once the heart is set on any thing that serves
to feed a sensual appetite, whether it be the lust of the flesh, or the lust of
the eye, it is violently bent, and it must not be denied.

3. You shall discover it by the effect, I mean the use of those external
blessings which you pray for: you pray for health, you pray for riches and the
like, and you receive them at the hands of God, he gives you the desire of your
hearts in these things; Well now consider with your selves what use you put
them to when you have gotten them, and what bills you bring in. What, so much
health and so much strength bestowed upon the prosecution of your worldly and
ambitious projects and designs? so much means and so much time upon riot and
excess? Item, so much upon your pride, and so much upon your lusts, and so much
upon the satisfaction of your malice and revenge: so much upon Hawks and
Hounds, and Whores: but nothing upon God, his Cause, or his poor distressed
servants. Are these the bills that you bring in to God? and will you own them
in the latter day? Brethren, by your layings out you may discover to what
intent you have prayed for outward blessings, whether to consume them on your
Lusts, or no: And if that has been your end, the spirit has not been your
principle in these petitions.

Job observes of the Hyppocrite, who has not Christ's spirit, Job 27.10. Will
he delight in the Almighty? will be always call on God? No, he will be on and
off in this duty. Our spirits are unconstant and unstable, my beloved: but
Christ's spirit is (...) not so. And hence it is that they that pray by their
own spirits, are so uncertain in the duty many times. Sometimes their spirits
stir them up to pray, and sometimes they do not: Though there be differences in
this too: for some men's spirits naturally are more ready and more fixed then
others are: And there may be other things as fear and strong conviction and the
like that may hold some certain men almost to a continued practice of the
outward duty; yet it is very rare that he is constant who acts by his own
spirit.

But now my brethren, he that acts by Christ's spirit, is a steady man in
prayer: he can appeal to God as David does, Psalm. 40.9. I have not restrained
my Lips, Oh Lord, thou know. Christ's spirit dwells in him: he does not
sojourn in him for a time, but he dwells in him as in his fixed and his settled
habitation, and he dwells in him as a spirit of supplication; So the spirit of
Christ is called, Zech. 12.10. And hence it is that he is always putting him
upon the duty, upon all occasions, so that he is constant in it. Christ's spirit
is at home still, though ours be wandering many times, even to the other end of
all the earth. And though Christ's spirit seem to be given sometimes as a spirit
of consolation, yet then he will be present as a spirit of supplication: He
will set a Saint to prayer, even when he seems most indisposed and averse: he
will not suffer him to lay it by, and wholly to neglect the duty, as is
observable in David, I said that I am cut off from before thine eyes, says he,
Psalm. 31.22. Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my prayer. Even then I
prayed to thee when I was in that temper; so in another place, from the end of
the earth will I cry unto thee, even when my heart is overwhelmed, Psalm. 61.2.
And whence proceeds this my brethren? surely these prayers of all others flow
from Christ's spirit as the Apostle teaches, Romans 8.20. The spirit helps our
infirmities: We know not what to pray for as we ought, but then the spirit it
self makes intercession for us with sighs and groans that cannot be expressed.

If we act by Christ's spirit, we come to God as to a Father, we cry Gal. 4.6.
Because ye are Sons, says the Apostle, God has sent forth the spirit of his
Son into your hearts. And what does that spirit there? you have it in the next
verse, crying Abba Father. So that Christ's spirit, if he act in us, makes us
address our selves to God as to a Father. And that my brethren, carries two
things in it. This spirit makes us come to God with the expectations of
Children, and with the affections of Children.

1. If Christ's spirit act in us, he makes us come to God in prayer with
Child-like expectations. Expecting from him all the mercy, pity, and
compassion which a Child can look for from his own Father. He makes us to
approach the throne of grace with great assurance of audience and acceptance
and success there; commonly he does this.

2. But yet I must confess An hypocrite may sometimes have these expectations,
and a child of God may want them. The Jews had Child-like expectations, Jer.
3.4. they cried to God Thou art my Father, and wilt not thou that art my Father
pity me and help me? sure thou will; and yet they had no Child-like
affections, no care at all to please God, and therefore it is added in the next
words, that they said and did as evil as they could. But now my brethren he
that acts by Christ's spirit, as he has Child-like expectations, so he has
Child-like affections, or if at any time he want his Child-like expectations,
yet still he has his Child-like affections. Though he be in such a case that
he is verily persuaded for the present, that God will neither own him, nor
regard him, nor look upon him as a Son, yet he loves God still. He has a
Child's heart to God, even when he thinks that God has not a Fathers heart to
him. Though he seem to frown upon him, and to hide his face and to turn away
his prayers, yet he has dear affections to the Lord notwithstanding all this.
And this appears by the trouble he is in at God displeasure: it grieves him so
that he is sick of love, as the poor Church was, Cant. 2.5. when Christ
withdrew himself a while, this was her grief, I sought him whom my soul loves.
I will go into the City and seek him whom my soul loves. I said unto the
watchmen, Did ye see him whom my soul loves? And so when God withdraws himself
from such a one as is endued with his spirit, the very soul of such a person
loves him still: when he is very much afraid that he shall never find God more,
that God will never show him favor more, when he has lost his Child-like
expectations, yet still he maintains his Child-like affections.

JOHN. 17.24. That they also whom thou have given me be with me, etc.


AND thus far of the manner of our Saviors prayer. Proceed we to the matter of
it: And here we have the persons that he prays for, those whom thou have given
me: And then the thing that he desires in the behalf of those persons, that
they also may be with me where I am.

As for the persons whom our Savior prays for, you see they are described
here by the Fathers giving them to Jesus Christ. Let them be what they will in
all considerations and respects besides, it matters not in this, of what
Nation, Condition, Station, Disposition or Conversation for the present, if God
have given them to him, his will is that they be with him where he is.

But then we must distinguish as we have done before of the Fathers giving to
the Son. The Father gives men to the Son either for outward Ministration, or
inward union and incorporation; Either to be his servants, or to be his
members. In the first sense Judas was himself given to the Lord Christ, to be
his Minister and his Apostle, as Christ himself acknowledges, ver. 12. Those
whom thou gave me I kept, and none of of them is lost but the Son of
perdition. Now they who in this sense are given to the Lord Christ to be his
Ministers and Servants only, not his members, are not the men for whom he
prays in this place, that they also may be with him where he is: because he
knows they are appointed for another place. Judas was so bestowed upon him, and
yet he was a lost Creature. The Father gave him to the Son, and he lost him (as
you may see in the forecited Text) never to enjoy him more.

But now there are another sort whom God the Father gives to Christ for inward
union, whom he bestows upon him for to be members of his body. And they must
needs be with him, who are in him: And therefore out of question these are they
for whom he prays, Father, I will that they also whom thou have given me, be
with me where I am.

But where was Christ when he spoke these words? Why he was upon the earth: he
was here in the world: what then does he desire that true believers might be
with him here? Is that the aim of his petition? No, it is a higher thing for
which he is Suitor here, their being with him in a higher and more glorious
place. Only you must conceive him here to speak (as his usual manner is) as if
he were in heaven already. As ver. 11. of this Chapter, And now I am no more in
the world. So in my Text, Father, I will that they whom thou have given me be
with me where I am: That is, in heaven where I am to be, and whither I am now
going: So that it is as if I were already there, it being such a certain near
approaching instant thing: and in that place I would have all those to be, whom
thou have given me by election, and whom in thine eternal Counsel and Decree
thou have appointed to be members of my body. Father, I will, etc. So that the
Point to be observed is this.

DOCTRINE. It is the will of Jesus Christ that all that are his own by the
donation of the Father, shall be in heaven where he is.
There are two things in the Doctrine, which I might prove clear in order,
before I come to Application.

First, that there are some certain men, whom God the Father has made over to
the Son, that belong to Jesus Christ, and are his own by donation from the
Father.

Secondly, that it is the will of Christ, that they who are so his own, shall
be in heaven where he is.

There are some certain men who belong to Jesus Christ, who are his ver. 12.

Now for the second branch, that it is the will of Christ, that they Father, I
will that they whom thou have given me be with me where I am, that is, in
heaven where I am to be. In heaven where I am already in my Godhead, and where
I am to be very shortly in my Manhood; there I will have them to be also.

And for this end our Savior Christ is gone to heaven, even to make heaven
ready for his people, that so they may be presently admitted when they come. He
yields it as one special cause of his departure from his Apostles and
Disciples, when he was about to leave them; says he, I go to prepare a place
for you, Joh. 4.2. When he entered into heaven and passed in, to the immediate
presence of his Father, he took possession of it in our name and stead, and
left it open after him to all his members. He has in this respect prepared it
for them, that he has made it ready to receive them; And when they are ready
too, he will come and receive them to himself, that where he is, there may they
be also, as it is added, Joh 14.3. And upon this account it was that the
Apostle Paul desired to be dissolved, because he was assured that as soon as
that was over, he should be with Christ, Phil. 1.23. and so he teaches us
expressly in another place, that all that sleep in Christ Jesus, shall be for
ever with the Lord, 1 These. 4.17. By which it is apparent, that it is the will
of Christ, that all that are his own by the donation of the Father, shall be in
Heaven where himself is. But you will ask me, Why will he have them to be there?

To this I answer, that a man would think it necessary by reason of the union
between Christ and them, that seeing they are one, they should be in one place.
But you must know (my brethren) that the corporeal and local presence of the
parties contributes nothing to the union that is made between Christ and his
members, which is a spiritual and invisible thing, and which no neerness in
regard of place can further, no distance in regard of place can hinder. So that
Christ's people may be in him, though they be not with him (in the sense wherein
I speak.) I mean not with him in the same place. Their being with him locally
in heaven, is no way necessary to their union with him: Or were it so, the
Saints on earth were in a very ill case. Well then, this cannot be the reason
why Christ would have his people to be in one place with him: that they may be
one with him. They may be this without the other. But there are diverse other
weighty reasons of the Point: I shall name a few of them.



1. Christ would have his people be in heaven, where himself is, because he
loves them with a love of benevolence: With such a love as makes him with them
all the good that they are possibly capable of. Now my beloved, what greater
good can be wished to true Believers, then to be with Christ in heaven? To be
in heaven where they shall be absolutely and completely holy and happy, where
they shall never sin, and where they shall never suffer any more: where
holiness and happiness shall be both perfect: where there is fullness of joy and
pleasure for evermore: and to be with Christ there, of whose immediate prefence
true believers are inavoidably debarred as long as they remain in this world:
While they are at home in the body, they are absent from the Lord, as 2 Cor.
5.6. But when they come to heaven they shall be with him, they shall have the
complete and full fruition and enjoyment of him, which is the greatest
happiness that can be. To be with Christ is best of all, 1 Phil. 23. To be with
Saints on Earth is good, though they be imperfect here, and though by reason of
their imperfections they be the less delightful, and the less beneficial to
us: To be with Saints in heaven is better, because they are perfect there:
There are the spirits of just men made perfect: But to be with Christ there, is
best of all. This is so good that there is nothing better; there is no higher
happiness attainable by any creature. And therefore Christ would have his
people to enjoy it, to be in heaven where himself is, because he loves them
with a love of benevolence.

2. Jesus Christ would have his people to be in heaven where himself is,
because he loves them with a love of complacency, because he takes delight in
them: and friends that delight in one another, think it not sufficient to be
present each with other by the presence of their hearts and spirits. No, if it
be possible, they will be present each with other in their bodies too: as you
may see in Jonathan and David, what shifts they made to come together. So Jesus
Christ who loves his people out of measure, is not content that he is with them
in his spirit, and that they are again with him in their spirits. No, this is
not enough, but he must have their bodies with him too, he must enjoy their
company in heaven, or else it is not well there. Christ is not fully satisfied
till he enjoy the sweet Society of his beloved Saints in heaven, with whom he
has such intimate and dear acquaintance, while they are here upon earth. And
hence he beggs his Father for them to bring them to the same place where
himself is, as if he could not live in heaven without them, Father, I will
that, etc.

2. There is a second reason added in the Text, which I shall handle Father, I
will that they whom thou have given me be with me where I am. And why so? might
the Father ask him, Why that they may behold my glory, which thou have given
me, as it is added in the next words. That they may see the luster which I
sparkle with. The glory of Christ's humane nature in heaven, is exceeding great.
The Evangelist who saw it through the dimm spectacles of humane frailty,
endeavors as he can to set it forth: Says he, his Countenance was as the Sun
that shines in his strength. Apoc. 1.16. But this was but a short resemblance:
Our Savior Christ who knew it better, carries it a little higher: The Son of
man says he, shall come in the glory of the Father, Mat. 16.27. In comparison
of whose incomparable luster and transcendent brightness the Sun it self is but
a shadow: Now Christ would have his people be in heaven where himself is, that
they may see this glory which he sh nes withal. But why would he have them see
it? what shall they gain by it?

1. While they see it, they cannot but exceedingly rejoice in it. It cannot but
transport them even to an ecstasy of joy, to see him whom they love so
infinitely, sparkle forth with such dazzling rays of glory. Oh will the poor
believer say, This is my head, my husband whom my soul loves, that is become
so out of measure glorious. There was a time when he was black, and when there
was no form nor beauty in him, when wretched men made him vile and ignominious,
and when they hid their faces, as if they were ashamed of him: But now he
shines forth as the Sun that has been masked with a gloomy cloud. This is he
that died for me, that shed his blood for me, that loved me and gave himself
for me. Oh how my heart is ravished to behold his glory.

2. While they behold it, as they shall rejoice in it, so they shall partake of
it. And that especially two ways both by union and reflection.

First they shall partake of it by union, for being one with Jesus Christ, they
cannot choose but share together with him in his glory. And as the glory of the
members, redoundeth to the glory of the head, in which respect it is that the
Apostle says that, Christ shall be admired in all them that believe: So on the
other side the glory of the head, redoundeth much more to the glory of the
members.

Secondly, And as they shall partake hereof by union, so also by reflection,
when they see Christ: while they behold the glory of the Lord they shall be
transformed into the same image from glory to glory. Their vile bodies shall be
conformed to his glorious body, Phil. 3.21. And while they see him as he is,
they shall be like him, as the Apostle John insinuates, 1 Epist. 3.2. They
shall bear the very image of the heavenly Adam, 1 Cor. 15.48. And as the face
of Moses shined when he had been with God upon the Mount, so when we come to be
with Christ in heaven, and to behold his glory there, we shall reflect it back
again, and so shall shine together with him in the same glory.

And this is another reason why Christ will have his people to be with him,
that they may see his glory, and seeing, may partake of it, both by union and
reflection.

etc. Here then you see the singular and extraordinary happiness of Christ's
people. If they were always to remain, to set up their perpetual abode in this
world, it would be very sad with them: It is a vale of tears, a most
uncomfortable place, especially to Christ's people in which they are not like to
have a quiet hour almost as long as they remain in it.

But now the comfort is, that it is the will of Christ that they that are
bestowed upon him by his Father, shall not always stay here, that he will have
them come to heaven where himself is: That he will not always leave them in
this vale of tears, but he will one day bring them to a place of joy, there to
enjoy himself for ever: to keep no longer at a distance from him, but to be
with him where he is. To be with Christ in any place must needs be sweet. It
was a high expression of an holy man, that he had rather be in hell with
Christ, (if it were possible) then anywhere besides without him. But to be in
heaven with Christ, this is excellent indeed: To be in such a glorious place as
heaven is, the blessedness of which no tongue of men or Angels is sufficient to
express, and to be with Christ there: To behold his glory there, and to partake
with him of the same glory: This is such happiness as neither eye has seen,
nor ear has heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive.

But who shall partake of it? who shall be raised to this high felicity? why
they that are Christ's own people, as you have it in the point. It is the will
of Christ that all that are his own, shall be in heaven where himself is: So
that if you be Christ's people, if God have given you to Christ, and put you
into him as members of his body, you are the men that shall be with him where
he is. When other men are cast out, when they are punished with eternal
perdition from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, you
shall be admitted into nearest fellowship with Jesus Christ; when he says to
other men, Avaunt, be gone, in the sad day of separation, Depart ye cursed into
everlasting fire, there to enjoy no better company then the Devil and his
Angels, he will say to you Draw near, come, you are company for me, you must
dwell with me for ever. Come ye blessed of my Father, sit down with me in my
Kingdom. Ah, my beloved, this is a sweet and comfortable thing indeed.

And thus far of the matter of our Saviors prayer, or the thing which he
desires in the behalf of true believers, that they may be with him where he is.
Together with the reason of it why he would have them to be with him, that they
may behold his glory: which we have handled also with relation to the point.

In the remainder of the verse you have a reason of a reason. Our Savior
having spoken of the glory bestowed upon him by his Father, which he would have
believers to behold: it might be questioned how he came by this glory, or what
induced the Father to bestow it on the Son. Why says our Savior, he gave it
me because he loved me from Eternity. Father, I will that they, etc. that they
may behold the glory which thou have given me; For thou have loved me; mark it,
thou have loved me, and therefore thou have given me this glory; That they may
behold my glory which thou have given me, for thou lovedst me before the
foundation of the world.

There is no difficulty in the words, unless it be in that expression, before
the foundation of the world; a phrase of speech very usual in the Scripture,
and applied to many things, as I might give you instances enough: But it will
be sufficient to observe, that it denotes Eternity wheresoever it is used. And
that before, or from the foundation of the world, (for we meet with both
expressions) is as much in Scripture language as to say from everlasting: For
whatsoever was before the world was made, my brethren, was eternal; so that
when our Savior says to God the Father, Thou have loved me before the
foundation of the world, It is as much as if he should have said, Thou have
loved me from Eternity, from Everlasting: And so accordingly the point shall be,

DOCTRINE. That God the Father has dearly loved Jesus Christ from all Eternity.
There are two things in the point which I shall orderly pursue. First God the
Father has dearly loved Jesus Christ. Secondly, he has done so from all
Eternity, Before the foundation of the world was laid.

As for the first of these, That God the Father loves Jesus Christ, you see it
is the clear express assertion of our Savior in my Text. And therefore if you
mark him, you shall find that he is often speaking of his Fathers love to him,
as Joh. 15.9. and in the 23. verse of this Chapter. And on the other side, the
Father he professes his transcendent love to Christ, and that out of heaven it
self, Mat. 3.17. This is my beloved Son. I have some other children that I love
well, but this is my beloved Son above the rest, take notice of him, this is
he, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.

I shall not stand to prove so clear a truth, That God the Father dearly loves
Jesus Christ. But you will ask me, Why does God the Father love him?

Truly, my Brethren, there is cause enough why he should love him,

There is Proportion, He is very like the Father, and that both as God

1. As God, he is extremely like the Father, he is the very picture of him as
we use to say; The express Image of his Fathers Person; not of the (...), but
of the (...), Heb. 1.3. Indeed he represents and resembles him in every
thing. The Father is Almighty, so is he; the Father is Eternal, so is he; the
Father is Immutable and Omnipresent, etc. so is he; He is his express Image.

Nay shall I go a little further? The Father as a Person distinguished from the
Son, has nothing proper and peculiar to himself, but is in some respect
expressed and declared in the Son. His act of generation or begetting, is
showed forth in the begotten: so that unless he were the Father, it is
impossible he should be nearer to the Father, or better like the Father then he
is. And if he were the Father, he could not be the Fathers Image, he could not
be like the Father; for Nullum simile est idem. Thus Christ as God you see my
Brethren, is the most absolute and perfect Character of God the Father, like
him in every thing in all respects, as one face answers another in a glass:
Having no other inward difference between them save only this, that by their
relative properties, they are distinguished the one from the other.

2. As man our Savior is extremely like the Father too; He is the Image of the
invisible God, Col. 1.15. As he has assumed our flesh, he is the very Image of
the Father. And therefore the Apostle says not simply, who is the Image of
God, but of the invisible God: In which there is a close Antithesis, q. d.
Having assumed our Nature, he is now become the visible Image of the invisible
God; That God who is invisible, is made visible in him. And this is that which
is suggested in that speech of John the Baptist, Joh. 1.18. No man has seen
God at any time; conceive it with the outward eye; The Son of man who is in the
bosom of the Father, he has declared him. He has discovered him in some
respect to that eye, because he is so very like him. So that if you see the
Son, you shall see the Father in him; the resemblance is so great, that in
seeing one of them, you see the other. And hence says Christ to Philip once,
Joh. 14.9. He that has seen me, has seen the Father also. So that our Savior
both as God and Man, is like the Father, and so in that respect is fitted for
his Fathers love.

God even thy God has anointed thee, says David, Psalm 45.7. And Christ is
Gods Christ, Psalm. 2.2. The Kings of the earth set themselves, and the Rulers
take counsel together against the Lord, and against his Christ. Indeed he is
the Fathers Chosen, the Fathers servant, the Fathers Son; He is his Son as God
by eternal generation, as man by union: He is his in all capacities, and under
all considerations; take him which way you will, he is the Fathers: So that no
marvail though the Father love him, and love him dearly too. We that are men
are wont to love our own, yea many times we dote upon them, though they have
little lovely in them. But Christ who is his Fathers own, is altogether lovely,
so that he has cause to love him. And this for clearing of the first branch,
that God the Father loves Jesus Christ.

Now for the second branch, that he has loved him from everlasting, This is
expressly taught us also in the Text; Thou have loved me, says Christ, before
the foundation of the world, that is, before time was. As the time will never
be when God will not love Christ; So the time never was when God did not love
Christ: That place is notable to this purpose, Prove. 8.22. The Lord possessed
me in the beginning, etc. I was set up from everlasting, etc. I was as one
brought up with him, and I was daily his delight. Observe it well, I was daily
his delight.

I, you will answer, he was so as God; But how was he so as man? How could the
Father love the Son as Man from everlasting, since he was not from everlasting?

God is one pure act, was slain, so he was incarnate too, before the foundation
of the world; and so he was beloved as man, and as incarnate before the
foundation of the world: and under this consideration he speaks, especially to
his Father in my Text; Thou have loved me, says he, viz. as Man and Mediator
before the foundation of the world.

Now is it so, That God the Father dearly loves Jesus Christ?

1. If God love Jesus Christ so dearly, he hates them that hate Christ: and he
will surely be avenged on them to the very utmost. The love he bears to Jesus
Christ, will stir him up to execute his fiercest wrath, and to take most severe
revenge upon them. Believe it, brethren, God will not spare them in the day of
vengeance, he will show no bowels of compassion to them who hate his dear Son
Christ, to whom he bears such infinite affection. The more he loves Christ, the
more he will hate them that hate him, and the more sharply will he deal with
them.

But you ask me, Are there any such that hate Christ? and if there be, which
way may they be discovered?

Some there are that hate Christ, Luke 19.14. He is refused, not of the Heathen
people only, but of diverse in the Church, and some of them of greatest note,
authority and learning there, to wit, the builders of the Church. He is the
stone which they that would be counted Workmen, Master-workmen, stumble at and
set aside, Psalm. 118.22. There be that live in opposition and hostility against
him, even where his Kingdom is set up; he rules in the midst of his enemies,
as his Father speaks of him, Psalm. 110.2. Where our Savior has a Church,
there the Devil has a Chapel, yea it may be a Cathedral. I know thy works,
and where thou dwell, says our Savior to the Church of Pergamus, even
where Satan's seat is, Apoc. 2.13. Observe it well, where Satan's seat is: that
is, where he is Bishop, where he keeps his residence, where his Episcopal
Cathedral and his chair is. Christ can never want his enemies where Satan has
such interest, and such authority as this is. Indeed the greatest Enemy that
Christ has in the world (conceit it among mortal men) is in the Church, and
that is Antichrist, a Bishop too, who has his name from being opposite to
Christ, (...), as who should say against Christ. He sits in the Temple, in
the Church, as the Apostle Paul speak, 2 Thessalonians. 2.4. There were false brethren
in the Church of the Philippians, who notwithstanding all their glorious
protestations, were enemies to Christ, as the Apostle tells them plainly, Phil.
3.18. and he tells it them with tears, he was so much affected with it. And
surely there are many everywhere, and in every Congregation, who pretend much
worship and submission, and Ceremony, and respect to Christ: And yet such is
the damnable hypocrisy and falseness of the hearts of men, they swell with
inward rank or, rage, and hate against him. It is not every one that calls him
Rabbi Master, as the false Herodians did, that kisses him, and bows before him,
and salutes him with Hayl Master, as deceitful Judas did, that is indeed a
friend to Christ: No, men may make a flourish, and profess they love the Lord,
and say that he is infinitely dear unto them, and yet may be as real enemies to
him, and to his Kingdom, as Judas that betrayed him, the Judge and Officers and
people that condemned, and scourged, and crucified the Lord of glory.

And now my brethren, Will you say to me as the Disciples to our Savior, when
he told them, that one of them should betray him? Will you ask me man by man,
Is it I? and is it I? No, I expect to hear you say, It is not I. What, I an
enemy to Christ? I defy it; and they that are his greatest enemies will be as
bold and resolute in the denial as any other. And therefore as our Savior gave
a sign to the Disciples, by which the Traitor might be known; so I will give
you certain signs out of Scripture, by which the enemies of Christ may be
discovered.

First they that are willing to submit to sin, and are unwilling to submit to
Christ, they are enemies to Christ. I will a little stand on either branch of
this mark. They that are willing to submit to sin, they are enemies to Christ:
It Is true indeed men may be taken captive by it, as Saint Paul was, they may be
forced to obey it in some certain acts, notwithstanding all their striving, by
the power of a temptation which they are no way able to resist, and yet may be
the friends of Christ; they may unfaignedly and dearly love the Lord Jesus. But
if they render up themselves to any lust, if they make a Covenant with it, as
being willing and resolved to obey it; if not content that they are sold by
Adam, they sell themselves to sin, as Ahab did, they are enemies to Christ: No
man can serve two Masters, that are contrary, as God and Mammon, Christ and
sin; for says our Savior, He will love the one, and hate the other, Mat.
6.24. So then if you be servants voluntarily engaged to any sin, as being
willing to obey it in the lusts thereof. Whether it be drunkenness, or
swearing, or uncleanness, or the like; If you resolve it is a sweet, it is a
profitable sin, I will not strive nor pray against it, because I mean not to
forsake it, you do indeed hate Christ. It may be you do think that you may
serve a lust, and love the Lord Christ too: But you deceive your own souls; for
the Truth of God has said it, that he that loves the one, will hate the other:
As they that serve Christ, hate sin; so they that serve sin, hate Christ.

And for the second branch of this mark, as they that willingly obey sin, so
they that are unwilling to obey Christ, they are enemies to Christ. You are my
friends, says Christ to his Disciples, if you do whatsoever I command you,
Joh. 15.14. otherwise you are not. And hence he styleth those his enemies, who
will not have him rule over them, Luke 19.27. Observe it well, he says not
simply, Those that will not have me reign; but those mine enemies that will not
have me reign over them, bring them forth and slay them before me. If then you
will not stoop to Christ, and to the Scepter of his Kingdom; if you will not
have him rule you, if you will not do the things that he commands you, but are
resolved to walk according to your own humors, and though you are informed what
is good, and what the Lord requires of you, yet you hate to be reformed, and
pluck away the shoulder, as the Prophet speaks, and say with those rebellious
wretches, Psalm. 2.3. Let us break his bonds asunder, and cast away his cords
from us, that we may walk at liberty, and that there may be no restraint from
any thing that seems good in our own eyes: be not deceived, for you are
Adversaries of the Lord Christ.

2. They are enemies to Christ, that love that which Christ hates, and hate
that which Christ loves. It is the property of near and bosom friends, to will
and nill, to love and hate the same things; and enemies are just upon the other
hand: and so it is in this case. They that are in love with sin, (which is the
thing, the only thing which Christ hates) are surely out of love with Christ.
They that love the Lord, hate evil, Psalm. 97.10. and I may say as well, They
that love evil, hate the Lord. It Is true, that such as love him, may commit it,
but yet they have a strange antipathy against it, they hate it with a perfect
hatred, and every false way they utterly abhor. And hence it is that they
endeavor to destroy it, to crucify it every day, to put it to the cruellest
and basest death, and if they had it in their power, they would show it no
mercy. You would not use a Turk, a Toad, as such a man would use sin. But when
a man shall cocker it, and stroke it, and delight in it, when he shall not
endure to have it stricken with the hammer, or wounded with the Sword of Gods
Word, but shall be ready to do violence to any man that offers it a blow, or
gives it but an ill word, the heart of such a person is not right toward
Christ.

And even as they are enemies to Christ, who love that which Christ hates, so
also they who hate that which Christ loves, and that is holiness and grace,
which he cannot choose but love, because it is a beam of his own light, a gift
of his own spirit, a stamp of his own Image, a part of his own fullness, for of
his fullness have we all received, and grace for grace. But you will say, Who
hates this? I answer they that persecute and scorn and vex their brethren for
their strictness and preciseness, because they follow that which good is,
because they fear an oath, because they run not out with them to the same
excess of riot, they are the men that hate grace. For it is holiness and grace
you see that is the proper object, and indeed the formal reason of their
hatred. And they that hate their brethren for their holiness and grace, which
they have received from Christ, by which they are conformable and like to
Christ, would hate him so much more then them, if he should come and live among
them, by how much he is holier then they are. And therefore let not such as say
they could affect and like of such a person well enough, but that he is so pure
and so precise, he will not do as they do, pretend any love to Christ. For
certainly the same affections of spite and malice and reproach which they
discover against such men, they would with so much greater bitterness express
against the Lord Christ, if he were conversant upon the earth, by how much he
exceeds and transcendeth them in holiness and grace.

3. They that are friends to the enemies of Christ, and enemies to the friends
of Christ, are enemies to Christ himself. Be they who they will that close with
those that live in enmity against Christ, and help them in their opposition to
his truth and to his cause, and to his glory, they can never love Christ. No,
if they did, they could never side with those that are professed adversaries to
the Lord Jesus, and who endeavor to subvert and overthrow his worship and
religion, and destroy his people. And certainly Christ cannot choose but take
them for his enemies, and use them like his enemies, while they incorporate
themselves with those that live in open opposition and hostility against him.

And as the friends unto the enemies of Christ, even so the enemies unto the
friends of Christ, are enemies to Christ himself. They that are adversaries to
the Saints, who are as it is said of Abraham, the friends of God, the friends
of Christ, must needs be adversaries to the Lord Jesus. There is a Covenant and
a League of love between the Lord and them, and the league is not defensive
only, but offensive too; he that touches them, says Christ, touches the
Apple of mine eye; touch them, and touch me, Zac. 2.8. Nay, they are not alone
in Covenant with him, but more then so my brethren, they are one with him. And
therefore they are called Christ, 1 Cor. 12.12. For as the body is one, and
has many members, and all the members are but one body, so also is Christ:
conceive it Christ in aggregate, comprizing all the Church with him; for, caput
and corpus unus est Christus (as Austin speaks) the head and the body is but
one Christ: and that which is the name of Christ, Jer. 23.6. This is his name
by which he shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness, is the Churchss name
too, Jer. 33.16. This is the name wherewith she shall be called, The Lord our
Righteousness. Indeed his people are the members of his body, and he can never
be a friend unto the head, who is an adversary to the members.

Now if on trial by the former evidences, you find that you hate Christ,
believe it God hates you. The dearer his affection to his Son Christ is, the
greater is his hatred of the enemies of Christ. The union is so near, and the
love so infinite between the Father and the Son, that God may truly say to
Jesus Christ, Do not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect
hatred, as though they were mine enemies: And I will surely take a course with
them, I will bring them low enough. Sit thou at my right hand, there sit thou
still unmoved and undisturbed, till I have made thine enemies thy footstool.

JOHN 17.24. For thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.


IS it so that God the Father dearly loves Jesus Christ? hence then it John
14.21. He that loves me, says Christ, shall be loved of my Father. Let him be
what he will, of what condition or estate he will, never so poor and mean and
despicable in the world, if he do really and truly love me, my Father loves
that man, and loves him dearly for my sake. Nay says the Father, this man is
my Sons friend, he bears a very great affection to my Son Christ, and therefore
I must needs esteem and love him for my Sons sake. I have always loved my Son,
even from all eternity, and that out of all measure; and upon this account my
love and my affection overflows to all those that love him.

Oh how should this prevail with every one of us to love Christ, and love him
dearly, since God the Father will requite us to the utmost for all the love we
show to him; all the love that we lay out on Jesus Christ, he will pay us back
again, and pay us in the same coin. We may depend upon it, that we shall have
love for love. If we love Christ, the Father he will love us. And is the
Fathers love worth nothing? Ah, my beloved, it brings with it all the
happiness and mercy that a poor soul is capable of: And therefore I beseech you
let us love Christ: let Christ have our love, that we may have the Fathers
love. And here to warm your hearts a little, and to draw them out to Christ,
take notice of these few things.

1. View him in himself, behold him in the choiceness and excellency of his own
beauty; There is no spot, nor imperfection in him, in the very least degree; He
is fairer then the children of men, Psalm. 45.2. then any of them all, let them
be what they will: for they have blemishes, but he has none. All the
perfections in the world do meet in him, so that there can be nothing added to
him. Indeed (my brethren) he is altogether lovely. All others have their
imperfections and defects, something there is unlovely in them: but he is
altogether lovely: And this is that which makes the Church so far in love with
him: She is taken with his beauty, and the delicious savor of his ointments,
the sweetness of the graces that are in him, Cant. 1.3. How is she ravished in
the contemplation of him? Cant. 5.8. What is thy beloved more then another
beloved? say the daughters to her there; What is he more? says she: me thinks
she is an end with that word: Why have you no eyes to see? He is transcendent,
incomparable, and so describes him from top to toe, and then concludes, This
is my beloved O ye daughters, look upon him, this is he: As who should say, now
judge you whether I have cause to love him, yea, or no. And therefore I am not
ashamed to own it: and if you meet with my beloved, you may tell him that I
love him, yea that I am sick of love.

2. Consider in the next place what he is to you, what interest and propriety
you have in him. Why, my beloved, he is yours: I speak this to believers only.
And this the Church and Spouse of Christ professes often, I am my beloveds,
and my beloved is mine: and yields this as the reason of the high and dear
affection that she bears him. A woman, you will say, has cause to love her own
husband. Now Jesus Christ is the husband of the Church, she is his wife, his
spouse, his second self, she is called by his name: We are thine (say the
people of the Lord) the heathen are not so, nor are they called by thy name. So
that the Saints in this respect, are infinitely more obliged to love him, then
these that are without the pale, because they have not such relation to him.

3. Let the exceeding love of Christ to you, draw out your love to him again.
Amor (they say) is C^s amoris. And so let his love be a whet to you. Consider
he has loved you, and therefore you have reason to love him again. This reason
does not hold on both sides: we cannot say that we have loved Christ, and
therefore he has cause to love us. For we never loved him till he loved us
first, the love began on his side. But we may truly say, that Jesus Christ has
loved us; and therefore we have cause to love him. For he prevented us with
mercy, and with loving kindness, as the Prophet speaks; and this should win our
hearts to him. We love him (says the Apostle in the name of all the faithful)
1 John 4.19. Why so? what is the cause of this love? you have it in the
following words, because he loved us first. Our love is not the cause of his,
but his love is the cause of ours.

4. Survey what Christ has done for you, and see if it deserve not at the
least a return of love from you. He has made you (that is little: in
comparison I mean) all things were created by him, Col. 1.16. but more then
this, he has redeemed you from sin, from death, from hell it self. You had
been utterly undone, and lost for ever, had it not been for Jesus Christ. But
he has saved that which was lost. He has raised you from nothing to a
Kingdom, from poverty to matchless riches, yea from death to life it self: we
were dead, but are alive; all this is Christ's doing. We use to love them who
have saved our lives: and surely we have cause to love Christ* for he has
saved our lives, and that not from a temporal but from eternal death: Not from
the first alone, but from the second death, where the worm never dies, and the
fire is never quenched: And therefore he is called our life, that is, the cause
and fountain of it, Col. 3.4. When Christ who is our life shall appear. So that
we may truly call him in the Prophets words, the God of our life; And therefore
we have cause to make him the object of our love, and wholly to bestow our
hearts upon him; to love him, by whom we live the life of grace, and look to
live the life of glory.

Is it so that God the Father dearly loves Jesus Christ? The more etc.

1. Consider how the Father used him, who is so infinitely dear to him: he gave
him up into the hands of sinful men, to deal with him as they pleased. There
take the darling of my bosom (says the Father) revile him, mock him, beat
him, spit upon him, scourge him, pierce him, nail him, stretch his limbs upon
the Cross, crucify him, kill him, shed his blood, take away his life from him;
wreak all your malice on him to the utmost, and though he cry and roar, I will
not save him, I will be far from helping him, and from the words of his
roaring, as the expression is, Psalm. 22.1. Though God does love him infinitely,
he left him in the hands of vile men, to use him at their own pleasure: and
they used him bad enough, as you may see, if you survey the Gospel story. Oh
the indignities, reproaches, and contempts that sinful wretches poured out
upon the Lord of glory! In which respect, the Prophet says, he was despised
and rejected, and men hid their faces from him, as if they were ashamed of him,
Isa. 53.3. I am a reproach of men (says holy David, as a type of Christ, Psalm.
22.6.) and despised of the people: all that see me laugh me to scorn. Oh the
abasures that he suffered from persons viler then the earth they trod upon, and
God the Father who so dearly loved him stood by, and made as if he saw nothing.

Nay more then so, he suffered much even from his Fathers own hands, q He made
him sin, that is a sacrifice for sin, and he made him a curse for us, that
there was nothing visible upon him for a season but the severest and feircest
wrath of a revenging Judge, as if he had been utterly accursed from his Father.
He scourged him most bitterly, even till he blead and roared and sunk away
under his hand. Thus it pleased the Father to bruise him; He spared not his own
Son, Romans 8.22. Though he were his own Son, he laid on and did not spare him.
He remitted not to Christ the least jot of those exquisite and unsufferable
tortures, that were in justice due to our transgressions. He drank off at his
Fathers hands the cup of fury, he drank the very dreggs, and wrung them out.
All this the Father did to Jesus Christ, and more then I am able to express,
and yet he loved him infinitely all this while, and did from eternity, and
therein lies the great wonder.

2. But secondly if we consider for whose sake the Father used him so who is
infinitely dear to him, the wonder will be yet greater. It had not been so
admirable, had it been for friends, but it was for enemies. This raises and
commends the Love of God, says the Apostle, Romans 8.10. that we being sinners,
yea being enemies, he reconciled us to him by his Son. He used a means, by
giving up his Son to shame, to make up all the breaches between us and him, and
herein lies the quintessence of this business, the sparkle in the jewel of the
grace of God: That he should prefer the good, the glory, the salvation of his
enemies who lived in open opposition, and hostility against him, before the
ease, refreshment, safety, life of his own Son, whom he so dearly loved from
all eternity: That he should rather choose that one whom he loved so
exceedingly, should die, then they; should be made a curse, then they: should
undergo the tortures and the pains of hell, then they: justice resolves they
must be undergone either by his beloved Son, or his hateful enemies. It must
and will be satisfied either by the one or by the other. Well then if it must
be so, his dearest Son shall suffer, and his enemies go free; yea he shall
suffer to the very death; rather then they shall be punished (says the
Father,) There go my poor harmless Lamb to slaughter in their stead; there go
his blood and life and all: He shall bleed and bleed to death, that they may be
healed and live. Oh the narrow hearts of men! how far short do they fall of
comprehending such a miracle of mercy! Well may the Angels wonder at it, and
desire to peep into it. Yea, the blessed Lord himself, whether as wondering at
or willing to make us wonder at this admirable business, has called the nane
of Christ Wonderful.



But you will ask me, Which way does this yield you out such precious comfort
that you have been beloved of God from all eternity?

1. It is a comfort to consider that the great and glorious God of heaven and
earth should think of such poor worms as we from everlasting, much more that he
should set his love upon us. The world it may be looks upon us as not worth the
speaking of, as not worth the thinking of, much less as worthy of the least
respect: And this it may be troubles and dejects us now and then. But this may
cheer us, and encourage us upon the other side, that God himself did think upon
us, yea, and dearly love us too from all eternity: when we had not a being in
the world, (save only in the Counsel and Decree of God) he made more of us,
then these men do now we have a gracious being.

2. It is a comfort to consider, that God and we have been such old friends,
that he has loved us from all eternity. For it is like the love will hold,
that has been of such standing. We have a Proverb, Change not an old friend
for a new, because the new is like to be more fickle. God has been an old
friend, time out of mind: And therefore he is like to be the more constant.
From everlasting he has loved us, and therefore we may safely rest and rely on
his love.

3. If God have loved us from everlasting, then he has loved us all along
since that time. Before we had a being in the world, and since we had a being:
before we had a gracious being, when we were dead in trespasses and sins: And
if he loved us then, assuredly he will not cease to love us now,
notwithstanding all our unallowed imperfections and defects: He will continue
and go on to love us still, till he have lodged us with himself in glory.

Oh how should this revive the hearts of those among the Saints, who are so apt
to doubt the love of God, because they sin so often, and so much against him!
Why man, God loved thee when thou did sin against him more then now thou
do; he loved thee when thou hatedst him; and therefore certainly he will not
hate thee now thou love him. No, he that loved thee from the beginning, will
love thee also to the end. He that loved thee from everlasting, will love thee
to everlasting, and nothing in the world shall separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And thus we have at length dispatched the body of our Saviors prayer, and are
arrived at the close or the conclusion of it: In which his drift and purpose
is, to render his Disciples (for whom he has petitioned all along before) very
acceptable and very gracious to his Father, and so to leave them in his hands:
And that upon this account, because they only had the true and saving and
affective knowledge of him; They only were acquainted with him, when as all the
world beside were strangers to him. And it was reason he should rather do for
them, then do for strangers. Oh righteous Father, the world has not known
thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou have sent me, and I
have declared unto them thy name. q. d. And now to shut up all, and to come to
a conclusion, I pray thee Father to consider this, for close of all, That the
world for whom I have not said a word in all my prayer, nay for whom I have
professed not to pray, (I pray for these, I pray not for the world) yet they
(the world) are wholly ignorant of thee, and unacquainted with thee. But I that
have put up this prayer to thee, know thee very well, no one in the world
better. And they for whom I have put up this prayer, know thee too by my means,
for I have manifested and declared thee to them. And therefore I am confident,
that thou will hear and answer me in their behalf: None know thee in the world
but I and they: I that pray, and they for whom I pray. Remember that, and I
have done: I say no more, but even leave thee to consider whether thou will
hear and answer me for them, or no, Oh righteous, etc. the world, etc.

In this conclusion of our Saviors prayer, I shall consider but these two
things: To whom he speaks, and What he speaks, for close of all. First, to whom
he speaks, and that you see my brethren, is to God, whom he styles righteous
Father. Secondly, what he speaks in the remainder of the two verses, which may
be very well divided, by the subjects of his speech, the persons that he speaks
of, viz. the world, himself, and true believers, as we shall see at large
hereafter.

Begin we with the person that he speaks to, and him he mentions by his title
and his attribute. His title here you see is Father, his attribute is
righteous, righteous Father.

As for the first of these my brethren, I have showed you more then once, that
Father in this prayer of our Savior is not personally taken for the first
person of the Godhead: For the first person of the Godhead (though it be the
Father of our Savior Christ as God, yet) it is not so properly the Father of
our Savior Christ as man. And our Savior Christ speaks as man in this place.
And therefore Father here is essentially taken for the whole Godhead subsisting
in the three persons. And even as we, by Father, mean the Godhead when we pray
our Father which art in heaven: So does our Savior Christ too. As man he is in
this respect like us, as the Apostle tells us, he is in all things like unto
us, sin only excepted.

Now the attribute he gives the Godhead, which he denotes by Father here, is
righteous, Righteous Father. But wherefore does he mention this, rather then
any attribute of God, on this occasion? Why might he not have said as well
Almighty, or Eternal, or Merciful, or Gracious Father? The special reason why
he chooses this expression (as far as I conceive) cannot be clearly and
undoubtedly resolved. Judicious Calvin thinks he does it in opposition to the
unrighteousness of men: So to comfort true believers, that however they were
like to meet with nothing but injustice and unrighteousness in the world, yet
he was now committing them into the hands and keeping of a righteous God.
Others guess at other reasons. Once, this is clear and manifest, that he picks
out this attribute of God among the rest, and whereas many others lay before
him, he fixes upon this only: He comes to God in prayer, by the name of
righteous Father: The thing is evident, though the particular Consideration
that induced him to it be unknown. So that the Points to be observed here, are
two.

First God is a just and righteous God in himself and in all his dispensations.

Secondly, That Jesus Christ came to him as a righteous God, when he was
pouring out his prayers to him, or making his Petition to him.

DOCTRINE. God is a very just and righteous God.
None knew him better then our Savior, and he calls him Righteous Father: So
does the Holy Ghost in Scripture very often. The Prophet David styles him The
Righteous God, Psalm. 7.9 And Jeremiah, The Lord that judges righteously, Jer.
11.10. Indeed he does not judge after the sight of his eyes, nor reprove after
the hearing of his ears; that is, he is not deceived with the external show of
things, with which the eyes of men are often taken. He is not misled and
carried with reports to deal unjustly in the least degree: No, with
righteousness he does judge the poor, (who many times are overborn in lower
Courts, by those that are too strong and mighty for them) and reprove with
equity for the meek of the earth: Though they be meek, though they be not
clamorous and troublesome, and though they do not wring out justice from him
(as the poor widow in the Gospel did from the unrighteous Judge, by
unweariedness, earnestness, and tyring importunity) yet they shall have it
easily and readily, he will dispense it to them freely of his own accord. And
this is that which holy David so applauds him for, and he will have it spoken
to his praise among the Heathen, Psalm. 96.10. Say among the Heathen, The Lord
reigns and he shall judge the people righteously. Let the Heavens rejoice,
and let the Earth be glad before the Lord, for he comes, for he comes to
judge the Earth. He shall judge the world with Righteousness, and his people
with his Truth. So that you see the point is clear; That God is a very just and
righteous God. And you will be the better satisfied in it; if you consider but
these three things.

First the largeness of his Jurisdiction and Dominion: His Government Abraham)
Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Genesis 18.25. The Supreme and
Sovereign Judge before whose dread Tribunal all the World must stand, and at
whose Bar they must be tried for that which most concerns them too, their
precious souls; from whose determination no man can appeal with any hope of
being righted in a higher Court, seeing there is none above it. Is God
unrighteous? I say as the Apostle, Romans 3.5. How then shall he judge the world?
Indeed inferior Governors may be unrighteous and corrupt, and yet this
universal frame continue and subsist, because they are perpetually subject to
the Sovereign Judge, who stands in the Congregation of the Mighty, and is a
Judge among the Gods, as David speaks, Psalm. 82.1. But if the universal Judge
should be unjust, whom none can overtop nor call to an account, what could be
looked for but confusion?

Another ground of the righteousness of God, is the immensity and to the
largeness of his Jurisdiction and Dominion, and this contributes very much to
the uprightness and the justice of his Government. Inferior Magistrates,
although perhaps they have no mind to be unjust, yet they are often times
misled by sinister information. They are not present everywhere, they see not
every thing themselves, and therefore are necessitated to proceed secundum
allegata and probata. And many times it comes to pass, that things which are
untrue are testified and proved before them, and so they do injustum, though
not injuste, by means of which the Innocent is injured and oppressed; See an
example of it in Mephibosheth, who by the false suggestions of his wicked
servant Ziba, was outed of his goods and his possessions, 2 Samuel 16.4. Had
David known that good Mephibosheth had still remained loyal to him, had he not
been abused by a forged information, how far would he have been from doing such
apparent wrong as he did in that sentence? But he relied on Testimony for the
truth of that which by reason of remoteness could not fall within the compass
of his own notice, and so was led into that gross mistake which you have heard.
Now there can no such Errors happen in the Government of God, because himself
is present every where, and therefore cannot be misguided by finister
information. He takes nothing upon trust, upon suggestion, as all our
Governors on earth do. No, my beloved, he sees all with his own eyes, he hears
all with his own ears: nothing is said or done but in his presence. His eyes in
every place behold the evil and the good, says Solomon, Prove. 15.3. whether it
be good or evil, whether it be near or far off, it is within his own veiw, his
eyes behold it, he need not to depend upon a witness for the proof of it: So
that in this respect he is not subject to such injustice in his government as
other Kings and Rulers are.

The righteous Lord loves righteousness, Psalm. 11.7. his very heart is set
upon it; as he acts without, so he affects it within. There are many in the
world that do justice, who yet do not love justice: They execute it out of
Politic respects and reasons only, or out of affectation of applause with men,
not out of inward inclination and affection. The Judge of whom our Savior
Christ makes mention, Luke 18.2. did the poor widow justice; and yet he calls
him an unjust Judge, because he did not execute it out of love to justice, but
himself; To wit, that he might quit himself, and rid his hands of the unwearied
importunities of such a suitor as would not give him rest till he had done it:
Because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her; not because her cause is
just: His aim was not to do her right, but obtain his own quiet. But herein God
excells; he does justice, and that because he loves justice: He does not
execute it by compulsion and constraint, or out of by-sinister ends: but out of
the affection that he bears it, and the dear regard he has to it. And this is
that which he professes of himself, Isai. 16.8. I the Lord love judgment.

us, and calm our troublous and tumultuous thoughts about the great disorders
and confusions that we discover in the world. It may preserve us from repining
against God, and charging him foolishly. What though the wicked prosper in the
world, what though their eyes stand out with fatness, while the people of the
Lord are troubled, and afflicted, and distressed! Will you presume to question
Gods Justice! Rather conclude the Lord is righteous; and where you cannot
fathom his proceedings, cry out with the Apostle Paul, O the depth and the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out? Let David's error be your caution: I
was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperous state of wicked men, Psalm.
73.3. They are not in trouble, neither are they plagued like other men. But as
for me, I have washed my hands in vain: for all the day long I have been plagued
and chastned every morning. It was no fair and equal dealing as it seemed to
him; he knew not what to make of these proceedings. And where was Jeremiah,
when reasoning with him of his judgments, as he calls it, Jer. 12.1. he thus
expostulateth the case; Wherefore does the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore
are all they happy that deal very treacherously? He could conceive no reason
for it, and therefore takes upon him to call the Lord to coram, how he could
warrant his proceedings. If such blasphemous thoughts assault us, my Beloved,
let us remember that of Austin, The judgments of the Lord are aliquando
aperta, aliquando ecculta, semper justa: sometimes secret, sometimes open,
always just: yea just when they are secret, when with the Prophet Jeremiah we
cannot see the reason of his judgments: And let us have it always in our
thoughts, that the time is drawing on, when the justice of the Lord (which in
this present life is covered and obscured) shall be revealed and made
bare-fac't to the world, to wit, at the great day of retribution, which is
therefore called in Scripture, The day of Revelation of the just judgment of
God: which here is hid in the prosperity of the wicked, and the pressures of
the righteous.

Is God a very just and righteous God? Then let it comfort and encourage He
has prepared his Throne for judgment, and he shall judge the world in
righteousness, says David, Psalm. 9.8. And what does he infer upon it? He will
be a refuge to the oppressed. And therefore let all those that are oppressed
fly to this refuge, and let the righteousness of God support them, and uphold
them, against the wicked and unrighteous dealing that they find from men. He
loves righteousness, and therefore he will surely do you right; he hates
iniquity, and therefore he will surely punish them that do you wrong: And
therefore go and cry to him, tell him how you are used by those that overpower
you in the world, and that you have no friends nor means to help your selves,
and so beseech him earnestly to show himself, and to appear for you: say as
Hezekiah did, Isa. 38.14. O Lord I am oppressed, undertake for me; and be
confident of this, that you cannot easily put any business into the hands of
God, that he takes more delight to do; O it is a thing that pleases him
exceedingly, he loves it dearly to do them right that suffer wrong, and to
avenge the wrong they suffer, upon those that do it. He loves righteousness,
and hates iniquity: yea, the less able you are to relieve and help your
selves, the more he loves to do you justice: And therefore takes upon himself
the special care of those who are most destitute of earthly succor, as the
fatherless and widows, and the like. A Father of the fatherless, and a judge
of the widows, is God in his holy habitation, Psalm. 68.5.

Rejoice greatly O daughter of Sion; and why so? because thy King comes to
thee, and he is just. (Even so say I to you my Brethren) God is a very just and
righteous God, and he desires to be received and entertained by you: That you
would set your gates open, that he may enter and sit upon the Throne in your
hearts. Say to him now, Ride on Lord, because of thy righteousness; Come in
Lord, and take command of us; We would willingly be ruled by such a just and
righteous Prince as thou art.

Where then shall the wicked and ungodly appear? What will they do who are
unrighteous, when the time of judgment comes, who have lived in the continued
and voluntary breach of all his laws? what will they plead why they should not
be condemned? Me thinks the justice and the uprightness of the Judge should
astonish and affright them, who have so ill a cause, so bad a matter to be
heard before him. If they whose hearts and lives are full of all
unrighteousness be judged with just and righteous judgment, if they receive
according to their works, what think you will their portion be? Ah, my Beloved,
lay it seriously to heart, you that run out with the intemperate, you that
oppress and grind the poor, that are abominable and disobedient, and to every
good work reprobate, how will you hold up your heads when the day of reckoning
comes, and all your sins shall be laid open in their colors? when God shall
bring every work to judgment, and every secret thing, when he shall rip up all
your close abominations, and all your secret wickednesses, that never any eye
saw, when the books shall be laid open, and all the black bills read; when God
shall say to the Ministers of vengeance, Go give them now according as their
works have been. Look how much they have sinned, and how much wickedness they
have committed, so much sorrow and torment give them. Oh then what wringing of
hands, what renting of hearts, what cries and lamentations will there be? able
to make a Rock relent, and a Flint to fall asunder; and yet God will stand out
immovable against them all; for he is a righteous God; nothing will bend him
from the rule of Justice.

And as this serves for terror to the wicked, so for comfort to the

But you will say, What reason have we to rejoice in this? For if we have but
justice from him, we are certainly undone; for what have we deserved but death
and ruin?

To this I answer, If we have justice from him, we are well enough, John
insinuates in 1 John 1.9. He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins. Now
he must reward our labors, or else he is unjust, as the Apostle Paul speaks,
Heb. 6.10. The Lord is not unrighteous to forget our work and labor: He does
not say, the Lord is not unmerciful, but the Lord is not unrighteous; Now he
must give us everlasting rest, and render everlasting trouble to our enemies,
and that upon the same ground: And therefore says the same Apostle, 2 These.
1.6. It is a righteous thing with him to render tribulation to them that
trouble you; and to you that are troubled rest with us; So that you see the
justice, and the righteousness of God, which is a ground of horror to the
wicked; yet it is a ground of comfort to the godly. It is very ill for them, it
is very well for us, that God is such a righteous God. It is their loss, and it
is our gain.

And the cause is manifest; for he proceeds with them according unto such a
justice as respects the merit of the work; and he proceeds with us according
unto such a justice as respects the verity and truth of his promise. And
therefore though ungodly men have cause to fear and tremble at it, yet we have
reason to rejoice at it. And this is clearly intimated by the Prophet David in
the fore-alledged place, which indeed is very notable to this purpose, Psalm.
96. ult. Let the heavens rejoice, says he, and so on. And why so? for he shall
judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. Observe it
well, the world with righteousness; the people that stand in opposition to the
world, his people with his truth: The world with such a righteousness as looks
upon the merit of their works; His own people with such a righteousness as
looks upon the truth of his promise. His people with his truth; Righteousness
and truth do kiss each other. O let the people of the Lord rejoice that they
shall have righteous judgment; that God will do according to his promise and
his Covenant with them, when the great day of retribution comes. That he will
in this respect be just and righteous to forgive them and reward them: Let them
be glad of this for ever.

Preached at the Assize.
Superior and Inferior Magistrates, to labor to conform themselves to him in
this respect, and to be just and righteous as he is. They are under him, and
for him, and therefore should endeavor to be like him. Honorable and Beloved,
the Land abounds with wickedness of every kind, there is much unrighteous
dealing everywhere with God and man. This calls for righteous dealing from them
that bear the Sword of Justice; that these abominations may be purged out, and
that our breaches may be yet repaired. In such a time as this, when there are
such abuses, such blasphemies, such prophanations of the day and Ordinances of
the Lord, such swearing, drunkenness, uncleanness, incest, etc. as former ages
have not equaled: Justice should flow down like water, to wash away this filth
from us, and righteousness as a mighty stream that violently bears down all
before it, and will not be diverted from the Channel which it ought to run in.
As there is no respect of persons with God, let there be none with you; let
every one receive according to his cause, and according to his deeds.

When parties struggle in the bowels of a Nation, when there are factions up,
as there are at this time, there is a great temptation to unrighteousness in
this respect; one must be favored, because he is of such a party, another must
be rigorously dealt withal, because he is of such a party; though the cause of
both be like. It ought to be the care of Magistrates, that in the execution of
their Office, they be not biased, that they be not drawn aside by such low
considerations. They must not (...), with the Delphian Oracle, they must not
speak or act in their Administrations so as to comply with any party, as if
they were afraid of doing that which will displease the strongest side, which
will not relish well with those who may do them a displeasure: No, they must
(...), judge for Christ and act for God, and do as near as it is possible, as
he would do if he were in their places: they must be just as he is. And to
encourage you to this; Consider

the pillars of it; It is Columna and corona Reipublicae. There are at this
time many things in agitation, and many ways and projects thought upon to
settle Government among us: But when we have run through them all, we shall
find in the conclusion that nothing in the world will do it like to
righteousness. Let the form, and let the frame of Government be what it will,
the Throne must be established by righteousness; Especially when it is first set
up. Justice is as necessary to confirm a new Government, as Miracles to confirm
a new Doctrine. And if the people find not this, if there be tyranny,
injustice, and oppression still, that which made the old unpleasing, will have
the same effect and operation on the new.

Secondly, This Righteousness in your Administrations will make you aimable in
the sight of God; as God himself is righteous, so he loves righteousness; as
he acts it himself, so he affects it in others. The righteous Lord (says
holy David) loves righteousness, his countenance does behold the upright,
Psalm. 11.7. Righteous he is in all his actings and administrations; he is the
righteous Lord: so righteous and so just, that there is none in that respect
like him: and that out of a principle of love within: the righteous Lord loves
righteousness; yea, he affects it, and loves it so, that he gives no man a
good countenance, or a good look so much, that is not just and righteous too:
his countenance does behold the upright, the upright and none else. But as for
those that are unrighteous, he abhors them, all of them without exception, he
hates all workers of iniquity, Psalm. 5.5.

Thirdly, As it will make you amiable in the eyes of God, so you will find it
to be very beneficial to your selves: They are precious promises that God
makes, and great rewards that he gives to those that love and do Justice. That
is a signal one, Isa. 33.15. He that walks righteously and speaks uprightly;
he that despises the gain of oppression, and shakes his hands from holding of
bribes; so that it any put a bribe into his hand before he be aware, he shakes
it out again, and does not hold it: he shall dwell on high, his place of
defense shall be the munition of the Rocks: bread shall be given him, his
waters shall be sure: He shall have honor, he shall dwell on high, he shall be
lifted up above his brethren: He shall have sure protection, his defense shall
be the munition of the Rocks; high, that the enemy can never reach him, and
high upon the Rock, that he cannot undermine him. And as he shall have honor
and protection, so he shall have provision too, bread shall be given him, and
full provision; he shall have bread and water too, and this shall be sure to
him; Bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure.

And as there is much promised to, so there has been much done for those who
have laid out themselves in doing justice. You know how Jehu sped, and yet he
did it in hypocrisy. The Kingdom was continued in his line to the fourth
generation. Phineas it seems was more upright, and therefore he had a reward
that lasted longer, Numb. 25.13. He shall have and his seed after him the
Covenant of an everlasting Priesthhod, because he was zealous for his God, to
wit, in executing justice on that notorious pair of foul offenders; Indeed the
recompense of him that does it in sincerity, shall last for ever; For he shall
dwell upon Gods holy Mountain, he shall receive an Euge, when the great day of
reckoning comes.

And thus far of the first conclusion, God is a very just and righteous God. I
shall speak very little to the second, because indeed it is not large: however
I shall touch it in a word or two.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ came to him as a righteous God, and looked upon
him as a righteous God, when he was making his petitions to him.
You see it evidently and demonstratively in the Text: this is the appellation
that he gives him, Righteous Father; His thoughts it seems are taken up more
with the righteousness of God, then any other attribute of his at this time.

I shall not undertake to show why he did so, he had his reasons in his own
breast and bosom. Only this is probable, he did it that he might be an Example
and President to us, that we might learn of him to do as he did; That when we
are approaching to the Throne of grace, we might be very much possessed with deep
and serious contemplations of the righteousness of God.



It will be very useful to us, as I shall show you in a few particulars.

1. The meditation of the righteousness of God, will humble us for sin, and
stir us up (as far as it is possible) to cleanse our selves from sin, when we
are making our approaches to him: For sin, my Brethren, is against the
righteousness of God; yea in directest opposition: And therefore it is set out
by the name of unrighteousness in Scripture. Not only all injustice is
unrighteousness, but sin is generally so; The wrath of God, says the Apostle,
is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
Romans 1.18. against every kind of sin, especially that violates the second
Table. And so all unrighteousness is sin, says the Evangelist, 1 John 5.17.
And I may say as well, all sin is unrighteousness. And hence it is my Brethren,
that it is so infinitely odious to the righteous God.

And truly did we seriously consider this my Brethren, when we come to pray
before him, we should be deeply humbled for it, and ashamed of it, we should
strive exceedingly to quit and rid our selves of it, which is so contrary to
this attribute of his, and consequently is so detestable to him. Oh we would
shake and quiver every joint, to think of coming to the righteous God in our
unrighteousness unhumbled for, and unreformed. We would consider with our
selves, What will the Lord say to me when he sees me in his presence? How will
he look on such a wicked and unrighteous wretch as I am? how is it possible but
he should hide his eyes from me? how can he choose but hate me and abhor me? Do
I expect to find favor in his eyes, and come before him with that which he so
abhors, as if I meant to vex him, and provoke him? And therefore if we ever
look to speed with God in prayer, let us consider what a righteous God he is,
and let us labor to cleanse our selves from our unrighteousness, that is, as
far as it is possible from every sin, and he will receive us, as his own
expression is, 2 Cor. 6.17. or otherwise he will not.

2. The meditation of the righteousness of God, will strengthen and confirm our
faith, in all the precious promises of God, when we are pouring out our prayers
to him: Because indeed his righteousness and justice lies at stake for the
performance of his promises, by reason of his Covenant and Engagement to us. It
is true, before he made the Covenant he was free, he might have done according
to his own pleasure: But having made it, he is bound, he is held to it, and may
not vary. Now he must forgive our sins, (ours that believe) or else he is
unrighteous, as the Apostle John insinuates, 1 John 1.19. He is faithful and
just to forgive our sins: Now he must reward our labor, or else he is
unrighteous, as the Apostle speaks, Heb. 6.10. The Lord is not unrighteous to
forget your work and labor. He does not say, the Lord is not unmerciful, but
the Lord is not unrighteous: Now he must give us everlasting rest, and render
everlasting trouble to our enemies, or else he is unrighteous: And therefore
says the same Apostle, 2 Thessalonians. 1.6. It is a righteous thing with God to
render tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled, rest
with us.

And therefore when we pray for the pardon of our sins, the acceptance of our
labors, or any other good thing comprehended in the Covenant, from the
beginning of it to the end: Let us fix our serious thoughts, not only on the
mercy, but also on the justice and the righteousness of God, and we shall find
it will exceedingly confirm our wavering faith, while we consider that his
righteousness is bound for the performance of his promises; and that as sure as
God is righteous, he will withold no good thing from us.

JOHN 17.25. The world has not known thee.


OUR Savior having ended the petitionary part, is at length come to the
conclusion of his prayer: In which he shows the Father reason why he should be
heard in all that he has been a Suitor for in the behalf of true believers.
(viz:) Because himself and they were inwardly acquainted with him, whereas all
the world besides were strangers to him, as I have noted heretofore.

In this conclusion of our Saviors prayer, have been considered two things. To
whom he speaks, and What he speaks. First, To whom he speaks, and this you see
my brethren, is to God, whom he styles Righteous Father. Secondly then in the
next place, What he speaks; and here is something that he speaks against the
world, and something that he speaks for himself and true believers. 1. Here is
something that he speaks against the world, the world has not known thee. 2.
Then here is something that he speaks for himself and true believers, but I
have known thee, and these have known that thou have sent me.

To whom our Savior speaks as he is set forth by his title and his attribute,
has been considered heretofore. The thing which we have now in hand, is what
he speaks, and more particularly what he speaks against the world. Oh Righteous
Father, the world has not known thee.

We have observed heretofore out of the ninth verse of this Chapter that he
speaks not for the world. No, it is utterly excluded from having any share at
all in our Saviors intercession: let their case be what it will, let their
necessities be what they will, Christ even leaves them to themselves, and never
interposes for them to the Father. Nay, which is worse, he speaks against them.
He speaks against the world, as you hear him in my text. You see he cannot end
his prayer, but he must have a parting blow at them (Oh righteous Father, the
world has not known thee,) to kindle and exasperate his wrath against them. It
has not known thee with a knowledge of affection; they have not known thee so
as to love thee and obey thee. They are strangers, yea, they are enemies to
thee. Let justice have its course against them, let it be executed on them to
the utmost.

This I have glanced at only from the general, that Christ speaks against the
world. Proceed we more particularly to consider what he speaks against the
world. Oh Righteous Father, the world has not known thee.

And here I shall unfold the terms, and come to a more special observation. Two
things we have to be enquired and resolved. 1. Whom our Savior means by world.
2. What he intends when he affirms of the world, that it does not know God.

As for the first of these, The world imports not here the frame and frabrique
of the world (as it does sometimes in Scripture) but the people of the world.
And yet not all the people of the world neither: for Jesus Christ immediately
excepts himself and true believers. The world has not known thee, but I have
known thee, and these have known thee, The world you see is set in opposition
here to Christ and his Disciples. So that our Savior by the world intends all
the people in the world besides himself and true believers.

Now of all these he says expressly that they know not God. You must not
understand it absolutely, that they know him not at all, in no respect and
under no consideration. The very Heathen know him in a sense and in a measure.
There is (...), somewhat to be known of God, by the works of the creation, and
by the things that he has made, Romans 1.19. even by the book of Creatures which
the Heathens have and study. And therefore it is charged upon them afterward
at ver. 21. that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God; They did
not glorify him according to their knowledge of him. And if the Heathen, who
have but the Book of Creatures, know the Lord a little; Professed Christians,
who have the Book of Scriptures, know him more. I say, professed Christians who
have no interest at all in Christ, no truth of saving grace in them, even these
may go far in a notional, speculative, discoursive knowledge of the Lord,
beyond many sound believers: and yet these are of the world. So that our
Savior means not absolutely when he says to his Father here, The world has
not known thee, q. d. they have not known thee at all: But they have not known
thee so, in such a manner, and with such a kind of knowledge as I and true
believers do. Oh Righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have
known thee, and these have known that thou have sent me, and I have declared
unto them thy name, all that is necessary to be known of thee.

You see the meaning of the words, The world here is opposed to Jesus Christ
and true believers: So that it is not mundus mundus, but mundus immundus, as
Austin calls it. It is the unbelieving and unsanctified world, says our
Savior, knows not God. He means not, that they know him not at all, but they
know him not aright.

How and in what respects they know him not a right, I shall open by and by; In
the mean time the Point is this.

DOCTRINE. That unbelievers and unsanctified persons know not God, at least
they know him not in such a manner, and with such a knowledge as they ought to
do.
This is the usual Character of such in Scripture: This is the Character of
unbelieving Heathens, they are the Gentiles that know not God, 1 These. 4.5.
This is the Character of unbelieving Christians, they know not God, and obey
not the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1 These. 1.8. So that all unbelieving
and unsanctified persons, whether they be Heathens or professed Christians, are
ignorant of God: yea though they discourse of him, and that excellently too,
and pretend acquaintance with him, as those whom the Apostle mentions, Tit.
1.16. They profess they know God, but in works they deny him. Yea, though they
cry to God, as Israel did, my God, we know thee, while they cast off the thing
that is good; Hosea 8.2, 3. yet they know not God indeed. Their knowledge of
him is not right and sound, and consequently is not worthy of the name of
knowledge, as I shall evidently clear it to you in a few particulars.

etc. know not God in such a manner, and with such a kind of knowledge as they
ought to do, in that they know him not with an affective knowledge, so as to
love him and delight in him. Knowledge in Scripture does connote affection: and
that which carries not the heart and the affections with it, deserves not the
name of knowledge. And therefore men are frequently affirmed in Scripture, not
to know that which they do not like and love. The Ox knows his owner, etc. but
Israel knows not me, says God, Isa. 1.3. Why certainly they knew him, if any
people under Heaven knew him with a discursive and a speculative knowledge. I
but they knew him not with an affective knowledge: Their knowledge of him drew
not out their hearts to him, and therefore in the Lords interpretation and
construction, it was no knowledge: For he says of them expressly, Israel has
not known me.

Romans 2.20. A form of knowledge. There is the show, but not the truth. When
Christ is said in Scripture to have known no sin, we cannot understand it to be
meant of intellectual knowledge, for then he could not have discoursed of it;
so that he knew no sin, in Paul, is, he did no sin, in Peter. They that knew
God, Romans 1.18. because they did not live accordingly, and glorified him not as
God, are therefore said not to have kept him and retained him in their
knowledge, ver. 28. God made his ways and statutes known to Israel, he dealt
not so with any Nation. And yet even of them he says, It is a people that do
err in their hearts, and they have not known my ways, Psalm. 95.10. Brethren,
there is an error in the heart as well as in the brain; and a kind of ignorance
arising from the will, as well as from the understanding, and this takes off
the name of knowledge from that which is but speculation only. And therefore
sinners are universally termed (...) ignorant, erring persons, Heb. 5.2. And
that alone is (by the Holy Ghost) thought worthy of the name of knowledge, that
sinketh from the brain into the heart, and so appears in the life, setting
all on work for God: In which respect it is the Covenant of the Lord with his
people that he will put his Law into their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts. Not in their minds and understandings only the seat and principle of
speculation; but in their hearts the principle of action; So that they shall
not only have it in their minds to know it, but in their hearts to practice it,
and to obey it. This, only this is right knowledge. A good understanding have
all they that do his Commandments, Psalm. 119.10. They only understand and know
the Lord effectually, and savingly, that obey the will of God. Hereby we know
we know him (as we ought to do) if we keep his Commandments. Others may have
understanding, only these have good understanding. For this God sets the finger
of a hand against Josiah, to point him out to special observation, Jer. 22.16.
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; was not this to know me? says the
Lord. q. d. This was knowledge to the purpose, this was true and real knowledge
of the Lord indeed. which made him strict and careful in the performance of
his duty.

In that that they know him not in Christ: and to know God out

But what may be the causes why the unbelieving world is so ignorant

First, for the unbelieving world Heathen, it is no wonder that they know not
God, for they have no means to know him in such a manner as is necessary to
salvation.

Its true that even they have means to know him in a common way, as the Apostle
shows and proves, Romans 1.19, 20. That which may be known (conceive it naturally
known) of God, is manifest to them, that is, the Heathen, for God has showed
it even to them; There is an Image and resemblance of him stamped upon the
Creatures. There are apparent characters, and footsteps and impressions of the
Godhead, of his power and wisdom, set upon every thing which he has made,
which may be looked upon by every eye. How does his glory shine, my brethren,
in the rare and admirable structure of the world, the glorious frame of Heaven
and earth! And hence it is that David says, The Heavens declare the glory of
God, etc. Psalm. 19.1. Indeed he tells us afterward, the Law of the Lord is
perfect. The word of God, and that alone, is a complete and perfect help to
bring us to the knowledge of God. But yet there is some declaration of him in
the Creatures, the Heavens declare the glory of God. And this means the
Heathens have.

The Creatures catechize them and instruct them in the knowledge of a God, as
Job shows, Chap. 12.7. Ask now the Beasts and they shall teach thee, the Fowls
and they shall tell thee, speak to the Earth and it shall teach thee, and
Fishes of the Sea shall declare to thee. Who knows not in all these that the
hand of God has wrought this? And therefore the Apostle tells us that even
they the Heathen knew God, Romans 1.21.

But now they have no means to know him savingly in Christ; And this is life
eternal, to know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.
This knowledge is not written in the Creature Book, and they have not the
Scripture Book, and how then should they come to it? Its true that God is
written in the Creature Book, but not a word of Christ there. God is written in
the Heart Book, but not a word of Christ there neither; The Law is written in
the heart by nature, but there are no impressions of the Gospel, which is the
word of Christ, Col. 3.16. And hence it is that all the Nations of the world
have groped after God and found him too, as Acts 17.27. Let a man run from East
to West, let him ransake all Nations, and where he finds any men, there he
shall find some notice of God.

But now, my Brethren, among which of all these Nations, who never had the book
of Scriptures, shall you find any notice of a Christ, any incling of a Savior
or Redeemer! No, Christ is not so much as named among them, They have no
glimpse, no crevice, to give them any light of God in Christ.

So that it is no wonder, though the unbelieving world Pagan know him not in
this manner, for they have no means to know him.



And without this it is impossible for any man to know God. And therefore the
Apostle prays for the Ephesians that God would give them the spirit of wisdom
and revelation in the knowledge of him. Chap. 1.17. By which he intimates that
without spirit-revelation they could never come to know him.

Now this spirit-revelation, or unveiling, consists in the removal of a double
Veil: the Veil that lies upon the faculty, and the Veil that lies upon the
Object.

1. In the spirit-revelation, which is the only means of knowing God, there
must be the removal of the Veil that lies upon the faculty, the understanding.
The sense must be unveiled, you know, or else we cannot see an object, though
it be before us. For what can a blindfolded person see? And so it is in this
case: for every unbelieving person is blindfolded as it were: the God of this
world has blinded his eyes: The Veil is on their heart, that is their
understanding, 2 Cor. 3, 15. And this Veil the Holy Ghost must take away; as in
the cited place, or else though God be by a man, (as certainly he is not far
from every one of us) he will not see him. But when once this is removed, then
revelata ac detecta facie, as Beza reads it, Then we with open and uncovered
face behold the glory of the Lord.

2. In that spirit-revelation, which is the only means of knowing God, there
must be the removal of the Veil that lies upon the Object; as of the Veil that
lies upon the understanding, so of the Veil that lies upon the Gospel, where
God is represented to us in a saving way. For you must know (my brethren) that
the Gospel is a veiled and a covered thing, it has a Curtain drawn before it:
It is a mystery, a secret thing. Nay it is not only secret in it self, but it
is also kept secret. Nor (...), but (...), for that is the term that the
Apostle uses, Col. 1.26. Not simply dark, or mystical, but hid on purpose, de
industria, as Theophilacta observes. Among the Jews it was covered with a veil
of types and figures and dark expressions: And to this day it is hid from
natural and carnal men, 2 Cor. 4.3. So that however God in Christ be clearly
manifested there, let them do what they are able, still there is something
between them and God that hides him from them, that they cannot see him. And
that is the first reason, why unbelieving Christians know not God, because they
want the inward means of this knowledge, viz. spirit-revelation.

And as they want the inward means of finding out this knowledge,

1. In every unbeliever there is somewhat that repells divine knowledge, and
that keeps out the beams of truth. And that is carnal reasoning, and carnal
wisdom, (...), Romans 8.7. The wondrous perspicuity and sharpness of conceit that
is in any man (that is but flesh) is so far from helping him to know God, that
it does but hinder him. And the ground is evident; for such a person leanes to
his own wisdom, he does not yield himself up to be taught of God, but weighs
those things that are divine and supernatural in the balance of his reason. As
far as that will reach, he is content to go: And where that fails him (as
infinitely short it falls) there he desists: and what he is unable to perceive
by this, is foolishness to him, as 1 Cor. 2.14. The natural man receives not
the things of God, for they are foolishness unto him. They are not so indeed
and in themselves, they are but so to him. He is too wise to take in such
foolish things: and therefore the Apostle says, not many wise, 1 Cor. 1.16.
and tells us plainly, that if we ever mean to attain to saving knowledge, we
must be renewed in the spirit of our mind, Ephesians. 1.24. that is, in the highest,
purest and the most refined part of it. As spirits are the quintessence of
things, that are most abstract from dross, and that have least of earth in
them; Even these must be renewed, or saving knowledge will not be received.

2. In every unbeliever and unsanctified person, as there is something
redundant, that repells divine knowledge; so there is something wanting to
receive it, and that is the spirit of God. Saving truths are often called the
things of the spirit, as 1 Cor. 2.14. Now (my beloved) the things of our own
spirits (carnal, natural and worldly things) our own spirits will take in: but
the things of Gods spirit, Gods spirit only will take in. Though they be
brought home to our doors, if Gods spirit be not there to take them in if he be
not at home to entertain them, and receive them, it is all to no purpose. And
this is the case of the natural man: he has not the spirit of God, and
therefore he receives not the things of the spirit, because he has no
principle within him that is agreeable and suitable unto them. And this is that
which the Apostle aims at, when he says, we speak wisdom to them that are
perfect, 1 Cor. 2.6. That is, to them that have all the parts of a spiritual
man (whereof the spirit is the principal) the doctrine which we teach is
accounted wisdom. But (...), the animal man, the souly man, the man that has a
soul indeed, but no spirit, (I mean none of Gods spirit) he perceives not these
things, nor can he know them. And why so? because they are spiritually
discerned. And he poor man, has not the spirit to discern them by. And
therefore though he hear the words of God and Christ, he never knows the mind
of God or Christ, as it is added in the end of that Chapter.

Psalm 82.5. They are wilfully ignorant, as 2 Pet. 3.5. God comes and shows
himself to them, and they say to God, Depart from us, for we will not the
knowledge of thy ways. Light is offered, and they shut their eyes against it;
So that it may be said of such, Their eyes have they closed, lest they should
see with their eyes. They need not to ascend up into heaven to bring God down
from thence, that they may see him. No, the word that manifests and reveals
God, is nigh to them, Romans 10.6. They need not to go far to hear it, and to
hear of God in it: But many will not step out of their doors to meet with God,
and to be acquainted with him!

If any light break in upon them, by which they have a glimpse of God, they
even thrust it out again. They do as the Gentiles did, Romans 1.19. they liked
not to retain God in their knowledge. They had him there, but they liked not to
retain him, they had no mind to keep him there: feign they would put him out
again, the apprehension of a God called upon them for love and duty and
obedience, and was a curb and a restraint from many evils, and therefore they
were weary of such thoughts as those, and sought to chase them from their
minds. To say the truth, they did not like them, and therefore would be rid of
them: And thus it is with many Christians. These are the reasons why
unbelieving and unsanctified persons know not God.

Jer 10.28. are made the object of a fearful imprecation: yea the ignorant of
God among the Heathen, who are deprived of the means, (though not of all, yet)
at the least of any saving knowledge of him: and yet the Prophet prays, Pour
out thy fury upon the heathen that have not known thee: And what then will
become of the ignorant of God among Christans? If ignorance of God, (yea though
it be invincible) expose men to the vengeance of the Lord, and damn them
everlastingly, because the knowledge of him is required necessitate medii to
salvation: what will it do if it be wilful and affected? If Jeremy desire the
Lord to pour his fury on the heathen, who yet have not so much as the outward
means of knowledge; What rivers and what floods of indignation think you will
be poured out on them who have the means and will not learn nor be instructed
by them? what will they do when the day of judgment comes? when the Lord Jesus
shall be revealed from heaven, etc. rendering vengeance to them that know not
God. as 2 These. 1.4.8. I beseech you think upon it and lay it seriously to
heart, you that have long enjoyed the means, and yet know very little of the
nature or the will of God. Or if you know with a notional discoursive
knowledge, you know him not with an affective and effective knowledge: You
glorify him not as God, you do not walk according to your knowledge of him:
And so your knowledge is as good as no knowledge; You may, and many do delude
themselves with this conceit, that though they dye in this condition, the Lord
notwithstanding will be merciful to them. But as you tender the salvation of
your precious souls, I beseech you to observe that Gods own word is peremptory
and express for this, that none that know not God, shall have any share in the
mercy of God, or in the glory of the world to come. Oh continue thy loving
kindness to them that know thee, (to them and none but them) says David, Psalm.
36.10. It is a people of no understanding, says the Prophet of the Jews, Isa.
27.11. And what follows? Therefore he that made them will have no mercy upon
them. It is the common apprehension of vulgar and ignorant people, that he that
made them will save them too: No, says the Prophet: if they be ignorant of
God, he that made them will not have mercy upon them. They have not known my
ways says God, unto whom I swear in my wrath, that they should never enter
into my rest.

But you will ask me then, By what means shall we come to know God?

Truly there is but one way of coming to the knowledge of him, No man has seen
God at any time, 1 John 18. What then? is he not to be seen or known at all, by
any means? Yes, though he be not to be seen, or known immediately in himself,
yet mediately in and by the Son he may be known: For he has manifested and
revealed him to us. No man has seen God at any time: the only begotten Son
that came out of the bosom of the Father he has declared him. Indeed it was
the business for which our Savior came into this lower world, to bring God
down to us, that we might be acquainted with him: And if ever you see or know
God, you must have light from Jesus Christ. I am the light, says he, John
8.12. He that follows me, shall have the light of life. And therefore if you
would have this light, follow Jesus Christ for it. How you must follow him, so
as to fetch this light from him, I have directed you before on the third verse
of this Chapter.

Is it so, that unbelievers and unsanctified persons know not God? Oh Righteous
Father, the world has not known thee, but we have known thee. O Lord, whence
is this to us? how is it Lord that thou do manifest thy self to us and not
unto the world, as the Disciples said, John 14.22. How comes this to pass Lord?
Truly this is free grace and free-mercy; mercy to be admired and wondered at. Oh
let our souls and all that is within us, bless the Lord: Let us take up our
Saviors words, Father, we thank thee that thou have hid thy self from a world
of wise and prudent men, and have revealed thy self to such babes as we are. We
bless thy name for this mercy.

And truly we have cause to bless him: for this knowledge is our life: keep it,
for it is thy life, says Solomon, Prove. 4.13. and life is a precious thing. If
we had still remained in the condition that the world is in, we had never known
God: we must have died to all eternity: we had been punished with eternal
perdition: we could never have enjoyed him who is the God of our life: But now
we know him so as to love him, we shall be sure to live with him, and that for
ever: Nay this is life, yea life eternal, (in regard of the beginning,) such a
life as is above the power of death and dissolution, as our Savior Christ
assures us, John 17.3. This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and
Jesus Christ whom thou have sent.

JOHN 17.25. But I have known thee, and these have known, etc.


AND thus of what our Savior speaks against the world, Oh Righteous Father,
the world has not known thee.

Proceed we to know what he speaks for himself and true believers, But I have
known thee, and these have known that thou have sent me.

There is no difficulty in the terms requiring any tedious explication. I have
known thee, says our Savior to the Father: though the world be strangers to
thee, yet I am very well acquainted with thee, I know thee inwardly: And my
Disciples here have known that thou have sent me. They have been thoroughly
persuaded that I am a messenger sent forth from thee, to manifest thy nature
and thy will to them, which I have done accordingly: I have declared to them
thy name, So they have known thee by my means.

So that the special thing to be observed here (my brethren,) is the order in
which the knowledge of the Father is dispensed. First Christ the Mediator knows
him, he is acquainted with him in the first place: I know thee, says our
Savior here; And then Believers are acquainted with him by the means of
Christ; And these have known that thou have sent me, and I have declared unto
them thy name. The Observation then is this.

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ, and he alone knows God immediately, and others
know him by the means of Christ.
All saving knowledge of the Father comes out by Jesus Christ to his people
Christ knows him first, and then we know him in the second place by him. No man
has seen God at any time, John 1.18. What then? is he not to be seen or known
at all by any means? Yes, though he be not to be seen or known by us
immediately in himself, yet mediately in and by the Son he may be known: for he
has manifested and revealed him to us. No man has seen God at any time. The
only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
Indeed it was the business for which our Savior came into this lower world, to
bring God down to us, that we might be acquainted with him. Ye neither know me
nor my Father, says our Savior to the Jews, John 8.19. If ye had known me, ye
should have known my Father also. q. d. I would have brought you to the
knowledge of my Father. And as the Book in Apoc. 5.9. had still remained a
sealed Book, unless the Lamb had opened it: so God had still remained a
concealed God: he had never been discovered and manifested to us in a saving
way, unless the Son himself had done it. So that the Point is plain you see,
That Jesus Christ, and he alone knows God immediately, and others know him by
the means of Christ.

And therefore in the first place, this may serve for information, to let

Is it so that Jesus Christ and he alone knows God immediately, and the book of
the Scriptures, hearing, reading, meditation will be unavailable, unless Christ
strike in with them: When you have done your utmost, you will die in ignorance
of God, and so be lost to all eternity. And therefore I beseech you my Beloved,
betake your selves to Jesus Christ the great Prophet of the Church, be his
Disciples, learn of him. Tell him that he knows the Father, as he professes in
my Text, and so beseech him earnestly to make him known to you, that you may
also be acquainted with him. Pray him as Philip does, Joh. 14.8. Lord, show us
the Father and it suffices us.

And thus far we have seen to whom our Savior speaks, and what he speaks. In
the first place against the world, and in the second place for himself and true
believers; Oh righteous Father, the world has not known thee, but I have known
thee, and these have known that thou have sent me. They have been thoroughly
persuaded that I am a Messenger, and an Ambassador sent forth from thee, to
manifest thy Nature, and thy Will to them.

Now in the following verse he comes to show that he has been, and will be
faithful in the delivery of the message which his Father sent him in, together
with the reason of it. First, he declares that he has been, and will be
faithful in the delivery of the message which his Father sent him in; I have
declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it. Secondly, he shows the reason
of it, why he has been, and will be so; That the love wherewith thou have
loved me, may be in them, and I in them.

Begin we with the first of these, in which our Savior shows; First That he
has been faithful; then that he will be faithful as the Messenger of God.
First that he has been faithful; I have declared unto them thy Name; But this
is for the sense, and almost for the words, the very same that he had said
before in the 6. verse of this Chapter. There it is (...), and here it is
(...), and so accordingly there it is rendered I have manifested thy Name, here
I have declared thy Name. The phrase is varyed, but the sense is one. And
therefore I shall wholly wave it here, and pass from that which Christ has
done, to that which he will further do, of which he makes no mention in the
former verse; I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it.

Whether this resolution of our Savior to make a further declaration of his
Fathers Name, relate to his Apostles and Disciples then about him only: or else
to such as should believe in after times to the end of the world, is all the
difficulty in the words; whether his meaning be, I have declared unto them thy
Name, to those Apostles and Disciples, present with me, and will declare it:
that is, I will declare it further to them, to the very same men: Or whether it
be rather this, I have declared unto them thy Name, to them that are now about
me; and will declare it unto others, that in after ages shall come in to me. I
have declared it unto these by my own immediate voice, and will declare it unto
others, by them and their successors to the end of the world.

As for my own part, I see no reason why either of these Expositions should be
laid aside, seeing both of them agree with the Analogy of Faith, and with the
scope and series of the Text. And since it is most consonant to the
accomplishment and execution of the Prophetical office of Christ, to be
continually teaching those that are bestowed upon him by the Father, in all
Ages, Teaching them further whom he has begun to teach, and teaching other men
anew, to the end of the world.

But you will interpose and ask me, How can this be meant of the Apostles and
Disciples then about our Savior, in the sense before expressed? I have
declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it further to them, since we have
understood the first words of a full discovery. If when our Savior says, I
have declared unto them thy Name, his meaning be, I have declared it fully to
them, (as I have formerly explained it,) how can he add, I will declare it
further to them?

Very well, if things be rightly and distinctly understood. necessitate medii,
to salvation. And here he adds I will declare thee further to them, as to many
other things that are yet concealed from them. I have declared thee fully to
them as to the foundation, or to the fundamental knowledge of thee: I will
declare thee further to them, as to the superstructure upon that foundation. I
have declared thee fully to them, as to what I am my self to teach them with my
own immediate voice before my passion. I will declare thee further to them
after my resurrection (when he continued forty days discoursing with them) and
further after my Ascension, when I will send down my Spirit to them, to teach
them all things, and to lead them into all truth: So then the point to be
observed is this:

DOCTRINE. They that have the Name of God, his Nature, and his Will, savingly
declared to them, have yet defects and imperfections in their knowledge of him,
so that they stand in need of further Declaration.
The Name of God was so far manifested and declared to these Apostles and
Disciples as was necessary to salvation. So far our Savior had fully and
completely made it known to them, he had concealed nothing from them of his
Fathers Name, in the ignorance of which whosoever dies must perish: For they
were in the state of grace, and of salvation, when he spoke those words, I have
declared unto them thy Name. And yet he adds presently (you see) I will
declare it, I will make further declarations and discoveries of thy Name to
them. And so accordingly he did as soon as he was risen from the dead, He showed
himself alive to them, being seen of them forty days together, Act. 1.3. And
what did he in that time? Why he instructed them in things concerning God, and
his Kingdom, as you may see in that place. And when he was ascended into
Heaven, he was mindful of his promise, which he had often made to them, and so
accordingly dispatched the Holy Spirit down among them to lead them further
onward in the knowledge of the Father.

Indeed the best are Novices in this regard, they have not yet attained to a
perfect man in point of holy and divine knowledge, as Ephesians. 4.13. It is true,
there is a great deal of variety among the Saints, as well in this as other
graces, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, Ephesians. 4.7. But in the
best it is a measure, and no more; it is not fullness and perfection. He that
has most of God revealed to him, yet knows him but in part; and he that has
the clearest sight of him, sees him but darkly in a glass, as 1 Cor. 13.12. And
therefore this is called the seeing of the back parts of the Lord; as when we
see the back parts of a man, we know him but by guess only: we know him not so
perfectly and so distinctly as when we come to see his face. Such a sight of
God it is that we attain in this world. And therefore the Apostle Paul, who in
this point of holy and divine knowledge was not behind the very chiefest
Apostles, who had his Raptures and his Ecstasies, and who was taken up into the
third Heaven, and had such things revealed to him as were not to be uttered by
the tongue of man, professes notwithstanding that he had not yet attained, nor
was he yet perfect, But, says he, I follow after, that I may apprehend, Phil.
3.12. So that he was Viator, and not Comprehensor; he was in the condition that
the people were, Hos. 6.3. he followed on to know the Lord. The people of
Coloss were eminent for grace and knowledge, and yet for them it is the Apostle
prays, That they might increase in the knowledge of God, Col. 1.10. So that the
point is plain, as you see; They that have the Name of God, his Nature and his
Will savingly, etc.

That it should seem by some expressions in the Scriptures, that God has been
revealed fully to some certain men in this life, as to Jacob for an instance,
Genesis 32.30. and to Moses, Numb. 12.8. With him will I speak says God, mouth to
mouth, even apparently, not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord
shall he behold.

Sol.
But this, my Brethren, must be understood comparatively of the more clear and
full discovery of the Lord to Jacob and to Moses, then to many other men; but
as for the perfect sight and knowledge of him, this was not imparted, neither
to Jacob nor to Moses; and for the latter, God himself affirms expressly, Thou
shall not see my face, says he to Moses, Exodus 33.10. that is the fullness of
my glory; for none shall see my face and live; That is reserved to the state of
glory, when we shall see God face to face, as the Scripture phrase is; when we
shall know as we are known; And this is that which Schoolmen call the
beatifical vision, wherein consists the main of our beatitude hereafter, as
Matthew. 5.8. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God: He does not
say, they do see him, but they shall see God; which the Apostle makes the great
ingredient in the happiness and glory prepared for the Saints at the time of
Christ's appearing, 1 John 3.2. We know that when we shall appear, he shall be
like him, and we shall see him as he is; Now we see him as we may; then we
shall see him as he is.

But why have they who have the Name of God savingly declared to them, defects
and imperfections in their knowledge? Why does not Jesus Christ in whom are
hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and that for the
accommodation of his members, furnish and supply them? Why does he not as soon
as he begins to teach them, declare all his Fathers Name to them, but keeps
back something still, for further discovery? There are two special reasons of
it, to name no more at this time.

Christ does not show them all at once, because they are not capable of I have
many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now; I am to say them,
but you cannot bear them now, and therefore I will take some other time to
reveal those things to you.

Christ does not show them all at once, that he may keep his Saints Jacob; he
gave him a gift, but left behind him a lameness withal that accompanied the
gift: So Christ bestows upon us some degrees of knowledge, but leaves withal
some imperfections and defects, that we may be kept humble, and that we may not
swell with self-attributions.

Now to descend to Application: In the first place, let it have the same etc.
Shall that we have received, lift us up? and shall not that in which we are
defective, cast us down? Have we not far greater cause to be abased in the
contemplation of the one, then to be exalted in the contemplation of the other?
Indeed if we were absolute in this respect, and if (as the Apostle speaks) we
understood all mysteries, and all knowledge, there were some color then,
though yet no just occasion to be proud. But now it is the greatest folly in
the world to strout and brave it in a back half naked, and half covered with
borrowed feathers.

Well then my Brethren, let us do as the Apostle did in this case: Let us
forget the things that are behind, and look on to the things that are before
us: Let us consider with our selves how short we fall, and how far we are to
seek in main things concerning God, which we are bound to know: How ignorant we
are, how ill we have improved our time and means; and if this do not take us
down, how justly may we perish in our pride?



Why, thou have heard, that they that have the Name of God declared to them,
have yet defects and imperfections in their knowledge: So that however thou art
much to seek in many things, and thou art exceedingly defective in thy
knowledge, thou may be savingly enlightened notwithstanding: And to uphold thy
heart in this particular, consider

This people which knows not the Law is accursed; Alas they are a company of
sots to us, they know nothing. But saving knowledge makes man humble, more
humble then he was before he had it. They that are endued with it, thought
better of themselves before Conversion, before they had one glimpse of this
enlightening, then now they do.

And hence you shall observe in Scripture, that they that have excelled most in
knowledge, have had lowest apprehensions of themselves. None have complained so
much of their corruption, blindness, ignorance as they have done. Agur was an
exceeding wise and knowing man, yet he professes that he had not the knowledge
of a man in him. He does not say that he had not the knowledge of a Saint in
him, but he had not the knowledge of a man in him; he was a beast in regard of
understanding. And holy David though eminent in this regard, yet was not puffed
up, Psalm. 131.1. No, he bewayls his ignorance exceedingly, and says he was in
this respect as a beast before God, Psalm. 73.22. And most remarkable is that of
Job, Job 42.5, 6. Heretofore I heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; I have
had in former times a dark remote confused knowledge of thee; I saw thee at a
distance, as it were a great way off; but now I have a clearer and distincter
knowledge of thee; and what was the event and issue of it? Now I abhor my self
in dust and ashes. So that if the degrees of knowledge which thou have (be they
great or be they small) do humble thee, and make thee little in thine own eyes,
it is a comfortable evidence that it is sound.

Whatsoever thy degrees of knowledge be, consider they are such as To every one
(yea to him that has the least) is given grace according to the measure of the
gift of Christ, Ephesians. 4.7. as he is pleased to distribute and proportion. The
body mystical is ordered so, that every member has a fit share: To some he
gives out greater measures and degrees of knowledge, the eminency of their
station calls for it; to thee perhaps he has communicated less, because he
sees that less will be sufficient for thee: From whom the whole body according
to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase, Ephesians.
4.16. Observe it well, my brethren, every member has his measure. The leg, the
arm, the little finger, are not all alike, but all according to their measure,
and so there is a decent and due proportion.

The time is drawing on a pace, when these defects and imperfections That which
is perfect is to come, though it be not yet come, 1 Cor. 13.10. when we shall
clearly understand those mysteries which Angels pryed into, but could not
fathom; even when we shall be ravished from our selves, in sweetest
contemplations of the glorious Godhead: when, as our Savior tells us, we shall
see God, and see him face to face, as the Apostle speaks; Now we see him in a
glass, but then face to face; 1 Cor. 13.12. now we know God in part only, then
we shall know as we are known; Now we see his back parts only, but then we
shall behold (as far as finite creatures may be capable) the fullness of his
glory.

Consider that the glorious recompense which is to be dispensed in the He will
give to every man (not according to his knowledge, but) according to his works:
To them who by patient continuance in well doing, seek glory and honor, and
immortality, says the Apostle; Romans 2.7. (To them who do, and do well, and
continue doing well, and patiently continue doing well, yea though they suffer
evil for well doing) the Lord will render eternal life.

JOHN 17.26. And will declare it.


AND thus far of the first part of our Saviors resolution, to make a further
declaration of his Fathers Name, in reference to his Apostles and Disciples
then about him; I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it further
to them, to the very same men.

Proceed we to the Second Member of his Resolution, to make a further
delaration of his Fathers Name in reference to other men, to whom he had not
yet at all declared it. I have declared unto them thy Name, to these Apostles
and Disciples now about me, and will declare it further yet to other men both
in the present and the future ages. This act of mine shall be a constant and
continued act; as long as there are any people in the world, I will not cease
declaring of thy Name to them. And so accordingly the point shall be;

DOCTRINE. That Jesus Christ will be continually making further declarations of
his Fathers Name, to other Nations, and to other persons, to the end of the
world.
He will be still declaring it to those that have not heard of it, that have
not been acquainted with his Fathers name: Teaching new scholars still to spell
it and to understand it, in every Generation while the World endures. And as
he is a King for ever, as long as there are any further people to be ruled: and
as he is a Priest for ever, as the Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 110.4. as long as
there are any further people to be saved and redeemed: So he is a Prophet for
ever, as long as there are any further people to be taught. Every age shall
have experience of the blessed fruits of the Prophetical Office of Christ, in
giving some the knowledge of his Fathers Name, who till then were strangers to
him.

For clearing of the point, I shall a little more distinctly show you, that
Jesus Christ will be continually making further Declarations of his Fathers
Name. In the first place to other Nations: And in the second place to other
persons to the end of the world.

Canaanitish woman, Matthew. 15.24. I am not sent but to the lost Sheep of the
house of Israel; I am to be my Fathers Messenger to them, and none but them
immediately in my own person. If I go further, I exceed my bounds; For till the
resurrection of our Savior, the partition wall between the Jews and Gentiles
was not broken down: And so accordingly he preached not peace, he did not
manifest that sweet part of his Fathers Name to those that were afar off,
neither by himself, nor by his Ministers, till after that time, as the Apostle
Paul insinuates, Ephesians. 2.14, 15, 16, 17. And therefore when he sent forth his
Apostles, Mat. 10.5. his express injunction was, Go not into the way of the
Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go ye rather to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Which course or method the Apostles in
the first place very carefully observed, as you may see, Act. 13.15. It was
necessary, says Paul and Barnabas to the Jews, that the Word of God the Gospel
(in which the Fathers name is manifested and made known to men) should first of
all be preached unto you.

But since that time he has declared it by his Ministers to other Nations. To
whom his last Commission was, Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to
every creature, Mark. 16.15. Go ye and teach all Nations, Mat. 28.19. And in
pursuance of this Commission and command of his, even the Apostles while they
lived, did spread it far and wide. The Scripture story seems to hint it to us,
Mark. 16. ult. where after the forementioned Mandate of our Savior, it is
immediately observed by the Evangelist, that they went forth and preached
everywhere. And the Apostle Paul reports, that himself alone had filled with
the Gospel all the Country from Jerusalem, even round about unto Illyricum;
yea, that he strived to preach it where Christ was not so much as named, Romans
15.19, 20. You may suppose the rest of the Apostles were not idle in their
places: The stories of the Church give in some Testimonies to it; For Stapleton
reports of Thomas that he preached to the Indians; and Clemens says there is
no Nation, either Grecian or Barbarian, among whom prayers are not made in the
Name of Jesus: And so to whom God is not manifested as a Father in his Son
Christ. But yet we are not to conclude from this, an universal Declaration of
the Name of God to every people, Island, Nation in the world, in the times of
the Apostles. For since their days, Christ has revealed it to many Countries,
and to many people.

And yet at this day there are many Nations that have not heard of God in
Christ; That Name of his has not been declared to them: But to them he will
declare it before the consummation of the world; they shall all hear of it; The
Gospel (says our Savior) shall be preached to all the world, and then shall
the end come, Mat. 24.14. So it behooves that remission should be preached in
his Name, and that among all Nations, Luke 24 47. There is a fullness of the
Gentiles yet to be brought in, by this discovery of the Fathers Name: which
Christ will certainly accomplish in his own time; He has begun of late to
manifest it to the Indians in America, and he will certainly go on with that
work, till all the People, Languages, and Nations in the world do serve the
Lord: till the ends of all the world do turn to him, and all the Kindreds of
the earth do worship before him: And till he be Governor in all Nations, Psalm.
22.27, 28. You see then Jesus Christ will be continually making further
Declarations of his Fathers name to other Nations: still it is, I have declared
it, and I will declare it, with reference to other Nations.

Ephesians. 1.10. when all things shall be gathered into one, which are in heaven,
and which are on earth. So that you see my brethren, Jesus Christ will be
continually making further declarations of his Fathers Name to other Nations
and to other persons. But how will he make these further declarations?
Brethren, he will not do it in his own person, or by his own immediate voice:
But he will do it other ways.

1. By his written word and Ministers in all ages: for that which they declare
in his name and by authority from him, Jesus Christ himself declares. To this
end Christ has set some in the Church, some Ministers of all sorts, as the
Apostle tells us, 1 Cor. 12.28. And that is out of all dispute in the universal
Church, which is not limited to any Country, or to any age. That so there
might be continually some in all Churches and in all ages, to publish what is
to be manifested of his Father. And hence said Christ to his Apostles, Mat.
28.20. Lo, I am with you to the end of the world. They were not to continue for
their own parts by many hundred years so long: And therefore it must also
stretch to those who were to follow them in the office, and the work of Gospel
preaching, till it be published universally to all Nations, in the outward
promulgation, and in the inward and effectual revelation to all persons to whom
it is appointed so to be revealed: Which was not done, you know, by the
Apostles: it was but begun by them, and must be carrried on, till it be
finished, by other Ministers to the end of the world. And therefore when our
Savior Christ ascended, and consequently could no longer teach his Church
immediately in his own person, he gave gifts unto men, such gifts as he never
gave before: And he gave some Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists: Some temporary,
some perpetual, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry.
How long? Till we all come (all that are chosen, whether Jews or Gentiles) in
the unity of the Faith, unto a perfect man. So that the Ministry shall be
continued, till all be gathered into Christ, that shall be gathered, and that
is till the end of the world.

2. Christ makes these further declarations of his Fathers name in every age;
by his spirit. As he declares it outwardly to other persons by his word, so he
declares it inwardly to other persons by his spirit, to his elect in every age
to the end of the world. And therefore when our Savior Christ withdrew his
corporal and fleshly presence, he sent his spirit down to teach his people, to
lead them into all truth: And by that spirit he declares his Fathers name, and
will do to the worlds end. And he assured his Apostles in the place even now
alleged, Mat. 28.20. when he was even about to leave them, as to his fleshly
presence with them, Lo, I am with you always, viz. by my spirit, to the end of
the world. That is, with you and such as you are, with you and your Successors
still in every age, as long as the world endures. Go ye therefore and teach
all Nations, and my spirit shall be with you: So that what you teach all
without, he shall teach my elect within, powerfully and with success, till the
last man be gathered in: And then shall the end come.

Is it so that Jesus Christ will be continually making further declarations of
his Fathers name to other Nations and to other persons to the end of the world?

1. Let us give him so much credit as to believe what he has spoken. And
though it seem improbable that Christ should manifest his Fathers name to all
Nations: That all the Countries in the world should come to know him, and to
be acquainted with him: yet seeing Christ has undertaken it, and bound himself
by faithful promise to his Father, that as he has declared his name already,
so he will be continually making further declarations of it to other persons
and to other Nations, let us say Amen to it. As Mary sometimes, when she had
staggerd at the difficulty of the Promise, at length recovered out of that fit
of unbelief, and set the seal of faith to it, Be it according to thy word.

2. Let our hearts be full of hope, in reference to this business. Since Christ
has undertaken it, let us expect the execution of it. Our Saviors words (my
brethren) are a promise to the Father, what he will do in after times for his
people: Says he, I will declare thy name to them. And therefore as it is our
duty to believe the promise, so to expect the good things promised. To be
continually in a waiting frame, looking and harkning after the accomplishment
of this eximious work of his, spying if we can see the day break, and the
Fathers name shine forth to other Nations, who never had a glimsp of it by any
Gospel Revelation, till in the end from the rising of the Sun unto the going
down of the same, his name be great among the Gentiles, according to that
Prophecy relating to these latter times and ages of the world, Mal. 1.11.

3. Let us strive with Christ in prayer, that he would make good the word that
he has spoken to the Father before so many witnesses. Oh my beloved, when ye
look on many Heathen Nations that yet are overwhelmed in ignorance and Egyptian
darkness, that yet know nothing of the Fathers name; when you look on many
Christians in profession, that yet are even in as bad a case as they, some of
which it may be have relation to your selves: go to Jesus Christ and say, O
Lord, thou have professed that thou will declare thy Fathers name to other
persons, and to other Nations, to the end of the world. Lord, there are such
Nations, there are such persons who yet are strangers to the Father; who know
no more of God in Christ, then the very beasts that perish: O be entreated to
declare thy Fathers name to them. Lord, manifest the Father to them, that they
may know him to salvation.

4. Let our hearts be full of joy while we are looking forward to the
accomplishment of this work. O let it cheer our spirits, under all the sinking
damps and deep discouragements that are upon them, in relation to the Church,
to think in what a blessed state and glorious posture she will be, when Christ
shall have declared his Fathers name to all the Nations under heaven, when the
Jews shall be converted, and when the fullness of the Gentiles shall come in: Oh
my beloved, that will be a joyful time indeed. Its true, those times, my
brethren, shall be very comfortable and full of gladness many ways. And this
is not the least, that people shall be brougbt in to the knowledge of the Lord
out of all the quarters of the world, and that by heaps and multitudes. And
when they come, th^^ shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing, as the
Psalmist speaks, Psalm. 45.15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be
brought. And truly they that have the happiness to live in those days, cannot
but be extremely taken with it, when they behold the Fathers name declared to
the people of the Jews, and to such multitudes of Nations of the Gentiles, so
that they shall come thronging in so fast as if they were in haste to be
acquainted with him, and to know more of him: Oh they will be an end at this,
and their hearts will leap within them. There was never such a time since the
foundation of the world, nor shall be till that blessed season come: and
therefore let our souls rejoice in the foresight of it, though we never live to
see it.

And thus far of our Savior faithfullness, in the delivery of his Fathers
Errand, in the discovery of his Fathers name to his people. He has been
faithful and will be faithful in it. In the remainder of the verse, he shows
the end and reason of it, why he has been so, and will be so, That the love
wherewith thou have loved me, may be in them, and I in them.

It is a very great question, whether believers be intended here to be the
objects, or the subjects of the love our Savior mentions. Whether the name of
God be manifested to them to this end, that they may be beloved by him, or to
this end that they may love him. I must acknowledge, all Interpreters almost
that I have seen, make them the objects, not the subjects of this love, That
the love wherewith thou have loved me may be in them; That is, say they, may
reach to them, or come to them: their meaning is so as to lay hold upon them,
and embrace them. In plainer terms, that thou may love them with the love
wherewith thou have loved me, with the very same affection.

Against this Exposition there are two Exceptions, to which I must confess I
know not how to give a clear Solution. For First, If this were the intention of
our Savior, I have declared unto them thy name, that thou may love them, he
would have said in probability, That thy love may be toward them, or That thy
love may be upon them, rather then That thy love (...) (as here we have it) may
be in them. This is a strange expression to say My love is in a man, when my
intention is, I love him, or I have set my love upon him. But secondly, if when
our Savior Savior says that thy love may be in them, his meaning be, That
thou may love them: how shall this be the end of his forementioned delaration
of his Fathers name, as it is clearly made in this place? I have declared unto
them thy name, and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou have loved me,
may be in them: That thou may love them with the love wherewith thou have
loved me. Does Christ declare his Fathers name to men, his love, his mercy to
this end that he may love them? Is this a proper means to that end? for God to
be made known to men, that God may love them whom he is made known to?
Brethren, God does not love men because his name is manifested and declared to
them, but men love him upon that ground, and for that reason: the declaration
of his name to them, is a means to make them love him.

And therefore I must needs crave leave to think the latter Exposition
probable, by which believers are made the subjects of the love here mentioned,
I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it, that the love
wherewith thou have loved me may be in them as in the subjects of it: That the
love which is originally in thy self as in the fountain (as all other graces
are) may be communicated and dispensed from thee to them, and become inherent
in them.

You know my Brethren, we are said to be partakers of the divine nature, 2 Pet.
1.4. not by participation of the essence, but by communication of the
properties of God, when the communicable properties of God, as holiness and
love and wisdom, are dispenst to us. So here our Savior prays his Father,
that the love wherewith he has loved Christ, may be given down from him into
the hearts of his people, that they may have that very property in them also.

And to this end says Christ, I have declared thy name, thy mercy, goodness,
love to them, that this love may be wrought in them. That by this means their
hearts may be enflamed, and filled with the love of thee: That they may have
the love of thee in them, as the Apostle has the very Phrase, 1 John 3.17. How
dwells the love of God in him? So here, that the love wherewith thou have
loved me, that very property may be in them, by way of derivation from thee,
and that by the revealing of thy name to them.

If this be our Saviors meaning, as I can see no other for the present, the
Observations will be two. First, The love which is in true believers, comes
from God. The love wherewith true believers love, is in a sense the same
wherewith God himself loves: Or the love wherewith God loves, is in a sense in
true believers. Secondly, The declaration of the Fathers name to them, is the
great means that begets love in them.

DOCTRINE. The love which is in true Believers comes from God.
The love wherewith he loves, is in them, says our Savior in my text. viz.
by way of dispensation from him. Love is originally, primitively and
essentially in the Lord, and from him it is given down into the hearts of true
believers. This is part of the divine nature, which they are made partakers of,
as the Apostle speaks, 2 Pet. 1.4. This is a print of his Image, whereby they
are conformed to God, and made suitable to God, when they love as he does; And
consequently, as he is, such are they in this world. So that when an enlightened
eye looks first on God, and sees that he does love, that he is love, and then
looks on the believer, and sees this grace of love communicated and dispensed
from God to him, he finds that he is such a one as God is: That he is like God
in this world, though he shall be better like him in the world that is to come:
This is a beam of his light (as other saving graces are) it comes down from the
Father of lights, as the Apostle James speaks, Chap. 1.17. And as the stars
shine with a borrowed Luster, even so do believers too. If there be this, or
any other brightness in them, it is a beam of the divinity, a streak and ray of
the divine glory. They shine because their light is come, viz. from God, and
the glory of the Lord is risen upon them, Isa. 60.1. And in a word this is a
stream of his fountain, which runs down from God to us: All our fresh springs
are in him, as the Prophet David speaks, Psalm. 87.7. and consequently all our
streams of living waters are from him. First the springs of our streams are in
him, and then the streams of his springs are in us. The love wherewith he
loves, is in us.

So that God does not only teach us love, as the Apostle says, ye are taught
of God to love, 1 These. 4.9. but more then so, he gives us love. He does not
only teach it as a Master, but he bestows it as a Donour and Dispenser; Yea, as
a Donour of himself to us; for when he gives us love, he gives us down himself
in some measure; And therefore by this love he is said to dwell in us; Mark
that Expression of the Apostle John, 1. Epist. 4.10. God is love, and he that
dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him, God is love properly,
essentially (for whatsoever is attributed to God is God,) and he is the
Original and Fountain of that love that is communicated to the Creature, and by
this love he dwells in us. So that whoever has this love in him, has God in
him; God in the beam, as we are wont to say; The room that has the beam in it,
has the Sun in it; That place of the Apostle John is full, 1 Epist. 4.7. Love
is of God, says he, and every one that loves is born of God, while he
participates in this of Gods nature, even as the Son is made partaker of the
nature of the Father. The Point you see is fully proved, The love which is in
true believers, comes from God.

Romans 1.30. as in diverse other places of the Scripture. Indeed it seems to be a
little strange that men should naturally hate the chiefest good: And true it
is, that nothing apprehended and presented under the notion, reason, and the
name of goodness can be hated and abhorred: But yet the chief good, looked upon
as evil, either in it self, or else to him that so conceives and apprehends it,
may under such a notion be so far from being loved as that indeed it may be
hated. And thus it is with all unsanctified men. So that of our selves you see
it is impossible to have the love of God in us.

But whence must we have it then, if we be partakers of it? The Apostle clearly
shows us, Jam. 1.17. Every good and perfect gift is from above. From above,
what is that? why it comes down from the Father of lights, that is, from God
who is the fountain of it. And if every gift be from him, every good and
perfect gift, then surely love which is in some respect the choicest of all
other gifts (as the Apostle shows at large) is from him too. The love which
is in true believers, comes from God.

But yet this Caution let me interpose, before I come to application. You must
not apprehend the love which is in true believers, to come immediately from
God, without the use of second means, as some have seemed to infer from that
place of the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 4.9. As touching love you need not that I write
to you; for you your selves are taught of God to love. As if his meaning were,
I need not teach it you at all, I need not strive to work it and beget it in
you, by my preaching; for you are taught immediately of God himself. Whereas
indeed he speaks comparatively, not as though they had no need at all of his
instruction, but not such need as many other men who were not taught of God to
love. As such expressions are very usual in the Scripture, which in show are
universal, yet to be understood ex part, and in comparison, as that for
instance, John 9.4. If ye were blind, ye should have no sin, says Christ; none
in comparison, not simply none. But as for love, that it is mediately wrought
by means, as by the preaching of the Gospel, is very manifest by this, that the
Apostles, Paul and John especially, do so frequently and earnestly persuade and
press to it: which they need not to have done, if God did work it in the hearts
of his people immediately by the teaching of his spirit. Indeed my brethren,
every saving grace flows clearly from the upper spring, but yet there are some
pipes that carry and convey it down to us, as the Word and Ordinances and the
like. And he that lives above them, lives above grace too. And therefore in my
text, our Savior makes his declaration of his Father name, by himself and his
Apostles and their Successors in the Church, the means of working love in the
hearts of his people; I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it,
that the love wherewith thou have loved me may be in them

Now is it so my brethren, that the love which is in true believers comes If
any man lack wisdom, says the Apostle, let him ask it of God. And so say I in
this case, If any man want love to God, or to his Brethren, let him ask it of
God. Let him go to God the Fountain and the spring of it, and beseech him
earnestly to give it down to poor creatures. If we find our hearts are cold and
dull and flat, if they be not inflamed with the love of God, let us entreat him
to kindle them at his fire. Let us beg him that the love which is in him may
be in us. Let us pray with the Apostle, The Lord direct our hearts unto the
love of God, 2 Thessalonians. 3.5. They cannot find the way themselves; the way of
peace, and so the way of love, they have not known. Now the good Lord himself
direct them, and guide them into that way. It cannot choose but be a pleasing
and a lovely suit indeed, to be importunate with God to make us love him and to
endear our hearts to him. A man would think that such a sweet request as this
should not be turned off with a denial. And that we may the rather struggle in
it, I shall propound two things.

1. Love as it comes from God, so it is in some respect the chiefest thing that
comes from God. It is a grace of the first magnitude, and therefore it is
placed first by the Apostle in that Catalogue of his, Gal. 5.22. The fruit of
the spirit is love, and then joy, and other graces. It is an excelling gift:
and therefore the Apostle Paul to show the matchless worth and the surpassing
value of it, admits a kind of Solaecism in his discourse, and makes it better
then the best of gifts, 1 Cor. 12. ult. Covet, says he, and covet earnestly
the best gifts. And then immediately annexeth a discourse of love, and touching
that he says, I show unto you a more excellent way.

Indeed it is of greater latitude then other graces, it runs through every
precept of the Law of God. For love is the fulfilling of the Law, and that no
other grace is. It is of greater power then other graces, for it sets them all
on work. And hence the acts of other graces are frequently ascribed to love, as
1 Cor. 13.4, etc she hops, she believes, etc. It is of greater permanency
then other graces, then faith, or hope. And other graces without love are
nothing, as the Apostle shows at large in that Chapter.

2. And as love is the chiefest thing that comes from God, so it is the
chiefest thing that conformeth us to God. It makes us like him more then other
graces do. God is not said in Scripture to be faith, or hope, or patience, but
he is said in Scripture to be Love. If we believe, God does not so: if we hope,
God does not so: if we suffer quietly, God does not so: Indeed he suffer not at
all, either by way of passion or compassion. But if we love, my brethren, so
does God. In this we do as God himself does. And therefore we may pray for
this, (my brethren) in another way then we may pray for other graces, according
to the pattern in my Text. We cannot pray to God, Lord grant us that the faith
which is in thee, may be in us: Lord grant us that the hope which is in thee
may be in us; But we may pray, Lord grant us that the love which is in thee,
may be in us; That the love wherewith thou love, may be given down to us.



JOHN 17.26. That the love wherewith thou have loved me may be, etc.


DOCTRINE 2. The Declaration of the Fathers Name to men, is one especial means
to work the grace of love in them.
IT is to this end that our Savior makes it known, as you may see expressly in
my Text; I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it; Why so? to
what end? That the love wherewith thou have loved me (that very property) may
be in them; That as it is in thee, it may be wrought in them also. And out of
doubt the means our Savior pitches on, are useful and available to his ends.

Indeed men come to know the Father, by the discovery of his name to them; for
so his name is all that makes him known to men: And that which works
knowledge of him, does mediately work love to him: So that if the discovery of
his name do make men know him (as that is very manifest) it does make them love
him too. That which one affirms of Learning, may be applied to God, Non habet
Inimicum nisi ignorantem. Whosoever knows him clearly, loves him truly; Indeed
while we are unacquainted with him, the admirable worth and beauty, and
excellency that is in him every way, does not take a whit upon us. The
Philosopher will tell us that the mind must be informed and convinced of the
goodness of a thing, before the heart will cleave to it, or the affections
close with it: And hence it is, that carnal and unsanctified persons love not
God, because they know him not: Or if they know him any way, it is not under
such a notion as renders him desirable or lovely to them. Perhaps they know him
as a Judge, or an avenger; they cannot know him as a Savior and Redeemer. And
this is the real cause why the triumphant Saints in Heaven, love him more then
the Saints Militant on earth, because they have a fuller, clearer and
distincter knowledge of him. We see him darkly in a glass, they face to face.
And this is the reason also why we love not God with such a high affection here
as we shall do hereafter, because we know him not so well, we have not such
distinct and full discoveries of his name, as then we shall attain to. So then
you see in general, that the discovery of the Fathers name to men is one
especial means to work the grace of love in them.

To clear it yet a little further to you. I shall show you particularly and
distinctly, that there are diverse things in Gods name, which (being manifested
and declared unto men) are means to win their hearts to him, and so to work
love in them. As

The beauty of the Lord is a part of his name, and beauty being manifested is
holiness; so it is often called, as 1 Chronicles. 16.19. Psalm. 29.2. To show that
holiness has beauty in it; yea it is called Beauties in the plural number; The
beauties of holiness; Psalm. 110.3. to intimate that holiness is full of beauty,
and that it over-matches all the beauties in the world, if all of them were put
together: And therefore this is made in Scripture the greatest beauty of the
creature; as Sin is the deformity, so Grace and Holiness is the beauty of the
Soul, it adorns the inner man: And therefore the Apostle Peter exhorts
Christian women to adorn the hidden man of the heart with this, 1 Pet. 3.4.
Even with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is of great price in
the sight of God: And hence it is that holiness is likened to the fairest
things, to Robes, and Gems, and Crowns, and Gold, and Jewels, and the like.

Now God is matchless in this kind of beauty; He is holiness it self; yea, he
is infinitely holy: And therefore holiness is called the Image of God. The
holiness that is in men, is but an image and a pattern of that holiness which
is originally and completely in the Lord: who has in this respect all beauty
in him. Yea, it is called the glory of the Lord, Romans 3.23. All have sinned and
are deprived of the glory of God, which shined in us in the state of innocence.
Indeed, my brethren, he has in him the Sum and the perfection of beauty; He
has all in him that does win and raise, nothing that cools or deadens the
affection; all things to invite, nothing to avert love. Others there are (my
brethren) who have some things beautiful and comely to invite and draw love,
but other things uncomely and unbeautiful to keep it off: Something or other
there is in them that is odd, unpleasing, and so a bar, and hindrance to
affection. Brethren, it is not so with God, he is all beautiful, and all
alluring, altogether lovely: Others are so in some respects, but he is so in
all respects, He is altogether lovely, the allurement of all hearts; And the
desire of all Nations, Hag. 2.7. So he is always in the merit, although he be
not always so in the event.

Object. But if God be so beautiful, what is the reason that men do not love
him?

Answ. Because his name, in this respect, is not made known to them. All men
are naturally blind, you know; and blind men cannot judge of beauty, until
their eyes be anointed with the Eye Salve, Apoc. 3.18. to make them see such
beauty as this is: The beauty of holiness is a spiritual beauty, and that is
not discerned by a natural Eye. There must be a spiritual eye to see and to
discern a spiritual beauty: And when you have such eyes as these, to see the
beauty of the Lord, your hearts will be enamoured on him; you will be in the
case the Church was, you will be sick of love, and say, Lord, turn away thine
eyes, for they have overcome us: We cannot bear the dazzling rays of such
beauty as thine is.

Austin speaks) because indeed he is goodness it self. The creatures be good,
but not goodness. Their nature is good, but goodness is not their nature. But
now the nature and substance of God, is goodness it self, so that he is
essentially good; and then he is also causally good, as Psalm. 119.68. Thou art
good, and do good; Thou art good in thy self, and thou do good to the
creature, so that the earth is full of thy goodness: He is eminently good; so
that whatsoever goodness is to be found among the creatures, is eminently and
transcendently in God himself.

Now goodness is the object of love, and consequently the allective of
affection. If we have cause to fear God for his goodness, as Hos. 3. ult. then
surely we have much more cause to love him, especially since he is not only
good in himself, but good to us: If this part of his name be manifested and
made known to us, we cannot choose but love him, and delight in him. That
phrase of the Apostle Paul is notable, and may be very well applied to our
purpose, Romans 5.7. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, but for a
good man one would even dare to die: Uprightness draws not love as goodness
does: One man will hardly love another so much for his uprightness as to die
for him; but for his goodness manifested to himself on all occasions,
continually doing good to him, he may come to love him so, as even to lay down
his life for him: And even for this cause we shall love God, and love him out
of all measure, so as even to die for him, if this part of his name be fully
manifested and made known to us.

The mercy of the Lord is a part of his name, and this if it be manifested
merciful, yea to be rich in mercy; and that not only because the mercy that he
has is precious, but because there is abundance of this precious mercy in him;
For both of these concur to riches; there must be something that is precious,
and there must be much of it: and so it is with God in this case; He has a
mass of mercy in him, a bottomless and endless treasure, such as the wants of
all the world are never able to draw dry: And as a rich man, though he spend
exceedingly, yet because he has a treasure, the e is no failing, no deficiency
of his store; so God though he communicate his mercy freely to the sons of men,
yet he cannot be exhausted; no, there is more behind still, it is an infinite,
a bottomless, an endless mercy; A mercy that endures for ever.

Now this rich mercy God lays out, as many other ways, so chiefly in the pardon
of our sins: and hence we read of mercies and forgivenesses in God, as Dan.
9.9. Mercies as the cause and fountain; Forgivenesses as the effect and stream:
And both you see my brethren, in the plural number, to show the overflowing
mercy of the Lord. Indeed my brethren, there is mercy in all pardons; but in
the pardon and remission of the sins of Gods people there is admirable mercy.
And hence the Prophet wondered at it, not knowing what to think, or to say of
it; Who is a God like thee, that pardons iniquity, etc. Mic. 7.18. The
Prophet is transported, and carried out beyond himself in admiration. And mark
it well He does not say, There is no man like thee, but there is no God like
thee. Indeed it goes beyond the mercy of any but the true living God to do
this. In which respect is that expression, Hos. 11.9. I will not execute the
fierceness of my wrath, for I am God, and not man: that speech of the Apostle
Paul is full, Ephesians. 1.7. We have remission of our sins, according to the
riches of his grace. Now if this part of Gods name be made known to us, it
cannot choose but work love in us. We love them who forgive us common debts,
especially if they be great, we think that we can never do enough for them, or
manifest respect enough to them. But we have cause to love him more who
forgives us such debts as these are, which if they should be rigorously exacted
of us, we were not able to discharge them, but must be laid up under
everlasting chains. Oh my beloved, how can this choose but draw out our
affection to the Lord? The woman in the Gospel had much forgiven her: and what
was the effect and issue of it? Why she loved much; Her love was answerable to
her pardon: Much was forgiven her, and she loved much: She was a great sinner,
and she had a large pardon, and so accordingly she showed great love. O my
Beloved, if such mercy be discovered to us, we cannot choose but do as she did;
if we survey our lives, and find perhaps that we have been grievous sinners,
beyond the ordinary rate, that we were over head and ears in debt to God, that
there were horrid crimes upon the bill against us, scarlet sins, and bloody
sins: and then the Fathers name is manifested to us, that he has been to us
The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, forgiving iniquity, transgression
and sin: And that according to the multitude of his tender mercies he has
blotted out our transgressions: how will our hearts come off to him? how will
they flame with love to God? so that we shall cry out, O how do we love the
Lord! we are not able to express it, how infinitely dear is God to me!

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it. Amor est cos
amoris, love is the special thing that whets love, and that makes it keen and
sharp: So it is with the love of man, and so with the love of God. If it be
made known to us, and if we have assurance of it, it will exceedingly indear
our hearts to him; We love him, says the Evangelist John, 1 Epist. 4.19. Why
so? because he loved us first; The declaration of his love to us, works love in
us to him again. First he loves us, and when we know it, then we love him. So
that the point is fully proved, The Declaration of the Fathers name to men is
one great means to work the grace of love in them.

etc. We see the reason then my brethren, why a great part of the world have
not the love of God in them: Though he be altogether lovely, yet they love him
not at all, because his loveliness is hidden from them. His name is not
declared to them, they have no knwledge of his beauty, goodness, mercy, love,
etc. and hence it is that they bear no affection to him; They are alienated
from him, strangers to him: love him no more then they do a mere stranger. But
how comes this to pass? by reason of the ignorance and blindness that is in
them. How many Heathen Nations in the world, and Christians by profession are
in this condition! and so will certainly continue, till Jesus Christ declare
the Fathers name to them.

And therefore in the second place, if you desire indeed to love God, David's,
if you read the Book of Psalms, and then you will cry out not much unlike as
he, O my God, how do I love thee, while I meditate of the beauty of thy
glorious Majesty, and thy marvailous works!

And thus far of the first end of our Saviors declaration of his Fathers name,
That the love wherewith thou have loved me may be in them.

The second follows in the last place to be handled; And I in them; that the
love wherewith thou have loved me, may be in them, and I in them.

First, that love may be in them, and then that I may be in them. The latter is
adjoined to the former by the connective particle and, as that which (out of
all dispute) will keep it company, and dwell with it. If love be in them, I
shall be in them too says Christ; I shall be where love is; and therefore I
have manifested and declared thy name to them, in reference to both these: That
love being wrought in them, I may be in them too by this means. This I conceive
to be the drift and purpose of our Savior in the words. The point suggested
then is this.

DOCTRINE. Where Love is, there Christ is.
If love be in a man, Jesus Christ is in him too; that is out of all question;
He comes with love into the souls of true believers. Brethren, Christ is an
utter stranger to every soul that has not true love in it. But if you knock at
the door of any heart, and enquire, Is love within? is love here? If love be
there, you may conclude that Jesus Christ is there too. You see my brethren,
they are knit together in my Text, That the love wherewith thou have loved me
may be in them, and I in them. Love in them, and I in them; Love, and I. To
show that Jesus Christ and Love do always dwell together in the same heart;
they are not be separated or divided each from other, but wheresoever one is,
there is the other also; where love is, there Christ is. But then you must not
understand it of love the passion, or natural affection, but of love the saving
grace; of that love which is wrought by the effectual revelation of the Fathers
name to men. Where this love is, there Christ is: as I shall make it evidently
to appear to you: For,

Tim. 1.7. because the Spirit is the cause of love. And hence we also read of
the love of the spirit, Romans 15.30. because love is the fruit of the spirit: so
the Apostle styles it expressly, Gal. 5.22. Yea it is the prime fruit, the
chief fruit, upon which all the rest follow, as the Apostle makes it there, The
fruit of the Spirit is love, and then joy, peace, meekness, and so on. Love is
indeed the special grace by which the spirit of love dwells in us; so that
where love is, there the spirit is.

Now where the spirit is, there Christ is: For his inhabitation in the soul is
by the Spirit, and so it is explained by all Expositors with one consent, where
Christ is said to dwell in, and be in us, as such expressions are very frequent
in the Scripture: He is with us by his Spirit, and in us by his Spirit; as we
are the habitation of God, so we are the habitation of Christ, through the
Spirit, as it is in Ephesians. 2. ult. And as the Spirit dwells in us by love, so
Christ dwells in us by the Spirit; so that where love is, there the Spirit is;
and where the Spirit is, there Christ is. That is the first thing.

Virtutes Christianae sunt connexae, as a Father speaks. All saving graces are
united and conjoined; they are made up together in a chain, so that if but one
link be wanting, all the rest are useless. If all of them be not united, not
one of them is in sincerity. But Faith and Love have a more near relation one
to the other, then the rest have: Faith to Love has the nature of a Cause;
Love to Faith the nature of an Evidence: Faith works love, love proves
faith: Faith without Love is a dead Belief: Love without Faith is a frozen
Charity: So that where love is, there faith is.

Now beloved, where faith is, there Christ is: Faith takes in Jesus Christ into
the soul, and makes him to inhabit there: And therefore he is said expressly to
dwell in the heart by faith, Ephesians. 3.17. And he received gifts for men, says
David, Psalm. 68.18. Yea for the rebellious also, that the Lord may dwell among
them. And if he dwell among and in us by his gifts, then certainly by faith,
which is principal of those gifts: So that where love is, there faith is; and
where faith is, there Christ is. That is the second thing.

God is love, says the Apostle, 1 John 4.8. he is Essentially so, as I have
showed you; and consequently God and love cannot be separated each from other.
He can no more be severed or divided from it, then he can be divided from his
Essence: And therefore the Apostle adds in the aforesaid place, that he that
has the grace of love in him, dwells in God, and God in him: So that where
love is, God is.

Now my Beloved, where God is, there Chist is: For he and the Father are one,
and consequently they must always be together. You are not ignorant, that
Christ and God the Father are often said to be in one another, as in that place
which we have largely handled in the 21 verse of this Chapter, That they may
all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee; As Christ is God, the
Father and himself are one Essence: In that consideration they are so in one
another, that they are the very same: The same Essence, (for so the union is
Identical) though not the same Person: As Christ is Man, the Son is in the
Father, and the Father in the Son, by the union of the Manhood to the Godhead
in the person of our Savior; for the Manhood being joined to the Godhead in
the person of the Son, it must be mediately joined also to the Father, with
whom the Son, as God, is one: So that in both considerations Christ is one with
God the Father; and if they be one, they must be together; they cannot be in
all respects asunder who are one: So that where love is, God is; and where God
is, Christ is; That is the third thing. By this time, I suppose, the point is
clear, where love is, there Christ is: For 1. where love is, there the Spirit
is. 2. Where love is, there faith is. 3. Where love is, there God is.

Now is it so, my brethren, That where love is, there Christ is? That
Philippians, who notwithstanding all their glorious protestations, were Enemies
to Christ, as the Apostle tells them, and that with tears, Phil. 3.18. And
surely there are many every where, and in every Congregation, who pretend much
love to Christ, and yet do really and truly hate him. It is not every one that
calls him Rabbi, Master, as false Judas did, that kisses him and bows before
him, that has indeed the love of Christ in him: No, men may make a flourish
and a show of love to Christ, and yet may be as hearty enemies to him, and to
his members, as Judas, Pilate, and the Jews were. And truly multitudes of such
there are among us, and every place swarms with them.

Now my Beloved, in what a sad and lamentable case are these men? For they that
have no love in them, have no Christ in them neither; they that are without
love, are without Christ too. And so they are exposed to all those matchless
miseries which follow being without Christ, such as no tongue is sufficient to
express, as I have laid them open largely to you, on Ephesians. 2.12.

Is it so, my brethren, that where love is, there Christ is? They then them, as
is apparently suggested in my Text; That the love wherewith thou have loved me
may be in them, and I in them. If that be in them, I shall assuredly be in them
too, and therefore I have manifested and declared thy name to them, that love
and I may dwell in them. Ah, my Beloved, what an admirable thing is this, that
Jesus Christ should live in you, as the Apostles phrase is, Gal. 2.20. that
your hearts should be his house, in which he dwells and walks, and dines and
sups, and lodges every night, so that he is at home in your hearts that while
he is a mere stranger to the remainder of the world, that while they are so far
from having Jesus Christ in them, that they have the Devil in them: Christ is
not in them, but the devil is in them: He keeps the house as Christ speaks;
While the strong man keeps the house: He keeps house in the hearts of wicked
men, the Devil himself is the housekeeper there: there he dwells, and there he
works, as the Apostle speaks, Ephesians. 2.2. he works in them, they are the
Devils house, the Devils shop; they are the house where he dwells, and the shop
where he works: I say while it is thus with other men, while others have the
Devil in them, they have Jesus Christ in them. The strong man is bound, and
dispossessed of his habitation: The Prince of this world is cast out, and Jesus
Christ the King of glory is come in. Ah, my Beloved, what a happiness is this!
I wish that I were able to express it to you, to set it off as it deserves. How
would it ravish and transport you, and make you to sit down in admiration at
your blessedness in this world!

That you may guess a little at it, review the things that have been hinted at
before. If Christ be in you, faith is in you, yea, all saving grace is in you;
You are blessed with all spiritual blessings, in that you have him in you. You
have a magazine, a treasure of the graces of his holy Spirit: So that you are
inestimably rich, and this riches is Christ in you, as the Apostle speaks, Col.
1.27. Not Christ without us, but Christ within us by his graces, is our riches.
If Christ be in you, the Holy Ghost himself is in you, as a Spirit of
Illumination, and a Spirit of Sanctification, and as a Spirit of Consolation.
If you be ignorant, you have one within you to enlighten you: If you be impure,
if you have dregs of sin and of corruption in you, you have one within you to
sanctify you; if you be sad and comfortless, you have one within you to
comfort you; the fountain and the spring of Consolation is within you: so that
he is at hand in all cases, you need not faint, or swound away, while they
fetch a cordial for you. If Christ be in you, God is in you; your hearts are
his Temples, and the great God of heaven himself is the light and glory of
them. O blessed hearts that have God to dwell in them! But more particulary yet;

1. If Christ be in you, you have most intimate and near acquaintance and
Communion with him. It is very much (my brethren) for Christ Jesus to be with
you. It was a precious promise that he made to his Apostles, Behold I am with
you: But for Christ Jesus to be in you, is much more. This imports yet more
close and sweet Communion: Indeed the closest and the sweetest that can be. You
cannot choose but know him inwardly, if he be in you.

2. If Christ be in you, you have free access to him, you need not travail far
to speak with Christ, he is at hand continually, for he is in you: so that you
may on all occasions, make your addresses to him when you please. If you have
any supplication to present, any complaint to make to him, do but open your own
hearts, and you shall find Christ there.

3. If you have Christ Jesus in you, you are partakers of a confluence of all
accommodations, comforts, satisfactions and delights that the poor heart can
reasonably long for, or look after: For Jesus Christ has all in him, and
brings all with him, where he comes. Indeed (my Brethren) he himself is all, as
the Apostle tells us, Jesus Christ is all in all, Col. 3.11. In all in whom he
is (my brethren) he is all: So that in having him, we have all. There is more
in him alone, to make us really and fully happy, then in all the world without
him.

4. If Christ be in you, as you are happy, so you are secure, there is no fear
of falling from your happiness; if you fall, Jesus Christ falls with you, for
he is in you: And this is that which makes our happiness in all respects
accomplished, that as it is complete and full, so it is permanent, and
indeficient too. The more excellent it is, if it were not firm and stable, the
greater were the fear, the greater were the misery of deprivation. Fuisse
faelicem, to have been happy, is the greatest unhappiness. But this felicity,
my brethren, is enduring; In whomsoever Christ is, he dwells there; he does not
sojourn, but he dwells there, never to depart again. The heart of such a man is
his settled habitation, of which he says, Here is my resting place, here will I
dwell for ever: So that if Christ be in you, you are safe; for he will never
leave you, nor depart from you, and then it is impossible that you should
perish. Ah, my Beloved, can a man be damned with Christ in him? cast into hell
with Christ in him? separated from the Lord with Christ in him? Christ willl
not, cannot leave him, that is once in Christ, so that if such a man should go
to hell, Christ must go to hell in him.

And now to shut up all, since Christ is in you, Let me give you this caution,
let him live quiet in your hearts; do not molest him, and disturb him there; Do
not make him vex, and fret: let it not be a penance to him to continue in you.
Let him not suffer by your sins, who suffered for them: But labor every way to
please him, and to give him satisfaction and content: that so the house which
he has chosen merely for your sakes (for he has heaven to dwell in) may not
be dark and doleful, but delightful to him.

And thus at length we have dispatched this heavenly Prayer of our Great High
Priest and Intercessor Jesus Christ. He was even ready to go forth to suffer,
when he made it. Me thinks I hear him saying to his Apostles and Disciples, The
time is now at hand that I must leave you, and be taken from the earth; Come
let us pray before we part, and there; withal he lifted up his eyes to heaven,
and poured out these holy breathings of his Spirit, for himself and them. Oh
what a blessed frame of heart! O what a choice and raised temper (think you)
was he in at that time! O what a Prayer must that be that was made by such a
person, in such a company, on such an occasion! Christ was in heaven in his
thoughts and his affections when he uttered it, and we have seemed sometimes to
be in heaven too, while we have handled it, and heard it. Well, it has been a
sweet and precious subject, as ever we have dealt upon. I shall desire you to
review it often, and let not any choice impressions, that have been made upon
you by it, out again. Let them not be like lines drawn upon the sand; no sooner
formed but defaced: like water spilt upon the ground, that is not to be
gathered up again. Here you have seen the heart of Jesus Christ opened, and his
affections plentifully flowing out to his people. Our prayers show our hearts
to Christ; his prayer shows his heart to us. Here you have seen how our dear
Friend, our Head, our Husband loved us, and had us in his mind and thoughts
before he dyed. Us (I say) who now believe, as well as them that did believe in
former times. How earnest and importunate he is with God the Father, that we
may be one here, and that we may be in one place hereafter! O let us search
into the heart of Jesus Christ, laid open to us in this Abridgement of his
Intercession for us: that we may know it, and the workings of it continually
more and more; until at length this precious Prayer come to have its full
effect, and we be taken up to be for ever with the Lord, that where he is,
there may we be also. Amen.

FINIS.
