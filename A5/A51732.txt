A MAN in Favor, OR, The way to Preferment.
^ To the Tune of, Would you be a Man of Fashion.
I.
WOuld you be a Man in Favor?
Would you have your Fortune kind?
Wear the Cross and Eat the Wafer,
you will have all things to your Mind:
If the Priests cannot Convert you,
Interest then must do the thing.
There are Friars can inform you,
how to please a P -- T --.
II.
Would you see a Papist Lowering,
lost in Hurry and a Fright;
With their Father Peter's Scowring,
glad of happy time for Flight.
Stay but while the Dutch are Landed,
and the show will straight appear;
When the Infernal Spirits disbanded,
few will stay for Tyburn here.
III.
If Preferment you would be gaining,
Or advanced be nigh the Throne;
Bribe some pious Pimp, pertaining
to the Whore of Babylon.
Priests are now the sacred Noddyes,
that spur on the hateful Cause;
They from Tyburn save their Bodies,
by dispensing with our Laws.
IV.
Peter's was the Popish Darling,
now has left us in the lurch,
And has quite given over his snarling,
and his snapping at our Church.
Now (...) Dutch are come to right her,
Pet^^ ^^dly fears a Cord:
For the ^^ince will bite the Biter,
and his Holy Cheats reward.
V.
All ^e catchpole Priests be speedy,
for ^ad Times are coming on;
Ty^^rn groans and will be greedy
for all you that are not gone.
Have and follow Father Peter's,
Popery must now go down;
The King no more will trust such Creatures
to be placed too nigh his Throne.
VI.
Now the Priests are all Confounded,
and their vile Intriegues are crossed;
By the Dutch they are surrounded,
and penned up within our Coast:
Many Aching hearts, I fancy,
are amongst the todpole Train,
If they were got safe Beyond Sea,
they would never trouble us again.
