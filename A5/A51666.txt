MY WIFE.

LONDON, Printed for R. Marriot, in St. Dunstans Churchyard, Fleet Street,
1660.

To the Reader. ^Tis not fit a little book should have a large Epistle, and
therefore briefly this:
THe Author fancied this Wife at a seasonable time to be married; which was,
about the thirtieth year of his Age; he lived almost as long married to her,
and dyed married to no other. She has now been more then twenty years his
widow; all which time, she has been kept very faithfully, and as privately by a
true friend of her Husbands; and she having been a Mourner so long, has been
persuaded by him to unvale her self and appear in the light, that she may
become a Copy for the best wives to write after.

And now each Reader that thinks fit may Court her, and by a strict Civility
get so much of her favor as to know her well; and by that knowledge have the
advantage of getting a Wife, as like her as his merits or his fortune (who has
usually the greatest share in getting wives and riches) will allow him, but let
him not flatter himself with a false hope of obtaining her, for ^he has
protested to dye John Coopers widow

And yet, if she should prove ^o very a woman as to change her name, let me beg
that though ^he break her promise, yet he use her kindly for her first husbands
sake, who was both Patient, and Humble, and Learned, and remarkably Charitable;
and indeed, a man of more visible virtues, then a short Epistle may enumerate.

And if the Reader shall doubt the justness of this Commendation, and require
a double witness for it, the Lady Dyot (for whose direction the Author created
this Wife) will say she knows it to be truth, and I know she and I do both love
his memory.

MY WIFE.
I.
I Have past my maddest age,
Free from Cupid's foolish rage,
Free from sighings, free from tears,
Free from hopes, and free from fears:
And yet I Will wed, if I can see
A Mistress that is meet for me.
II.
First, I would have her person such,
As deformity cannot touch;
Be she black, or brown, or fair,
Of Complexion, hue, or hair;
If my Mistress comely be,
She Will prove fair enough for me.
III.
Courtly carriage in these days
Is but a suspicious paise:
For my part I care not for it,
Nature is not made at Court:
Let a grave and virtuous Mother
Be my Wives Court, and no other.
IV.
Wealth I wish she may have more
Then to keep her from being poor;
That she need not love for need,
Nor I wealth her love to feed:
If in mind or means she be
Rich, she is rich enough for me.
V.
To be born of noble blood,
Is to her that is good a good:
But to me it is no more
Then time past, or untried Ore:
Be she good, how ere she be
Born, she is nobly born to me.
VI.
True Religion will make
Any good for her own sake;
But, let virtue be the Teacher
Of my Wife, before the Preacher;
She Is good that would use me well,
Were there neither Heaven nor Hell.
VII.
Who for beauty takes a Wife,
Chooses by the sheath the knife;
And, who takes her for Estate,
Or for person, has ill fate:
These may perish, or decay
On, or ere her Wedding day.
VIII.
Wealth is Fortunes and not mine,
Person owes decay to time:
Learning, Wit, and such like parts
Ravish men's, not women's hearts;
But a love, by true love bred,
Gives each night a maidenhead.
IX.
Wit and Eloquence of tongue,
Should to me, not her, belong
Sober silence in a maid
Says enough when nothing's said;
And a Wife when she speaks least,
And that little well, speaks best.
X.
When I Court her first she shall
Neither credit naught nor all:
But, when time my truth has proved,
And she finds she is beloved,
Let her then believe, and then
First begin to love again.
XI.
Let her next be wise, and know
Love shall reap as Love shall sow
Trying masteries in a Wife,
Is the scab or bane of life:
And has too often had the fate,
To destroy a good Estate.
XII.
Children should not be loves end,
But loves mend: if God them send
She should love them for no other
Cause, but for my Wife's their Mother*
If God send none I should be
Child to her, and she to me.
XIII.
For man is the ball of fate,
Tossed about from state to state;
Therefore God for one chief part
Give mine fortitude of heart,
That so she may valiant prove,
And bear any loss but love.
XIV.
Next I wish that my heart may
Find here is made of Wax, not Clay:
That my love may make here is be
More soft, not more hard to me;
She Is loves hangman, and his hell
In whom a proud heart does dwell.
XV.
When the Priest has made us one,
Flesh of flesh and bone of bone;
We must Wed our wills together
And will one in both or neither*
By her tongue my heart must ^peak,
Hers by mine must silence break.
XVI.
Where two hearts be thus indented,
They live, ^or they live contented;
Where they differ, there they die,
And their Marriage-knot untie:
They and none but they are Wed,
Whose hearts lodge both in one Bed.
XVII.
She that knows to spend or spare,
As times and occasions are,
Brings a portion, bringing none,
But, much better bringing one;
One may well call such a Wife,
The life of her husbands life.
XVIII.
She her husbands state and ki^
Makes her glass to dress her by*
She a neat and wholesome diet
Makes the utmost of her riot;
She, like a good Snaile, does dwell.
Most at home in her own shell
XIX.
Such a Wife as this, would make
Monks their Cloisters to forsake,
Such a Wife would almost vex
Angels that they want a sex;
Such a Wife I wish to nurse
Both my body and my purse.
XX.
Thus in the mine ^ de choose my gold
And my Wife cast in a mould;
Yet, a Woman's Son may vary,
But, I mean if ere I marry,
Either to have such an one,
Or a better, which is none.

The Book of Common Prayer.
WHat prayer by the book? and Common?
Yes, why not?
The Spirit of Grace,
And supplication,
Is not left free alone
For time and place,
But manner too, to read or speak by rote,
Is all alike to him that prays
With His heart, what with his mouth he says.
They that in private by themselves alone
Do pray, may take
What liberty they please
In choosing of the ways,
Wherein to make
Their souls most intimate affections known
To him that sees in secret, when
The are most reserved from other men.
But, he that unto others leads the way
In public prayer,
Should choose to do it so
As all that hear may know
They need not fear*
To tune their hearts unto his tongue, and say
Amen; no doubt they were betrayed
To blaspheme, when they should have prayed.
Devotion will add life unto the Letter:
And, why should not
That which Authority
Prescribes, esteemed be
Advantage got?
If Prayer be good? the commoner the better.
Prayer in the Churches words, as well
As sense, of all Prayers bears the Bell
