Religious Villainy, An ELEGY on the Execrable Murder of King CHARLES, I.
THough to contemn all Laws Religion be,
And though to be a Christian's Heresy;
Though it be a Crime for any to be good,
And he is no Saint that is not Baptized in blood.
Though to be no Traitor Treason be,
And to be Loyal be Disloyalty,
Though it be Justice Innocents to kill,
And Meritorious Royal Blood to Spill,
For which it is Death to greive; yet who but he,
'Twixt whom and Virtue's an Antipathy,
Such an unparalleled Butchery that hears,
Does not resolve into a flood of tears,
Which even unto Tyrants Urns are due, but when,
The best of Princes and the best of Men,
Thus slaughterd is, it claims from Loyal Eyes,
Full Seas to waft him into Paradise,
In Spite of Fate then pay this Tribute due,
To him was yours and Virtues Sovereign too,
Nor let your Tears know bounds in such a fall,
The Grief and Loss are Epidemical,
You whose malicious Charity at first, Londoners

These Vipers hatched these towering Serpents nursed,
Let your much want of him instruct you in
The greatness of his Loss and of your Sin,
And let those Scorpions teach you the vast odds,
Betwizt the Rule of Men and Reign of Gods,
Unheard may you their Clemency invoke,
Uneas'd, unpitty'd bear your purchas't yoke,
As is your Reformation be your Peace,
Since thus the Land's restord thus troubles cease,
Deluded fools that with so vast expense,
Have bought your Ruin, sold your Innocence,
Contracting to your selves a guilt so high,
Will damn your yet unborn Posterity,
These are your tender Conscience Men who dare
to act, what others do with horror hear,
No more let bafled Historys now tell,
How Caesar in the treacherous Senate fell,
No more let France of Henrys Fate complain,
This deeper die makes pale that crimson stain,
These, thy lost honor, Catiline, redeem,
Whose foul designs now fair and pious seem,
Thy modest wishes durst not aim so high,
As such transcendent Acts of Villainy,
The bashful plotters of this black design, Presbyterians.

To Ruin England with own Fatal Mine,
So much the horror of their guilt did fright,
They durst not Act without the Cloak of night,
But these tryumphing Saints do glory in, Independents.

As much the show, as acting of their Sin,
Nor shame to exhibit to the blusing Sun,
A Sight never seen since first his Race begun,
The Murder of a Prince whose grand offense,
Was Virtue and a settled Conscience,
Nor does his Death Suffice, our just Laws must:
Pimp for these Caniballs in humain Lust,
And Justice the Protectress of the Earth,
Must be the Midwife to this Monstrous Birth,
Thus while they seemingly would blot his Fame,
They scandalize that most Religious Dame,
A Court unheard of therefore thy Create,
To make complete their Antipodian State,
Where Wolves (as grand delinquents) Lambs present,
And Traitors do arraign the Innocent,
Where Pluto's Mercenaries do wrest the Laws,
To make them serve a most prodigious cause,
And belch from their blasphemous mouths, pretense
Of crimes against his sacred Innocence,
Replies to it would spoil the new Courts credit,
All must be granted true because they said it,
Wherefore they do provide he should not use
Defense, 't would criminate those that did accuse,
But to determined Sentence they proceed,
The frontless Pageant told him he must bleed,
Necessity required that the should dye
A victime to that upstart Deity,
Which blood carousing Idol could not rest
Content with any offering but the best,
Though baited with such obloquies as laid
Their hated crimes upon his guiltless head,
Though bold faced Treason had usurpt his Throne,
And robbed him off all Crowns save that alone,
Of Martyrdom; though pride were grown so high,
He Is still a King, Preserves one Soveraigntie,
No Rebel passion durst arise to bring
Stains on his undeserving suffering,
With meekness great as Innocence he dies,
A Royal and immaculate Sacrifice,
No fear nor sorrow he, but 'twas for them,
Deceiptful, proud, Ambitious, bloody Men,
Nor could the last Act of this Tragedy
Shake his inviolable Constancy,
Nor his unconquerable Patience quell,
Whose Charity such injuries did excel,
But what their guilt not suffered them to crave,
His pardon he unsue'd too freely gave,
Thus he orecame their malice and expressed
Himself victorious although oppressed,
Yet does their Hell-bred fancy find no end,
But would unto his memory extend,
But Rebels do your worst, what you deny,
His Fate contemning Virtues shall supply,
And what already is become your shame,
His glorious Death shall balm his wounded Name,
Whose greatful memory shall as lasting be
As time, or as your loathsome Infamy,
Whose growing names equal to his shall rise,
That turned the Temple to a Sacrifice,
Nor shall those Pyramids fall being built with good
Men's bones, and clemented with guiltless blood,
His Luster nere shall fade but shine in spite,
Of your contrived mists and Hellish night,
Such Graces as were his are too divine
For Lies to spot or dark Cells to confine,
The glorious Lamps a while deprived of light,
Breaks forth again and does appear more bright,
Aflicted Virtue so does higher swell,
And spyces bruised yield a more fragrant smell,
You worthyly enslaved, see here your lot, (Londoners^
And bless you with the freedom you have got,
But however, that change can but small safty bring,
That Is founded on the Ruin of a King
Whose worth to tell, in vain let any try,
No Pen but his could write his Elegy.
