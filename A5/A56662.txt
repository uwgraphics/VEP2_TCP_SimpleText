TO THE READER.
THE Parish-Clerk is an Officer to be chosen by the Minister of the Parish
(unless Custom prevail to the contrary) and by him to be certified to the
Bishop of the Diocese of his competent skill in Reading, Writing, and Singing;
but especially of his civil Life and Conversation, great requisits, and most
necessary qualifications of one chosen to attend in the Ministry of Holy
things, and to bear a part in all the Divine Offices of the Church. Therefore a
Minister, or Parish ought to be very careful how they introduce any person that
is not thus qualified; otherwise the ignorance and impiety of the Clerk may
bring an unavoidable scandal to the Church of God, in whose Holy Offices he is
to be conversant. A scandalous Clerk is an Offense to a devout Congregation,
and gives just ground of discouragement to People to join in the respective
Offices of Prayer and Praise, in which the Clerk bears so considerable a part,
viz. By responding, by standing up, by bowing, and by Genuflections proper to
all the parts of the Holy Offices as is directed in the Rubric: by all which
he more than intimates the Duty of every individual person in the Congregation,
particularly by saying Amen to all the Prayers throughout the whole Service;
which if the Clerk were not obliged, ex Officio, to say Amen, (which the
Ancients say, in the Primitive Church, was wont to be repeated like a Clap of
Thunder) the carelessness, and lukewarmness of the generality of people is such,
that (as experience shows) there would be few or none oftentimes to perform
that part, or say Amen to the Prayers. Therefore it is well the Church is
provided of a proper Officer to supply the defects of others in the Worship of
God. A Parish-Clerk then is not so mean and contemptible an Office as some
people render it. He is more than a Doorkeeper in the House of God, he is
Servus in Sacris, conversant in all the Holy Offices of the Church; whose Life
and Conversation ought to be such, that he be Habitually prepared at all times
to Communicate with the Sick, etc. The Clerk is to take care about the Elements
proper to be used in the Holy Sacraments; of the Holy Vestments, that they be
decently kept to the Honor of God, and the Reputation of that particular Church
he has the honor to serve. In a word, the Parish-Clerk ought to be an exact
Pattern of Conformity in all the respective Offices of the Church, by whose good
example the Congregation may be excited to Reverence and Devotion, viz.
Kneeling at Prayer, standing up at the Creed, howing at the name of Jesus, etc.
Now to the end that every Parish-Clerk may be accomplished in that part of his
Office that relates to the Setting of the Psalm, and for the more ready turning
to that Portion he has a mind to sing: I have here furnished him with an
Alphabet of the most material Words and Sentences in the Singing Psalms: and I
have added also another Alphabet, where you will find Psalms suited to proper
and solemn Occasions. Moreover, I have made a Collection of choice Verses of
the Psalms, which I call Closes, to be used when the common Gloria Patri is
omitted, which you find at the close of the 75. Psalm, and is generally used by
the Parish-Clerks. Lastly, you shall find at the end of this Book several Forms
of Gloria Patris for Psalms of eight and six Syllables, viz. for the 25. the
51. second Meter, the 67. 70. and 134. Psalms, and for Psalms of eight
Syllables, as is the 100. the 125. second Meter, etc. In all which, next to the
Glory of God, I aim at the common benefit and advantage of my Brethren the
Parish-Clerks, for whose service, and furtherance in Sacred things, I have a
particular regard; with whom, if my weak endeavors shall find a kind
acceptance I have my end and design, wishing that the same may chiefly serve to
the Glory and Praise of Almighty God, to whom I recommend you, who am

Your Brother, and Servant, B. P.
