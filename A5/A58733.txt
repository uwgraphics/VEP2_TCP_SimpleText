THE SECOND PART OF THE Pilgrims Progress, FROM This present World of
Wickedness and Misery, TO An Eternity of Holiness and Felicity; Exactly
Described under the Similitude of a Dream, Relating the Manner and Occasion of
his setting out from, and difficult and dangerous Journey through the World;
and safe Arrival at last to Eternal Happiness.

They were Strangers and Pilgrims on Earth, but they desire a better Country,
that is an Heavenly, Heb. 11. 13, 16.

Let us lay aside every Weight, and the Sin that does so easily beset us; and
run with patience the Race that is set before us, Heb. 12. 7.

Elsmere 1703



To Him that is Higher than the Highest: The Almighty and everlasting Jehovah,
who is the Terror and Confusion of the Hardened and Impenitent World; and the
Hope and Happiness of all Converted and Returning Sinners.
Most Mighty and Eternal God, thou King of Kings, and Prince of Peace,
IT was from thee that I at first Derived the Original of my Being; and it is
upon the sole account of thy free Grace, and unmerited Goodness, that I enjoy
my Well Being too, with all that I am and have, which both Obliges and
Encourages me to approach thy Footstool, and with all possible Veneration,
prostrating my self before the Throne of thy Glory, Humbly Offer up, and
Dedicate to thy Sacred Majesty the ensuing Meditations, Solemnly begging for
the sake of thy Eternal Son, the Lord Jesus; that thou would cast a
Favorable Eye upon them, and do thy Servant who acknowledges himself to be the
meanest and unworthiest of all thy Subjects, the Honor to accept and own them,
by making them useful to Convey the Knowledge of thy self to Unconverted
Sinners? Convince them of their lost and undone Condition by Nature, and the
danger they are in of being miserable for ever. Allure them to fall in Love
with, and Embrace thy Son, who is so Beautiful and Lovely, that he infinitely
exceeds all Comparison; and so Loving, Tender, and Compassionate, that he has
no Parallel. Let it point out to them the way to Christ, who is the way to
thee, and the only means whereby they can be Reconciled to thee, and be made
happy in the enjoyment of thee: Let them tend to the promoting the Spiritual
Good and Eternal happiness of all those into whose hands they shall come.

It is probable, and I expect no less, that they will fall into the Hands of
some whose Curiosity will be the only Motive that Prompts them to Read, and
Design the Perusal of them shall only serve to please and gratify their fancy
with the Quaintness and Vnusualness of the Method wherein they are Penned, or
to verify the truth of the Proverb, The Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor
the Ear with hearing; but if thou will please by the Powerful influence of thy
Grace, to make them fall in Love with and Entertain the Substance, whilst they
only designed to sport and play with the shadow, I shall thereby obtain my End
in Composing and Publishing them.

And I humbly Implore, that as when I was endeavoring with incredible Pains
and Industry to precipitate my self into a Gulf of deplorable Misery, the
Nature and Extent whereof thy self has described to be Wrath to come, Thou
wast pleased out of thy Infinite Goodness, and Tender Compassions, which have
been ever of Old, to pluck me out of the Horrible Pit, as a Brand out of the
Fire, and by an Effectual changing of my Nature, turn my Feet into the ways of
thy Testimonies, and persuade me to go on Pilgrimage to the Celestial Canaan,
and have enabled me to make a Considerable Progress toward it through the
midst of many amazing difficulties, and to trample under Feet, and with ease
and facility pass over innumerable Discouragements, not only from those who
were traveling the contrary way, and with an Infernal Eagerness directing
their hasty Steps toward the Sulphury Lake, from whom I expected no fairer
dealing, but even from my fellow Pilgrims too, so thou would please by the
Power of thy Grace to enable me to persevere therein, until thou have safely
carried me through all the remaining Difficulties and Dangers of my Journey,
brought me within the Gates of Zion, and given me an Actual Possession of a
perfect and everlasting happiness in the immediate enjoyment of thy self, and
the Beatifical Visions of thy Face.

And if in the mean while, I may by this or any other means be an instrument of
doing good to my fellow Pilgrims, Increasing and Advancing the Kingdom of
Christ in the World, and bringing Glory and Honor to thy Name, then the End
and Design will be sufficiently obtained, which really is the aim of him, who
is not, would not, will not be his own; but as innumerable Instances of Divine
Goodness has infinitely Obliged me to be seriously, so I solemnly promise and
resolve to be for ever thine, in Time, and to Eternity.

An Explanation of the two Emblems.
LO here the Emblem of our wanton Age,
And their mad Frolicks on the fatal stage;
See foolish Prodigal! The dismal End
To which thy sottish, damned Debauches tend.
Behold the gaping Tophet, so profound,
Whose flaming Vaults with hideous cries resound;
Blind, foolish miscreants tumbling headlong in
Whilst they are dancing of their rounds in sin.
Look on lewd Jezebel, who leads the Dance,
Whilst to her Timbrel all the rest advance:
Heedless they caper on Destructions brink,
'Till dropping in, in sulfurous flames they sink.
Around the dismal Gulf, see Roses strewn,
The Road to Hell had need b' a pleasant Road.
The 'frighted Pilgrim, who the danger spies,
From the loose throng, and Magic Circle flies;
Toward a safer Way his course he steers,
Free from their seeming joys and real fears.
The Preacher's warning, or some Friend within,
Roused him to shun the Snares of Lust and Sin.
The rest jigg on secure, at Conscience laugh,
And greedily their poisoned pleasures quaff.
In the next page, the friendly Preacher stands
Telling their Danger, with up lifted hands:
Indulgent Heaven offers them a Crown;
But thoughts of Heaven in sensual Frolicks drown.
All this the slumbering Dreamer saw, whose eyes
Twinkling with Tears bewail their Miseries;
And clad in black, with pensive head on hand,
Laments those Ills attend a sinful Land.
His slumbers 'wake in Heaven; their Stygian Napps
Start not, until 'wak'd by Hells After-Claps.

To the Ingenious AUTHOR Of this SECOND PART Of the Pilgrims Progress.
Swain.
WHilst laboring restless Tyrants swims
Through Seas of Blood to Diadems;
And whilst they set the World on blaze
A tottering Mortal Throne to raise;
Poor Earthworms fighting for Earths Sway,
Contending for the word Obey!
To which must Europe vassallage owe,
The Lov're, or the Seraglio?
(Where Turk or Pope the Empire have
The Subject's sure to be a Slave;
And if I Am Chained, it is all one,
Be the Gally Turkish or Thoulon)
Whilst those the Tragic World engage
With Streams of Blood to stain the Stage,
Exceeding all called Brutal Rage.
Pilgrim.
Thou by this Pilgrim shewst the way
TO an Empire of Eternal Day:
An Empire not with Slaughter gained,
Nor yet by Force or Fraud maintained:
An Empire Bright, serene and clear
As the bespangled Hemispere;
Whose Beauteous Glories ever shine
With Rays Immortally Divine:
Transcending all the Pageant Pride
Of Monarchs Semi-Deified.
Where all a mutual Glory share,
And each a Royal Crown does wear.
Where Faction, Hate and Envy cease,
ETERNITY's the date of Peace.
No proud Oppressor Lords it there,
Nor Prisoners Cries afflict the Ear:
Their Ear's not fed with feigned loves,
Or Warbles of the evening Groves;
But ravished with Celestial Songs
Of glorious and Triumphant throngs,
The bright-wing'd Seraphims Adore,
And mighty Angels make the Chore.
Exalted Saints praise Heavens great King,
And all their Halelujahs Sing.
Needs must the Music there excel
Where every soul's a Philomel;
Inspired, not with feeble Breath,
But Airs above the reach of Death.
When this poor molehill Earth shall tumble,
And into Dust and ashes crumble,
When in a Universal Fire,
All worldly Empires shall expire:
Gasping Crown'd-Heads, lie down in Anguish,
And see their Tottering Glories languish.
When evil Shepherds, and their flocks,
Shall shelter crave of falling Rocks.
Shivering Princes trembling crave
The help of once despised slave.
The All-conquering Soldier stands dismayed,
Of all his Trophies unaraid.
When gilded Palaces shall have
With Cottages an equal Grave:
And the Worlds Axletree shall crack,
And blaze in the last General Wrack,
Then shall thy Pilgrims Rock remain
Unshaken by the Hurricane,
A safe retreat, for those whose care
Shall Mansions in that place prepare.
But those who do intend to go
On Pilgrimage, thou letst them know
What they will meet with on the Road
Unto this happy blessed Abode.
The way's not all strewd' with flowers,
With Fountains, Walks and Bowers;
The days are not easy, nor the nights
Crowned with downy soft Delights.
No Jessamies perfume the Air,
But Pleasures are all banished there:
And many Troubles they will find
Upon the Road you have designed,
Through which by help of thy Advice,
They Will find the way to Paradise.
When all their troubles vanish strait,
At their First entrance of the Gate:
And through the tedious way they pass,
They Have a sure Guide, and cordial Glass,
Nere failing Comforts to the Soul,
Tho she be tossed from Pole to Pole.
Short-sighted ones may sometimes faint,
When they the Glorious Prospect want:
But when they have got a Pisgah's veiw
Of the blessed place directed to,
They Will pass the Wilderness and find
The Egyptian Host left far behind;
And Canaan will their wants supply,
When David leads, Philistims fly.
And they in full shall then receive
The Glories which they now Believe:
In which blessed State they will still remain,
Triumph and Joy, and Ever Reign.

THE Authors Apology FOR HIS BOOK.
IT has been observed of late years, that peoples minds are so vitiated and
debauched, that no books will please them to read, but Novels, Romances and
Plays, with others of the like nature; which have been bought up at a strange
and prodigious Rate, in vast and incredible numbers, whilst Tracts of Divinity
are almost wholly slighted and neglected; and their stomachs turn upon them
with loathing, unless they contain something that is New and unusual, either for
Matter, Method or Style: By which means Debauchery is not only maintained and
continued, but hightened and increased thereby, to the sensible discouragement
and decay of Piety and Religion: The observation whereof put some eminent and
ingenious persons upon writing some Religious Discourses, which they designed
for a General Use in such kind of methods as might incline many to read them,
for the methods sake, which otherwise would never have been persuaded to have
perused them, as Bernard's Isle of Man, Gentile Sinner, etc. Hoping that the
Power of those plain Truths which they thereby delivered in so much plainess
and familiarity, that made them the more easy to be understood by most
illiterate persons, and meanest capacities; and yet afford pleasure, delight
and satisfaction to the most Judicious, Learned and Knowing Reader. And this
consideration was the Motive which put the Author of the First Part of the
Pilgrims Progress, upon composing and publishing that necessary and useful
Tract, which has deservedly obtained such an Universal esteem and
commendation. And this Consideration likewise, together with the importunity of
others, was the Motive that prevailed with me, to compose and publish the
following Meditations in such a method as might serve as a Supplyment, or a
Second Part to it: Wherein I have endeavored to supply a fourfold Defect,
which I observe, the brevity of that discourse necessitated the Author into:
First there is nothing said of the State of Man in his first Creation: Nor
Secondly, of the Misery of Man in his Lapsed Estate before Conversion. Thirdly,
a too brief passing over the Methods of Divine Goodness, in the Convincing,
Converting, and Reconciling of Sinners to himself. And Fourthly, I have
endeavored to deliver the whole in such serious and spiritual phrases, that
may prevent that lightness and laughter, which the reading some passages
therein, occasion in some vain and frothy minds. And now that it may Answer my
design, and be Universally Useful, I commend both it and Thee to the Blessing
of him whose Wisdom and Power, Grace and Goodness it is, that is only able to
make it so: And withal I heartily wish, That what has been formally Proposed
by some well-minded persons, might be more generally and universally practiced,
viz. The giving of Books of this nature, at Funerals, instead of Rings, Gloves,
Wine or Biscuit; assuring my self, that Reading, Meditation, and several Holy
and Heavenly Discourses, which may Probably be raised upon the occasion of such
presents as these, would mightily tend to the making people serious, and
furnish not only the person, who Discourses, but the rest who are present, and
who would otherwise be employing their thoughts and tongues too, in such
foolish, vain and frothy Discourse as is too too commonly used at such times,
with such frames of Spirit as may be suitable to the greatness and solemnity of
that occasion which then calls them together, and even enforce them to consider
their own frailty: And by employing their thoughts upon that sad object which
then lies visible before their eyes, read Lectures to themselves of their own
Mortality, and affect their Souls with such serious, suitable contemplations as
this, Lord, This sad and dismal, this mournful Tragedy, which is now acted, and
acting upon my deceased Friend, and whereof I am now only a Spectator, must
shortly be acted by me, or rather acted upon my self, and the rest who are
spectators hereof, by the King of Terrors, now calls to us, and we must all of
us ere long, in the self same manner, call to others to mind their latter End,
and consider that the Remembering to prepare their great and last Change, is or
ought to be the chief bufiness of our Lives. Lord my breath is as liable to
end, will be as certainly stoped as his, and I find that my body likewise is
compounded, and made up of the same mouldering and decaying principles, which
incline me, and render me subject to crumble into dust, and fall into the
Grave, to which I am now following him; but Lord, I know not how suddenly my
self may be followed thither. Lord, here is his Body, but where is his Soul! His
departure is a sad occasion of mourning and Grief to his sorrowful Relations;
but Lord, what is it to himself! He is now got beyond the Grave, and has a
clearer sight of, and is thereby able to Judge more truly of unseen and
invisible things than when he was here, he has other thoughts of Sin and Hell,
of Holiness and Heaven, than us poor mortals, who are yet Grovelling in the
dark, in these lower Regions. Lord, Sin was the great, the cruel and barbarous
Murderer, that first brought Death into the World and furnished him both with
the Dart and the sting wherewith he wounds. O that Thou would therefore
affect my Soul with that Sermon which thou art now preaching ot me by him; and
O let not that Lecture of Mortality which he is now reading to me, ever be
forgotten by me: Lord give me an interest in thy Son, whereby I may escape the
sting, and despise the Dart, and Triumph over the fear of Death!

Amongst those few who haved practiced this, abundance of good has been
observed to have been done by that means and who knows were it more generally
used and become a custom amongst us at our Burials, what good might be
effected thereby?

And now, that the reading this small Tract may promote thy present piety, and
future happiness, by making thee more sensible of thy lost and undone condition
by nature, and by bringing thy soul more out of love with sin, and more and
more into love with God, with Christ, and holiness, is the desire of him who is
thy cordial friend, and heartily wishes the Eternal welfare of thy immortal
Soul.

THE PILGRIMS PROGRESS.
PART II.
THE Spring being far advanced, the Meadows being Covered with a Curious Carpet
of delightful Green, and the Earth Clothed in Rich and Glorious Attire, to
Rejoice and Triumph for the Return of her Shining Bridegroom: The Healthful Air
rendered more Pleasing and Delightful by the gentle Winds then breathed from the
South, impregnated with the Exhilerating Fragrancy of the Variety of Flowers
and odoriferous Plants over which they had passed; and every Blooming Bush, and
Flourishing Grove plentifully stored with Winged Inhabitants, who with a
delightful Harmony sweetly Sing forth their Makers Praise, and Warble out their
Joyful Welcomes to the Gaudy Spring. I one Day took a Walk in the Fields, to
Feast my Eyes with the variety of Delightful Objects which that Season of the
Year, wherein the Universe bears the nearest resemblance to the happy state
wherein the Immortal God at first created it, liberally offers to the view of
the Admiring Beholders, and thereby lays an Irresistible Obligation upon
Heavenly Minds, to Spiritualize the several Objects they b^hold, and satiate
their happy Souls with Heavenly Meditations, by affording them such innumerable
occasions of Contemplating the Divine Goodness. And as I walked, the various
Objects represented to my View, afforded diverse occasions of, and furnished me
with matter for different Meditations. Sometimes I would Contemplate the Divine
Wisdom in the curious Frame and Fabric of the World, stretching the North over
the Empty Place, and hanging the Circle of the Earth upon nothing, when by the
irresistible Power of his Almighty Word, he spoke a Confused Chaos into Form
and Beauty, Commanding some part of the Earth to raise it self into lofty
Hills, and aspiring Mountains; forming their Concave Heads for Springs, and
ordaining their Bowels for the Production of the Usefullest and the Richest
Minerals, and appointing other Parts of it to subside into Humble Valleys, and
be Formed into Champain Plains, whose Surface he Clothed with a Carpet,
curiously interwoven with various and delightful Flowers, and Adorned with a
Natural Landscape of stately Cedars, Shady Palms, and Spreading Pines, Fruitful
Groves, Aromatic Plants, and Balsamic Shrubs, Invironing the whole with the
Liquid Ocean, Commanding the Sea to Compass and Embrace the Habitation of Man,
reserving it as a perpetual store to Administer Rain to the Bottels of Heaven,
and Convey Liquor to the Bubling Fountains, supply Mankind with the variety of
Useful and Delectable Creatures wherewith the Almighty has stored it, and
serve him for the use of Navigation and Commerce. Replenishing the Earth
likewise with innumerable Rarities, and almost Infinite Variety of Living
Creatures; and furnishing the Air with the most admirable and Ravishing Music,
Establishing a Glittering Cannopy, admirably Beautified with Spangling Stars to
cover all his Sublunary Works, Ordaining it to be a Tabernacle for the Sun,
whose Influence and Motion Conveys Heat and Vegitation, and Measures Light and
Darkness to all things beneath his Sphere.

And having thus finished and Beautified the World, and prevented the very
Wishes of Man by those admirable Preparations for him, at last he Formed him
also, and from a Clod of Earth exalted him to be the Head of the Universe, and
the Perfection of all the Visible Creation, advanced him into the Throne, and
gave him Dominion over all the rest of the Creatures, appointing him to be
their High Priest, to Offer up their Tribute to their Great Creator, whereby
the Divine Goodness antedated his most Ample Desires, rarefied his Enlarged
Heart, and filled his Capacious Soul with Sacred Wonder.

Sometimes I would Expatiate in my Thoughts upon the Reasonableness and
Easiness of that Law which God gave to Man in the Primitive state of Innocence
and Happiness, as the Rule of his Obedience, and the Condition upon which he
should remain in the perpetual Possession of all those Glorious Felicities
wherewith he was then Crowned.

And then upon the Folly and Madness of Man, that notwithstanding the
Reasonableness of the Homage he was Obliged to pay to the Great Monarch of
Heaven and Earth, he should so easily permit himself to be puffed up with so
much Pride and Arrogance, as to aspire after an Equality to, and be prevailed
upon, and wheadled by the very first Temptation to fall into flat Rebellion
against, and Commence open War with his Sovereign, whereby he lost at once the
Divine Favor, and all the Happiness and Felicity which was the Consequence
thereof, Expelled himself out of Eden, and Barocado'd the entrance into the
Celestial Paradise, against him and his Posterity for ever: Precipitated
himself into a Gulf of Desolation and Woe, and rendered himself obnoxious and
liable to all the Torments and Misery, which Abused and Enraged Justice, in
Conjunction with, and Assisted by Almighty Power, was able to Inflict.

Then I could not but Meditate on the Triumphs of Hell, and how the Devils
rejoiced at their Victory, Priding themselves, that although they were not able
to revenge themselves upon the Great God for Expelling them out of Heaven, and
Casting them down into Hell, to be for ever Tormented in those unquenchable
Flames, yet they had wrakt their Infernal Rage and Devilish Revenge upon Poor
Mankind, and thereby spoiled as they thought the New Creation: Robbed God of
the Honor he designed to himself thereby, and Involved Adam and all his
Posterity into equal Ruin with themselves, who must now undergo alike just
Condemnation, be equal sharers with them of their Misery, and Eternally bear
them Company in the Everlasting burnings.

And then methoughts I saw wretched Man in a most Forlorn and Despairing
Manner, bitterly exclaiming against his Madness and Folly, and pitifully
bewailing and lamenting his deplorable and wretched Condition; running into the
Woods, and striving to hide his Guilty Head among the Thickets, from the
unavoidable search of the All seeing Judge, who immediately followed him
thither; called him to the Bar, and Convicted him of the Crime of Disobeying
and Rebelling against his Almighty Will, in wickedly breaking, and perfidiously
violating his most Just and Righteous Law. Upon which my trembling Ears
diligently listened to hear the dreadful Pronouncing of the Fatal Sentence,
Consequent to the preceding threatening, in the Day that thou eatest thereof
thou shall die. But lo, to my wonder and astonishment, Divine Love produced a
Reprieve before Sentence, and Mercy stepped in and stayed the Execution,
Free Grace having from all Eternity prepared a Propitiatory Sacrifice to
Compensate for the Crime, and restored the Prisoner to the Favor of his
Sovereign; to the exceeding amazement of Angels, those shining Courtiers of the
King of Glory, that continually reside in his Celestial Palace, and perpetually
attend the performance of his Royal Command, who were all of them hereupon
filled with a Divine Wonder, at the Infinite and Inconceiveable Condescension
of the great Jehovah, in parting with his own Son, his only Son, for the
Redemption of Rebellious and Ungrateful Man: To the inexpressible Comfort and
Consolation of the Reprieved and Pardoned wretch, who was hereby instantly
raised from the depth of despair to the very Pinnacle of hope. And to the Grief
and Confusion of Hell, whose Tormented and Despairing Inhabitants found
themselves strangely disappointed, by the admirable Contrivances of the
Covenant of Grace made between God the Creator, and God the Redeemer from all
Eternity, whereof they had no Knowledge till now when the sweet Effects of it
began to appear in the Expiation of that Mischief which their Infernal Subtilty
had effected; and the advancing Man to a Happiness far more Admirable and
Glorious than that from which he was fallen, in regard of the immutable
stability thereof; it being so firmly fixed by the Eternal Decrees of God, and
Confirmed by the Precious Blood of the Mediator, to all those happy Souls who
are of the Number of Gods Elect, and for whom the Blessed Jesus has Bought and
Purchased this Eternal Happiness, that it is an utter Impossibility for all the
Rage of Earth and Hell to rob them, or deprive them of it.

And having thus in my Meditations run through the Creation, the Fall and
Redemption of Man, I reflected more particularly upon the sad and innumerable
miseries whereunto Fallen Man is now Subject, as the Reward and Consequence of
his Depravation, revolving in my Mind the Huge Slaughters, Cruel Maslacres, and
the Bloody and Inhumane Executions which have happened in all Ages; the
Miseries and Calamities of Sickness, and the Tormenting Pains wherewith many of
those Distempers to which he is Subject are attended, as the Gout, Stone,
Strangury, Collique, and the like; the many unseen Accidents which frequently
render the nearest Relations uncomfortable and displeasing, and imbitter the
sweetest and most desirable Enjoyments, together with the various perplexities
which always accompany the most prosperous and flourishing Condition of Rich
and Great Men, and from which their Large Possessions, Great Places, Honorable
Titles, and the Palaces of Princes cannot secure them. Nor can even the Throne
it self exempt him that sits thereon from having the glittering Diadem
wherewith his Royal Temples are Incircled, attended, and encumbered therewith,
and rendered always uneasy, and sometime unsafe thereby; but chiefly upon the
miserable and deplorable Condition of Man in the Loss of God's Image, and the
Original Corruption wherewith his very Nature is Defiled, the Poisonous and
Infectious steems whereof are perpetually Bubling forth in the many and horrid
Acts of Profaneness and Debauchery, whereof his short and transitory life is
Composed, and at the Period and Conclusion thereof, sadly plunges him into a
Sea of Wrath and Everlasting Misery: And that notwithstanding all this, it is a
Work of most incredible difficulty to allure and prevail with this wretched
Creature to accept of and embrace the Blessed Jesus in the Offers of the
Gospel, and thereby at once free himself from the intolerable slavery of Sin,
the Fear and the Danger of Hell, and be Reconciled to, and enjoy the favor of
God with all the Delights and Glories of Heaven as the Consequence thereof:
That nothing below an Infinite Power can possibly effect it; the Consideration
whereof Clipped the Wings of my aspiring Soul, which till now had been Towering
aloft, and Soaring above the Clouds, and so overwhelmed it with Grief and
Melancholy, that I sat me down on a Flowery Bank, when leaning on my Hand in a
kind of a sad and sorrowful Posture, I fell asleep, and in my sleep I Dreamed,
and methoughts I saw at some distance, an innumerable Company of Men, Women and
Children Dancing and expressing abundance of Mirth and Jolitrie, which begat in
me an extreme desire to inform my self of the Quality of the Persons, and the
occasion of their Rejoicing. To which purpose I directed my steps toward them,
and as I drew nearer, I found them to be vastly more in Number than I at first
conceived them, and could perceive that there were Persons of all Degrees and
Ranks; and that Young and Old, the High and the Low were all of them engaged in
the same kind of Diversion, and that the Rich and the Honorable were
Confusedly intermingled with the Poor and the Despicable, wherefore meeting
with some straggling Persons before I got up to the great Heard, I inquired of
them with great earnestness, what Country it was wherein I was then Traveling?
What kind of People they were that Inhabited it, and what was the occasion of
all that Mirth which I discovered in the Company that I saw on yonder Plain?

Sir, replied they, every one of your Questions sufficiently demonstrate that
you are a Stranger in our Country, which obliges us to give you as Positive and
Satisfactory an Answer as possibly we can; Wherefore, know Sir, the Country
wherein you now are, is called Wilderness, as well for the Largeness and
Barrenness of it, as the innumerable Dangers which always attend those who
Travel in it. It is Situated exactly between two vast and mighty Countries,
each of which are far longer and bigger than it self. There is but one way into
it, through which all its Inhabitants have entered, and there are but two ways
out of it, through which, all those who Travel to either of those Countries
Situated upon its Borders must of necessity pass. And that fine, broad, smooth
and pleasant Path which you see goes down there on the left hand, Beautified
and Adorned with many rare and delightful Varieties, and which, as you see, is
thronged with Passengers, is one of them, and is known by the Name of
Impenitency, it leads directly to the Kingdom of Darkness. And look up yonder
Hill on your Righthand, wherein you see not above two or three Travelers, is
the other, and that is usually known by the Name of Conversion, it leads as
directly to the Country which lies on that side of the Wilderness, and is
called Celestial Paradise, as the other does to the Kingdom of Darkness. Now we
suppose you cannot but wonder by this time why the Path which leads down to the
Kingdom of Darkness is so much Crowded with Passengers, and the other which
leads to the Celestial Paradise so seldom trod. But before we acquaint you with
the Reasons, it is necessary that we inform you of the different Entertainment
those Travelers meet with, as well in their Journey toward, as their
Reception into each of those Countries. You must know therefore, that those
which Travel toward the Celestial Paradise, by reason of the narrowness and
unevenness of the Way, have a very hard and difficult Journey of it, are forced
to strive and struggle hard, and put forth all their might and strength to get
forwards, because the Road lies all the way up Hill, besides which they are
forced to grapple with abundance of Difficulties and Discouragements; and to
Encounter with mighty and powerful Enemies, who endeavor sometimes by flattery
to persuade and allure them to forsake the way, and at other times by open
force and violence to force and thrust them down, continually molesting them
some way or other, adding moreover continual Mockings and Scoffings, deriding
their Madness and Folly (as it is termed by them) for walking in such untrodden
and forsaken Paths. But to make amends for the troublesomeness and
unpleasantness of the way, they no sooner draw near to the Borders, and get
within view of the Country; but they are met by some of the shining Courtiers
of the Great King, by whom they are Congratulated for their safe Arrival within
the view of the Celestial Paradise, bearing them Company, and assisting them in
the remainder of their Journey, and as soon as they arrive there they are
Welcomed and Embraced by the King himself, by whom they are immediately arrayed
in Robes of Majesty, Seated upon Thrones of Glory, and their Victorious Temples
adorned with Crowns of Triumph; in which manner they are to Live and Reign in
the Royal Palace, and with the rest of the Blessed Inhabitants of the Place, be
Kings and Priests unto himself, and the Lamb for ever and ever.

But on the contrary, those who Travel toward the Kingdom of Darkness, in
regard the way is broad, plain, and easy, somewhat inclining down Hill, filled
with abundance of Passengers, and replenished with many other Felicities, to
render it the more pleasing and delightful, and thereby allure them to
persevere therein, their Journey thither is attended with little or no trouble,
opposition or difficulty; but they march on Courageously in Triumph and Glory:
But at the end of the way, suddenly and at unawares, and usually before they
can imagine they are got half way in their Journey, they fall down into the
Kingdom of Darkness, which some have thus described.

Rebellious Angels, though Heaven's Ancient Race,
The Almighty thrust into the lowest Place,
Which from the Earth so deep, and dark does lie,
As we are distant from the Starry Sky.
And being thus fallen into this dark and dismal Place of Horror, they are
there lost for ever, as it is said of them in Holy Writ; I saw the Wicked
flourish like a green Bay Tree, but I looked, and lo suddenly he was not. They
are likewise evilly Entreated, and made Slaves of by the King of that Place,
which many of them are not Ignorant of, and yet will not be persuaded from
walking in the Path that leads thither, and therefore we shall next give you
the Reasons thereof.

First, Some because they have Christian Parents, were Baptized in their
Infancy, and Educated in the Christian Religion, suppose themselves born Heirs
apparent to Celestial Happiness; and therefore conclude that whatsoever way
they walk in, they shall certainly get thither in the End. And that their
Indulgeing themselves in Profaneness and Debauchery will prove no impediment
to their obtaining that Eternal Happiness, which they vainly Imagine to be
their Birthright: And therefore you may with as much Confidence of prevailing
speak to the Mountains to remove, or Command a House to turn its Foundations
uppermost, as to convince them of their danger, or persuade them to lay a
better Foundation for, or obtain a New Title to everlasting Glory.

Secondly, Some having Traveled many Years in the ways of Sin, and found
abundance of delight and pleasure therein; and having never so much as looked
toward the ways of Religiou and Holiness, but at a distance they fancy them to
be far more dismal and void of pleasure and delight than they really are, and
therefore cannot persuade themselves to leave a pleasant Rode wherein they are
well acquainted, for a loansom Path wherein they are altogether Strangers. Or,
if they have ever adventured to enter a little way therein, by the
Discouragements they meet withal, and the Revolveing in their Minds, the
sweetness of their former Enjoyments, they have been allured back; returning
with the Dog to his Vomit, and with the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in
the Mire.

Thirdly, The greater number are drawn into it by their Ignorance and Folly,
and the Example of others; accounting it safe enough to go to Hell with a
Multitude, and esteeming a Popularity in Misery better than a Singularity in
Happiness.

Fourthly, Some walk in the Broad-way, because all that they enjoy there is
their own, and the place which they receive, at their End of it, they receive
upon the Score of Merit; but if they should go in the Narrow Path, then both
the necessary Provisions for their Journey, and the Celestial Paradise at the
end of it, must be given them as a Free Gift, by the King of the Country, which
they cannot endure.

Fifthly, Many refuse to walk in the Narrow way, because of its simplicity and
plainness, they must have their Glorious Colleges, and their Splendid
Ministers, their Beautiful Quires, and Raised Altars, Enclosed with Hangings of
Arras and Tapestry, and richly furnished with the Finest Silver, and Adorned
with the Gold of Ophir. They must have a Gaudy and Pompous Worship, and a
Ravishing Harmony of Vocal and Instrumental Music to delight and exhilerate
their Spirits, and if you will deny them this, you may go to the Celestial
Paradise alone for them, for you shall be sure to have none of their Company.

Sixthly, Abundance of those who walk in the Broad-way have obtained some
knowledge of the Celestial Paradise, entertain good thoughts of it, and would
fain procure an Interest therein; but it being an hereafter Happiness, an
Inheritance in Promise only, and they being impatient Creatures, are unwilling
to stay so long for their Happiness, or tarry for their Portion till the end of
their Lives: Wherefore closing with the desires of those mentioned in Holy
Writ; that cry out, Oh, who will show us any good? wholly neglect that
inestimable Treasure wherewith those happy Souls are enriched, upon whom the
Son of the Blessed lifts up the Light of his Countenance, and thereby makes
them to Rejoice more than others whose Corn, and Wine, and Oil increases.

Seventhly, Many of those, who do enter into, and make some Progress in the way
to Celestial Happiness, by reason of some defects in their entrance, they after
a little time strike into some of those By Paths which Border upon the way to
Life, and seem to run Parallel with it, but indeed, after some Miles Traveling
they Wind off, and by insensible degrees lead into the Broad way again, and
when they arrive there, they Bless themselves to find the way to Celestial
Paradise, wherein they confidently persuade themselves they are yet Traveling,
as free from trouble, and replenished with as great or greater Felicities than
that wherein they Formerly Traveled toward the Kingdom of Darkness; so that
by this means the Convincing them of their dangerous mistake, and the reducing
them back again to the way of life, is become far more hard and difficult than
it was at first, and many of them never find they have lost their way until it
is too late to return.

They having given me this Description of the Country, I found my Heart
exceedingly affected therewith, which put me in mind of what the Disciples of
our Lord said to each other, viz. did not our Hearts burn within us, when he
talked with us by the way, and opened to us the Holy Scriptures; But perceiving
one of them going to proceed, I begged of them first to resolve me this
Question concerning the Narrow Way, which they called Conversion; whether there
were no manner of Pleasure and Delight therein, which may in some measure allay
the bitterness, and Compensate the troubles of the Journey?

You must know, Sir, replied they, its so far from being wholly without, that
it is the only Path in the whole Country, which affords any True, Solid, and
Real Pleasure. In the other indeed they have ^ great many Carnal Pleasures, and
Fleshly Delights, but they afford no Real, but only an Imaginary Happiness; and
therefore although they express abundance of Mirth, yet it is the Travelers in
the Narrow Way which have the only True and Real cause of Rejoicing. But you
must know Sir, that they are Pilgrims, and the Happiness and Treasure whereof
they are Possessed, is such as is most agreeable to, and convenient for such a
Condition; were they Clogged and Laden as the others are, what Progress would
they make, do you think, in their Pilgrimage; since the Path is so narrow, lies
up Hill, and is attended with so much difficulty all the way till they come to
their Journeys End? And therefore their Treasure is chiefly within them, so
that all the Enemies in the World cannot Rob them of it, nor do Strangers
intermeddle therewith: Redeeming Love, Pardoning Mercy, and Converting Grace is
their Happiness and Treasure: They are Reconciled unto, and are become at Peace
with God; and the Great, the Everlasting, and the Almighty Jehovah is become
their Portion and Inheritance. Infinite fullness and Alsufficience it self is
the Ocean wherein they Swim, the Air wherein they Breathe, and the Fountain
whereat they Drink, the Streams whereof refresh their Spirits, and make glad
their Souls, even in the midst of outward Calamities. They have an assurance of
Divine Love, and are filled with the Peace of God which passes all
Understanding. And now I hope you are Convinced, Sir, said they, that the Way
is not without its Comforts; but if it were, the sweetness of the End would
Compensate and make amends for the bitterness of the Way. To which I making no
reply, they concluded me satisfied by my silence, and therefore proceeded.

And now, Sir, said he that spoke to me at first, having thus Described unto
you the Country wherein you now are, and my Friend having resolved your Doubt
concerning the Narrow Way, which we call by the Name of Conversion. I shall
proceed to the Answer of your Second Query, what kind of People they are which
Inhabit this Country: They are, Sir, of the Generation of a certain Man called
Adam, a Native of the Land of Eden, and being Expelled that Country for their
Usurpation and Rebellion against the Monarch thereof; they settled in this
Wilderness. They are a People who are Naturally extreme proud, and yet both
they and all their Predecessors were Beggars from the Cradle, and they are born
to Trouble, Desolation and Misery, as naturally and with as much frequency as
the Sparks fly upwards. Besides which they are in continual danger of being
taken in some or other of those Snares which the Prince of Darkness has placed
all over this Wilderness so secretly, and covered them with so much Craft and
Subtilty, that its a Matter of Incredible difficulty to discern them, and
thereby fall into Tophet, the Place where the Damned are Eternally Tormented;
notwithstanding which it is their constant custom to rush amongst those Snares
with as much eagerness and inconsideration as the Horse rusheth into the
Battle; and put far from them the Evil Day, until such time as it overtakes
them at unawares, and the Son of the Eternal, when his Wrath and Indignation is
stirred up, suddenly tears and rends them to pieces: And in order to this,
putting far from them the Evil Day, is the Intent and Design of that Mirth and
Jolitry which you see expressed by the People that Dance on yonder Plain, which
may serve as an Answer to your Third and last Query.

The Discourse being thus finished, and I having acknowledged my Obligations to
them for their Courteousness and Civility, returned them Thanks for their
gratifying my Curiosity, and taking my Leave of them, I went toward the Plain,
and as I drew nearer, I perceived there was a large hollow Circle or Cavern in
the midst of them; and because I could not conceive what it should be, I
pressed in among them, and going to the Brink thereof looked in, and lo to my
Amazement and Wonder, I then plainly perceived that they were all of them
Dancing about a Pit that was bottomless, and playing with Flames that never go
out; and as I stood there, methoughts I could hear the horrible outcries and
dismal Screeches of the Damned, and the Rattling of the Chains, and the Fiery
Shackles of the Prisoners of Hell, whereupon being much astonished, my Spirits
sinking within me, and my very Flesh trembling for fear, I suddenly started
back, and fled for my life, lest the Rolling Flame which flowed like a stream
of Brimstone, should have Consumed me, or the Noisome Fumes of the Burning
Sulphur which came up into my Nostrils should have Suffocated and Choked me;
but being gotten some distance from it, and as I thought out of the danger
thereof, I first lifted up my Soul to God, returning Adoration and Praise to
him for delivering me from the danger of the Horrible Pit; and then turning my
self toward them again, I could not but stand and behold them with Admiration
and Pity, and found my Heart touched with a sensible Commiseration of their
desperate Folly and Madness, in their wilful continuing to sport themselves in
a Place of so much hazard and danger, notwithstanding the reiterated cautions
they perpetually receive to forwarn them of their danger, and Advise them to
flee from the wrath to come. And behold as I looked earnestly upon them,
methoughts I saw sometimes one, and sometimes another drop into the Pit, and
the Flames catched hold of them, methoughts when they were falling they
struggled with all their might and main, endeavoring if possible to make their
escape; but, alas, it was then too late, and there was no remedy.

But while I stood in this manner looking toward them, I saw several Gentlemen
in Gowns standing up amongst them, and thereupon I drew near and listened to
what they would say; and the truth is, I there heard diverse very Learned and
Rational Discourses of the evil Consequences of Sin, the Dreadfulness of
Tophet, and the Happiness of the Celestial Paradise; insomuch that I verily
thought within my self, that those Orations would certainly make Converts of at
least an half of the Company, and prevail with them to go on Pilgrimage to the
Promised Land, which had been so admirably Described and Commended to them; and
I waited with a great deal of Patience to see them begin; but all to no
purpose, for not a Man of them would stir a Foot, whereat I wondered, and
Reasoned thus within my self. Good God, said I, shall all these Learned and
Rational Discourses be spent in vain, and prove like Water spilt upon a Stone.
Shall so many excellent Words, and so many curious Sentences be lost in the
Air, and prove of none Effect? Shall they Accomplish nothing to thy Honor, nor
the good of those to whom they were directed? Shall so much Pains be taken by
the Orators, and yet shall they not have one Soul added to their Ministry as an
Encouragement to them in their Work, and to Demonstrate thy aprobation thereof?
Lord what can be the occasion of this, and where shall I fix the Reason
thereof. And methoughts I found my Mind wonderfully grieved and perplexed
because I could obtain no satisfaction therein; but after some Pauses and
Serious Deliberation thereon, I considered that the Reason of it was, because
they Preached to them as if they were all Converts, and had already begun their
Pilgrimage, and therefore stood in no need of any Persuasions to enter into the
Narrow Way, but only a few short and cursory directions for their walking
therein. And whilst I was musing on this Matter, and bewailing the miserable
Consequences of so Fatal a Mistake, I suddenly heard a Man speak with a loud
Voice like the Noise of Thunder, and looking up, I saw a fine Grave Old Man,
whose Name as I have since learned was Boanerges; he laid open their miserable
and undone Condition, and assured them in the Name of the Eternal Jehovah, That
unless they repented they should all likewise Perish: At the pronouncing
whereof, I saw one of them began to change Countenance, and look as if he were
almost persuaded to become a Pilgrim; wherefore, I drew near to him, to observe
what he would do, and methoughts I heard him say thus to himself: The truth is,
I now see plainly that I am in a lost and undone Condition, and that this
Careless and Profane life which I now lead will certainly undo me; to prevent
which, I must Repent and forsake my Sins, in order to my finding Mercy. But,
oh, said he, the mischief of all is, that I must then leave all my Delights and
Pleasures, forgo and bid an Eternal farewell to all this Brisk and Jolly
Company, with whom I have hitherto spent my time in Mirth and Pleasure, and
abandon those beloved Practices which always afforded me so much Delight and
Satisfaction, that I have accounted them as dear to me as my Right Eye, and as
necessary as my Right Hand, and the parting with them, will be as terrible,
Displeasing, and Painful, as the Disjoynting, nay Dis-membring of my Body; and
therefore, what will thou do, O my Soul, will thou consent to a Mortification
of the Parts; or will thou content thy self with the Destruction of the whole?
Will thou yield to a Cutting off those Corrupt Members, with which it is
morally impossible thou should ever enter into life, or will thou resolve by
a sparing of them, to plunge thy self, Soul and Body, into everlasting Death.
And after a little pause, he added, But suppose, O my Soul, that thou could
freely consent to part with all these things which thou have esteemed as
Precious as thy life, nay more precious than thy self, yet thou must go further
and Submit to the doing and suffering many things very irksome and tedious to
Nature; as being Buffeted, Hated, and Derided by the World, the loss of thy
Reputation, and Credit; Goods, and Estate; the Imprisonment of thy Body, and it
may be the loss of thy Life too: And indeed the whole way to this Celestial
Paradise is attended with so much hardship and danger, that even those who
Commend it to thee, and persuade thee to go on Pilgrimage thither, tell thee
plainly, that through many Tribulations thou must inherit the Kingdom. Upon
which methoughts he began to shrink, and shruging up his Shoulders, was about
to Address himself to his former Courses; whereupon I saw a Grave Serious Old
Gentleman, who stood by, the Gravity of whose Countenance showed him to be a
Judge, (and as I remember one of them that that stood by, told me his Name was
Conscience, and he is, said he, the Vicegerent of the great King) he boldly
struck him upon the Shoulder, and in a kind of harsh and surly Dialect, told
him plainly, that since he believed not, he was damned; and that by the
rejecting the Council of God, he had accounted himself unworthy of Eternal
Life, and drawn upon him the Infinite Wrath of the Eternal Jehovah, whio is
thereby so much enraged and filled with Anger against thee, that he is coming
forth in his Fury to Revenge upon thee, wretched thee, all that Scorn and
Contempt wherewith thou have shamefully slighted, and wilfully refused the
Sacred Charms of Redeeming Love, and the Wonderful and Amazing Offers of the
Divine Bounty. Upon this methoughts I saw him tremble and look as if he were in
a straight, and knew not what to do; upon which the Gentleman began to speak
again, and told him, that it was no time for him to Debate, lest before he came
to a Conclusion, he were overtaken by the hand of Justice, and then I can
assure you, said he, there will be no possibility of escape. Whereupon I heard
him say to himself, this Wicked and Profligate course I see now must be
forsaken, or else this Old Gentleman will never let me alone, but will be a
perpetual trouble to me, which I am not able to endure, for his Words are
terrible as Thunder, and I dread his Reproof more than an Earthquake; besides
if what he says be true, I shall be in a dreadful Condition, for as I remember,
I have somewhere read, that This Majesty of Heaven and Earth against whom I
have been guilty of High Treason (having lived in Actual Rebellion against him
this many Years, and whom Mr. Conscience tells me, is now coming forth against
me Armed with Fury and Wrath to destroy me, and Execute me as a Traitor) is a
Consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniquity; That his very Nostrils breathe
Smoke, and out of his Mouth comes devouring Fire; and the Prophet Daniel has
formerly told me, that he had seen him several times, and that once he beheld
him seated upon a Throne which appeared to him like the Fiery Flame, and his
Wheels as Burning Fire, and affirmed that he beheld a Fiery Stream issue and
come forth from before him, and that thousand thousands Ministered unto him, and
ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. And now, O my Soul, if all
this be true, and this great and terrible Jehovah be coming forth in this
manner against thee, as I fear he is, for I read the other day a Passage in the
Divine Law which now comes fresh into my Mind, and I verily believe it to be
intended as a Declaration of War against me, viz. The Lord tries the
Righteous, but the Wicked and him that loves Violence his Soul hates, upon
whom he will Rain Snares, Fire and Brimstone and an horrible Tempest, this
shall be the Portion of their Cup: For his hand shall search out his Enemies,
and his right hand shall find out all those that hate him, whom he will make as
a Fiery Oven in the time of his Anger, he will swallow them up in his Wrath,
and the Fire shall devour them, their Fruit he will destroy from the Earth, and
their Seed from among the Children of Men, because they intended Evil against
him, and imagined a mischievous Device, which they only wanted Power to
perform; therefore will he constrain them to turn their Backs when he makes
ready his Arrows upon his strings against the Face of them: What will thou do?
It is impossible for thee to stand before him, or defend thy self against him,
for he is too strong for thee, and infinitely above thy match; neither have
thou any other Forces to Muster up against him, but Briers and Thorns which he
will easily go through and burn together; nor can I see any probability of
escaping by flight; for whither will thou go from his presence, or in what
place will thou hide thy self from his sight? Do thou know any place secret
enough to exclude thee from his search, or art thou acquainted with any Cavern
so dark and remote, and the way to it so intricate and perplexing, that
Infinite Wisdom cannot find it out, nor Omnisciency it self Penetrate it?
Having thus reasoned with himself he ceased, discovering by the Dejectedness of
his Countenance, the trouble of his Mind; whereupon I saw a brave solid Person
step to him, as I remember, his Name was Judgment; and having first fixed his
Eyes upon him, and viewed him for a considerable time, he spoke to this, or the
like purpose; Sir, I am somewhat concerned to see you in such a dreadful and
deplorable Condition, and I would fain be instrumental for the helping you out
of it: I must acknowledge, that of all Men in the World, I have been the most
mistaken in you; for the truth is, I did verily believe you to be in as good a
Condition as any Man living, and flattered my self into an opinion, that as you
were blessed with Outward and Temporal Felicity, so you were in a safe and sure
way to obtain Everlasting Happiness; nor had I yet been undeceived, had not the
Son of the Blessed, who is by Virtue of his Mediatorship, made unto us Wisdom,
as well as many other Precious and Necessary things, without which we can never
be happy, darted the Beams of Divine Light into me, and by those enlightening
Rays enabled me to take a clearer prospect of your Condition than ever I did
before, whereby I plainly perceived, that your Condition was far worse, and
more dangerous and dismal than I ever imagined; but I must tell you for your
Comfort, that at the same time wherein I received this discovery of your danger
and misery, I received likewise Information of your Remedy too. At which Words
methoughts the Man suddenly revived and looked cheerful, as if the Power and
Efficacy of some rich and reviving Cordial had raised and exhilerated his
drooping Spirits, and chased away those disponding thoughts which till now had
filled his fearful Breast with Horror and Despair: And he cried out, Oh, Sir,
if you will do that, I shall esteem you the best Friend I have in the World:
Pray what course must I take to prevent my being Miserable for ever? Sir, said
he, your only way to prevent that, and to secure your being Eternally happy; is
immediately to fly for your Life, (for if you stay here, there is no
probability to prevent our Ruin) and go on Pilgrimage to the Celestial
Paradise; for in the way thither there stands a City, the Name whereof is
Refuge, and it is appointed and ordained by the Eternal, to be a place of
shelter for all those, who, finding themselves pursued by the Avenger, will fly
into it; and he has freely promised, upon the Word of his Omnipotency, that
from the very Day and Hour of entrance thereinto, we shall be Eternally safe
from the Avenger; nay, has assured us, that the Avenger himself shall
thereupon become pacified, that his heart shall be molified toward us, and his
Indignation against us be appeased, and that he shall put on Bowels of
Compassion, and Cloth himself with the Love and Tenderness of a Father toward
us, when speaking to us in the most Melting and Compassionate manner, he shall
declare that Fury is not in him, but Favor and Friendship, Love and Good will
is all that we may now expect to find from him; that he would Cloth and
Beautify our Souls with Holiness, and Enrich them with the Inestimable
Treasures of Glory and happiness, bestow upon them the refreshing Dews of
Heaven here, and the fullness of it hereafter; by which Sweet and Comfortable
Words, he shall effectually persuade us to lay hold of his strength, and make
Peace with him, Promising, that thereupon he will become a Sun and a Shield to
us, that Infinite Love, and Divine Goodness shall be our Inheritance, and
Omnipotency it self our Portion: Now the Gates of this City stand open Day and
Night to give continual Entrance to any who fly thither.

But now, if ever you expect entrance into this City, you must consent to the
being stripped of all those abominable Rags and filthy Garments wherewith you
are now Clothed; and you must lay down all those Lusts and Corruptions, which
for the sake of an Imaginary Happiness you have fancied in them, you have
hitherto with incredible Pains and Industry always carried about with you, and
Indulged them in your Bosom; but no you must relinquish them for ever, and
abandon and turn from them with the greatest hatred and detestation imaginable;
nay since they have Traitorously opposed your subjecting your self to the Son
of the Blessed, and would not have him to Reign over you, you must bring them
before him, that he may slay them: This indeed is hard and irksome to Nature,
and you will find some difficulty in the performance thereof; but yet, assure
your self that this must be done, or otherwise you will be Eternally undone. Oh
therefore, let me prevail with you to consent to, and resolve upon the
performance hereof. Consider I pray you, did not the Eternal part with his own
and only Son for you, and will you then be so ungrateful to deny the parting
with those Wretched and Cursed Companions for him, which if not parted with,
will infallibly betray you to everlasting Ruin, and Precipitate you into the
deepest Place of the Burning Lake? I say again, let me persuade you to this, or
else sit down satisfied, and content your self to spend your time in Mirth and
Folly, and your Eternity in Pain and Misery; and therefore pray resolve what to
do, and let your Debates come to a final issue.

Whereupon I saw a third Person come to him, who seemed to be of a far more
brisk and Aerie Complexion, than the two former, telling him, that he had
diligently listened to all the foregoing Discourse, and found himself
wonderfully pleased and delighted therewith, verily believing, that at the very
same instant when, and by the very same Act of Grace whereby the Son of the
Blessed darted the Beams of his illuminating Light into Mr. Judgment, whereby
he plainly saw and discovered his Misery, together with the way and means
whereby you may, said he, be saved from it: He darted into me likewise, a sense
and feeling thereof, making me to Sympathise with you, and incline to help and
assist you in the performing the hard Task, and the carrying you over all those
Difficulties Mr. Judgment has Described, for I assure you, that I begin to
think so well of the Journey, that if you will undertake it, I will go along
with you and assist you with Legs wherewith you shall Walk and Run therein:
Nay, to encourage you the more, I promise and engage my self to furnish you
with Wings for the inabling you to sore aloft and fly above the Clouds. The
extraordinary Promises this Gentleman made him of Assistance begat in me a more
than ordinary Curiosity to Inquire his Name, and I was answered by some who
knew him, that his Name was Affection.

And now methoughts I heard Conscience begin again to round in his Ears, the
greatness of his danger, the necessity of his escape, and the encouragement he
had received from those two Persons for the attempting thereof, demanding what
he intended to do. You may be sure Sir, replied he, that by this time I am
weary of this dreadful and dismal Condition wherein I now am, hanging as it
were between Heaven and Hell, without being able to discern to which of the two
places I am most inclined, nor can I possibly discern if Death should now put a
period to my Life, which of them would be my Eternal Home, and therefore you
may well imagine, that I am not without some inclination to go on Pilgrimage to
the Celestial Paradise; but there is a certain Person in the World whose
consent I must first obtain for my so doing, or else I must still remain as I
am; for the truth is, without his consent to, and help and assistance therein,
I can neither begin nor perform my Journey; and yet I am afraid he will not be
persuaded to consent to, and assist me therein, for I have found him by woeful
Experience to be a cross, stubborn, ill-natured fellow, being naturally
inclined to oppose and hinder every thing which is good, and by Custom inured
to the Practice of that which is evil.

Pray, said Conscience, who can that be with whom you maintain so near a
Correspendence, that without his consent you will not be happy. It is, replied
he, one whom you know very well, and I think you have some kind of acquaintance
with him, and when I have told you his Name, I believe you will be of my Mind, his
Name is Mr. Will, and I am confident that you know him to be both a Wilful
Headstrong Person, strongly bent against any thing that is good, especially
against this Pilgrimage, and likewise, that he has such an absolute Power and
Dominion over me, that I can do nothing without his Consent. Then said
Conscience, if that be the Man you spoke of, I acknowledge there is a great
deal of truth in what you say, yet I tell you again, you must not make use of
this as an Argument for your delay, lest ruin suddenly overtake you, and you
Repent when it is too late, and there be no Remedy: You must send for him, and
see if you can get him to consent, and let your two Friends, Judgment and
Affection, Discourse with him, and see if they cannot persuade him to a
Compliance.

Whereupon I saw him return all alone by himself, and being curious to know
what he was going to do, I followed him, and saw him enter into a secret place
wherein he concealed and hid himself from my sight, and indeed from the view of
every Mortal, which made me the more desirous to inform my self what he did
there; to which end, methoughts I crept as near to the place as possibly I
could without being discovered, and withal I observed a profound silence, lest
otherwise peradventure I might have been an unhappy Instrument to disturb him
in his private Meditations: Being thus seated, I hearkened diligently if I could
hear him speak; but notwithstanding all my diligence he spoke so low, that by
that means and my distance I could not hear much, only sometimes when he was
more earnest than ordinary, he would exalt his Voice a little, and then I could
hear him Expostulate after this manner: Lord thou have Convinced me, Oh that
thou would Convert me too? Thou have given me a sight of my Sin, Oh that
thou would give me a hatred and detestation of it too? Lord; that my Soul
may abhor and loath it, and that I might loath my self because of it? Thou have
by the Terrors of thy Law made me afraid, and by the Threatenings of thine
Anger, and the Thunderings of thy Fury have made thy Wrath and thy Justice
terrible to me; Oh that thou would now by a Powerful and Effectual
Application of the Promises of thy Gospel, make my Soul to hope in thy Mercy,
rejoice in thy Love, and triumph in thy Favor? Thou have given me a sight of a
Savior; Oh that thou would give me an Interest in him too? Now thou have
shown him to me; Oh let me not be put off without him; and since there is such
a Remedy provided, let not my Soul perish for the want of it; since there is
such Balm in Gilead, let not my Wound prove incurable, and since there is a
Physician there; Oh, oh, that my Soul may be healed and recovered by him.

I am weak and feeble, ready to faint and perish, and thou have told me that he
is willing as well as able to heal me; Oh make me willing to go to him? Thou
have said, thy People shall be a willing People in the Day of thy Power; Lord
Exert thy Power in me, and make me willing to go to thy Son, since thou have
made him willing to receive me? Thou have in the Gospel made a free Offer and
Tender of him to me; Lord make me willing and able to accept of it and embrace
it, by receiving him into my Soul, and the making a Complete and absolute
Surrender and Resignation of my self unto him.

Lord thou have informed my Practical Judgment, and caused Light to shine into
my Understanding, and thereby in part cured that Blindness and removed that
Darkness wherewith they were naturally filled, making some of those Scales to
fall off which Original Corruption at first drew before them, and Actual
Transgression has since thickened and increased, until at length they were
extended over the whole Surface, and rendered it not only Dark, but even
Darkness it self: Thou have awakened my Conscience, and in part cured it of the
Plague of Hardness and Unfaithfulness; and thou have moreover regulated my
Affections, and reduced them to better Order and Obedience. And now, O Lord,
have thou done all this for me, and yet shall I have no benefit thereby? Have
thou brought to the Birth, and will thou not give strength to bring forth?
Shall it stick here? Will thou give me a glimpse of Mercy, only to make me the
more sensible of future Misery, and afford me a prospect of thy Love, only to
let me know I am not an Object thereof? Have thou given a view of Heaven, only
thereby to precipitate me the deeper into Hell: Indeed if all this should be,
yet I must acknowledge that thou art Righteous when thou Judge, and Just when
thou Condemnest: But Lord, so long as there is so much Merit in thy Son, and
Bowels in thy Love, I will still hope in thy Mercy, and from thence plead with
thee for the finishing that Work which thou have graciously begun in my Soul?
Subdue my Will as well as inform my Judgment, and cure the Stubbornness and
Rebellion of the one, as the Blindness and Darkness of the other? And as thou
have Regulated my Affections to Love and admire thee; so bring my Will to
comply with, and make choice of thee? Make it willing to consent to, and
aquiesce in that admirable contrivance of Saving me by Jesus Christ? Lord
display the Riches of thy Grace, and the Glories of thy Love so effectually
before it, that it may be sweetly persuaded and allured to a Compliance; Oh
that by a Discovery of the freeness, fullness and redundancy of thy Grace thou
would draw and attract it to thee, for hereof I am Confidently assured, that
if thou do begin to draw, my Will can do no less than follow after thee.

And now his Voice beginning to be low again, I could hear him speak no more,
only I could sometimes hear him Sigh, and now and then breathe forth an
imperfect Sentence, as, Lord how long; or, Oh when will thou come unto me, etc.
When he had done, he came out, and I saw him go into a little Walk not far from
the place, as soon as he came there, he met with Will, Judgment, and Affection,
and so they walked together, and as they walked, he began to break the Matter
to Mr. Will thus, You know, Sir, said he, that you and I have for a long time
been loving friends and Intimate associates, have maintained an exact
Correspondence, and with equal consent have spent our time in Sin and
Wickedness: Raised an unreasonable Rebellion against, and maintained an
unlawful War with our Sovereign, and that with such a preposterous Ingratitude
and amazing Folly, Madness, and Foolhardiness; that we have taken the very
Mercies which we received from him, and made Weapons of them wherewith to fight
against him, and in the mean time laughed at our own Danger, and sported with,
and made light of his Power; nay, we have even run upon the very Bosses of his
Buckler, and played at the Mouth of his Roaring Cannon; and although sometimes
he has laid hard at us, yet we have refused to yield, and when he has offered
us a Truce, and proposed Terms of Reconciliation, we have scorned them; and yet
you cannot but be sensible that he has infinitely the odds of us, for the very
Ground whereon we stand to fight, is full of Pits and Snares, and Incommodated
with a Thousand Inconveniences, besides which it borders upon an Unfadomable
Precipice, on the very Brink whereof we have frequently played, and sported our
selves with the Rolling Fire, and Unquenchable Flame wherewith it is filled:
You know likewise that our Feet frequently slipped, and we had both of us like to
have fallen into it, especially one time, when, if you remember, we were
brought down to the very Gates of Tophet, and the shadow of Death covered us,
it was only the Effect of Divine Patience that we then escaped it; but now I am
Informed, (nay and I am sure it is certainly true too) that our Sovereign Armed
with Fury and Revenge, is Marching against us, and is resolved to tumble us
down into the Pit, as a Reward of our Treason and Rebellion against him; to
prevent which, and in order to the making my Peace with him, I am Advised to
fly to a City that stands in yonder narrow way, the Name whereof is Conversion,
and I think they say the Name of the City is Refuge, through which lies the
way to Celestial Happiness; they give such an admirable Description of the
City, and such Convincing Reasons why I ought to repair to it, that I am
inclined to yield to their persuasions, and in regard there is so near a
Relation between us, I would fain have you to go with me; nay I cannot go
without you; and therefore, pray Sir, be so kind to your self and me, as to
Consent to go with me; for the truth is, I must not, I cannot, I dare not take
a denial from you. When he had done, Judgment and Affection seconded him,
laying down diverse weighty and excellent Arguments why he was obliged to comply
with a Motion founded upon such admirable Reason, and by the Complying with
which he might reap such an extraordinary advantage.

I perceived by the Countenance of the Man, that the Lectures which had been
read to him were very distasteful and unpleasant, and no way suitable to his
Corrupt Inclinations; for scornfully throwing up his deformed and Misshapen
Head, Rolling about his Luxurious and Adulterous Eyes, and holding up his
Sturdy and Rebellious hand, he began to Huff and Hector at a strange Rate, and
cried out to them after this manner.

Pray, Sirs, leave off your Canting, away with your whining, I cannot endure
it; if you love me, give over your Importunities, and let me alone, leave me to
my Sensual Delights, and the Pleasure of my present Enjoyments, for I assure
you, you shall not prevail with me to part with or relinquish them. Tell not me
of Danger; I see none, fright me not with Tophet, I feel it not; nor terrify
me with your Stories of Infinite Justice and Divine Vengeance, for I fear them
not; you shall impose none of your Melancholy Fancies upon me, nor will I
believe any of your Chimera's; you tell me of a Strange kind of Happiness, you
know not where nor when; you tell me of strange kind of Horror and Torments,
but where, or what they are, you know no more than my self: You tell me
likewise of Death and Judgment, which indeed is of most weight with me, and I
acknowledge my self most affected therewith; because I have Daily Objects of
Mortality before my Eyes, and the very Emblem or Effigies of Death is
frequently represented to my view in the Death of my Relations and Friends;
nay, the fading Flower, and the withering Grass read me perpetual Lectures of
my frailty; and the Tolling Bell often brings News, that the Destroyer is
abroad, and terrifies me with Alarms of his approaching toward me; but yet
this also seems at a great distance, for Death is not yet come within view of
me. I am young, and in my strength, and enjoy the Greenness and Verdure of my
Youth, the Prime of my Days are not half spent, and I have many Years to pass
over before I arrive at Old Age, some of which, at least I resolve to spend in
my present Courses, and lay out on my sinful Dalsiances; its time enough to
Repent hereafter, when I have satisfied my Soul with Pleasure, and glutted my
self with the Creature, then I will begin to think of Heaven; for I think, that
when Death, Judgment, and Eternity, with the other terrible things whereof you
tell me begin to mend their pace, and make more speed in their Approaches
toward me; it will be the fittest time for me to fly to this City of Refuge,
and till then, pray let me alone, for I am yet free, and am resolved not to
bring my self into a Voluntary Bondage.

Having given this cross and untoward Answer to what they had proposed: He
turned about, and was going away in a Rage, but methoughts I saw Judgment lay
hold on him, and cry, pray Sir turn again, and let us Debate this Matter with a
little more Consideration and less Partiality, lay aside your Heat and your
Prejudice, and attend with Patience to what we have further to offer, and when
you have heard it, then Judge of it with a Mind, not Predetermined against it,
but resolving within it self to be Convinced by it, and yield to it if it be
backed with sufficient Authority, by its agreeableness to and Correspondency
with the Rules of Scripture and Reason.

I perceive that what we have Proposed has angered you, and put you into a
fume; but pray sit down and consider a little, whether notwithstanding all that
Confidence and Fearlesness you have expressed, and that Courageous and Heroic
temper of Mind you boast your self to be the Master of, you can endure without
any kind of Concernment or Grief to think of being everlastingly shut from the
presence of the Eternal, and Banished the Beatifical Vision of his Face: Can
you take Pleasure think you in being for ever Banished the Presence of the
Lamb, whose Person is so Comely and Glorious, and his Face Clothed with such
admirable and ravishing Smiles, that it contains in it, and conveys
unexpressible Pleasures and Delights, and inconceivable Joy and Consolation to
those happy Persons who are admitted to the beholding and contemplating
thereof: Can you, I say, endure to think of the loss of all this, together with
the loss of the Company of the Holy Angels and Glorified Souls, who there
Celebrate an Eternal Marriage, and keep an Everlasting Sabbath: And being
raised to the highest Pinnacle of Admiration and Joy, with Exalted Voices and a
Divine Harmony, sweetly Sing forth, and perpetually Breathe out their Praises
and Adorations of him, who having died for them, and washed them from their
Sins in his own Blood, has now made them Kings and Priests unto God, and to
himself for ever. Or, admit you can think of all this without being concerned
or grieved for your loss, yet tell me, can you as easily endure the Vengeance
of Eternal Fire? Are you willing to exchange your stately House, your pleasant
Fields, and your delightful Orchards for everlasting Burnings? Can you consent
to have your Merry and your Jovial Company, which you now keep, exchanged for
that of the Damned; or those Musical and Harmonious sounds wherewith you are so
much delighted, for the Hideous roaring, and dismal Outcries and Shrieks which
the Extremity of their Pain, and the Depth of their Despair extort from them?
Are you willing to have that Sweet Air wherein you now breathe, and which you
suck in with so much complacency, converted into the Nauseous and Offensive
Fumes that flow from burning Brimstone, or to have this Pleasant Light, and
Delightful Day which you now enjoy, turned into an Eternal Night? What think
you, will a Burning Oven, or a Glowing Furnace be an easy Lodging for thee?
can thou feed upon devouring fire, and satiate thy Thirst with Boiling Oil?
or can thou swallow Scalding Lead, and Drink down Burning Brimstone with as
much eagerness and delight as now thou do Wine in thy Rioting and
Drunkenness? Thou now accountest the Duties of Religion hard and unpleasing;
how then will thou suffer all those Torments? Thou now deridest Hell as a
Scarecrow, because thou have not felt its Pangs, nor met with any, who having
made their escape thence, could with their Flaming Tongues relate to thee the
Terrors thereof; but whatever it seems to thee now, Oh how will it appear to
thee then, when thou find thy self really sinking, and the Day is come when
thou must actually descend into it, and feel thy self wrapped up in the Flames
of it: Oh how terrible it will then be to thee, when thou must bathe thy self
in a Sea of Wrath, and Welter out thy Eternity in a Burning Flame, without
being able by all thy Crying and howling, complaining, and lamenting, to
prevail for one drop of Water to cool thy Flaming Tongue, or obtain the least
Mitigations of the extremities of thy Pain and Torments: Oh think with thy self
how will thy Fleshly Delights, and Dalliances wherein thou now indulgest thy
self, relish with thee then, when they are thus seasoned and sauced.

Methoughts at this Discourse I saw him begin to shrink, and could perceive him
to shake and tremble exceedingly, crying out, Oh Sirs, what shall I do to be
saved? you have by this Discourse very much awakened me out of the deadly
Sleep, and Fatal Lethargy whereinto Lucifer, by the consent of my own wretched
and deceitful (as well as deceived) Heart, had hushed me; you have convinced me
of the danger and dreadfulness of my Condition, and now I am freely willing,
and give my consent that he should go on Pilgrimage, and Promise that I will
bear him Company, and assist him in his way to Celestial Paradise, and to
Morrow we will begin our Journey thither.

Having thus prevailed with Will, and got his Consent to go on Pilgrimage, the
time likewise being so very near wherein they were to set out toward the Place
where his Blessed Redeemer Resided, and kept his Celestial Court: He went away
wonderfully pleased, being in a kind of Rapture upon the account of his
Victory, and the Happiness he expected as the Consequence thereof; and
methoughts I could do no less than rejoice with him too. But as I lifted up my
Eyes, I espied a certain Person coming toward the Place where we were, and
although when I first espied him, he seemed to be at so great a distance, that
I could but just discern him, yet he came forward with such swiftness, that in
less time than a Minute he was got just by the place where the Man stood; his
Person was so deformed and ugly, and his Countenace so grim and terrible, that
I presently fancied he was no Mortal, but rather some Malicious Devil, who
envying that any should be happy, since he was Damned to be Eternally
Miserable, for when I looked earnestly upon him, I could perceive a kind of
Blew Sulphury Flame come out of his Mouth, and he breathed Fire out of his
Nostrils as out of a Furnace, the Smoke whereof Infected and Putrified the very
Air, impregnating it with such an oftensive and Sulphury smell, that it almost
suffocated me, and his Eyes seemed to be so swelled with fury, that they were
ready to burst, and as they rolled about, they sparkled like a Burning Coal,
threatening Ruin to all upon whom they were fixed: Well, thought I, this poor
Man is beset by this Fiend, what will he do, or how will he defend himself
against him; how will he be able to grapple with him, since he is so strong and
powerful, that he did in the very first Battle that ever he fought, after his
coming into the Infernal Regions, by his own proper strength, without any kind
of help, or Auxiliary Forces, overcome and Conquer the whole Humane Race, yea
struck them Dead, and laid them at his Feet at the very first blow. And Holy
Writ terms him the Power of Darkness, and the Prince of the Power of the Air.
Besides if he could defend himself against his Power and Strength, so that he
could not overcome him by open Force, yet he is so great a Politician, and
Master of so much Subtilty, that his Devices for the Ruin of poor Mortals are
innumerable, and his Wiles for the wheedling and Wiredrawing them into his
destructive Snares, so many and various, that without an extraordinary care,
and continually watching and eyeing of them, it is impossible for the most
careful and prying Soul to trace or discern them, for if they neglect their
Watch but an hour or two, they unawares fall into such a Labyrinth, and find
therein so many Crosses and difficult Paths, wherein are so many turnings and
windings, that they find it the most difficult and intricate matter imaginable
to get out again; and some never find the way out, but are lost therein for
ever. Now methoughts, I said to my self, alas, poor Man, what will thou do, how
will thou be able to resist this Strong, and this Subtle Adversary, since thou
art but a poor thing, but just now, nay hardly yet escaped out of his base and
slavish Vassalage, and have not had time to recover thy Strength, make
Provision of Forces for thy Assistance, or cast up any Breast Works to defend
thee from his Assaults; and just as I had done speaking these Words, I saw him
lay hold of the Man, and with a furious Countenance demand of him what he did
there, why he was not with the Company he was wont to keep? and many such like
Questions, telling him he was a Traitor, a Rebel, a Schismatic, a Puritan, a
Precisian; that he was Headstrong, Stubborn, Disobedient to the Church, and
what not; and therefore, said he, I command you upon your Allegiance to go back
again, and wholly lay aside all thoughts of the Pilgrimage you had designed,
for I will assure you its a very silly Contrivance to forsake such pleasant
Company, and relinquish so Sweet and Pleasant Enjoyments whereof you are
already in present possession, for something which you have never seen, felt,
or enjoyed, and so cannot possibly be assured that they are certainly true, or
supposing them to be true, yet there are several Discouragements attending your
Pilgrimage to Celestial Paradise, which are sufficient to dissuade any Wise and
Considerate Man from attempting of it. As First, you will meet with but little
Company upon that Road, and what you do meet with, will be but mean and odd
kind of Persons, you will find them all Pevish and Froward; some Loose and
Scandalous; others Rigged and Censorious, ready to catch at, and quarrel with
you for the meanest trifles; you will likewise, if you prosecute your intended
Journey, subject your self to abundance of Perils and Dangers; therefore, pray
go back to your Company: There is at the Tavern in yonder High way, a meeting
of several of your acquaintance to Drink Healths, and Huzza's: I charge thee to
go thither to them, and by employing thy self in those Exercises wear out of,
and Banish from your Mind those idle Fancies, and Groundless Whimsies which
has of late crept into it: There is likewise a little further, about three or
four steps beyond the Tavern a spacious Theater, where there will be a Commedy
Acted this Afternoon, being exactly at three of the Clock, I Command you to go
thither likewise for the same purpose; so that you may see all my Commands are
easy to be performed, agree exactly with your Natural Inclinations, and afford
as much pleasure and satisfaction to your self as advantage to me.

It Is true, replied he, you have ever pretended to a Sovereignty over me, and
have with a Tyrannous and Arbitrary Insolency commanded my Thoughts, and
disposed my Actions, and it is as true, that I have yielded an absolute
Obedience to all your Commands; made my self a Slave and Vassal by the doing
your Drudgery, and provoked my Rightful Sovereign against me, only to gratify
your Hellish Revenge, and give you an opportunity of insulting over the Wretch
you have by your Subtilty and Malice made Eternally miserable: Yet I absolutely
deny that ever you had any true and rightful Power over me, but you were a
cruel Tyrant and Usurper; nor had I any power to dispose of my self to you, but
was guilty of as great Usurpation in suffering my self to be so imposed upon,
as you were in attempting it, since I was His, by Infinite Obligations. Besides
I am informed that your Work, as hard and difficult as it is, will be rewarded
with nothing but Death; wherefore I found my self constrained to leave your
Service, and enter my self a Servant to the Eternal, who is my Liege Lord, and
do resolve to continue so for ever, in defiance of thee and all thou can do.
Hereat methoughts the Fiend stormed exceedingly, and with a fierce and terrible
Countenance, he roared in a most hideous Manner, breathing forth immediate
Ruin and Destruction to the poor trembling Wretch, if he did not yield, so
that I looked when he should be Slain and Trampled under Foot by his proud and
insulting Foe. But whilst I stood thus doubtful what would be the issue of that
great Combat; lo as I looked earnestly upon them, I saw the poor thing pluck
up his Courage, and very nimbly draw a Sword which he had formerly received out
of the Sacred-Armory, wherewith he began to lay about him wonderfully; crying,
Oh, how shall I do this great Wickedness and Sin against God; and charged so
home upon his Adversary with that Sword, that notwithstanding all that force
and strength wherewith he made resistance, he found himself under a necessity
to give back and flee; whereby I perceived that what is said of him in Holy
Writ, is certainly true; resist the Devil and he will flee from you. And now
methoughts I saw the Man look very cheerfully, and discover much briskness and
agility in his walking, as being in a Rapture of Joy for his Victory; but as I
afterward perceived the Fiend by this means took advantage against him, for
seeing his Enemy fled, and himself become Master of the Field, he was now more
secure, being altogether void of any dread or fear of his adversary's rallying
again, when indeed he only retreated to take breath, and contrive some new
Stratagem for the renewing the Battle with better advantage to himself;
wherefore I saw that when he was got a little way out of sight, he made a
stand, and having paused a little, he turned about, and presently advanced
toward the late Victor, whose thoughts were so taken up with his Conquest,
that he never saw the return of his Adversary; whereupon I heard him say thus
to himself; well now I have him sure enough, he overmatched me in Strength, by
reason of his Sword, the keenness whereof I cannot endure, nor have I any
Armor that will defend me from the Fatal Effects of it, when it is wisely used
by those that have it; but I shall overmatch him in Craft, and bring about that
by Subtilty, which I could not do by Violence. I began now to wonder in my
self, what Method he would take next in Assaulting him, but he soon resolved me
by putting his Device in practice; and first, I saw him becken a Person who was
in the Man's Company (I think they call him Fancy) to come to him, he
presently went upon the first call. Well Friend, said he, you and I have been
old Acquaintance, and we have been always very Familiar together, upon which
score I make bold to desire your Company at this time, to acquaint you how you
may do me an extraordinary kindness, and I request your ready endeavor to
accomplish it. You need not question it, Sir, replied Fancy, for I am
naturally inclined to Froth and Vanity, and am in my Element when Actually
employed in your Service, wherein I have found more sweetness than in any thing
else whatsoever. I am glad to find you so pliable, said the Fiend to him, and
now therefore I will tell you the thing I would have you do for me; you see
that Man which walks yonder is turned Rebel against me, has cast off my Power
and Authority, and is removing himself and all that he has quite out of my
Territories, intending to go and settle himself in Celestial Paradise; I know
that if ever he get within that place, he will be far beyond my reach, and
there will be no possibility of ever coming at him, or revengeing my self upon
him, and therefore I resolve to use my uttermost endeavor to withdraw his
thoughts from thence, and prevail with him to return to his former Pleasures
and Delights. I know likewise, that the chief Man with him is one Mr. Heart, I
think they now call him Mr. New-Heart, although when they were both in my
Service, this New-Heart was then an Old Man, he was then very familiar with me,
and I made him my Confident, and one of my Council; and he used to lodge me in
his best Room; but of late he is grown wonderful shie, and will not by any
means come at me, nor suffer me to come at him, but I know that you have so
much Power with him, and such an influence upon him, by reason of your Intimacy
and Familiarity, that you can prevail with him to do any thing; and if I can
draw him over to my side, he will bring the rest along with him. Now therefore
take these fine, sweet and pleasant things which I now give you, and lay them
just before him, and let them be displayed by you to the best advantage, and by
the strength of your imagination the enjoyment of them must be represented as
the best and most desirable Happiness he can possibly obtain: And now, Sir,
said he, if you will undertake it, and do your best for the performing of it, I
do not question but I shall succeed and reduce him to my Obedience again. Now I
understood that the Man was altogether ignorant of this Conspiracy which was
thus strongly Combinated against him, nor did he in the least perceive the
Snare which was thereby laid for his Eternal Ruin, which made me burst forth
into the following Lamentation for the dangerousness of his Condition. Alas,
poor Man, said I, I find thee to be in a far worse condition now than thou wast
before, although then it was bad enough with thee, for thou have not only a
Strong and Subtle Adversary to fight with, but thou have those about thee too,
who Conspire to betray thee into his Hands; and that which is yet more sad, and
I fear will prove more Fatal to thee, is, that thou art ignorant of all this,
and so in the more danger of being ensnared and ruined thereby.

Fancy being thus instructed, went his way, and managed the business so
sliely, that Mr. Heart was intoxicated therewith; whereupon I saw the Fiend
send one of his Companions, whose Name as I understand was Asmodai, to lay some
pleasing Object in the Man's way, in hope that he would be taken therewith, and
accordingly he having planted himself in a certain way through which he knew
the Man would pass; he dropped down something just before him as he passed by; it
is not convenient for me to tell you what it was, but thus much I may adventure
to tell you, it was something which he had formerly been very much in Love
with, and was so suitable to his Temper, bore such an exact resemblance to his
Complexion; and was so ingrafted into, and interwoven with his very Nature,
that you would have taken it for an Essential part thereof; when he First saw
it, he gave a little start, seeming much amazed to find it there, concluding as
I understood, that he had left it so far behind, that he should never have seen
it more; after a little pause he turned his Head away and would not give it a
look, but went forwards as fast as he could. well, thought I, this Man will not
be so easily ensnared as I was afraid he would have been; but I was not long in
that Mind; for I found that notwithstanding his seeming resolution at first,
yet he began to flag and yield, for although he turned away from the Object it
self, yet Mr. Fancy so ordered the matter, that he had the perfect Image and
Idea of it continually before his Eyes, and imprinted so firmly in his Mind,
that he could not possibly raze it out, and remembering the former Love he had
for it, and the sweetness of those Pleasures the enjoyment thereof had yielded
him, he began to find himself somewhat pacified toward it, and his indignation
against it to cease; whereupon he first admitted it into his sight, then
adventured to play with it, and at last (although not without some reluctance)
he consented to a perfect Reconciliation, and admitted it to the same
familiarity and indearness wherewith he had formerly embraced it, and so fell
insensibly into the Snare which was laid for him by the Fiend, who was as I am
informed the Prince of Darkness himself. Methoughts I found my self very much
grieved and troubled thereat, concluding that he had by this means put an end
to all his Conviction, and banished the thoughts of his Pilgrimage to Celestial
Paradise, fearing lest being thus Wheedled into the Labyrinth whereof I told
you before, he should be Eternally lost therein, without being ever able to
find the way out, or free himself from the intricacies and perplexities
thereof; and that which increased my fear, and confirmed me the more strongly
in my Opinion, that there was a final period put to all further proceedings in
his intended Pilgrimage, was the seeing of him after he had dallied and sported
sometime with this lately banished, but now reconciled Darling, turn again to
his former Company, and dance with them as eagerly as ever about the bottomless
Pit, only with somewhat more Caution than formerly; this made me think of what
I had formerly read in Holy Writ, which says of some Persons, that their
goodness is like the early Dew which quickly passes away: I could not choose
likewise but observe, that how strong soever Convictions are, if the Heart be
not really and thoroughly changed, and the Will subjected to, and melted into
the Divine Will, our Sense of Sin, and our dread of Danger will by little and
little wear off, and we shall become as vain and as loose as ever: Now you must
know that this alteration opened the Mouth of Conscience, and made him Roar
again, and Thunder more loud than ever, Denounceing the Judgments of the
Eternal against him now as an Apostate; telling him, that it had been far
better for him never to have known the Ways of Righteousness, than thus basely
and shamefully to turn out of them again to the Ways of Sin and Wickedness; all
which he had learnt to Answer, by acknowledging the truth of what Mr.
Conscience said, and crying, I wish it were better, and I would I could do
otherwise, if I were to begin again I would be more careful, and watch more
against the Devices of the Prince of Darkness, that so I might not be thus
easily betrayed by him into his Snares and Gins; but alas, now it is too late,
and having been deluded thus far out of the way, I may as well venture over
Shoes over Boots; it is now too late to return, I would to God it were not so.
Nay, said Conscience, now you talk very foolishly, for the farther you have
gone from your Happiness, more haste you ought to make your return toward it,
and the more you have offended that Divine Goodness which has condescended so
far, and stooped so low as to offer you terms of Mercy and Pardon,
Reconciliation and Eternal Salvation; the more speed you should make to Confess
and acknowledge the same, and the more Hearty should you be in your lamenting
and mourning over it; and when you have so done, then you must turn to him, who
never, never, never changes, and whose Love is like himself, an unchangeable
and an unalterable Love. Oh that I could do so, said he, but I cannot, I have
now multiplied my iniquities against him, and my Sins are increased as the
Stars of Heaven, or the Sands on the Sea Shore. What though they be, said one,
whose Name to the best of my Remembrance was Hope, who now began to speak, and
of whom I had taken no notice till now, they are not too great for Almighty
Power to conquer, nor yet too many for Divine goodness to forgive, he has
Strength enough to subdue all your Corruptions, and Mercy enough to Pardon all
your Crimes; your Sins are great indeed, but his Mercies are greater, for they
are Infinite; your Sins are many, and increased to a great number, but his
Mercies are more, for they are numberless; the cry of thy Sins are reached up
to Heaven, but his Mercies are above the Heavens; now therefore take courage
and adventure to cast thy self at his Feet, and lie at his Mercy, and do as the
Church we Read of in Divine Story did, cry after him, my Father, my Father, the
hope of his Youth. Oh, said he, this is good Council, and I would to God I
could do according to it, but I cannot, Oh I cannot do it. Nay then, said
Conscience, I denounce thee to be a Wicked and an Accursed Wretch, Cursed in
time, and Cursed in Eternity, for the great Lawgiver, whose Vicegerent I am,
has declared in the Records of his Law, that whosoever continues not in every
thing that is written in the Book of the Law to do them, is accursed; and I who
being a Witness of, and having Recorded all thy Wicked and Profane Actions, am
empowered with Authority from him to pass Judgment upon thee, do declare that
thou have not continued in all things that are written in the Book of the Law
to do them, and therefore thou art the Man which the Righteous Judge of Heaven
and Earth has denounced Accursed; nay, if it be possible, thou art more than
Accursed; for first, thou have not only, not continued in all things written in
the Book of the Law to do them, but thou have continued in nothing that is
written in the Book of the Law to do it; there is not one Command in the whole
Book of the Law, but what thou have violated and broken; thou have wickedly and
wilfully acted contrary to all its Rules, and Rebelled against every Precept
contained therein. And Secondly, thou have not only done all this, but when the
Offenced Majesty of Heaven and Earth, had out of the good Pleasure of his Will
Graciously provided a Remedy, in the Person of the Redeemer, offerring that he
should by his Infinite Merits make a full satisfaction to Divine Justice for
the wrong which thou had done, and which was so great, that you as a Finite
Creature were not able to satisfy, any otherwise than by suffering the
Vengeance of Eternal Fire, and that you should moreover upon your accepting of,
and imbraceing this offered Redeemer, become reconciled to him, and enjoy all
the Felicity and Glories of Heaven, you disdainfully scorned and slighted them,
rejecting the Council of God against thy self; now therefore, if those who are
altogether ignorant of this Savior, and by reason of their living in
Heathenish or Mohammedan Regions have never received the offer of a Blessed
Redeemer, are accursed, and must suffer the Sentence of Eternal Damnation: How
much sorer Punishment think you, will you be thought worthy of, who have
spurned against the very Bowels of Mercy, trampled under Foot the Offers of
Pardon, and spit in the very Face of a Tender and Compassionate Savior. Ah,
Sir, said he, all that you have said I acknowledge to be true, and it all helps
still to aggravate my Misery, and heighten my Offense, and makes my Crimes too
great to be Pardoned. But, pray Sir, said Mr. Hope, let me prevail with you to
cast your self on the Merits of our Savior, and lie at the Fountain of Mercy.
In the Condition wherein you now are, you must of necessity be for ever
Miserable, you can be no more if we suppose the worst, that you should not be
accepted; Oh therefore resolve, that if thou must Perish thou will Perish at
the Fountain of free Grace, and if thou must be cast away, tell him whose
goodness is as large as his power, and knows no other limits than his own
Omnipotency, that thou art resolved it shall be upon the very Shore of that
Ocean which is so full of Mercy, that its Depth is unfathomable, and its
Breadth unmeasurable; and let me tell thee for thy further encouragement, that
although thou can hear nothing from the Eternal now, but Vengeance is mine
and I will repay it, says the Lord; I will tear you in pieces, and there shall
be none to deliver; there is no Peace to the Wicked, says my God; and although
the Sinner live to be an hundred years old, he shall be accursed; so are the
Paths of all them who forget God, and the hope of the Hypocrite shall perish;
yet if you will fly to the City of Refuge, and get the Son of the Blessed to
Interceede for thee; thou will then find him speaking to thee in another kind
of Dialect, and he will tell thee that he was indeed angry with thee, but his
Anger is now appeased; he was thine Enemy, but he is now become thy everlasting
Friend; his Hatred, and his Vengeance, his Justice and his Fury was to have
been thy Portion, but now his Goodness and his Love shall be thine Eternal
Inheritance, you shall be an Instrument of my Honor in this World, and I will
make thee a Vessel of Glory in the other; I will Bless you with my special
presence in thy Soul, and that shall both fit and prepare thee for, and be an
assurance and earnest of the enjoyment of my immediate Presence in Heaven, I
will teach thee so to order thy Conversation aright, that at the end of it I
may show thee my Salvation; the fullness of my Son, and the Alsufficiency of my
self, shall be an inexhaustible and overflowing Fountain to thee. Now prithee
tell me, continued he, is not all this worth the adventuring for? Yes, replied
he, it is, and Oh* that I could follow your Advice, but there are so many
Discouragements, that I cannot adventure. No, said Conscience, then I tell thee
that thou art the most hardened and impenitent wretch that ever I met with in my
whole life; I tell you your danger; Mr. Judgment has informed you how to
prevent it, and here is your good Friend Mr. Hope, gives you all the
encouragement that can possibly be expected or desired to make trial of his
Advice: Pray let me have your Answer what you do intend to do in this Case, for
I must not, nor will not be thus put off with delays any longer. Awake and
rouse up thy self, thou have been often complaining of, and lamenting thy Base,
Vain, and Earthly Heart, and bitterly Exclaimed against thy Sloathful,
Lingering, Careless, and Delaying Temper, have often been wishing that things
were, and hoping that they would one day be better with thee, promising thy
self that it will not be always thus with thee, but that thou shall some time
or other get rid of thy intanglements, and go thy Pilgrimage; but Oh, what if
thou should after all this wishing, and woulding, and hoping, and expecting
it to be better with thee, let things run on thus from Day to Day, and so from
one Year to another, until thou art surprised by the King of Terrors, and be by
him hurried away before ever thou art come to a point, or made any resolution
what to resolve on, or have gotten thy Heart to a through, and a saving closing
with the Redeemer; Oh now consider what will become of thee if the Case should
be so with thee; do thou think that thy Golden or Silver Key will open the
Gates of Heaven, and shut the Gates of Hell to thee, or purchase thee an
Inheritance in the Promised Land; or can thou be so Vain and so Foolish as to
imagine that the remembrance of thy ease, thy pleasure, or thy plenty here,
will alleviate thy Pain, or procure thee any kind or manner of ease in thy
Eternal Dolours, or yield any Comfortable or Refreshing Consolations to thy
miserable Soul when it lies Broiling upon the Hot and Scorching Coals of Divine
Fury, and Frying in the Burning Flame. Thou art by this shuffleing and
procrastinating Guilty of Monstrous Madness and Folly, and art so Mercilesly
cruel to thy self, that the very Angels blush at thee, and are ashamed of thy
Brutishness, and even the Heavens and the Earth are Amazed, and all the
Creatures stand Astonished at it. This Discourse made him Tremble exceedingly,
and very much revived his Convictions again, and he solemnly promised
Conscience that he would now resolve to go on Pilgrimage, and promised to begin
his Journey on the Morrow, protesting that he did really intend to do as he
said, wherewith Conscience being satisfied held his Peace for that time. I
looked still when Mr. Affection should have appeared, and have Contributed
something toward so good a Work, since he had formerly been so much for, and
promised such large Assistance in the performing the Pilgrimage to Celestial
Paradise, but upon inquiring into it, I found he was wholly taken off, and
diverted by the late Reconciled Companion, and so fallen in Love, and taken up
with him, that he had not time or leisure to look toward, or so much as think
of Paradise, but instead thereof, as soon as he saw Conscience and the Man was
parted, he presently stepped to him, and endeavored to dissuade him from it,
telling him what new Delights and Sweetness their Friend Fancy had found out
in other Objects, especially in that which you wot of, said he, to which I
perceive you are by his means, together with some little Assistances
contributed toward it by my self and Mr. Heart, almost wholly reconciled
again. And Fancy being by, seconded him, Representing and Guilding things
over with such Artificial Glosses and Smooth Appearances of Delight and
Advantage, that the poor Man, was absolutely bewitched and Enchanted thereby,
so that he presently forgot all the Terrors of Conscience, and all the Solemn
Promises and Protestations he had made but just before of beginning his
Pilgrimage the next Day, which made me think of what I had formerly read in
Drexelius his excellent Treatise of Eternity.

I will to morrow, that I will,
I will be sure to do it;
To morrow comes, to morrow goes,
And still thou art to do it;
And thus Repentance is deferred
From one day to another,
Until the day of Death does come,
And Judgment is the other.
But yet the free Grace and Goodness of him whose Name is I am, whose Love is
unchangeable, and Mercy so unsearchable, that it is past finding out, and who
does whatsoever he pleases, being moved and inclined to do all that he does,
only by the Dictates of his own Counsel, and the good pleasure of his Will,
would not suffer it to be so with this Man; resolving, as I did perceive, that
the Prince of Darkness should not make a Prey of him, nor would he permit him
to erect Trophies of Honor and Triumph to himself upon this Man's Overthrow and
Ruin; notwithstanding the poor wretch himself was freely willing to be a Slave
and Vassal with quiet, rather than be a King with some little hazard and
danger, in the Way through which he must pass to his Coronation.

Wherefore he sent Boanerges to him again, Commanding him to Preach another
Lecture about the danger and dreadfulness of his Condition, and to denounce
Judgment against him, if he did not immediately Repent, and fly to the City of
Refuge: Having received this Command, he presently obeyed, and thus he began;

Thou Wicked, Vile, and Miserable Wretch, said he, that have been so ungrateful
as to slight and refuse the Offers of Mercy and Pardon, and have like an
hardened wretch, made the Son of the Blessed, whose Countenance is White and
Ruddy, and his Person altogether Lovely, being the chiefest of ten thousands;
and in point of Excellency, infinitely beyond Comparison, stand knocking at thy
Door, Entreating, Persuading, and Wooing thee for admittance into thy Heart,
and a Grant of thy Love, until his Head was wet with the Dew, and his Locks
with the Drops of the Night: The Prince of Peace will shortly therefore appear
against thee as a Rageing and a Devouring Lion, and shall come from Heaven with
his Mighty Angels in Flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on thee, because thou
know not God, nor wilt yield Obedience to the Gospel, and shall punish thee
with an everlasting Destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the
Glory of his Power; and Oh, how amazing and cuttingly will the very first
appearance of the Son af Man's coming in the Clouds with Power and great Glory,
strike into thy Guilty and Self Condemned Heart, then thou will begin with
inexpressible Grief and Bitterness of Spirit to sigh and say within thy self.
Oh that strong and Terrible Judge whom I now see sitting down upon yonder
Flaming, White, and Glorious Throne, accompanied with all the Blessed
Inhabitants, and Shining Courtiers of Heaven, is that same Blessed Redeemer,
and Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, that sweetest Lamb, who did most
Graciously power out his most precious Blood like Water for me, that I might
thereby have been Washed, and Cleansed, Sanctified, and Saved; and he it was,
who so fairly and frequently Invited and Wooed me with the most Powerful and
Charming Arguments, and Terms of Dearest Love, but only to abandon my Lust,
and bid Adieu to the Prince of Darkness, who was my implacable Enemy, and then
sought, and has now together with my own wilfulness accomplished my utter
Ruin; promising that if I would give my Consent, he, even he, would become my
Alsufficient and Everlasting Husband, and if I had then accepted it, he would
now at this very time have placed an Immortal and Splendid Crown of Heavenly
Bliss and Matchless Glory upon my Head with his own Almighty Hand: But woe, and
alas, I like a wilful, foolish, and desperate wretch neglected this great
Salvation, forsook my own Mercy, and so judged my self unworthy of Eternal
Life, and like a Cruel and Bloody Butcher to my own Soul, I have Inhumanly
Murdered and Destroyed my self; and therefore happy were I now, if I could
Entreat some Rock to fall on me, or persuade some vast and mighty Mountain to
cover me, under the Ruins whereof I might lie everlastingly hid from the Face
of him that sits on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb; Oh that I might
now be turned into the Meanest, and Basest, and most Despicable Beast, might be
changed into a Bird, a Stone, or a Tree, or any other thing how Contemptible
soever: Oh that I might by all my Supplications and Tears obtain the favor
only to Evaporate into Air, or be quite Annihilated, and put into the same
state wherein I was before ever I had any Being; I should now account my self
Blessed and Happy that ever I was Born, if I could now be unborn; Ah that my
Soul might now become Mortal, that I might die in Hell, and not welter
Eternally in those Fiery Torments to which I am now to be Damned by a Just, and
Everlasting, and an Irreversible Sentence; which Torments are too excessive and
Intolerable that I am not able to abide them, and yet so certain and
infallible, that there is no possibility for me to avoid them: I might indeed
in the Day of my Gracious Visitation have escaped them, but now I must lie down
in Sorrow, and Eat the Fruit of my own doings; But all thy Lamentings and
Complainings, thy Bewailing and Mourning thy self, nor all thy Supplications
and Tears, thy Cries, nor thy Prayers will then avail thee any thing; thy
Punishment shall then be proportionate to thy Crime now; thou now refusest to
hear the Charming Invitations, and the Melting Entreaties of the Blessed Jesus,
and then he will refuse to hear thine; thou now hardenest thy Heart against
him, he will then harden his against thee; thou art now deaf to the Calls of
the Gospel, and the Offers of Grace and Salvation, for which the very Rocks
thou call on, and the Mountains whose help and assistance thou vainly
implores to fall on thee, and hide thee from the dreadful Face of the Judge,
and the Penetration of his Fierce and Terrible Eyes, shall then tacitly flout
and upbraid thee for thy folly and madness therein, by standing deaf to all thy
Complaints, and letting thee Beg, Entreat, and Implore their help in vain and
to no purpose, and after all thy reluctance and unwillingness thou shall be
compelled to stand before the Flaming Judgment Seat, and then, and there at
that most impartial, strictest, and last Tribunal give an exact account of
every Act of thy Life and Word of thy Mouth, every thought of thy Heart and
glance of thy Eye, and all the Brutish and Impure Abominations of thy Filthy
Heart, all thy Secret Sins and Closet Villainies, which no Eye ever saw, but
that which is ten thousand times brighter than the Sun, shall then be disclosed
and laid open to the view of all the innumerable Inhabitants of Heaven, Earth,
and Hell, to thy unspeakable and everlasting shame; thou know thy self to be
secretly Guilty of many hateful and abhorred Crimes, which thou would not
should be discovered for the whole World, or known to any but thy self, or it
may be to two or three of those filthy and profane Wretches, who are thy
accursed Companions and Partners therein; but assure thy self, that at that Day
all shall be discovered, and thou shall be displayed and laid out in thy
Colors in the Face of Heaven and Earth to thine Eternal Confusion. In what a
woeful case think thou will thy heavy Heart then be, what amazing Terrors and
desperate Rage and Despair will then tear and rend it, if it were possible,
into ten thousand pieces? Ah, how will thy Spirits Faint, and thy Heart Sink
within thee? How will thy Flesh tremble, and thy Head shake, when thou shall
hear the unalterable and irreversible Sentence pronounced upon thee; depart ye
Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; every Word
whereof breathes out Fire and Brimstone, Vengeance, and Misery, and every
Syllable bites deeper, and terrifies more than ten thousand Scorpions Stings.
The very departing from the Glorious Presence of him who is Life it self, were
Hell enough; but thou shall go with a Curse, and not only so, but thou must go
into Fire, and that Fire must be Eternal and Everlasting too, fed continually
with infinite Rivers of Brimstone, and kept in perpetual Flame and Fierceness
by the unquenchable Wrath of the justly Enraged God to all Eternity.

And if the very Pronouncing this Sentence be so amazing and dreadful; Oh, how
will thine Heart Strings crack, and thine Eyes burst with Tears, when thou
shall behold this killing Sentence, putting into Execution, and see the
Devils Actually laying Hands on thee, and draging thee from the presence of the
Judge into that Infernal Prison which is to be thine Eternal abode, and where
all thy Employments shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of Teeth!

Now I could perceive that this Discourse startled and terrified him more than
any he had formerly heard, and that which helped to increase it, was his
fancying that he felt the Ground sink, and the Earth whereon he stood fall from
under him, when turning hastily to see what the Matter was, he thought he saw
the Bottomless Pit opening and extending it self to receive and swallow him up;
with the fright and amazement whereof he suddenly gave a very great start and
ran for his Life, and as he ran, he looked often behind him, as if he
apprehended himself still in danger, and was afraid the Hand of Justice was
pursuing him to throw him down in that dreadful place, but being got a pretty
way from the place, he made a stand, and looking back to see and admire the
dreadfulness of the danger he had escaped, and adore that Divine Goodness which
had sent him so many Warnings of Persuasions to flee from it. And now he began
to consider with himself what he should do, and whither he should repair for
safety. The City of Refuge, to which he had been directed, he saw lay up the
Hill of Self-denial, a Hill very hard and difficult to be climbed up to, and
seeing there were several Refuges nearer at hand, and easier to come at, and
with all as much or more frequented than the other, viz. The Mountains of
Confession, Prayer, Amendment of Life, Holy Duties and Ordinances, with diverse
more which are all Situated thereabouts, he presently fled thither, and took
Sanctuary in them, but notwithstanding innumerable others whom he had found
there, were altogether in Peace, and enjoyed a perfect quietness in their
Spirits, being absolutely free from any fears or apprehensions of the Burning
Lake, yet he could find no such safety and security as others fancied they did,
and he expected he should have found there; but they all cried out to him,
Salvation is not in us, nor is Peace with God, or safety from his Wrath and
Indignation within our borders, and therefore unless you intend go through a by
way to Tophet, and Perish as certainly as if you had never set a step, or moved
a foot toward Paradise, look beyond us, and flee to the only Refuge that can
secure you from the Avenger of Blood, who is still in pursuit of thee, and will
certainly and suddenly overtake thee if thou stayest here; Oh therefore be
advised before he lay hold of thee, and Sheath the Sword of Justice thy Bowels.
You may well imagine that the hearing those terrible, unpleasing, and
unexpected Lectures, where he expected to find nothing but Peace and
Tranquillity, and a perpetual safety from that Desolation and Woe which he found
himself notwithstanding still subject to, and was threatened and denounced
against him with as much terror and fiereeness as ever, filled his very Soul
with trouble and grief, and almost overwhelmed his Spirits with sorrow; the
Arrows of the Almighty stuck fast within him, and the Poison thereof had almost
drank up his Spirits, all which brought him into such inconceivable and
inexpressible perplexities, that I can far better conceive of them my self,
than I can relate them to you; the truth is, the poor Man knew not what to do,
being almost at his Wits Ends, and upon the very Brink and Border of Despair;
whereupon I saw him rouse himself, and fall more roundly to Work, with Prayer
and fasting, keeping the Sabbath, and hearing of Sermons, frequenting of
Lectures and Christian Conferences, and like the Mariners in a Storm, and
ready to Perish, he cast away and abandoned many of those things which hitherto
had been pleasant and delightful, but now he found them to be burdensome and
dangerous to him: notwithstanding all which, no Peace, Comfort, or Consolation
could he obtain; for although he followed hard after them, they fled so fast
from him, that he could not possibly overtake them; whereupon he began to
expostulate with himself after this manner: Unhappy Man that I am, while I
remained in my Course of Sin and Wickedness, I could not be at quiet for
Conscience, who harrased me continually to leave my danceing about the Pit,
which was as he affirmed (and as I am apt to believe) Bottomless, and now I
have complied with his Advice, I cannot as yet obtain any Peace in my Soul;
what can possibly be the reason or occasion thereof? I wish I have not mistaken
the Way which I was directed to take, and am got into some other Path which
leads not to Celestial Paradise, but to some other place, but I certainly think
it cannot be so, for I remember that I have always been told by those who have
been well acquainted with the Way, and are appointed by the King of the
Country to be Guides to those who Travel thither, that Praying, Hearing the
Word, and other such like Holy Exercises wherein I now Employ my self, lead
directly toward Paradise, and yet my Heart misgives me that this cannot be the
Way, because I remember also that they used to describe the Ways of Paradise to
be Ways of Pleasantness, and all the Paths therein to be Paths of Peace; But to
the trouble and disquiet of my Soul I can find no such thing by those ways
wherein I now am: And then directing himself to the Eternal, he said,

O Lord rebuke me not in thine Anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure, for thine Arrows stick fast in me, and thy Hand presses me sore;
there is no soundness in my Flesh, because of thine Anger, neither is there any
rest in my Bones because of my Sin, for thou have brought all mine Iniquities
upon my Head as a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me to bear; my Wounds
stink and are corrupt because of my Foolishness, I am troubled, I am bowed down
greatly, I go Mourning all the day long, my Loins are filled with a loathsome
Disease, and there is no soundness in my Flesh; I am feeble and sore broken, I
have roared by reason of the disquietness of my Soul; but thou, O Lord, know
all my desires, and my groanings are not hid from thee; my Heart pants, and
my Strength fails me, as for the light of my Eyes also, it is gone from me, I
am ready to halt, and my sorrow is ever before me, wherefore I will declare my
Iniquities and be sorry for my Sin, and I will hope in thy Mercy, O Lord; the
sorrows of Hell has compassed me about, and the floods of desolation make me
afraid; the sorrows of Hell has environed me, and the snares of Death
prevented me; but in my distress I will call upon thee, O Lord, and cry unto
thee, O God, thou God of my Salvation, to whom alone is all my desire, and in
whom alone is all my relief and succor; direct me, O God, my strength, guide
me into the way of Holiness, and lead me into the Path wherein thou would
have me to walk: I am feeble, do thou uphold me; my Feet are ready to slip, but
do thou establish me; for thou, O Lord, art my Rock upon which I lean and stay
my self, thou art my Strength and my Redeemer: I am, O Lord, like a weaned
Child, awkward and unskilful to tread in these Paths which are altogether new
and unusual to me, but do thou graciously condescend according to thy promise,
to lead me by the Hand, and teach me to go; Oh leave me not until thou have
conducted me into the way of Life, which leads to the Heavenly Paradise: and
lest there should be any thing in me that may peradventure occasion my falling
short of that blessed place, do thou enter into me, and search my Heart, and
try my Reins, O God, and if thou find any evil way in me, purge it away with
the Blood of thy Son, and guide me into the way everlasting. After this, I saw
that he was somewhat more cheerful than before, but it lasted not long, for as
he afterward told one of his Friends in my hearing, he had something within
him which continually cried unto him, Away Man and flee for thy life, for thou
art not yet safe from the Avenger, who is yet in pursuit after thee, and if
thou escape not quickly, he will certainly lay hold on thee, and thou shall
Perish as surely and much more fatally than if thou had never made any one
step toward an escape; which did terrify him exceedingly, and made him rore
out, and cry for help to him, who has styled himself the God of help, and
promised to be a present help in time of trouble, saying, In the day of trouble
call upon me and I will deliver thee, so shall thou glorify me: Cast thy
Burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee; commit thy way unto to the
Lord, and he shall direct thy Paths: Trust thou in him, and rely on him only,
and he also will bring it to pass. Here Conscience interrupted him somewhat
abruptly, and said, I cannot but wonder at thy desperate madness and folly, in
that thou still abusest the Divine Patience, and by continuing in thy
Obstinacy, dare the Almighty to do his worst, fancying to thy self, that thou
have by thy Repentings and thy Tears, thy Fastings and thy Prayers, and a
little forced partial and imperfect amendment, stopped all his proceedings
against thee, and so tied up his Hands, that he cannot hurt thee, when, alas!
thou art still in the High Way to ruin; thou now endeavourest to set thy self
to keep the Law, but I must still pronounce thee Accursed, because thou
continuest not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them, nor
indeed art thou able to do so; but admit thou were, yet that will not make
satisfaction to Justice for the wrong thou have already done it, the keeping
the Law now, will not compensate, or atone for thy former Breaches of it; nor
must thou expect to put God off with good Words, or fair Promises, plausible
Pretenses, and faint Resolutions; nor will he admit that thou should have
any other Savior than his Son, nor that thou join any thing with him, for he
will have the whole Honor of saving thee, or else he will leave thee still to
Perish in thy Sins. At this I could perceive him to be exceedingly troubled and
terrified, which was much increased by his espying the Avenger Marching against
him, Clothed with Vengeance, and Armed with Fury, Brandishing a Flaming Sword
in his Al-conquering Hand; wherefore he fuddenly cried out to Heaven for help,
looking every way, as if he would run, but knew not whither, for he could
discover no place which promised him more security than that wherein he then
was, and seeing the Avenger was then almost got up to him, and ready to lay
hold of him, he fainted and even despaired of escaping; but just as he was in
the very depth of extremest danger, I looked to see what would become of the
poor thing, and lo suddenly one stepped to him, and with a brisk and cheerful
Voice, cried to him, Oh Sir, why ly you here and perish within view of the
remedy, you have but a little way further to the City of Refuge, where the Son
of the Blessed stands waiting for you, and ready to receive you, if you will
but go to him. This welcome and unexpected Message in the very Minute of the
lowest extremity strangely revived his desponding Soul, and made so great and
sudden an alteration in him, that I can compare it to nothing so well as to the
Prophets Vision of dry Bones, for as one dead he revived, and his Spirits came
into him again; when looking up upon him, he cried, Sir, that which you say
has a little revived my Spirits, and I find a strange kind of sweetness and
delight therein, but pray whereabouts stands this City of Refuge which you
spoke of, I have heard much of it, and have been advised to repair thither, as
the only place where I could be safe; and to tell you the truth, I did think I
had been got into it; and although Mr. Conscience and several others
endeavored to convince me of it, yet I could not be persuaded; but now I see
by woeful experience, that I am more than a Mile short of it, and in as much
danger of Perishing as before I came hither. Why, said the Gentleman, it stands
a little further there right before you in that middle Path between that
wherein you now are, and that from which you lately came; whereupon he looked
that Way with great eagerness, but could not discover it. I have, said the
Gentleman, a Box of Eye Salve which I received from our Lord himself, wherewith
if you please I will Anoint your Eyes to make you see the more clearly. Ah,
with all my Heart, Sir, said he; And when he had so done, he bid him look
toward the place which he pointed to. Do you not see, said he, a little Narrow
Ruged Path that goes up there? Yes, said he, I can see it now, although before
I could not discern it so well: Why that Path is called by diverse Names, but
they all signify the same thing; some call it by the Name Repent and be
Converted that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall
come from the presence of the Lord; others call it by the Name, Believe and ye
shall be saved; with many more, as, Turn and Live; the way of Rigtheousness,
and the way of Peace; the Heavenly Path, etc. Now therefore do you look
straight through it, and you will see a very small and narrow Gate, that Gate
goes directly to the City of Refuge; the Man could not see it at first, but
having fixed his Eyes very steadily, and looked earnestly for some time, he
espied it, which I could perceive by his Countenance, and the Joy he discovered
thereat, to be the Pleasantest and most Blessed sight that ever his Eyes saw;
for there he beheld the Glorious Sun of Righteousness begin to arise upon him,
with healing under his Wings, discovering the Son of the Blessed to stand there
with extended Arms and a smiling Countenance, Clothed with Goodness and Love,
and droping Mercy and Pardon from his Divine Lips, ready to receive and embrace
him, and calling to him, O poor Soul, who art weary and heavy laden, come unto
me and I will give thee rest and ease; this sight presently convinced him that
he was yet really far short of the City of Refuge, cured him of all his
unwillingness to go further than those Mountains where he then was, and
effectually removed all that aukwardness which was upon his Soul, and set his
feet at Liberty to walk toward this place of safety: Upon which I saw him
presently throw away several of those things he had about him, Gird up his
Loins, and run toward it, and being arrived there, attempted to enter, but
could not; for, by reason of the straitness of the Gate, he could not possibly
crowd in, by reason of many things he had yet about him which never pass that
Gate, and are of such a Nature, that any Person who has any of them about him,
cannot enter there, nor go through it to Celestial Paradise, neither is there
any other way to go to it than through that Gate: He attempted to enter diverse
times, but all in vain, until looking behind him, he saw the Avenger just at
his Heels, ready to lay hold on him, and Sheath his destroying Sword in his
Guilty Bowels; whereupon he gave a very great start, threw off those things
which impeded his getting in at the Gate, striping himself of his very
Garments, which were all torn, ragged, and defiled, so that they were not
capable of covering the shame of his Nakedness, and he appeared a very filthy
and loathsome kind of Creature whilst he had them on; being thus stripped, he
entered resolutely into the Gate, striving with all his might to go through it,
and finding much difficulty in the Passage, the Gentleman, who had shown him
the Gate, whose Name I think was Faith, and was a Stranger to the Man till that
time when he showed him the Gate, and directed him the Way to it, helped him to
lay hold of a certain Post placed there on purpose for the help and stay of all
those who pass the Gate; the Name of it is, Him that comes unto me, I will in
no wise cast out: And I saw as he passed through the Gate, he received new
Garments, wherewith being arrayed he seemed like another Man, appearing much
more Beautiful and Comely than before; But that which appeared to me to be most
admirable and strange, I beheld while his Heart was taken out, and another
which was a new one put into him, which although the Prince of Darkness
supposed to have been done before, when the Man first began to think of
forsaking his Service, and turning out of the broad way, yet it was not really
changed and renovated until this very Moment: The Old Heart which was taken out
of him was a perfect Stone, as solid as a Rock, and as hard as the nether
Millstone; But the New Heart, was a Heart of Flesh, being tender, soft, and
pliable, and thereby fit to receive the Sacred impressions of the Divine Will,
and made capable of receiving and retaining the Image of our sweet Redeemer,
which I then saw the Eternal stamp upon it with his own Almighty Hand. And I
saw him as soon as he was got through the Gate, bow himself down to the Earth,
and Worship the Son of the Blessed, and lying prostrate on the Ground before
him, he said as follows;

Almighty and Eternal God; thou King of Kings, and Prince of Peace, whose
Greatness and Power is Infinite; whose Glory and Majesty is Incomprehensible;
whose Goodness and Mercy is unconceiveable; upon thy frequent and often
reiterated gracious Invitations to come unto thee, and thereby be at once
secured from everlasting Ruin and Misery, and Entitled to, and assured of
Eternal Salvation and Happiness, I am now come in according to thy Command, and
in the most humble manner imaginable, prostrating my self before thy Footstool;
I acknowledge my self by Nature to be a most Wicked, Filthy, Polluted, and
Undone Wretch, being born a Stranger, an Enemy, and a Traitor to thee, and by
that Original Guilt which I contracted in the very Womb, inclined to do
Wickedly, and Sin against thee, as naturally as Fire produces heat, or the
Sparks fly upwards; and that I was therefore bound over by a most Just (and
otherwise than by thy Merits Irreversible) Sentence, to Eternal Damnation, and
I found by woeful experience, that I as Naturally tended to, and as freely moved
toward the Burning Lake, as the Stone does toward its Center, having moreover
by my Wicked course and conversation continued my Rebellions against thee, and
thereby rendered my self ten thousand fold more the Child of Hell, having by
rushing into Sinful Courses and Working Wickedness with both Hands greedily
heaped up unto my self Wrath against the Day of Wrath; and as if all these
Offenses were not enough, I have committed a far greater, by Sinning against
the Remedy, and refusing tenders of Grace and Mercy, Pardon and Reconciliation,
which thou were pleased to make me preposterously resolving rather to be a
sordid Slave to my own Lusts and Corruptions, a miserable Vassal to the Prince
of Darkness, an Heir of everlasting Misery, and an Eternal Companion for the
Damned, than admit to be made free indeed, a Son of the Eternal, an Heir of the
Heavenly Glory, and an everlasting Associate with an innumerable Company of
Angels and Glorified Saints, that Blessed Assembly and Church of the First Born
which are written in Heaven, basely and bitterly opposing thy Blessed Kingdom,
endeavoring to hinder the promoting thy Interest, the Purity, Spirituallity,
and Holy Preciseness whereof I abhorred and detested, as quite contrary to my
Vile, Base, Carnal Heart, and those Sensual Pleasures and Worldy Contentments
into which I had most desperately cast my self, cruelly Persecuting all thy
Ambassadors, and trampled under Foot the Blood of the Covenant, which should
have Sanctified and Saved me: Notwithstanding all which, such is thy
astonishing Grace and Goodness, so unparalled thy Love, that thou still
declarest thy self willing to become my Savior and Redeemer, appease the
Anger, and satisfy the Fury of the Eternal against me, and reconcile me to
him, if I would but give my consent thereunto; wherefore I call Heaven and
Earth to record, and conjure all the Creatures therein to Witness this Day,
that I do here with all the Powers of my Heart give my full and free consent to
the same, accepting of thee as the only New and Living way, whereby I can
possibly obtain access to the Father; and upon the bended knees of my Soul, I
do here freely and willingly give up, and join my self to thee in a Marriage
Covenant, the Obligation whereof shall be perpetually unalterable.

Wherefore, O thou Anointed of the Father; I now come to thee a Hungry,
Distressed, Thirsty Soul; a Poor, Wretched, Miserable, Blind, and Naked
Creature, a most Filty, Loathsome, and Poluted Wretch, a Guilty, and Condemned
Traitor, unfit for the meanest Office in thine House, and unworthy to wash the
Feet of the very lowest of thy Servants, and therefore Infinitely more unworthy
and unfit to be Solemnly Contracted, and Married to the Majesty of Heaven and
Earth: But yet since such is thy unparalled Love, and unmerited Goodness,
that thou will have it so, I do here with all possible Veneration, and with the
firm and settled Resolution of my Heart, accept thee to the utmost of my Power,
freely consenting to, and acquiescing in the admirable Contrivance of Divine
Wisdom to save me by thy Righteousness and Merit, and take thee for my Head and
Husband, my Hope and my Happiness, my Portion and my Shield; and I do declare
my self freely content to take thee for better for worse, for Richer and for
Poorer; for all times and Conditions whatsoever, promising both in Prosperity
and Adversity to Love, Honor, and Obey thee before all others, and that to the
very Death: I accept of, and Embrace thee in all thine Offices; I disown my own
Merit, and freely declare my self empty of all manner of worthiness, and do
here avow thee to be the Lord my Righteousness: I do renounce my own Wisdom,
and do here take thee for my only Guide: I renounce my own Will, and do here
take thy Will for my Law, and the only Rule of my Faith and Life.

And since I am perfectly satisfied, that suffering is the way to Reigning, the
Cross the way to the Crown, and that I must through manifold Tribulations
inherit the Kingdom; I do here oblige my self by this Covenant to take my Lot
as it falls, and resolve by the Assistance of Divine Grace to run all manner of
hazzards with thee, verily supposing and assuring my self, that neither Life
nor Death, nor any Afliction or trouble whatsoever, shall ever be able to part
between thee and me.

And because thou have graciously given me thy Holy Laws and the Commands of
thy Gospel as the Peaceful Way and Pleasant and Delightful Path, in and through
which, I must by thy Assistance walk to thy kingdom; I do here willingly submit
my Neck to thy Yoke, and acknowledging all thy Laws to be Holy, Just, and Good;
I do Solemnly take them as a considerable part of my Happiness, and the Rule of
my Thoughts, my Words, and my Actions; promising, that although thou know,
and I find by dreadful experience, that my Flesh will Contradict and Rebel, yet
I will endeavor to order my whole life according to thy direction therein, and
will not knowingly allow my self in the neglect of any thing which is my Duty.

Only in regard, that through the frailty of my Flesh I am subject to many
failings; I humbly presume to protest before thee, that unallowed miscarriages,
contrary to the settled bent and inclination of my Heart, shall not annul this
Covenant, which I am the more bold to assert, because thou thy self have
promised and assured me that it shall be so.

And now my sweet Redeemer, thou who penetratest into the Heart, and have all
things open and naked before thee, know that I make this Solemn Contract of
accepting and embracing of thee, and dedicating and giving up my self to thee
freely without hesitation, fully without reservation, and sincerely without
Hypocrisy, to the best of my knowledge; humbly imploring, that if thou espiest
any kind of flaw or falsehood herein, thou would discover it to me, and help
me to do it with more uprightness and sincerity?

And now, Glory, and Honor; Adoration, and Praise be ascribed by my Soul, to
the great Creator and Conserver of all things, whom I shall be bold from this
Day forward to look upon as my God and Father, and shall account it my
Happiness as well as my Duty, that I may sweeten my Pilgrimage through the
Wilderness of this World, by Contemplating the admirable Effects of thy
Infinite Wisdom and Love, in finding out such a way for the recovery of undone
Sinners: And Glory be to thee, O thou Compassionate and Indulgent Mediator, who
have loved me, and washed me from my sins in thine own Blood, and art now
become my Savior and Redeemer: And Glory, Adoration, and Praise be given
likewise unto thee, O thou Eternal Spirit, who have by thy Powerful and
Gracious Operations applied to me the Precious Merits of my Sweet Redeemer, and
by the Finger of thine Almighty Power Effectually Changed and Converted my Soul
from the World to God, from self to Christ, and from a Course of Sin to the
Practice of Holiness.

And now, O thou Infinite, Eternal, and Alsufficient Jehovah, the Lord God
Omnipotent, Father, Son, and Spirit, who art a Fountain of Mercy and Pardon,
and an Ocean of Goodness and Love: Thou art now become my Covenant Friend, and
have through thy wonderful Grace and Goodness permitted me to become thy
Covenant Servant, Amen, Amen: And let the Contract which I have this day made
on Earth, be Ratified by thee in Heaven.

As soon as he had thus expressed himself, I saw him pluck a Paper out of his
Bosom, wherein I supposed the substance of what he had said was written, and
having opened it, he spread it before the Son of the Blessed, Subscribed his
Name to it, and then presented it as his Act and Deed to him, who received it
with such a readiness and Complacency, that plainly declared the greatness of
that delight he took therein; and stretching forth his Hand, he lifted him up
from the Earth, and embraced him with the greatest love and tenderness
imaginable, spoke Comfortably unto him, kissed him, and promised to love him with
an everlasting love, which is better than life it self, assuring him likewise
that he would present him before his Father without spot and blameless in love;
and that he would send him a perpetual supply of all things necessary for his
Pilgrimage, at the end whereof he would receive him into the Eternal Mansions
of Bliss, and place a Crown of Glory upon his Head: And as for your Old
Companions, said he, who would not that I should Reign over you, I will now
slay them before me: Now therefore Gird up the Loins of thy Mind, watch and be
sober, and hope to the end; run without weariness, and walk without fainting;
be thou faithful to the death, and then I will give thee a Crown of life; I
will likewise write your Name in the Book of Life; and therefore tell me, said
he, what is your Name. Ah Lord, said the Man, my Name is so bad, wretched, and
scandalous, that I am ashamed to tell it. I would, said he, have you be ashamed
of it, and never own it more; but yet you must tell it me, for I intend to
change it, and give you a New Name, a precious and an honorable Name, for I
will give you in my House, and within my Walls a Place, and a Name far better
than that of Sons and Daughters; I will give you an everlasting Name which
shall not be cut off. Lord, said the Man, thou know that I have always
hitherto been known by the Name of Reprobate. Its true, said he, but thou shall
be called so no more, but Believer shall be now thy Name, by which Name I will
enter thee in the Book of Life: And I will give thee a White Stone with this
New Name enclosed in it, which shall not be so legible and easy to be read by
any other Person as thy self, who receivest it; and that thou may have Life,
and have it more abundantly, thou shall receive of my fullness, and have Grace
for Grace: I will give thee to Eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midst of
the Paradise of God, whereby thou shall be put out of all possibility of being
hurt by the Second Death: I will feed thee with the Food of Angels, and give
thee hidden Manna to eat; I will shut the Door of Hell against thee, so that no
Man shall be able to open it, and open the Gate of Heaven to thee, so that no
man shall be able to shut it against thee; and when thou art cast out of the
Synagogue, by those who call themselves Believers, and are not, and art by them
Excommunicated and delivered over to the Prince of Darkness, with an express
Command to him to take thee, and when he will not (or rather cannot, for
because I give unto you Eternal Life, you shall never Perish, nor shall Men or
Devils, Earth or Hell pluck you out of my Hands; my Father which gave you to me
is greater than all, and no Man is able to pluck you out of my Fathers Hand: I
and my Father are one; and as such we engage our selves for thy Defense) then
it may be the Gaol shall; but if so, yet be not dismayed, for I engage to make
that and all things else to Work together for thy good; and assure thy self,
that although those things may not at present be pleasant but grievous, yet
they shall afterward appear to have in the Bowels of them the peaceable Fruits
of Righteousness; and if thou will take care to keep the Word of my Patience, I
also will engage to keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon
all the World, to try them that dwell upon the Earth, and when thou have
overcome, I will make thee a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and thou shall go
no more out, and I will write upon thee the Name of my God, and the Name of the
City of my God, which is, the New Jerusalem that comes down out of Heaven from
my God, and I will write upon thee my New Name; and I will Grant that thou
shall sit down with me on my Throne, even as I also overcame and am set down
with my Father on his Throne; in the mean time I will be your Mediator to my
Father, and when the Accuser of the Brethren shall bring any Accusation against
you into the Court of Heaven, I will be your Advocate, I will appear for you,
and plead my Merits in Bar of any punishment he shall Imprecate against you for
the same. I am and will be your High Priest, and as I have already offered up
my self to the Father as an Acceptable and a Propitiatory Sacrifice for you,
whereby I became at once your Sacrifice and your Altar whereon your Sacrifice
was Offered, so I will now perform the other part of my High Priesthood, and I
will Interceed for you to my Father, and my Intercession will be prevalent
enough, and sufficient for thee, and I will thereby procure thee whatsoever thy
Heart desires, for the Father can deny me nothing: In fine, my Merit and my
Fullness, and all that I am and have, shall be thine; and whatsoever I am to my
self, that I will be to thee. Now therefore be of good Courage, go on thy
Pilgrimage with an Holy Resolution to be Faithful, and cleave to the Lord with
full purpose of Heart all the Days of thy Life; thou will meet indeed with
abundance of Enemies, and innumerable Discouragements; but fear thou none of
these things, for God shall be thy Leader, and the strong God thy Captain; he
shall teach thy Hand to fight, and thy Fingers to War; nay he shall fight all
thy Battles for thee, give thee Victory over all thine Enemies, and make thee
more than a Conqueror overthe Powers of Darkness, and all the rest of thy
Adversaries, both within and without thee. Wisdom it self shall be thy Guide,
Almighty Strength thy Support, and Infinite Goodness thy Reward at the period
of thy Pilgrimage, when thou shall receive from me the end of thy Faith, the
Salvation of thy Soul.

And then taking him by the Hand, he led him to his Storehouse, the Sacred
Armory, where he has always in readiness all kinds of Armor and Arms,
admirably Designed and fitted for the Spiritual Warfare; and from thence he
furnished him with a Sword, a Shield, a Helmet a Brestplate, and Sandals,
together with a well contrived Engine of such mighty force and efficacy, that
with it he afterward did wonders, and so did some of those who had formerly
made use of it, for they did by it shut and open Heaven, Battered down the
Walls of Cities, Conquered their Conquerours, and put their insulting and
Victorious Enemies to flight; for of such force and prevalency it is, that in
less than a Minute, it is able to bring into our assistance so many Auxilliary
Forces, as may be able to defend us against, and enable us to Conquer more than
10000 times 10000 Enemies; which occasioned a certain Queen, who was a
Sovereign Princess, to say, that she was more afraid of the Prayers of a
certain Pilgrim, who was her Subject, than of many Regiments of Armed Men; and
yet this Engine, as mighty as it is, is no bigger than a Man may carry always
about him, which is somewhat signified by its Names, which as I was told, are
two, Pray always, and with all manner of Prayer: I was told likewise, that
those who have it not are liable to all manner of danger and misery, and have
not any manner of defense against it; nay it has a Voice too, and imprecates
Ruin and Misery upon all those that have it not, for I my self heard it often
call out to Heaven, saying, Lord pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know
thee not, and the Families who call not on thy Name. But seeing that all those
Pieces of Armor were designed for Front Pieces, and that he received none for
the defense of his Back-parts, he humbly inquired the reason thereof, and was
told, that it was because the Nature of the War wherein you are to engage, is
such, that you must stand fast, fight manfully, and resist to the very death
and spilling your Blood, rather than yield or flee; and therefore bear it
always in your Thoughts, and let it be written in your Memory, that if ever you
turn your Back, you thereby lay your self open to be Mortally wounded by your
Infernal Adversary, having no Armor given you to defend those parts. Then said
he, Lord, is there no Case wherein I may turn my Back and flee? Yes, replied he
that is fairer than the Children of Men, in some extraordinary Cases it will be
both your duty and your safety too, to flee; as when the Sin you are tempted to
commit has such a likeness to, interest in, and Correspondency with your
Flesh, and the very Complexion of your Nature, that the very standing to
contend with it may prove your overthrow, and the very yielding to fight only,
lay a sure foundation for its obtaining the Victory; the Weapon wherewith thou
intendest to wound it, may stab thy self, and those very thoughts and
considerations wherewith thou intendest to choke and strangle it, prove
Cordials to revive and strengthen it, adding more Fuel to the Fire, and
proving like Oil to increase those Flames which burn with too much vehemence
and violence already. I say, in those cases you must flee, and you have a
Paragraph in the Sacred Statute-Book to Warrant your so doing, viz. flee also
youthful lust.

Being thus Harnessed, the Son of the Blessed, Blessed him, and sent him away;
and I saw him go forward in his Pilgrimage with abundance of Cheerfulness and
Agility; and as he walked in the Narrow Way, he thus discoursed to himsef; Oh,
how Beautiful and Comely is my Beloved? His Aspect was sweet, and his
Countenance was pleasant, he was arraied with Flames of Love, and filled with
Bowels of Compassion; in his Right Hand he had plentious Redemption, and in his
Left Hand multiplied Pardons: methinks I could see his Sacred Breast swelled
with Mercy and Love, and by their pantings, discovering themselves uneasy and
even in Pain until they were eased by the sucking of my Hungry and my Thirsty
Soul; wherefore wonder, O my Soul, and all the Powers within me, be ye amazed
and astonished at the greatness of the thing, for the Tabernacle of the most
High is with me, and he will dwell with me; he will be mine, and I shall be
his; I shall be his Son, and he will be my Father; be astonished and even
ravished with wonder, O my Soul; for the Infinite Breach which Sin had made
between God and thee is now made up, the difference Composed, and the Offender
received to Mercy; so that God and thee are now reconciled, and have entered
into a Covenant of Peace, Heaven and Earth having agreed upon the terms, struck
their Hands, and Sealed the Indenture: O happy Conclusion! O Blessed
Conjunction! If the Stars should condescend to dwell with the Dust, if Fire and
Water could be reconciled, or the North and South Poles be brought to meet and
mutually embrace each other, this were much; but yet this Agreement and
Conjunction wherewith thou art now Blessed is much more wonderful and strange,
for the terms of Distance were infinitely greater: Rejoice therefore, O ye
Angels, and shout ye Seraphims; and let all the glorious Inhabitants of the
Celestial Mansions prepare an Epithalamium, and stand ready with the Marriage
Song, for lo here is a wonder of wonders, the great Jehovah has given himself
to a Worm, and the King of Kings has Contracted a Marriage with his hopeless,
helpless Captive, Publicly acknowledging and owning it before the whole World,
freely declaring that he is become one with me, and I with him, and that he
has given me the Fullness of Heaven for my Jointure, and the Fatness of the
Earth for my Substance, having kept back nothing from me.

And now, O Lord, thou art that God, and that I AM, and thy Words they are
truth it self; wherefore having made all these Promises to thy Servant, so that
thou have prevented my very wishes, nonplust my desires, and left me nothing to
ask at thy Hands but what thou have already freely granted and bequeathed to
me, and all that thou have left me to do, being to accept and embrace thy
kindness, adventure my self upon thy Fidelity, and trust my whole happiness
both here and hereafter upon these thy Promises, I only request that the Word
which thou have spoken concerning thy Servant thou would establish for ever,
and do as thou have said, that so thy Name may be magnified for ever, and the
freeness of thy Love in the choice of thy Servant be the Matter of my Praise
and Adoration through the Days of Eternity.

And now adieu vain World, and all the empty and imaginary Pleasures of Sin, I
bid you all an Eternal farewell; nay, I will now tread you under Foot, and
trample upon you as the basest Dross and Dung; the vain Threats of an Insulting
World shall no longer terrify me, nor shall thy salse and deceitful Promises
any more delude or flatter me to fall in Love with a Strumpet, or Adore a
Painted Image, to forsake the everlasting Spring, the overflowing Fountain, and
the inexhaustible Ocean, to drink of thy impure puddles, or attempt to satiate
my Thirst at thy broken and empty Cisterns: And although the Prince of Darkness
dress the Harlot in all her Pomp and Bravery, and by Painting and Patching her
deformed Face, make her appear to be a Beautiful and Lovely Object, in hope
thereby to allure me to fall in love with her, and return to her embraces
again; yet his pains therein shall all be lost, and prove labor in vain, for I
bid thee defience, O thou incorrigible and implacable Enemy of my Souls
Salvation, resolving in the Divine Strength, that all thy Subtle Wiles, nor thy
Tempting Baits shall ever be able to prevail with me for the changing my
present choice, unless thou art able (as I am sure thou art not) to show me
such a Crown, and such a Kingdom as the Almighty has settled upon me, or at
least give me something which may balance the loss of an Infinite and an
Alsufficient God, who has now given himself to me; but I know you cannot do
that neither, and therefore take notice, that I do from this Day forward, and
for ever Banish you, and all those filthy and deceitful Lusts and Pleasures
which are thy accursed Companions and Attendants, out of my Heart; get you
gone, get you hence, I will have no more to do with you, I have enough in God,
in Christ, and the Promises, to fill and satisfy my Soul; these have I lodged
within my Heart, and there is now no more Room for such Guests as you are, nor
shall you ever again be permitted a peaceable entrance within these Doors.

And thus I saw him go on rejoicing in the Lord, and triumphing in the
happiness of his present Condition, continually looking forwards and reaching
forth his Hand toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus, fixing his Eye always upon the place whither he was going, in the
midst whereof he saw the Son of the Blessed, the Eternal Darling and Glory of
his Father, advanced far above Angels and all Created Powers, and seated upon a
Bright and Glorious Throne, admirably framed of Majesty and Mercy, Justice and
Love; and strongly supported by Almighty Strength and Unchangeable Goodness,
having on his Sacred Head a Royal and Imperial Crown, the Riches, Splendour, and
Glory whereof so far excceds all expression, that I am no way able to relate
it; nay the Tongues of Angels would fail, and the Pen of the most Dexterous and
Florid Scribe be nonplust, should they attempt the Description thereof; and his
Victorious Temples justly encircled and richly bedecked with Wreathes of
Victory and Triumph; Angels, and Thrones, and Dominons being Subjected to him,
who is the everlasting Heir of all things; and Clothed from Head to Foot with
Garments of unapproachable Light; which made him break forth into an Ecstasy of
Admiration and Joy. And I after heard him, with his Hands and his Eyes lifted
up to Heaven, utter these and the like expressions; O my Soul, with how much
Shining Glory and Luster do thou behold thy Beloved Arrayed? O how admirable
is the Beauty of his Face? How Ravishing are the smiles of his Countenance, and
how attractive the Glances of his Eyes? How delightful are the Expressions of
his Love to thee, and the Kisses of his Rosey Lips affords thee a sweetness
that far excedeth even life it self. And at other times, when he lay down to
Rest and Repose his weary Limbs, tired with the difficulties and hardships of
his Journey, he would break out suddenly into Heavenly and Ravishing
descriptions of the Celestial Paradise.

With what raised Affections and inflamed Love, would he say, do I review thee,
O thou City of God, thou Paradise of Delight, and Region of Peace and
Tranquillity. Joy and Happiness, Glory and Honor, Beautify thy Palaces. O, with
what breathings and longings of Soul after thee, do I now think of thee, and of
those Glorious Inhabitants who dwell within thy Saphir Walls, and whose Holy
Feet trace thy Jasper Streets! O how Glorious art thou, O Jerusalem! So
splendid is thy Brightness, an so redundant thy Glory, that Kings shall come
and lay down their Crowns before thee, and account all their Pomp and Glory as
Dust in Comparison of thee.

And still as he walked he would keep his Eyes so fixed upon the recompense of
Reward, that the Prince of Darkness with all his Wiles could not prevail with
him to cease viewing of it, nor persuade him to turn out of the Way toward it:
whereat being exceedingly enraged, he alarmed the whole World with the News
thereof, telling them that they were like to lose a Companion, and stirring
them up against him to Revenge his abandoning their Company, and either bring
him back by fraud or force, or else make his Pilgrimage as bitter and
unpleasant to him as possible. They presently followed his Counsel, and Earth
and Hell uniting together, listed themselves under his Banner, and marching
against the poor Pilgrim, they Attaqued him all at once, but all in vain, for
he made such resistance, and defended himself so well with his Helmet and
Shield, that they were not able to stand before him, but fled toward the place
from whence they came, and he went forward in his Pilgrimage, and as he went,
he Sang, All Glory, Honor, Laud, and Praise,
Unto the Lord I Will yield;
For giving me against these Foes
The Honor of the Field.
But whilst he was thus rejoicing upon the account of his Victory, they
rallied again, and returning upon him ere he was aware, they Charged him with
so much Resolution and Fury, that they wounded him in diverse places, beat his
Sword out of his Hand, and so disabled the Arm which managed the Shield, that
it became in a manner useless to him, insomuch that his Spirit began to flag,
his Heart fainted, and his hopes were just giving up the Ghost, and himself
falling a Victim to their Rage and Malice; when suddenly calling to Mind the
great things which the Son of the Blessed had-told him might be effected by the
Engine he delivered him, he presently roused up himself, as one inspired with
New life, and began to play it upon them, and as soon as he began to play, I
heard a Voice saying to him, Pluck up thy Spirits Man and be of good Courage,
for more are they who are with thee, than those which are against thee, my
Grace shall be sufficiont for thee, and my strength shall be made perfect in
thy weakness: Whereupon I lifted up mine Eyes, and lo I saw an innumerable
Company of Horses and Chariots of Fire round about him, and a whole Army on
their March from the Eternal to his rescue; by whose Help and Assistance the
Prince of Darkness and all his Irreligious Rout were put to flight, not one of
them being able to stand before him; which gave him new occasion of Rejoicing
and Singing Praise to him by whose Assistance he was now a Conqueror.

O Lord, said he, thy Strength and Grace
I ever will admire,
For by thy sending me relief
Thou'st taught me to aspire
To love thee more, and strive to have
Thine Image so impressed
Upon my Soul, that thou may dwell
For ever in my Breast,
Until at last thou shall Conduct
My Soul to Zion Hill,
Where I for ever shall be free
From all the Craft and Skill
Of Earth and Hell, and all their Strength
And Rage, wherewith they fain
Would work my fall from God and Christ
Into Eternal pain.
Then there for ever I shall sit
In safety from all those
Who envy now my happiness,
And do the same oppose;
Yea, then my self I will employ
In nothing but to praise,
Exalt and laud the Name of him
Who does me help always.
Methoughts after this Victory he went forward with more speed and swiftness
than before, and Traveled so fast, that in a few hours he was got many Miles
from the Bottomless Pit toward his Journeys End. Now this way wherein he
walked lay exactly between two Walls, which the Eternal had placed on each side
of it; the Name of that Wall on the Right Hand, was called by the Name of
General Calling; and the other was named Particular Calling, to teach Pilgrims,
that neither of them must be neglected by them, and yet intimate to them, that
they ought always to give General Calling the chief Place, and the upper Hand,
although they must not suffer it wholly to justle out the other. In his Travels
I saw two Pilgrims overtake him, they both set out after him, but having gotten
into the Way, not through the Strait Gate, but through a certain Gap which was
in the Righ-hand Wall near adjoining to the Gate, and by that means met with
less sensible trouble and opposition from the Prince of Darkness: When they
came up with Believer, they saluted him, telling him they were glad to find any
Travelers in that Despised Road, and hoped that since they were so happy to
meet in so pleasant a Path, they might keep Company together, and be helpful to
each other in their Pilgrimage. Believer, you may well imagine, was as glad as
they to find others traveling toward Paradise, and was as well pleased
likewise to have Company thither, since Experience tells Men, that it is not
good for them to be alone; wherefore being exceedingly pleased with their
Motion, especially to hear them talk so sensibly of their Pilgrimage, he
answered them, he wished it might, and hoped it would be as they desired, for
said he, if any of us after we have entered this Path, and traveled so many
Miles herein, should look back and return again to the Broad Way, we shall
thereby not only make our selves unfit for, and unworthy of the Celestial
Paradise, but likewise list our selves in the number of those whom the Son of
the Eternal has assured us shall have greater Damnation. We acknowledge it,
said one of them, and O that it may be none of our cases, and that we who have
Walked together, and Communicated together in the means of Grace and the Sacred
Ordinances of the Kingdom, may not after all this be Eternally separated, and
whilst some of us shall be received with Joy, and welcomed into the Promised
Land, others of us should be for ever excluded out of it, and thrust down into
a Sea of Wrath. Amen, Amen, said Believer: Then he inquired of them of what
Country they were: They Answered, they were born in the Wilderness which lies
below this Hill, and at the end of this Narrow Way wherein we are now
Traveling, it is called by some, the Howling Wilderness, by others the Land of
Rebbels, the Bewitching World, the False and Deceitful Paradise, etc. A
Country, said he, which I know very well, I was born in it my self: I dwelt in
it many years, and continued there until Divine Fury had overtaken me, torn me
to Pieces, and tumbled me down into the Bottomless Pit, had not Everlasting
Goodness warned me of my Danger, and put it into my Heart to go on Pilgrimage
as you see. And pray my Good Friends, said he, how came you to leave it? Why,
to tell you the truth, answered they, as we were Danceing about the Brink of
the Pit, we saw diverse of our Companions fall in, and moreover one Boanerges,
said they, was sent by the King of Kings, and was Commanded by him to denounce
War against us, assuring us, that unless we presently forsook our Evil Courses
and Repented, we should all likewise Perish: Whereupon we presently fled for
our Lives into this Way, and do resolve to go on Pilgrmage to Celestial
Paradise. Pray, said he, which Way did you come into this Way? I hope you will
not be offended at my inquisitiveness, for I do assure you, it is in Love and
Tendernerss to your precious and immortal Souls that I make this Inquiry; for
if there be an Error in our Entrance into the Way, it is very improbable we
should ever persevere therein, since there is nothing more common, than for
those who begin in Hypocrisy to end in Apostasy; but admit that by reason of
the prevalency of our fears of Tophet, and to pacify a Bawling, Chiding
Conscience, we do make a shift to keep drudging on to the End of our Lives,
yet, if then we are not found to have entered through the strait Gate into this
Narrow Way, we shall for that Error in the beginning of our Pilgrimage be
denied entrance into the Celestial Paradise; and that which is yet much more
dreadful (and therefore should induce us to look back and inquire if our
beginning be right, and such as will bear us out at the Tribunal of him whose
Eyes are infinitely brighter than the Sun, and therefore able to penetrate
into, and look through all our Disguises and Specious pretenses, so that there
will be no deceiving of him) if there be an Error there, and by that means we
run our Race and do our Work amiss, we shall never be permitted to return again
to mend it; for as the Tree falls so it must lie for ever, without any
possibility of removing or exchanging its place. All this we know to be true,
replied they, and have learned from one of the Disciples of our Lord, that we
ought to render a reason of our Faith to every Man who shall make an inquiry
into the same, and therefore I am, (and I hope my Brother too) so far from being
angry, that I return you Thanks, and am ready to give you a satisfactory
account as far as I can. You must know therefore, that being sore frightened by
Boanerges, we presently repaired this way, easily ascended the little Hillock
we found a little below the Narrow Way, about the middle of which we met with a
very strait Passage, through which with some small difficulty we passed into
this Road. Having given him an account of their Country, and the Reason why
they left it, and the Way whereby they came out of it, he was indifferently
well satisfied, that they were sincere and resolved Pilgrims. Only, said he to
himself, the Eternal granted them an easier passage than I found. But
notwithstanding their seeming willingness to render an account how they got
into the Way to Paradise, yet they were really unwilling, were glad when the
Scrutiny was over, and all the time they walked together, they found one means
or other to shuffle off all further Discourse upon that point, for it appeared
a little then, but more afterward, that although they fancied the place in the
Wall through which they came into that Path was the Strait Gate which leads
into the way of Life, yet they had many doubtings and misgivings of Heart, that
it was not; but however being unwilling to be at the pains of going so far
back, and very desirous to appear at least to other Pilgrims to be real
Converts, and to have entered in a Regular Way and Manner into their Pilgrimage,
they thought it the best way to prevent as much as possible its being too much
inquired into. As they went along the Road he asked them what were their Names.
My Name, replied one of them, is, Desire to be Good, and mine, said the other,
is, Would be Happy. Very well, said he, I wish you may both answer your Names
and somewhat more. And thus I saw them go forward talking together until they
came to a place where there was a Passage through each Wall, the one exactly
opposite to the other, and each of them lead into a path that lay just without
the Walls, and ran close by them as far as they could see, and both of them
replenished with many though different Pleasures, and yet not so much different
in them ^ives, as they vary in the Tempets and Apprehensions of those who walk
therein. Now when they had looked into those Bypath, the two Pilgrims
declared their Opinions to be, that they were made by the Kings Order, as
Foot-Paths for the ease of Pilgrims, and to make their Pilgrimage the more
pleasant and delightful, and therefore were for walking in them, lest, said
they, we be found to put a slight upon the Favors the Divine Goodness has
hereby offered to us. No, said Believer, I dare not, nor would I have you to go
into them, for they seem to me to be Bypath, and I am very suspicious that
all Bypath lead out of the Way of Life. Its true, said they, they do so, but
these can be no Bypath, for you see that they run all along by the Walls
side, so that if we find occasion, we may turn out of them into this Path again
at our Pleasure. I will not, said he, and, O do not you venture that; for
however they seem to run so as far as you can see, yet who knows how they run
farther off, or whither they will lead you in the End; as for the Way wherein
we now are, I am sure that is the right Way, and that Eternal Glory is at the
End of it, because the King himself set me into it, charging me withal, that I
should not dare, as I loved my Soul, esteemed his Favor, or vallued
Everlasting Happiness, to turn out of it either to the Right Hand or to the
Left, so that if you will not be persuaded to go along with me and be happy, I
must not, nor I will not be Wheedled and Wiredrawn to go along with you to be
Miserable: Pray remember what you were saying when you first overtook me, viz.
How dreadful it will be if any of us who have Conferred, and Prayed, and Walked
together, should after all this Miscarry, and be Eternally Separated and Doomed
to Everlasting Misery; if it fall out so with either of you, you will be forced
to remember when it is too late, that you were forewarned thereof by me. Having
thus told them their Danger, and finding them notwithstanding Obstinate and
Headstrong in their way, he left them to their own Devices, and went forward
on his Journey. Now I saw that when he was gone, the two Pilgrims could not
agree which of the Paths they should take, wherefore Desire to be Good took the
Right Hand Path, and Would be Happy turned into the other on the Left Hand,
which Believer, (who looked back to see which of the Ways they would take)
beholding, he said thus to himself; Lord, what a strange Creature is Mankind?
How willing is he to be Miserable? How unwilling to be Happy? How easily
Wheedled into the Path of Danger; and how hardly persuaded to enter into, or
when entered to continue in the Way of Life? And now, O Lord, what is thy
Servant, that thou should be so loving and indulgent to me, and bring me
into the Way of Life, when thou have left so many others to Perish in the Paths
of Death? and be so unwearied in thy care to preserve and keep me therein, when
thou permittest so many others to be Wheedled by the Prince of Darkness, and a
deceitful, yielding Heart, foolishly to turn out of it into the Ways of Sin and
Death again? Lord, let the consideration hereof inflame my Heart with more love
to thee, teach me to be more Faithful and Obedient, and lead my Soul to a
nearer and a more universal Compliance with the Divine Will.

Now methoughts seeing the three Pilgrims thus parted, I became strangely
concerned thereat, and it created in me an extraordinary desire to know what
became of them all, and whither the two Bypath led; to which end I would get
upon the Walls, sometimes on one Wall, and sometimes on the other, and look
after them, yet so as not to lose the sight of my Pilgrim, who continued still
in the Narrow Way. And I saw that the Way on the Left Hand which Would be Happy
took, was a Road of so much Business, that the Employ and Management thereof
engrossed so much of his Time, and kept him in such a perpetual hurry, that he
not only lost his Way to the Celestial Paradise, but he quite forgot also, that
there was any such place, or at leastwise that ever he had been Traveling
toward it, or had any kind of Business there; and at length it brought him into
the Broad Way again, where he returned without any Reluctance or Notice, being
not at all concerned thereat: Well, thought I, I may now say of thee, Farewell
for ever, for there is now an end of thy Pilgrimage, unless the Eternal, who is
the Father of Mercies, should by a Miracle of Mercy revive thy Convictions
again. And as for Desire to be Good, I saw, that not long after his entrance
into the Path, he overtook one whose Name was Intend well, who was got over
into the Path not long before him, fancying as the other, that now they had
nothing to do, but to mind and follow their General Vocation, vainly Imagining
that the Eternals commanding them to forsake the World, not suffering
themselves to be Carnal, but Spiritually minded, have their Conversation in
Heaven, and that they should set their Affections not on the things which are
seen, but on the things which are not seen, because the things which are seen
are Temporal, but the things which are not seen are Eternal; I say, they
thought that those Commands warranted their so doing: but, as I afterward
learned, they were grossly mistaken therein, and that this mistake was almost as
mischievous and as fatal as the other into which Would be Happy fell: Now I saw
them walk together a long time in that Way, every Day frequenting of Sermons,
and Lectures, and Christian Conferrences, or else keeping of Days of Fasting
and Humiliation, in all which they seemed to take a great deal of Delight and
Pleasure, and manifested abundance of Heat, Warmth, and Zeal. Well, thought I,
I hope better things of these two Pilgrims than I did of the other that took
the Left Hand Way; but at length I perceived them to be perfectly glutted and
clogged with their Enjoyments, and by the Constancy of their Attendance
thereon, their fervor began to flag, and by degrees they grew exceedingly
weary and tired thereof; and afterward I understood that was the Design of the
subtle Serpent, in persuading and drawing them into that Path, that so by being
Righteous over much, they might be surfeited with the Duties and Ordinances of
Religion, and turn from them with loathing, and thereupon return again to his
Service, or at least put them to the trouble of going back again as far as the
Strait Gate, in order to their getting into the Way of Life again, and so it
fell out in those two Pilgrims, for I saw Intend well at length fall into a
certain Path which led back again into the Broad Way, and I never heard that
there was ever any farther Enquiry made by him after the Celestial Paradise.
And Desire to be Good beginning now to be sensible of the Error he had been
Guilty of, in turning out of the Way wherein the King had appointed him to go
on Pilgrimage to the Celestial Paradise, and being thereupon overwhelmed with
sorrow, he returned with Grief and Shame to the Strait Gate, whereat Believer
had entered, which he was not able to pass without much difficulty and
Striving, nor was he favored with those Sweet Soul-Affecting and
Heart-Ravishing Intimations and Assurances of the Redeemers Love, wherewith
Believer was blessed; nor did the Son of Righteousness arise upon him with so
much Brightness and Splendour as upon the other; but instead thereof, he was
forced through a long tract of time to Walk alone in a mournful and
disconsolate manner, bitterly exclaiming against his former folly, and ever and
anon lamenting the absence, and declaring how vehemently he longed for the
presence of the Beloved of his Soul, who did at last graciously Condescend to
Visit him with his Salvation, and refresh his Spirits with his loving kindness
and his tender Compassions, which have been ever of Old.

And now I think it is time to return to our Pilgrim again, who by this time
was got a great way on his Journey, and had joined him in Company with a great
many Pilgrims, who were going likewise the same way, and intending for the same
place with himself, having all of them their Faces set Sion-ward. And lo I
beheld an Ambassador come from the King of Kings, and inviting them in his Name
to a Royal and Plentiful Feast, where they all sat down at a well spread
Table, Richly furnished with all manner of Varieties, and plentifully stored
with all the Delicacies of the Gospel, all which were served up in several
Dishes, and the first which I saw set on the Table was a Representation of a
Broken, a Bleeding, and a Dying Jesus, whose Face although it were fairer than
the Children of Men, was defiled with Spittle, bruised with Blows and
Buffetings, and covered over with a Purple Gore; whose Head which was white as
Snow, and like the purest Wool, was Crowned with Thorns, the points whereof
wear beaten down into his Head with Reeds, and thereby both Head and Hair Died
in a Sanguine Red, whose Eyes which used to be Infinitely brighter than the
Flames of Fire, and sparkle more than the Richest Diamonds, now swam in Tears,
were dim with Blood, and darkened at the approach of Cruel Death; whose Mouth
and Lips, although they were wont to speak as never Man spoke, were now grown
Pale and Wan with strokes, grim with Death, and imbittered by the Gall and
Vinegar which he Drank; whose Arms wherewith he used to Fathom the World, and
Embrace all the Powers of the Universe, were now distrained and stretched on
the Cross; and his Shoulders, by the strength whereof he upheld the tottering
Creation, was beaten and lashed with Knotty Cords and Whips, and when so
Bruised and Wounded thereby, that it would have drawn Tears from the Dryest
Eyes, and have moved the Hardest and most Obdurate Heart to Pity and
Commiseration to behold it, he was enforced notwithstanding to bear a Heavy
Cross, whereon himself was to be Crucified; whose Hands, whereby the Worlds
were made, and with which he formed the curious Frames and Fabrics of Heaven
and Earth; and his Feet, which used to move so swiftly to bring Pardon and
Relief to the Condemned and the Miserable, were now Bored and Pierced through,
and by Inhumane and Salvage Traitors Cruelly Nailed and Tenter'd on the Cross;
whose Heart, which was never polluted nor defiled, and was the very Spring and
Fountain of Mercy and Love, was now pierced and wounded with a Spear; and those
Bowels, which Yearned with Pity, and Rouled with Compassion toward others,
when in Distress and Misery, were now dried up for want of Moisture, and Pained
and Tortured with straining pulls, and the extrremity of his Torments, and even
broken and rent a sunder by his dying pangs. So that from Head to Foot, there
was no part free; but methoughts he appeared covered all over with Blood; his
Face was sadly Mortified, and numerous streams of Blood flowed from the several
Wounds the Crown of Thorns had made in his Guiltless Head; his Eyes looked
Watery and Red, his Mouth Wan and Pale, his Arms were Distorted, and his Flesh
beat and torn from his Shoulders, his Hands and his Feet were Boared, his
Heart Strings broken, and his Bowels dried up and clung together; his Wounded
Side ran like a Fountain of Blood, the Sacred Streams whereof was endued with
such a Cleansing Virtue, that being sprinkled on the Pilgrims, they were
presently washed thereby from all their Pollutions, and adorned with a
wonderful Beauty and Comeliness; and withal, so Powerful and Persuasive, that
upon the very sight thereof, the Eternal forgave them their Iniquities: The
Wound in his Side, from whence this Fountain of Blood issued, was so large and
open, that as some of the Guests afterward told me, they could through it look
into his Breast, and see the pantings of his Heart, the whole whereof they
assured me, was Composed of Love. The next Course I saw served up, was a Dish
of Gospel Mysteries, every one whereof contained and had enclosed in it a
Sacred Wonder, the number whereof was so great, that my Memory was not able to
contain them, and having forgotten many of them my self, I cannot relate them
to you; but such of them whereof I took a more particular notice, and wherewith
I found my Heart more than ordinarily affected, were as follow: The First
Mystery I remember which offered it self to view, was God manifested in the
Flesh, which being opened by the Steward of the Feast, the Sacred Wonders
enclosed therein (for there was more than one contained in this Mystery)
plainly offered themselves to the view of the Beholders. And it contained,
first, as Wonder of Righteousness, Justice, and Severity, in that the Eternal
would not spare but punish Sin, although upon his own and only Son,
notwithstanding the Guilt thereof was not contracted by him, but only imputed
to him. The Second Wonder, was a Wonder of Wisdom, whereby the Eternal had made
Light to spring out of Darkness, Life out of Death, Gain out of Loss, Blessing
out of a Curse, and Victory out of an Overthrow, and brought about many other
glorious and incredible things by absolute Contrarieties; As the rising of the
World by the fall of its Upholder: The riches of his People by the poverty of
their Inricher; and the fullness and glory of the Saints, by the emptiness and
shame of the King of Saints. The Third Wonder, was a Wonder of Mercy, in that
the Eternal, notwithstanding he shut his Ears, and hardened his Heart against
the Cries and Entreaties of his own Son, when he submissively begged of him,
Father if it be thy Will let this Cup pass from me, should yet open his Ear to,
and receive the Cries of Sinners, who had Conspired and Rebelled against him.
The Fourth Wonder was a Wonder of Love: A Wonder of Love! Ah that was a Wonder
indeed, and there was more Wealth and Sweetness contained therein, and the
sight of it afforded more satisfaction and delight than the Bluntness of my Pen
will permit me to Describe. First, The wonderful Love of the Eternal, the
Everlasting Father of the Prince of Peace, in providing such an admirable way
for the Saving of Sinners, and the making them who were by Nature Children of
his Everlasting Wrath, Children of his Dearest Love by Grace, and the parting
with, and giving up his own Eternal Son, who had never offended him, to become
a Sacrifice and a Ransom for lost and undone Mankind, who were Strangers and
Enemies, and had ever Rebelled against him. Secondly, the Wonderful Love of the
Blessed Redeemer in consenting to give himself, his Blood, his Life, his Soul a
Ransom for his People, to Ransom them from Everlasting Misery, buy them out of
the Hand of Justice, purchase for them an Eternal weight of Glory, and an
Everlasting Inheritance with the Saints in Light; but that which added to, and
increased the Wonder beyond all expression, nay, beyond conception it self,
was, that all this should be done for Worms and rottenness, for Dust and Ashes,
for the most filthy and polluted, for the most worthless and despicable
Creatures, who were not capable of meriting, or any way deserving this
Redeeming Love before, or answering and Compensating of it after it was
be^^^^ed upon them. The Fifth Wonder, was a Wonder of Divine Patience,
Long-suffering, and Forbearance, in that the Eternal did not speedily Execute
Vengeance upon those Ungrateful Wretches who had slighted his Mercy, abused his
Love, and scornfully refused and trampled upon his Son, affronting him for the
kindness he offered them, and spitting in his Face for the Reward of his Love,
in tendering them Pardon and Forgiveness. Now although those Dishes which were
already placed on the Table were Admirable and Splendid, yet those which
followed far exceeded them in Sweetness, and afforded infinitely more delight
and satisfaction to those who fed thereon; and the First of them was, A
particular and Effectual Application of Electing, Redeeming, and Converting
Love to the Souls of the Redeemed, by the Hand of the Spirit in the preaching
of the Gospel; which Mystery likewise contained in it several Wonders; as, that
Divine Goodness should choose them and neglect others, making them to be the
Heirs of Life, whilst others were left to Inherit the Paths of Death, that he
should Embrace them in his Arms, and bestow upon them the Kisses of his Lips,
whilst others are not permitted so much as to behold his Face; but were by a
Sentence of Banishment for ever excluded from his presence; that he should
Indulge them in his Bosom, when others were Trampled under his Feet; that they
should be received and accepted by him, notwithstanding they had neglected and
stood out so long against him, and had refused and slighted so many offers and
tenders which had been made by him, etc. The next Course was of Multiplied
Pardons, and Plentious Redemption, ready prepared for, and freely bestowed upon
Relenting and Returning Sinners, and reiterated Pardons and Forgivenss for
those unwary Pilgrims, who had through oversight neglected to keep up their
Watch, and by reason of the prevalency of their remaining Corruption, fallen
into some undue Practices against the King, contrary to the settled bent and
inclinations of their Hearts, which were always Constant and Loyal to him. The
last Course which I saw served up, was Unchangeable Love, brought to the Table,
and Handed down and Conveyed to them in an unalterable and an Everlasting
Covenant, ordered in all things and sure. And for the better pleasing of the
Eye, as well as delighting and satisfying of the Heart of the Guests, the Dish
was covered over with Promises of an inestimable value, and garnished round
with such Assurances as these, I will not Violate my Covenant, I will not alter
my Love, nor suffer my Faithfulness to fail; my Covenant will I not break, nor
alter the thing which is gone out of my Mouth.

Besides these Dishes which I have told you of, there were many others which I
cannot so well remember, and every Dish which came to the Table, was Saused
with Eternity, and Garnished with Unchangeableness and Instability; neither was
there wanting Variety of Delectable Liquors for the satiateing of the Thirsty,
as well as the satisfying of the Hungry Soul, for there was plenty of Living
Water, Honeyed Milk, and Spiced Wine in abundance; and indeed the Glory as well
as the Plenty of the Feast was such, that I fear nothing more than that I shall
detract from and lessen it by my attempting to describe it, and therefore I
would have you Guess at it, not so much by my Description, as by the Wealth and
Riches, and the Bounty and Love of the King that made it, and the Quality of
the Persons whom he invited to it. Now you must know, the King who made this
Feast is the Lord of Life and Glory, the Eternal God, the Everlasting Jehovah,
the Mighty and the Uncontrolable Monarch of the Universe, who says of the Earth
it is mine, and all the fullness thereof; and is the owner and absolute disposer
of all that the Heaven of Heavens can produce; and whenever he makes a Feast,
he makes it like himself, that so he may thereby show forth and declare to them
who are his happy Guests, the Wealth, and Riches, and Glory, and Fullness, and
Love of him who has Invited them to, and Entertains them at his Table. And the
Persons who were the invited Guests to this Royal and Kingly Feast, were all or
most of them Princes and Princesses, the Sons and Daughters of the Majesty of
Heaven and Earth, and by the Glory of their Countenance and the Majesty of
their Port and Carriage, they each of them resembled the Children of a King.

Now the Table being thus Spread and Furnished, the Guests Seated, and the
Steward of the Feast having Implored a Blessing from Heaven upon the Rich
Varieties wherewith it was Stored, the King himself Arrayed in Royal Robes of
Love and Majesty, Girt about with Truth and Faithfulness; and having his Crown
on his Head, and bravely attended on by an innumerable Company of his Glorious,
Splendid, and Shining Courtiers, came in amongst them, and Saluting them all,
bid them welcome to his Table, and turning First to one, and then to another;
he invited them to Eat Heartily of the Bread which he had prepared, and Drink
freely of the Wine which he had Mingled; crying out unto them, and saying, Eat
O Friends, and Drink, yea, Drink abundantly, O my Beloved! You are now at a
Feast where you have Provisions enough to fill and satisfy you, therefore Eat
and spare not, and let your Souls Drink freely of the Cup of Salvation which I
have provided you. You need not fear your Eating of my Table empty, nor shall
the Fountain whereat you now Drink ever be Exhausted; O therefore, Feed and
Feast your Souls; for assure your selves, that the more you Eat at my Table,
the more you shall have to Eat, and the welcomer you shall be; and the more you
Drink at the Ocean of my Love, and the Fountain of my Goodness, the more you
shall have it overflowing to you; and therefore I charge you that you rise not
before you are satisfied, and that none of you go Empty from my Table. O Create
not an occasion to your selves, to reflect with shame and sorrow hereafter upon
your Madness and Folly in going from Infinite fullness without being filled, and
from Alsufficiency it self, without being satisfied. I am sure you do not, or
at least you need not Question your welcome to my Table, and the Provisions I
have there provided for you, nor my willingness to make you so, since I have by
many and Irrefragable Arguments given you unquestionable Demonstrations thereof.

The King having made this Declaration, methoughts I saw Believer, (who had
before he would adventure to approach the Table, or participate of the Feast to
which he was invited; plucked out of his Bosom (which was the place where he
used to keep it) the Memorials of his Covenant, and having read the Conditions
thereof, and Considered with himself how he had answered the Obligations he had
thereby laid upon him, and finding himself saulty in some Particulars, he
mightily bewailed his folly and oversight therein, and in the most humble
manner imaginable upon his Knees, with shame and blushing, acknowledged and
confessed it, and craved Pardon for the same, protesting the sincerity of his
Intentions to amend, and promising to yield better Obedience for the future,
and having so done he set his Hand and Subscribed his Name to it, as he did
before when he first entered into Covenant, and so folding of it up, he put it
into his Bosom again, and kept it there as a perpetual Memorial of the Matter,)
now pluck the Memorial of the Covenant between him and the Son of the Blessed
out of his Bosom, and with a most profound Reverence and Veneration Humbly
presented it to the King, entreating him to set his Seal to it; which I saw the
King take into his Sacred Hand, and having read it over, and perused the
Contents of it, I heard him declare himself highly pleased and delighted with
that Faith in his Promises, Hope in his Mercy, and Confidence and Trust in his
Truth and Faithfulness which Believer had by that Act discovered himself to be
possessed of, and therefore willingly affixed the Broad Seal of Heaven to that
Memorial of his Covenant, and Certificate of his Marriage. And then Methoughts
I heard Believer sing softly to himself the following Himn.

Thou'st brought my Soul into thy Courts,
And Chambers of thy Love,
To be refresht and feasted here
With dainties from above.
The Heavens thou have open set,
And rent the Vail, that I
May upwards look, and thy dear So
With Glory Crowned epsy,
Who Crowned was for me with Thorns,
And Scourged with Cruel Hand,
When on the Cross he died for me
With sad and torturing pangs;
Tears then ran down his Rosy Cheeks,
And Sweat bedewed his Face,
Blood from his Sacred Hands and Feet,
And Side in Streams apace
Did flow, to purge and wash my Soul,
And purchase at thy Hands,
The Pardon of my Wickedness,
And freedom from my Bands:
His dying Groans were strong and loud,
When thou on him did lay
The Punishment of all my Sins,
Which he did freely pay;
And for my Soul he purchase did,
Both Grace and Glory too,
The one to be my portion here,
The other when I go
From this frail state and mortal life,
To be possessed above
With those delights which there do flow
In plenty from thy Love.
And after they had all of them Eaten and Drank their fill, and the Steward of
the Feast had in their Names, and on their behalf returned Praise and
Thanksgiving to the King for the Bounty and Love wherewith he had Treated them
at his Table; they all sang an Himn to the Praise and Adoration of him, who was
both the Maker and the Matter of their Feast; and then the Steward standing up,
he Blessed them in the Kings Name, and so they departed; and I saw them go
forward on their Journey, Talking and Discoursing together of the great things
which they had seen, and felt, and participated of at the Kings Table, and
saying one to another, certainly we shall never forget the Glorious sights
which have been represented to our view this day, especially, that Blessed and
Glorious Mystery which was so full of Wonders, and those Wonders so great and
Transparent, viz. The Mystery of God Manifested in the Flesh; Ah Blessed
Mystery! and thrice happy we who have had our Eyes Blessed therewith, and have
had Hopes and Assurances given us, that we have an Interest therein, and shall
both here and hereafter in Time and in Eternity, enjoy the benefits thereof.

But after some time, I saw Believer overtaken by one of his old Companions,
with whom he admitted to talk a little, which brought up former Enjoyment into
Remembrance, which he found created some kind of delight to him; upon which the
poor Man was presently seized with the Plagues of Spiritual Laziness and
Aukwardness, so that he became in a manner altogether indifferent whether he
went forward or not, and the Plagues increased and grew so much upon him, that
in a little time, he neither cared whether he did, nor knew how to set one Foot
further; nay, I perceived he had, (notwithstanding all that he had formerly
suffered thereby, the trouble and sorrow it had procured him, the Comforts it
had Robed him of, marred his Confidence in the Eternal, and made him both
afraid and ashamed to repair to his Throne of Grace, or once dare to lift up
his Face before him) some little Inclination to go back again with him; whereby
the Blessed and the Holy Spirit which was sent into his Heart by the Redeemer,
to be the Director and Comforter, and Reliever of his Soul, and as such had
endeavored to persuade him against having any thing to do with this Old
Acquaintance, or once stop to speak to him; and when he could not prevail for
that, but the poor overtaken, and wilful Man had resolved notwithstanding all
that was said to the Contrary, to buy Repentance at the dear rate of parting
with all these Assurances he had of, and all the delight and satisfaction he
took in, the Favor of the Eternal, and for any thing he knew to the contrary
his Soul too, to purchase it: Then he persuaded him to Repent of his Folly,
told him the danger he had brought himself into by this relaxation from, and
prevarication in his Covenant, advising him to stop before he was gone so far
that he would not be able to stop, nor would be peradventure accepted by the
Eternal if he did, but now he was grown more wilful and obstinate than before;
nay, he was so taken up, that he heard not, or at least minded not what was
said to him, whereat the Holy Spirit was offended, grieved, quenched, and
finding all his Motions slighted, and all his Dictates opposed and disobeyed,
he withdrew, but I saw that he did not absolutely leave him, but only retired
out of sight, forbore the sensible performance of his Visible Operations,
whereby the poor Man was left in a sad and dismal Condition. He intended at
first it should seem only to speak to it, or so, without any Design of Cloasing
with, or embracing of it, but the Prince of Darkness perceiving that he stopped
to speak with it, and knowing that the Original Corruption which he had within
him, was of the Nature of Tinder, and thereby apt to take Fire upon the least
occasion, he presently laid hold of the opportunity, and flying swiftly through
the Air with a little spark of Fire in his Right Hand, which he brought with
him out of the Bottomless Pit, he came close by him, and having ordered the
Object that had at first stayed him to appear, just as he came to him, the Man
seeing it coming lift up his Eyes to gaze at it, and thereupon the Wicked
Fiend, who only watched for, and desired that opportunity, threw the burning
Spark which he brought in his Hand for that purpose in at those Windows or
Casements of the Soul, which meeting with a Nature that was no other than
Tinder to this Spark, he was presently set all on a Flame. Now when I saw
things go thus with him, I still expected when he should by an absolute
Compliance have turned his Back upon the Celestial Paradise, and have declared
his resolution then and there to have put a final period to his Pilgrimage, and
return again into the Broad Way; but notwithstanding my fears, I perceived that
all the Wiles and Devices which the Prince of Darkness was Master of, was not
able to effect that; not but that Believer's Inclinations to do so, were strong
and powerful enough, but because the Seed of the Eternal remained in him, and
the Prince of Darkness could not find out or Devise any expedient to force or
steal that out of him, however he resolved to keep him as long as possible in
that posture, wherein he found him, hoping to effect that by length of time,
which he could not accomplish at present, and resolving since he could not
steal away, or force the Seed out of his Heart which the Eternal had Sown
there, he would Beleaguer and Besiege it so close as to prevent the Eternals
sending any relief or succor to it, and thereby starve it out, or force it to
a Surrender: And in this sad kind of Condition the Man continued for a long
time, hanging as it were between Heaven and Hell, and halting between two
Opinions, until at last he came to a place where one of those Temples stood
which the Eternal had placed in the Road for Pilgrims to do their Homage and
Worship, and Adore him in. Now when he came to the Door, I could easily
perceive him to be indifferent whether he went in or passed by, but being
entered he there met with an Ambassador from the King, who assured the Pilgrims
which came there to Worship, that if any of them sinned wilfully after the
receiving the knowledge of the Truth, there remains no more sacrifice for Sin,
but a fearful looking for of Judgment, and Fiery Indignation, which shall
devour those Adversaries; for if those who despised Moses Law, died without
Mercy, of how much sorer punishment shall you be thought worthy, who have
trodden under Foot the Son of God, and accounted the Blood of the Covenant
wherewith you were sanctified an unholy thing, and done despite to the Spirit
of Grace: And I will assure you, said he, you will find it a dreadful thing to
fall thus into the Hands of the living God, for our God is a consuming Fire to
all of you, who are Workers of Iniquity: Now Believer looking back, and
reflecting upon what he had done, found, that if it were not his very case
which had been Treated of, yet at least it came somewhat near it, looked like
it, and led directly toward it; whereupon he presently applied all that had
been said to himself, affirming it was all directed at, and intended for him;
and that which made him the more confident it was so, was this, he fancied that
the Ambassador looked on him, and pointed at him all the time he was
delivering his Embassy; whereupon he roared in the bitterness of his Soul, and
cried out, O, woe, woe, and ten thousand woes unto me, wretched me, deluded and
deceived me, for I am now lost and undone, my hope is cut off from the Lord,
and the everlasting God has forsaken me; the Blessed Redeemer has now ceased
to interceed for me, and the Holy Spirit is withdrawn from me. After this
manner he lamented and bewailed his backsliding, nor were his fellow Pilgrims,
diverse of whom attempted it, able to fix any Comfort upon him; they told him of
the Mercy of the Eternal, the Merits of the Redemer, the certainty and firmness
of those Promises, and the unalterableness of the Covenant wherein they had
made over and given themselves unto him: They told him, that the everlasting
Jehovah was not as a Man, that he should Repent; nor as the Son of Man, that he
should Change; all which he acknowledged to be good Plasters for a wounded
Soul: But O, said he, they will not stick upon me. And thus he went mourning
from them, and I saw him retire into a secret place all alone by himself, where
prostrating himself on the Earth, before the Eternal with a dejected
Countenance, a sad Heart, a weeping Eye, and a doubting Spirit, having his Face
covered over with shame and blushing, not daring to look up to Heaven, as
unworthy to behold that place, he only laid his Hand upon his Guilty Breast,
and sighed out Lord be merciful to me a Sinner: He would have proceeded
further, but was not able, so that he was forced to sigh out the rest in silent
Groans, which he was not able to utter, or form into Words. Now after he had
lain thus grovelling on the Ground for some time, I saw him a rise, and taking
the Records of the Sacred Law into his Hand, he opened it just about the
middle, and the very first thing that he fixed his Eyes upon, was the following
Promise; He that confesses and forsakes his Sins shall find Mercy: His Eyes
were so dim and blared with weeping, that he could not see to read it plain at
first, so that he was forced to look on it again, and again before, he could
read it plainly; then turning toward the latter end of it, he found another,
which was not only more full and sweet in it self, but also directed him how to
make use and improve the other, viz. If any Man sin we have an Advocate with
the Father, even Jesus Christ the Righteous; from which two places of the
Divine Law, he Extracted abundance of Comfort and Hope, and resolved presently
to put them in practice.

Wherefore Addressing himself in the most humble manner imaginable upon his
Knees to the Eternal, he uttered himself after this manner.

Lord (said he) I have sinned against Heaven, and before Thee, and am not
worthy to be called thy Son; wherefore Thou have almost consumed me in thine
Anger, because of my Backsliding: And thy wrath has troubled me, because of my
sin. Mine iniquities are ever before Thee, and Thou have set my secret sins in
the Light of thy Countenance. Thou make me to spend my days in sorrow, and
pass away my nights in despair. Lord, who knows the power of thy Anger?
according to thy fear, so is thy wrath; the sense wereof lies so heavy upon
me, That I am like one going down into the pit, and like a man that has no
strength, thy fierce wrath goes over me, and thy Terrors have cut me off; so
that my days are consumed as smoke, and my bones are burned and consumed
within me: My heart is smitten and withered, like grass, so that I forget to
take my bread; and yet all this I freely acknowledge to be Just, because I have
sinned against Thee. I am destroyed indeed, but it is by my self; I am wounded,
but is by my own weapon of my own forming, and an arrow out of my own Quiver. I
am Poisoned but it is by a draught of my own Composing. I am Robbed and
stripped of all my enjoyments, but it was not without my own consent: And
therefore thou may justly refuse to Heal or Relieve me, Pardon and forgive
me; But Lord, did not thou tell me, that thou were an Everlasting God; that
thy Love was unchangeable. I have indeed slighted thy Love, abused thy
Patience, trampled upon thy Son, despised thy Grace, and greived thy Spirit.
And have not only sinned against, and broken and violated all those obligations
which thou have been perpetually laying upon me by the infinite and
uncontrollable instances of thy Love and thy Bounty: But likewise against all
those obligations that I have been laying upon my self too, I have violated all
my Covenants, my promises and my vows, and sinned against my own prayers,
lamentations and Tears: And will thou therefore, O Lord, prove as changeable as
my self! Will thou take an advantage against me! Will thou cut me off for ever!
or will thou resolve to be favorable no more! Is thy mercy clean gone for
ever! And shall thy promises fail for evermore! Have thou forgotten to be
gracious! Or will thou in anger shut up the Bowels of thy tender compassions!
Will thou who art the God of Grace, refuse to be gracious! The Fountain of
Mercy, cease to be Merciful! Have Thou not said in the Records of thy Law, that
Thou will not be always Wrath, neither will Thou keep Thy Anger for ever, lest
the spirit fail before Thee, and the Soul which Thou have made?

And then applying himself to the Son of the Blessed, Lord, said he, Did not
Thou assume me in the day when Thou enteredst into Covenant with me, and
permittedst me to enter into Covenant with Thee; That Thou would become my
High Priest and Advocate; and that as Thou had shed thy most precious Blood,
as a Sacrifice to Atone for my sins; so Thou would appear before thy Father,
as my Advocate, and plead that Blood, and the Merits of it, to appease his
Anger, and turn away his displeasure against me, and Procure me Pardon and
forgiveness from him, and Reconciliation with him. And will Thou now, when I am
confounded in my self, and even environed and overwhelmed with Despair, having
no hope or possibility of finding relief any where but in thy self, forget thy
Promise, and prove worse then thy Word? Will Thou because I have wickedly and
most perfidiously broken my Covenant, break thine too? Sure it cannot be, for
thou art the same for ever, and can not change: wherefore thou Blessed Jesus,
thou sweet Redeemer of my Soul, I will by thy own Assistance, (for without it I
am sure I shall not be able) resolve with an humble boldness, to act Faith in
thy Promises, lay hold on thy Covenant, and hang upon the words of thy lips, as
the Be does on the flower, from whence she extracts a sweetness wherewith the
dews of Heaven has replenished it. And according to thy own directions, I will
now take unto my self words, and say unto thee, Lord, Pardon thou my
iniquities, and receive me graciously: Heal thou my Backslidings, and love me
freely. And do thou who art so Eloquent and Powerful an Orator, that thy Father
can deny thee nothing, Who art so wise an Advocate that none of thy Clients did
or shall lose their Cause; so prevailing an Intercessor, that whatsoever thou
Intercedest for, and what request soever thou make on the behalf of thy
Members, is fully and immediately granted; go to the Eternal, and plead my
Cause at at his Bar, and when Thou have there procured Pardon and
Reconciliation for me; then send thy Spirit to convey the knowledge and
comfortable Assurance thereof, unto my Soul, that so thou may cause my heart
to sing for joy, and put a new song of Praise and Thanksgiving into my mouth,
that I may rejoice in the Lord, and triumph in God my Savior, Amen, Amen.

And methoughts, I saw him rise from his knees in a most Humble, Serious, and
sedate Frame, having his heart enlarged, lifted up to Heaven in Holy and
desires, and yet his eyes cast down to the Earth, as being both ashamed for his
having so shamefully Backsliden from, and prevaricated with the Infinite
Jehovah, the Eternal Majesty of Heaven and Earth; and withal not absolutely
freed as yet from all manner of fear, diffidence and doubtings, whether the
Eternal would be reconciled to him, or whether the Blessed Redeemer would
intercede for him, and endeavor to prevail with the Eternal to consent to a
reconciliation: having as he afterward told some of his fellow Pilgrim, many
mis-givings of Heart, that they would never give him credit or trust him more,
since he had falsified his word, violated his promises, and broken his Covenant
with them so often before; wherefore plucking the memorial of his Covenant out
of his bosom, he first read it over, and then began to examine himsef what
parts of it he had broken, and tried, convicted and condemned himself for the
same: And having so done, I heard him say thus to himself, Well! since it is so
that I have been so foolish and unwary, as to suffer my self to be thus
wheadled by my subtle Adversary, to dally and play with that which I thought I
had Eternally shaken hands with, and had firmly resolved to have no more to do
with it for ever; and I am not able to obtain any Assurance within my self,
whether I am in a state of Grace, nor yet whether I am Pardoned by the Eternal,
for thus Backsliding from him; I will now therefore, resolve to enter into
Covenant anew as if I had never done it before; I will give up and make a
Resignation of my self to the Blessed Redeemer, as though all I had hitherto done
in that respect, were false and fained: And when I have done this, then I will
see if I can take more heed to my ways, be more careful to maintain a stricter
and more Spiritual Government over my thoughts and affections.

Whereupon kneeling down before the Eternal, he opened the paper, and having
spread it before him, he first bewailed with shame and sorrow his Violation
thereof, freely acknowledging, and confessing his Guilt, and that he had
thereby justly deserved to be Eternally forsaken by, and banished the Presence
of the Eternal for ever. And then he silently sighed out his humble Request,
That Free Grace might notwithstanding Reprieve and Pardon him, and the Divine
Goodness Heal and Restore him. Then I heard him read over the Conditions of his
Covenant and saw him when he had so done, in the most Solemn manner imaginable,
present it to the Divine Majesty, as his act and deed, setting his hand and
subscribing his Name to it, as he had done at the first.

Whereupon methoughts I looked up, and saw The Son of the Blessed, stand by the
Golden Altar, which was erected before the Throne of God, having a Golden
Censor in his hand, which was full of incense, wherewith he offered up the
Prayers and Desires of Believers, upon the Golden Altar, which was before the
Throne, and the smoke of the Incense which came with the Prayers of Believers,
and ascended up before the Eternal, out of the hand of the Blessed Redeemer who
is the compassionate Advocate and merciful High Priest of all relenting and
returning Pilgrims, wherewith the Eternal was to exceedingly well pleased, that
all his frowns were thereby presently changed into smiles, his Anger into Love,
and his indignation into Compassion, so that he now spoke kindly to believers;
returning the words of Peace and Truth, and comforting him that was cast down,
saying unto him, Behold I have called thee as a man calls a Woman that was
forsak'n and greived in spirit and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused,
says thy God, for a small moment, have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy
will I gather thee, in little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment, but
with Everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, says the Lord thy
Redeemer; And the Covenant between us shall be, as the waters of Noah, shall no
more go over the Earth, so have I Sworn that I would not be wrath with thee,
nor rebuke thee. The Mountains shall depart and the Hills they shall be
removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall the Covenant of
my Peace ever be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on thee. Thou have
indeed played the Harlot, gone a whoring from me and embraced strangers,
whereby thou have deserved no better at my hands than that I should write thee
a Bill of Divorcement, put thee away and resolve never to own thee again: But
yet fear not, for I have Pardoned thee and have covered thy shame with the
skirt of my Love, so that thou shall forget thy shame, thy unfaithfulness, and
shall not remember the reproach of thy Widowhood any more; for thy Maker is thy
Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
Israel, whose Truth is established for ever, and his Faithfulness to all
generations; wherefore art thou afflicted, tossed with tempest and not
comforted? Behold I will lay thy Stones with fair Colors, and thy Foundation
with Saphires. And now if thou will take care to keep close to me, and be
unfaithful no more, then will I also resolve never to withdraw the sense of my
Love and the Light of my Countenance from thee any more for ever.

And now I saw upon this Reconciliation, the Eternal Spirit, who was the
Director, Reliever and Comforter of his Soul, return to him again, being sent
from the Redeemer, to acquaint him with, and assure him of that Reconciliation,
which he had by his efficacious and prevailing Mediation procured for him, with
his Father, and to fill and feast his Soul with comfort, joy and consolation
upon that account, and assist him in the preserving himself in the Divine
favor for the future; whereupon I heard him break forth into such sweet and
Heavenly Expressions as these, Lord, said he, how infinite is thy
Condescension, and how wonderful is thy Love! How unfathomable is thy Mercy!
And how unwearied is thy Patience! O that ever such a Backsliding wretch, such
a worthless Worm, such a Rebel, Traitor and Prodigal as my self, should be
again received to Mercy! O what a wonder it is, that ever such Backslidings as
mine were, should be healed! That ever such unfaithfulness should be Pardoned!
That ever such Ungratefulness should be forgiven; but since thou have declared
that it is so, and have assured me of the Truth and certainty thereof, both by
the Word and Oath of him that cannot lie, I Believe, Lord, help thou my
unbelief. And now, O my God and my Father, I do with all humble Boldness, lay
hold of, and thankfully receive these renewings of thy Love, and fresh
assurances of thy Favor and Friendship, which thou have at this time
graciously sent me, and do as the most suitable return which my poverty is
capable of making to thy Infinite and unmerited Love, subject my Soul and all
the powers of it, to thee, to be disposed of as thou please; and ordered, and
directed in all things, according to the pleasure of thy will: In order
whereunto, I do with all humble Boldness and firm Resolution, lay hold of thee,
O my God! and of that Covenant which thou have made with me, both as my
happiness, and my safety, my portion and my strength too. And thou, and the
Covenant, which thou have made with me, and now renewed to me, shall be that
Rock whereon I will build all my confidence and hopes; and make the stay of my
Heart and the support of my Soul; that shall be the very life of my joys, and
the joy even of my life it self; where I will for ever sit and Sing, under the
Shadow of thy branches with great delight, and thy fruit shall be sweet to my
taste. There, even there, I will behold the Glory of thy Face, and veiw the
ravishing Beauty of thy Countenance, and satiate my Lovesick Soul with the
matchless Greatness and Bravery, freeness, sweetness, and redundancy of thy Joy.

And now methoughts I saw him go forward in his Pilgrimage with more speed and
diligence than ever, and with such an addition of strength, that
notwithstanding he met with innumerable discouragements, and every step brought
him into new and more threatening dangers, both from Earth and Hell, which with
one accord united and banded together to obstruct and retard his passage; yet
he courageously trampled them under foot, and with ease and facility, passed
through them toward the promised Land. And now after he had marched thus
rejoicing and triumphing in God for some time, I saw an Ambassador come from
the King of Kings, and invite him, with many other Pilgrims, whom he had now
overtaken again, to a noble and splendid Feast, at the Kings Table: A Feast of
fat things, and wine on the Lees; fat things full of marrow, and wine on the
Lees well refined. He gladly accepted of and embraced the Invitation: But yet I
observed, he durst not adventure to go to the Kings Table, before he had first
read over the Memorial of his Covenant, examined himself how he had kept it,
Consest his prevarications with sorrow and Repentance, and then protesting the
Resolutions of his Soul to be more strict and yield better obedience for the
future, again set his hand and subscribed his name to it as before. And having
thus renewed his Covenant with the Eternal, he went and sat down with the
rest, at the King's Table, where I saw him present the same to the King,
begging that he might have the Seal of it Renewed likewise, which was presently
granted. And now methoughts I could discern him to eat more heartily, and drink
more freely at the Kings Table, then I had seen him do at other times, when he
was invited thither; and when the Feast was over, he went away likewise filled
with a Joy as far exceeding what he had formerly expressed, as the Joy of
Harvest exceeds that of the Seed time; or the Joy of Marriage transcends those
that flow only from the first overtures of it: And as I afterward heard him
acknowledge in a Conference he had with some of the Pilgrims, it was the most
ravishing and transforming Glimpse, and the sweetest, and the most satisfying
Taste of that Eternal Felicity and Delight that is to be had in the Celestial
Paradise.

In this sweet and Heavenly Frame he continued a long time, still calling to
his fellow Pilgrims, and telling them the greatness of those Joys, and the
sweetness of that pleasure which the Eternal poured into his Soul; and would
frequently say, O what a wonder it is that Divine patience has born with me
thus long. Methinks it is a wonder that the Eternal should not feed me with
Wrath, with Gall and Wormwood, with fire and Brimstone, and that he has not
Clothed me with fury and flames, with indignation and Vengeance! But O it is
yet a greater, nay an infinitely greater wonder that he should feed me with
Mercy and Love, Grace and Goodness, and Cloth me with pardon and and
forgiveness! That he should give himself to me, as my happiness and portion,
and give me leave upon all occasions to make use of him as my Inheritance and
Treasure! And that rather than I should want, he should Bountifully make me a
continual and perpetual Feast; of which Feast he himself is the matter as well
as the Maker! O that ever a poor worthless, forlorn and despicable Wretch, who
was cast out in his Blood, and no eye pitied him, should be thus Dignified and
Advanced! That ever I should be permitted to feed, and feast, and live even
upon Omnipotency it self! O come unto me all ye that fear the Eternal, and I
will tell you what he has done for my Soul: He that is Mighty has done for me
great things, and Holy is his Name! O that I could love him, please him, and
Delight in him more! That I could rejoice and triumph in him more! And O that
the whole employment of my life, may be to admire and boast of the Sweetness
and Glory, Riches and Plenty of my Portion! And that my Tongue may speak Good
of his Name, and exalt and sing forth his praise, so long as I have a tongue to
speak or sing withal.

But notwithstanding all this Heavenly Discourse, I understood he was not yet
perfect, for afterward, I perceived his heat and fervor begin to abate, and
by reason of the remainder of Conceptions, the power of his Indwellingsin and
the deceitfulness of his treacherous Heart, he was thereupon prevailed with to
meddle a little too much with take delight in some things, which were indeed
lawful in themselves, and were bestowed upon him by the Eternal, for the
Comfort and ease of his Pilgrimage, in a moderate enjoyment thereof. But the
least excess in Love to, and Delight therein, has ever been accounted (and he
found by woeful experience, that it was so to him) a wonderful hindrance to
Pilgrims in their Journey toward Celestial Paradise; so that he began to grow
very cold, dull and indifferent, and by that means lost much of the Comfort and
Joy which he had been possessed withal, but as soon as he perceived it, he
presently ran to a certain mountain which stands in that Road, and is so
exceeding high, that Pilgrims were used to climb up thither, and take a Veiw of
Celestial Paradise, formerly called Pisgah, but I think they now call it
Contemplation. The delightful and ravishing Sight whereof very much conduces
toward the recovering them out of those fits of carnal Security. And when he
came to the foot of the Mount, he encouraged himself to get up to it by the
sweetness of those pleasures, the convenience of its height would afford him a
prospect of, saying to himself,

Mount up my Soul, and on this Mountain stand,
A taking prospect is the Holy Land.
And having thus encouraged himself, up he went, but by reason of its height
and steepness, it was not without some difficulty that he reached the top of
it; But being once there, it gave him a fair prospect of the whole Universe.
And the first thing he fixed his eyes upon, was the Wilderness, where he saw a
World of Sin and Wickedness, Cursing, Swearing, and Blaspheming God, Theft, and
Rapine, and murder, Irreligion, Breaking the Sabbath and profaning every
thing which was Sober and Sacred; And as the consequence hereof, great variety
of tormenting pains and perplexing misery, attending of, and falling on the
Inhabitants thereof: Then casting his eyes a little lower, he saw Tophet, the
place which the Eternal had made for the Reprobate: A pla exceeding deep and
large, the pile whereof was Fire, and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord,
like a perpetual stream of Brimstone, does kindle it: Where he saw an
innumerable company of vain and impertinent Wretches, weeping and wailing, and
gnashing their teeth, and bitterly bemoaning and lamenting themselves and
howling in those dismal flames. Then he lifted his eyes to Eden, where he took
a Veiw of the happy place, where the Eternal first made Proclamation of mercy,
and declared the Riches and Glory of his free Grace and Love, in the choice and
provision of a Redeemer, saying, The Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents
head. Then he removed his eye to Canaan, where he beheld the Temple, the
Sacrifices, and all the other Types and Figures that were lively
representations of the promised Messiah. After this he directed his eyes
toward, and took a veiw of Bethelem, Egypt, Nazareth, Jordan, Jerusalem, and
the rest of the Cities of Judah, the Mount of Tranfiguration, the upper Room,
where the Blessed Redeemer Instituted his last Supper, the Garden beyond the
brook Cedron, where he endured his Agony, and was Betrayed, the High Priest's
Hall, where that blessed Face which was fairer then the Children of men, was
Spit on, and in scorn and derision covered and buffetted; the the Judgment
Hall, whither he was carried by those ungrateful Jews, and where he was
Condemned by the Roman Governor, First to be in a most inhumane manner Cruelly
Scourged with Whips, and beaten with Reeds, and then his Royal Head to be
barbarously Crowned with a Diadem of Thorns: And after all this, by a most
unjust Sentence, delivered to be Crucified, only to gratify the importunity
and clamor of a multude. From thence he directed his eye to Golgotha, where he
saw him as an Eternal High Priest, after the order of Melchisedeck, offer up
himself as a Sacrifice to Divine Justice; and then to the Sepulcher, where he
saw him lie three days, as a Testimony that he was really dead, and on the
third day rise again, as an assurance that he had paid the uttermost farthing
that Justice could demand, and that the Eternal was fully and completely
Satisfied. And from hence he followed him through several places to Mount
Olivet, whence he saw him Ascend to the Celestial Paradise, there to prepare a
place for him. And now methoughts I could easily discern him to be exceedingly
filled with admiration and wonder, at this blessed and glorious Sight,
following him with his eyes to the very entrance of Paradise, and looking in
after him, he beheld a little glimpse of the surprising Beauty and
inexpressible Glory and splendour of the place.

Now you may well imagine that after such transforming Sights as these, he was
able to trample under foot all that coldness, deadness and indifferency which
he carried up with him, and by that means was Enabled to Walk without
weariness, and ran without fainting, like a man whose Fetters were just now
knocked off, and all those cloggs wherewith he was wont to be hindered, were
removed. And yet after all this I could perceive he lost sight of it again, and
thereby he lost much of that comfort and consolation which the sight of it
yielded him; and indeed the whole way, both before and after this, lay over
Hills and Dales, sometimes on the Mount, and sometimes in the Valley, sometimes
he could behold the Sun of Righteousness arising upon him, with healing under
his wings, darting his glorious Beams, and conveying his refreshing and and
exhilerating Influences into his Soul; and at other times he was so benighted,
and such sable Clouds interposed between him and Paradise, that he was so far
from seeing the Sun, that he was not able to discern either Moon or Stars.
Sometimes he would be walking with the Son of the Blessed, who was the beloved
and the darling of his Soul, in the Gardens of Spices, satiating himself with
Love, and the mutual embraces and enjoyment of each other; and yet at other
times his Beloved would withdraw and hide himself behind the wall, so that he
could not find him, although he enquired after him, and it may be, when he did
appear he would only vouchsafe to look on him through the window, or show
himself through the Lettice.

Yet toward the latter end of his Journey, when he drew nearer to Paradise,
the path wherein he walked, became more smooth and fruitful; and the little
winged Choristers, wherewith the blooming and fragrant Groves on either side of
it, were replenished, sang more sweetly than they were wont to do, and the Air
likewise became more serene and clear, the reason of all which was, because the
Beloved of his Soul was more frequent in his Visits, and longer in his Stays
then formerly, yet not so, but that he had some intermissions, some ups and
some downs, some Sun and some Cloud, some Light and some darkness still.

And thus I saw that through abundance of those vicissitudes and changes, he
came at last to a certain River or narrow Sea, which parts between the
Wilderness and Paradise: Through which he was of necessity to pass, in regard
there was no other way to go it. Now the Name of this River was anciently
called Jordan, but more modernly known by the name of Dissolution; he was
somewhat sorrowful, when he first saw the River and begun to shrink and tremble
for fear, and was ready to wish that the passing through that River, which was
so displeasing to nature, were not the way to Paradise. But considering with
himself that there was no other way, that he was unworthy of a Crown, if he
would not willingly adventure through a narrow, straight, difficult passage to
obtain it, especially since it was so exceeding short too, and the greatest
difficulty and danger thereof taken away by his Redeemers passing through it
before him, he plucked up his Spirits, and roused up his two Friends Faith and
Hope, to assist him in, and bare him company through the River, telling them
that this was the last time that ever they could possibly have an opportunity
to afford him any assistance; for said he, so soon as ever I reach the further
shore, I must there take my Eternal leave of you; for I shall no sooner have
set my foot on that Blessed Land, but Faith shall be immediately turned into
Vision, and imperefect Hope changed into perfect Fruition; and then
courageously entered the River, saying, O Death where thy sting! O Grave where
is thy Victory! The Sting of Death is taken away, and Victory of the Grave
obtained for me, by the Son of the Blessed, who has Redeemed my Soul from
both, in the day of his Crucifixion, when and where he erected Trophies of his
own and my Victory, upon their ruin and destruction, spoiling Principalities
and Powers, and leading captivity captive. When he first entered, he only waded
therein, but after a little while it proved so deep, that he was forced to
swim, wherein he took abundance of pains, and labored hard to keep himself
above Water, still lifting up his face toward, and fixing his eye on the
Recompense of Reward, the sweetness and Glory of which Sight, did very much
alleviate the pains and troublesomeness of his passage, and made it easy to
him, and made him speak much of the sweet effects of Divine Goodness and Love,
and of the Beauty, Order and Glory, Quietude; Peaceableness, and Unity of the
place to which he was going; And he continued to go until he came to the other
side, when drawing nearer the shore more plain, and getting a discovery of the
Glory of the Heavenly Country, he did witsh a delightful smile give a sudden
start, and leaped on shore saying, Farewell forever thou dangerous and stormy
Sea, for I have now passed thee, and am arrived in a safe, a still, and an
Eternal Harbor; When he first entered the River, he had still about him some
Remainder of Corruption, and was clothed with Mortality and Imperfection, all
which he left behind him in the River, and so soon as ever he was got on the
other side, I could plainly perceive that he had nothing remaining in him, or
cleaving to him, but what was perfect, pure, and immortal.

Now I saw, that as soon as ever he came on shore, he was received, and
welcomed by a great number of the shining Courtiers of Heaven, who had waited
on and encompassed him all the time of his Passage through the River of
Dissolution, although then they were not visible to him: They congratulated his
safe Arrival telling him how welcome he would be to, and how joyfully received
by the King of the Caelestial Paradise, who is, said they, the King of Kings,
and the absolute Monarch of the Universe, adding moreover that they were sent
by him, to be his Lifeguard, and attend him in state through the rest of his
Journey, to the place of his Coronation, which lies, said they, throw the very
midst of the Enemies Country, and when he was come about half way thither, he
was met by a far greater number of those Glorious Inhabitants, every one of
them declaring the greatness of that Pleasure which his Arrival afforded them,
and joined with him in singing praises and Hallelujahs to him who having washed
him from his sins in his own Blood, and espoused him to himself, had now
consummated the marriage, and Crowned the Nuptials with a full, a perfect, and
an Eternal Enjoyment of each others Love, and that the joy and delight of that
happy Marriage might be the more full and Complete, they even then began to
Celebrate it by playing on their Musical Instruments, the sounds whereof yield
such an Heavenly Ravishing and Divine Harmony, that it Infinitely exceeded
those Descriptions which some have given of the Music of the Spheres, although
that is said to be so admirable and delightful, that should it but strongly
touch the ear, it would tempt the ravished Soul to forsake its mortal
Habitation. And thus he passed on to the Gate of the City, which he found wide
open, and through it an abundant entrance was administered unto him, into the
Everlasting Kingdom. As soon as he was arrived within the Gate, the blessed
Redeemer stood with extended Arms ready to receive and embrace him, and having
first arrayed him in White, and shineing Garments, placed a Crown of Glory on
his head, and palms of Triumph in his hands; he then lead him toward, and
according to the promise he had formerly made him in the day when he entered
into Covenant, with him, he presented him to his Father without any kind of
spot or Defilement, being blameless in Love before him for ever in the
Beatifick Vision, of whose blessed face, and the familfar Enjoyment and full
fruition of whose Glory and Love he is to live and Reign for ever and ever,
World without end. Amen.

And now methoughts when I saw the Gates opened to give admittance to this
happy Pilgrim, I took that opportunity to look in and take a delightful view of
that blessed and glorious place, which is so much famed in sacred Story, and I
found the Prospect of it to afford such an abundance of Pleasure and
Satisfaction, I think I shall never forget it. And I hope I shall never sit
down satisfied until I also have obtained the Possession thereof: This sight
being so Pleasant, and the Prospect of its Glory being so ravishing and
Delightful to me, I would willingly give you a Description of the Country, in
hopes thereby to make you in Love with it. But yet I must do it with a caution,
and beg that you would not expect I should give you an exact and perfect
description of a place which I only know my self by report, or at best by that
short and transient Glimpse at a vast and incredible distance, which I then
obtained, especially since its extent and largeness, its glory and sweetness
etc. is not only more then can be any way expressed by the Tongue of men or
Angels, or described by the most florid and ingenious Pen, but even above, and
infinitely beyond all possibility of Conception too, when the Soul most
expatiates and inlarges it Thoughts and Contemplations thereon; however, assure
thy self that what I do say of it, is really true, and infinitely more than I
can either write or think; The full Prospect and Knowledge whereof thou must be
content to stay for till thy self shall be admitted as an Inhabitant thereof.

Celestial Paradise is a place admirably situated in a most incomparably sweet
Serene and delectable Air, infinitely exceeding the fairest and the best
situated place, which this World wherein we now live can possibly produce; for
being advanced by the Almighty Jehovah, who contrived and formed it by his
Wisdom, and fixed and established it by his Power, far above the heavy Earth,
whereon we walk, and the thick foggy Air wherein we breathe, it aspires into
the purer Sky, where the Eternal Jehovah himself ever shines, and is that
Glorious Sun whose Bright and Illustrious Rays fill those happy Regions with a
perpetual Confluence of Light, and thereby maintains an Eternal day by the help
whereof, and the Advantage of its Situation, the whole Universe presents it
self at once to the admiring view of its blessed Inhabitants. And the whole
Circumference thereof seems to make their prying Souls the happy Center,
wherein all its Beauty and Glory Conspires to meet; no noysom or offensive
scents can possibly penetrate or infect that sweet and Blissful Place, for
there is nothing affects that Air, but what is pure and Odoriferous, and serves
only to perfume the Heavenly Mansions with the more exhilerating Fragrancy, and
moreover, a perpetual Calm and Quietude reigns in that happy Region, and
therewith Eternally crowns all its other Felicities.

For there you shall hear nothing but what will infinitely delight and charm
thy ravished Soul into sweet and delightful contemplations. And when thou shall
hear the infinite praises of thy great Creator, sung forth by all his works of
wonder; and every Creature thou beholdest with Cheerful Hyms and Seraphick
Songs, Celebrate the Admirable Wisdom and the Infinite Goodness of him that
Created it; The Harmony thereof will be so ravishing, and their imploment so
pleasing, that thou thy self wilt jo^ and dance in company, and rejoice and
sing together with them* And as the Situation of Paradise is delightful and
pleasant, so are its Dimension, large and extensive, its Buildings stately and
glorious, and all those varieties wherewith it is beautified and adorned, are
splendid and rich, every where becoming the Majesty and Glory of that Palace,
which is the Royal City and Palace of the Great King. The Metropolis of the
Universe, and the Residence and Seat where the Imperial Majesty of Heaven and
Earth, whose Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, and who extends his Reign
throughout all Generations, keeps his Court, and whlther his happy subjects
repair to behold the Majesty of his Glory, stand before him as his devoted
Servants, and worship and adore the Sovereign of the World, to view and admire
the Wisdom and Righteousness of his Government, the Goodness and Equity of his
Laws, the strange and wonderful methods of his Grace, the admirable continuance
of his works, and the universal care he takes of every Creature, the Infinite
extent of his Providence, the greatness of his Power, and his absolute and
unaccountable Authority whereby he unites those things which were in themselves
at the greatest distances, and dissolves the combinations and confederacys of
those who are enemies to his interest and people, when they are most strongly
and closely united, and renders all the Matchiavillian designs of Rome and
Antichrist, barren and unfruitful, or else makes them prove abortive jnst when
they are ready to bring forth, and the disappointing the devices of the crafty,
and confounding the subtilty of the wise, makes the adversaries of his Church
become the instruments of their own ruin and overthrow. And there likewise his
blessed subjects satiate their Ravished Souls with the delightful and satisfying
views of the Beauty of his Holiness, the brightness and extent of his
Understanding, the riches and the freeness of his Love, Righteousness and
equity of his Justice, the inexhaustibleness of his Goodness and the
Immutability of his Faithfulness and Truth.

Then next to the King himself there sits the Kings Son, the Blessed Redeemer
and the Mediator of the new Covenant, upon a Throne of Glory at the Right hand
of the Father, whose Glorified Body being now in the Meridian of his Glory,
Exaltation and Triumph, is filled with greater light and shines with infinitely
more brightness and splendour then the Sun, when shiningin its strength. And
there the eternal Spirit performs his Divine Operations in the Souls of the
Redeemed more fully and perfectly and constantly, more sensibly and feelingly,
and therefore more Comfortably to them, and with a perpetual constancy that
admits of no intermission, but he is ever enlarging and disposing, fitting and
capacitating their happy souls to drink in those eternal pleasures and
everlasting delights whereinto they are plunged, and wherein they bathe
themselves; And is ever conveying into, and more absolutely then when they
were in their imperfect state, filling them with the joys of the Holy Ghost,
and the peace of God which passes all understanding. Then you have the holy
Angels whose brightness and splendour likewise very much conduces to beautify,
and adorn the place: And there also dwell the Redeemed, every one being placed
upon a Throne of Majesty, with Imperial Crowns on their heads, and Palms in
their hands, shine like the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father, in which
station they ever behold the face of God in Righteousness, and obtain such an
understanding and knowledge of him as perfectly turns them also into the nature
of him that they behold, and transforms them into the likeness of that holy and
pure Being which they eternally delight to be viewing of, and the Reflections
of whose Glory and Goodness does as it were overshadow their inamoured souls,
and by living animates them into the same Disposition with its self. And that
Divine Beauty whereon they everlastingly feed and feast their eyes, imprints
its own form upon their souls, and renders them fair and Beauteous with the
very same lovely Excellencies which they delight to behold in him.

And now methought when I had taken this view of the Caelestial Paradise, I
wished that I might have been permitted to enter into it likewise. But whilst I
was thus wishing with my self, the place began to appear more bright than
before, and the Glory and Splendour of it increased to such a degree, that my
eyes were too weak to behold it, nor could my Mortality longer endure the sight
of its Glory which now so ovewhelmed me, that methoughts I sunk down and
fainted away; Whereupon I awoke, and found my self still grovling on the earth,
in the same wicked and profane, and carnal, hardened and secure World, wherein
I lived before I fell asleep and dreamed this Dream.

FINIS.
