THE PROTESTANT'S Doom in POPISH Times.
Protestants are Her^ticks.
A Prince putting himself, and his Dominions under the Authority of the POPE,
and admitting (as he must unavoidably) the Laws and Decrees of the Romish
Church, all his Protestant Subjects being, by the Judgment and Sentence of that
Church, HERETICS, Distinct. 19. Cap. a Cause. 25 q. 1. Cap. 11.
do forthwith lie under the Penalty which those Laws and Constitutions will
have infl^cted upon Heretics; Heresy Cap. Vegent. de Hereticis.
being the highest degree of High-Treas^n; called therefore by them, Laese
Crimen Maj^statis Divinae: So the English Protestant must be a Trayt^r, and the
worst of Traitors, and exposed to the Penalties of High Treason.

The LAWS and Decrees of the Romish Church against HERETICS.
He^esie Cap. Infam. 6. q. 1. p 297.
is denounced INFAMOUS, and the Heretic must be dealt with as such; which is
many Penalties in one.

1. Forfeit Dignity and Office
First* Whereby they are deprived of all Nobility, Ju^isdiction and Dignity,
and debarred from all Offices, and Public Councils, Parliaments as others;
Being made incapable of choosing, and being chosen: So that it reaches all
sorts Suar. de Fide. disp. 12.. 9. n. 5. l. 2. c. 29.
of Clergy, Layety, Noble and Igno^le: Which is extended to their Children
also. For, they say, The Issue of Traitors, Civil and Spiritual* lose their
Nobility. And all that owe a^y Duty to such Infamous Persons, are discharged
and exempted there from; as Subjects Cap. de Haer.
from their PRINCE, Servants Aazov. Tom. 1. l. 8. c. 12. q 7.
from their MASTERS, Children Cap. 2. Sect. fin. de Haer. in 6.
from their PARENTS; whom they also may lawfully Kill.

Whereby we may see a little, to what Condition the Admission of the PAPAL
Authority wo^ld reduce us, expelling both Nature and Humanity, and making the
dearest Relatives unnatural and barbaro^s to one another: It would leave no
Protestant either Dignity or Authority* either ^ety or Liberty; Nobles are
sentenced to Peasants, and Peasants to Slaves.

Secondly, 2. Goods and Estate.
Another Penalty, to which Heretics are condemned by their Laws, is
CONFISCATION of Goods and Estate; and this they incurr I^s^ jure, and ipso
facto; that is, immediately as soon as they show themselves Heretics, before
any legal Sentence have passed: For which there is an express Decree in the
Canon Law; Cap. cum secundum Legis de Haer. Inno. III. Cap. de Vergentis.
Bona Haeretico^um ipso jure d^scernemus Confis^ata; We decree the Goods of
Heretics to be Confi^cate by Sentence of Law. The Effects of this
Confiscation, wherein they all agree, makes the Severity of the LAW apparent,
^iz. First, All the Profits made of the Estate from the first Day of their
Guilt, is to be V^sq in Suar. disp. 22. S. 4 ^. ^^.
refunded. Secondly, All Alienations S. 1 (...).
by Gif^, Sale, or otherwise, before Sentence, are null and void; and all
Contracts for that purpose, Cap. Vergent. de Haer.
rescinded. Thirdly, Children, Heirs of Heretics, are deprived of their
Portions; yea, though they be Papists.

Whereby it appears, that as soon as the PAPACY is admitted, all Title and
Property is lost and extinct among us: And therefore we must not think that
Pope acted extravagantly, who declared, That all his Maj^sty's Territories were
his own, as forfeited to the H^ly See for the Heresy of Prince and People. Not
only Abbylands lands are in danger, who ever possess them; but all Estates are
forfeited to his Exchequer, and legally Confiscated: All is his own, which
PROTESTANTS, in these Three Nations, have or ever had, if he can but meet with
a Prince so wise, as to help him to catch it; whose process follows them beyond
their grave, and ruins their Children, and Children's Children after them. And
when they have stripped the Heretic of his All, they provide that no other*
shall relieve him; viz. That none shall receive him into their Ho^ses, nor
afford him any Help, nor show him any Favor, nor give him any Counsel. We are
here in England zealous for Property; an^ all the reason in the World we should
so be: But we must bid Adieu to this, when we once come under the Popes
Authority; for as soon as this is admitted. All the Protestants in these
Nations are B^ggers by Law* viz. By the Laws of That Church; which will then be
Ours, divesting us of all Property and Ti^^e to what ever* we count our own.

3. Lives.
Thirdly, Another P^n^lty which their Law inflicts on H^^eticks, is Death, Cap
ad abolendum de Haer. Suar. Dis. 23. Bull. Urb. 4* and Inno. 4.
which is the Sentence of the Canon Law; and which i^ so Absolute, that no
Secular Judge can remit* and which is the Judgm^^^ of all the Doctors. Ita
docent omnes D^ctores: And from which Penalty, neither Emperors no^ Kings
themselves are to be freed or exempt. And the Death they i^fl^ct is Burning
Alive: By B^rning.
N^ Death m^re tolerable. ^r of less e^q^^si^e Torture, will sati^fie the Mercy
of that Church. The Canon says thus; Decernimus ut vivi in conspectu hominum
combu^antur; We decree, That they shall be Burnt Alive, in the Sight of the
World. So our last Popish Successor, Queen Ma^y, pract^sed upon near three
hundred Persons, without regard either to Age, Sex, or Qual^ty: The Scripture
they urge for it, is Job. 15 6. Jac de ^ra decis. l. 2. c. 9. n 2.
If any one abide not in me, Men gather them, and cast them into the Fire, and
they are Burnt.

So that as soon as the PAPAL Authority is admitted among us, all the
Protestants in th^se Nations are dead Men in Law; being under a LAW, that has
Sentence^ us to be Burnt Alive; and under a Power that has Declared it
necessary, that no one of u^ escape with Life.

Fourthly, 4. D^stroy'd by War.
Where legal Penalties cannot take place, b^ reason of opposite Strength, they
hold War necessary, and lawful to chastise Heretics. For which we might give
you diverse Authorities; Bonacina Diana. Castro M^^anus* etc. Car. Allen. ad
mon. to Nobl. and Peop. p. 41.
but let Cardinal Allen, our Country man su^^^e; who asserts it is not only
lawful, but necessary: His Words are these: It is clear (says he) what People
(...) Persons soever be declared to be opposite to GOD's Church, with what
Obligation so^ver* either of Kindred, Friendship, Loyalty, or Subj^ction, I be
bound unto them; I may, or rather must* take up Arms against them: And then
must we tak^ them f^r Heretics, when our lawful Popes ad^udge them so to be.
And which (says Car^inal Pool) is War more Holy than that against ^he Turks.

Fifthly, 5. By M^ssacre.
To destroy them by Massacre^, is sometim^ hel^ more adviceable* than to run
the hazard of War; and which ( they s^^) is both lawful and ^eritorious, for
the rooting our a Pestilent Heresi^ ^n^ the promoting the Roman inte^est. This
^^ta ^oo^ the ^^ish Massacre, that inhumane bloody Butchery* not so much from
the Savageness and Cruelty of ^hei^ N^tures, as the Doctrines and principles
which dire^^ed* and encouraged ^t: As also that of Paris; than which nothing
was more grateful and acceptable to their P^^es, as their Briefs of P G. 13.
and Cl^m. 8.
Bulls make ma^ifest, and the picturing^ it in the Popes Chamber: and for
which, (...) a most Glorious Action, Triumphs were made, and public
Tha^k^givings were returned to GOD. So in Savoy, and elsewhere, both in former
and later Times. And this was that which the late Conspirators aimed at so
fully, intending a Massacre Those that escaped a Massac^e, ^uch 5 J^^. Trial*

Dugdale must be cut off by the Army. And Col. Lr. to the Internuncio.
Coleman tells the Int^rnuncio in his Letter; That their Design prospered so
well, that he doubted not in a little ^ime, their Business would be managed to
the utter Ruin of the P^otestant P^rty: The effecting whereof was so desirable
and meritorious, what if he had a Sea of Blood, and an hundred Lives, he would
lose them all to carry on the Design. And if to effect This. i^ were necessary
to destr^y an hund^ed Heretical Kings, he would do it. Prance 's Nar. p. 4.
Singl^ton the Priest affirmed, Tha^ he would make no more to stab forty
Parliament Men, than to eat his Dinner Gerard and Kelley, to encourage Prance
to kill Sir E. B. G. told him, it was no Murder, no Sin, and that to kill
twenty of them was nothing in that Case; which was both a charitable and
meritorious Act. And Caus^ Ep. p. 189
Grant, one of the Massa^ri^g Gunpowder Tray^o^s said, upon his Execu^ion^ to
one that urged him to Repent of that wicked Enterprise; That ^e was so far from
counting i^ a Sin, that on the ^ontrary, he was confident That tha^ Noble
Design had so much of Merit in i^, as would be abundantly enough to make
Satisfaction for all the Sins of his whole life. Sir Everard D^gby speaking to
the sure purpose also. The provincial, Garnet* did teach the Conspirato^s the
same Catholic Doctrine; viz That the King, Nobility, Clergy, and whole
Communalty of the Realm of England (P^p^sts exc^pted) were Heretics; and, That
all Heretics were Accu^sed and Ex^ommunicated: and* That no Heretic could be
a King: but that it was lawful and m^ri^orious to K^ll him* and all other
Heretics within thy Realm of England, for the Advancement and ^nlargement of
the Au^h^rity an^ Jurisdiction of the Pope* and for t^^ Restoring of the Romish
Relig^on. T^is was that Garnet whom the P^pists here honored as a Pope, and
kissed his Feet, and reverenced his Judgment as an Oracle; and since his death
given him the Honor of Saintship and Martyrdom ^ Jes. Trial p. 25. 1. The
Popish Prince cannot, help, if he would. Oaths and Promises insignificant.
Dugdale des^sed, That after they had dispattched the King, a Massacre was to
follow.

But surely, it may be supposed, that the Temper of such a Prince, or his
Interest, would oblige him to forbid or restrain such violent Executions in
England: I, but what if his Temper be to comply with such Courses? Or if his
Temper be better? What if it be Over ru^d? What if he be perswade^ as other
Catholics are, that ^e must in Conscience proceed thus? What if he cannot do
otherwise, without hazard of his Crown and Life? For he is not to hold the
Reins of Government alone, he will not be allowed to be much more than the
Po^es POS^^LION; and must look to be ^nmounted, if he Act nor according to
Order. The Law Ca^^ Offic^^.
tells us, That it is ^o^ in the power of any Civil Magistrate, ^^r (...)
Penalty, or abate the Rigor of the Law. Nay, if the Prince should plight has
Faith by O^th, that he would not suffer their Bloody LAWS to be executed upon
his Dissenting Sbjects, this would signify not^ing: For they would soon tell
him, That Bonncina de prim. prac. Disp. 3. q*2.
Contracts made against the Canon Law are invalid, though confirmed by Oath;
And, That he is not bound to stand to his promi^e, though he had Sworn to it:
And, That Faith is no mo^e to be kept with Heretics, than the Council of
Constance would have it. So th^^ P^otestants are to be Burnt, as Jo. Huss, and
Jerome ^f Prague were by that Council, though the Emperor had given them his
safe Conduct in that Solemn manner, which could secure them only (as they said)
from the Civil, but not Church-process, which was the greatest. For it is their
General Rule, That Faith is either not to be given or not kept with H^reticks.
Therefore says Simanca, That Faith engaged to Heretics, tho confirmed by
Oath, is in no wise to be performed: For says he, If Faith is not to be kept
with Tyrants and Pirates, and others who kill the Body, much less with
Heretics who kill the Souls; And that the O^th in savor of them, is but
Vniculum Iniquita^is. A Bond of Iniquity. T^ough P^pish Princes the better to
promote their interests, and to ensnare their Protestant Subjects, to get
advantage upon them, to their Ruin, have made large promises, and plight^d
their Faiths to them, when they did not intend to keep it. As the Emperor to
John Huss and Jerome; Charles the Ninth of France to his Protestant Subjects
before the Massacre; the Duke of Savoy to his Protestant Subjects, before their
designed Ruin; and Qu. Mary, before her burning of them. But if there were
neither Law nor Conscience to hinder, yet in point of Interest he must not show
f^^our to Heretics, without app^rent hazard, both Person's Philop. p. 109.
of Crown and Life, for he forfeits both if he does. The Pope every Year does
not only Curse Heretics, but every favourer of them, from which none but
himself can ab^olve. Beca^. Cont. Aug. ^. 131, 132. In Fowlis. p. 60.
Becanus very elegantly tells us, If a Prince be a dull Cur, and fly not upon
Heretics, he is to be beaten out, and a kee^er D^g must be got in his stead.
Henry the Third, and Henry the 4th, were both Assassinated upon this account,
and because they were suspected to favor Heretics. And are we not told by the
Discoverers Ores's N^r. p 4. N. 5 etc.
of the Popish Plot, That after they had dispatched the King, they would depose
his Brother also, that was to succeed him, if he did not answer their
Expectations, for rooting out the Protestant Religion.

2 Parliaments cannot prevent Ruin to Protestants.
But may not Parliaments secure us by Laws and provisions restraining the power
which endan^er us? Not possible, if once they secure and settle the Throne for
Popery: For, First, They can avoid Parliaments as long as they please, and a
Government that is more Arbitrary and V^olent, is more agreeable to their
designs and principles: It being apparent, that the English Papist have lost
the Spirit of their Ancestors, who so well asserted the English Liberties,
being so generally now six'd for the Popes Universal Monarchy, Sacrificing all
to that Roman moloch; being much more his Subje^ts than the Kings: and though
Natives by Birth, yet are Foreigners as to Government, Principle, Interest,
Affection and Design; and therefore no Friends to Parliaments, as our
Experience has tol^ us.

1. They may be avoided.
But Secondly, If their Necessity should require a Parliament, ther^ is no
question but they may get such a one as will serve their turns. For so have
every of our f^rmer Princes in all the changes of Religion, that have been
amongst us: As Henry the VIII. when he was both for and against Popery, Edward
the VI. when he was wholly Protestant, Qu. Mary, when she was for Burning
Alive, and Qu. Elizabeth when she ran so counter to her Sister. And the reason
is clear that he who has the making of the public officers and the Keys of
preferment and profit, 2. May be made to serve a Popish, not a Protestant
Interest.
influenceth and swayeth Elections and Votes as he pleases. And by how much
the Throne comes to be fixed in Popery, the Protestants must expect to be
excluded from both Houses, as they have excluded the Papists: For as Heretics
and Traitors, they, as Ignominous Persons, etc. you have heard, forfeit all
Right either to choose, or be chosen in any public Council: And then all Laws,
which have been made for the Protestants, and against the Popish Religion, will
be null and void, as being enacted by an Incompetent Authority, as being the
acts of Heretics, Kings, Lords and Commons, who had forfeited all their rights
and privileges.

But Thirdly, 3. Good Laws insignificant.
Suppose our Laws were valid, as enacted by competent Authority, and such good
and wholesome provisions, as were those Statutes made by our Popish Ancesto^s, in
those Statutes of proviso^s in Enward the I. and Edward the III Time; and that
of p^aemunire in Richard the II. and Henry the IV. for Relief against Papal In
roachments and Oppressions: Yet being against the Laws and Canons of Holy
Church; the Sovereign Authority, they will be all superseded: For so they
determine, That when the Canon and the civil Laws cl^sh, one requiring what the
other allows not, the Church-law must have the observance an^ that of the State
neglected: And Constitution^ ( they say) made against the Canon^ and Decrees of
the Roman Bishops are of no moment: Their best Authors are possitive in ^t. And
o^r own Experience and Histories ^estifie the truth thereof: For how were those
good Laws beforementioned, defeated by the Popes authority, so that there was
no effectual Execution thereof till Henry the VIII. time, as Dr. Burnet Hist.
Ref p. 110.
tells us? And how have the good Laws, to suppress and prevent Popery, been
very match obstructed in their Exe^ution, by POPISH I^fluence?

THE END.
