A NEW SONG, BEING THE TORIES Imploration FOR Protection against the Whiggs.
To an Excellent New Scotch Tune.
I.
DEfend us from all Popish Plots,
That so the People fray;
And eke from treacherous Whiggs and Scots,
As bad or worse than They.
From Parliaments, Long Rumps, and Tails,
From House of Commons Furies;
Defend us eke from Protestant Flails,
And Ignoramus Juries!
II.
Protect us now and evermore,
From a White Sheet and Proctor,
And from that Noble Peer, brought over
The Salamanca Doctor:
A Doctor with a Witness, sure,
Both in his Rise and Fall;
His Exit almost as obscure,
As his Original!
III.
Designs and Dangers far remove
From this Distressed Nation,
And Damn the Traiterous Medal off,
Bold Tony's 'Sociation.
And may the Prick-ear'd Party, that
Have Coin enough in Cupboard,
Forbear to shiver an Estate,
And Splinters mount for Hobbart!
IV.
From sixteen Self-conceited Peers,
Protect our Sovereign still;
And from the Damned Petitioners
For the Exclusive Bill.
Our King Defend, and make Him great,
Against Tony upon Tony;
And from a House of Commons, that
Will give the King no Money!
V.
From those that did Design and Laugh
At Tangier, in Distress,
And were Mahometans worse by half,
Than all the Moors of Fez
From such as with Usurping Hand,
Drive Princes to Extremes;
Confound all their Devices, and
Deliver Charles and James!
VI.
May they be Wise, and soon expel
The Old Fox, the Old Fawning Elf;
The Time draws nigh, Achitophel
Shall Not need to Hang himself.
Impartial Juries for his sake,
Brave North and Box may bring;
And make his Nose through Nooze to sneak,
For Treason against his King.
London, Printed for J. D. in the Year 1682.
