AN APPENDIX, TO Mr. PERKINS his Six Principles of Christian Religion.
Unto the former Principles published by that Reverend man Mr. William Perkins,
fully containing what every Christian is ^^ believe touching God and himself,
I have thought it fit for the good, especially of those over whom I am set,
(the younger sort of whom I have formerly catechized in private according to
the same Principles) to annex a few other, touching the more solemn fellowship
of Christians, the Church of God; as being a divine institution, the spiritual
Paradijse, and Temple of the living God; in Rev. 1. 7. 2. Cor. 6. 1(...) Romans
9. 4. Math. 1^. 2.Cor. 6.
which his most solemn Services are to be performed: and to which he adds
daily such as shall be saved: promising to dwell in the midst of them by his
most powerful and gracious presence.

Question.

WHat is the Church?

A. A company of faithful and holy people (with their seed) called by the word
of God into public covenant with Christ, and amongst themselves for mutual
fellowship in the use of all the means of Gods glory and their salvation.

Q. Of what sort or number of people must this company consist?

A. It is all one whether they be high or low, few or many, so as they exceed
not such ^al. 3. 28. Math. 28. 17. 19. 1. Cor. 11. 17. 18. 20. and 14. 23. Act.
10. 7.
a number, as may ordinarily meet together in one place for the worshipping of
God, and sanctification of the Lords day.

Q. What are the reasons why the Church must consist of faithful and holy
persons?

A. 1. The Levit. 20. 16. Romans 1. 7. 8. 1. Cor. 1. 2. Phil. 1. 1. 10. verse. 9.
Scriptures every where so teach.

2 The Ephesians. 1. 22. Col. 1. 13.
Church is the body of Christ, all whose members therefore should be
conformable in some measure to him their head.

3 Only such worshippers please God, and are accepted of him, Ioh. 4. 25.
Prove. 15. 5, Hob. 8. 8. 10. etc.
and have right to the covenant of grace, and seals thereof.

Q. But are not hypocrites mingled with the faithful in the Church?

A. None ought to be by the word of God: and where such are, they are not truly
added by the Lord to the Church, but do Judge ver. 2. Ezekiel. 44. 7.
creep in through their own hypocrisy, and not without the Churches sin
also, if they may be discerned to be such. Math. 28. 15 Act. 1. 14. etc cap.
11. 19. 21 Romans 1. 5. 1. Cor. 15. 1. Act. 1. 41. 47 cap. 8. 37. and 18.


Q. By what means is the Church gathered?

A. By the word preached, and by faith received of them that hear it.

Q. Is every believer a member of the visible Church?

A No: but he must also by his personal and public profession adioyne
himself to some particular fellowship and society of Saints.

Q. How prove you the seed of the faithful to be of the Church with them?

A. By the covenant which God made Genesis 17. 7. etc Gal. ^. 8. 16. 17 Romans 4. 11.
with Abraham and his seed: which was the covenant of the Gospel, and
confirmed in Christ, the seal there of circumcision, being the seal of the
righteousness of says.

Q. What are the essential marks of the Church?

A. Faith and Order, as the Church in Col. 2. 5. 6.
them may be seen and beheld to walk in Christ Jesus whom she has received:
Faith professed in word and deed, showing the matter to be true: and Order in
the holy things of God, showing the form to be true, which are the two
essential parts of the Church.

Q. Are not the preaching of the word, and administering of the Sacraments
certain marks of the Church?

A. No: for the word may (and that rightly) be preached to assemblies of
unbeleevers Math. 18. 19. Act. 14. 7. 14. 1^ 17. 22. etc.
for their conversion: as may the sacraments also (though uniustly) be
administered unto them, and so be made lying signs. Besides the true Church may
for a time want the use Genesis 34. 24. 1. King. 17. 25. ctc. Hol. 1. 9.
of diverse ordinances of God, but has always right unto them: as may also the
false Church usurp and abuse them, but without right.

Q. What are the means in and by which Christ and the Church have fellowship
together?

A. 1. In the gifts of the Spirit of Christ. 1. Cor. 12. 3. 4. 5. 6.
2, In the Offices of Ministry given to the church. 3. In the Works done in
and by those gifts and Offices.

Q. Wherein stands this communion of the Spirit?

A. In the in dwelling and operation of the gifts and graces thereof conveyed
from Christ Ephesians. 2. 22. and cap. 4. 15. 19.
as the head, unto the Church as his body, and members one of another: Whence
arises that most straight and divine conjunction, by which as by the civil
bond of marriage, the man and wife are one flesh: so they who are thus iojned 1.
Cor. 6. 17
to Christ are one spirit.

Q. How many are the offices of ministry in the Church?

A. Five besides the extraordinary offices of Apostles, Prophets, and
Evangelists, for the first planting of the Churches, which are ceased, with
their extraordinary gifts.

Q. How is that proved?

A. Partly by the Scriptures, which both mention them expressly, and describe
them by their principal gifts and works: and partly by reason, agreeable to
the Scriptures,

Q. Show me which those officers be, with their answerable gifts and works.

A. 1. The Pastor, to whom is given the spirit of wisdom for exhortation, 2.
The Ephesians. 4. 11. 1. Cor. 12. 8. Romans 12. 8. 1. Tim. 5. 2 6. 1. Tim, 3. ^ and
cap. 1. 10 Romans 16. 1.
Teacher to whom is given the gift of knowledge for doctrine. 3. The governing
Elder, who is to rule with diligence. 4. The Deacon, who is to administer the
holy treasure with simplicie. 5. The Widow, or Deaconnesse, who is to attend
the sick and impotent, with compassion and cheerfulness.

Q. What is the reason for the proving of these ministeries?

A. Because all these are necessary, and these alone sufficient for the Church:
as being the most perfect society and body of Christ, which neither fails
in that which is necessary, nor exceeds in any thing superfluous.

Q. Whence arises the necessity and sufficiency of these ministeries in the
Church?

A, From the condition partly of the souls. and partly of the bodies of the
members.

Q. How does that appear?

A: 1: In the soul is the faculty of understanding, about which the Teacher
is to be exercised for information, by doctrine. 2. The will and affections,
upon which the Pastor is especially to work by exhortation and comfort. 3. For
that doctrine and exhortation without obedience, are unprofitable, the
diligence of the ruling Elder is requisite for that purpose.

Q How are the other two Ministeries to be excised?

A. As the Church consists of men, and they of souls and bodies, so are the
Deacons our of the Churches treasure and contribution to provide for the common
uses of the Church, relief of the poor, and maintenance of the officers: as
are the widows to afford unto the sick and impotent in body (not able
otherwise to help themselves) their cheerful and comfortable service.

Q. Wherefore call you those offices by the name of Ministeries, or Services?

A. For two causes: 1. For that they are no Lordships, but mere services of
Christ, and Math. 20. 25. 26. 27. 2. Cor. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 4. 1. and cap. 3. 21.
22. 23.
of the Church.

2. Because they consist in administering only of those things which are
Christ's, and the Churches under him.

Q. By whom are these Officers to have their outward calling?

A. By the Church whereof they are members for the present, and to which they
are to administer.

Q. How does that appear?

A. 1. The apostles who taught only Christ's Commandments, so directed the
Act. 1. 15. 23. and cap. 6. 1. ^. 3. 5. and cap. 14. 23. Act. 1. 11. and 6. 3.
1. Tim. 3. 2. 3. 4. 5.
Churches.

2, The people amongst whom they have been conversant can best judge of their
fitness, both in respect of their persons and families.

3. It furthereth much the diligence and faithfulness of the Minister, that they
whose Minister he is, have freely chosen him as unto whom under Christ, they
commit the most precious treasure of their soul: as also it binds the people
to greater love and conscience of obedience of him and his ministry, whom
themselves have made choice of.

4 The Church being a most free Corporation spiritual under Christ the Lord,
is in all reason and equity to choose her ministers and servants under him, unto
whom also she is to 1. Tim. 5. 17. ^
give wages for their service and labor.

Q. Is this outward calling of simple necessity for a true Church officer?

A. Yea, as for the magistrate in the city Heb. 5. 4. 5.
and common wealth, or steward in the family: without which they usurp their
places, how excellent soever, whether in their gifts, or works.

Q. What is the officer be found unfaithful in his place?

A. He is by the Church to be warned to take heed to his ministry he has
received, Col. 4. 17.
to fulfill it; which if he neglect to do, by the same power which set him
up, he is to be put down and deposed.

Q. What are the outward works of the Churches communion with Christ?

A. These six: 1. Prayer 2. the reading and opening of the Word. 3. the
Sacraments, 4. singing of Psalms. 5. Censures. 6. Contribution to the
necessity of the Saints.

Q. Wherefore put you prayer in the first place?

A. Because by it all the rest are sanctified 1. Tim. 2. 1.
to the faithful. For prayer see the end of the fifth Principle, with the
exposition: only add this, that in the act of our speaking unto God by
prayer, we are not to use the help of any book, beads, crucifixes, or the
like, to Jude verse 10. Zach. 12. 10. Romans 8. 15. 16.
reach or provoke us, but only the help of the spirit of adoption, and
prayer, working in our hearts effectually, and teaching us both what and how to
pray as we ought.

Q. What believe you touching the word?

A. Besides the things observed in the fifth Principle and Exposition: that the
whole written Word, and it alone is to be read and opened in the Church.

Q. Wherefore are the whole Scriptures to be read and opened?

A. Because the whole Word of God is Prove. 30. 5. Romans 15. 4. 2 Timothy 3. 16.
Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Rev. 21. 19.
pure, written for our learning and comfort, given by divine inspiration, and
is profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction and instruction, and from
which nothing may be diminished.

Q. How prove you that the Scriptures, only are to be read, and opened in the
Church?

A. Because they alone are sufficient for faith, and the obedience which is of
faith, and Romans 16. 17. Heb. 11. 6. Ioh. 10. 31. 2 Timothy 3. 16. 17. Prove. 30. 6.
Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Rev. 11. 19.
able to make the man of God perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works,
and unto which nothing may be added.

Q. Who are to open and apply the Scriptures in the Church?

A. Principally the Bishops or Elders, who by the Word of life are to feed the
flock, both in teaching and government. Secondly such as are out of office,
in the exercise of Act. 10. 28.
Prophecy.

Q. How is that exercise proved in the Scriptures?

A. By Luke 1. 4. 1. 47. and cap. 17. 18. Act. 8. 4. and 11. 19. 10. 2 cap. 13.
14. 1 and cap. 18. 1 26.
examples in the Jewish Church, where men though in no office, either in Temple
or Synagogue, had libertly publicly to use their gifts.

2 Luke 9. 1. cap: 10. 1. Romans 12. 9. 1. Pet. 4. 10. 1. Cor. 14. 1
By the Commandment of Christ and his Apostles.

3. By the prohibiting of 1. ^ Tim. 2. 1. Cor. 14. 3 1 1. Pet. 4. 1^ 1 Thessalonians.
5. 1 1. Tim. 3. 2. 1. Cor. 14. 3 Act. 2. 42. Luke 4. 22. 1
women (not extraordinarily inspired) to teach in the church, herein liberty
being given unto men their husbands, or others.

4. By the excellent ends, which by this means are to be obtained: as 1. The
glory of God in the manifestation of his manifold graces. 2. That the gifts of
the spirit in men be not quenched. 3. For the fitting and trial of men for the
Ministry, 4. For the preserving pure of the doctrine of the Church, which is
more endangered, if some one or two alone may only be heard, and speak. 5.
For debaring and satisfying of doubts, if any do arise. 6. For the edifying of
the Church, and conversion of others.

Q. Who is a Prophet in this sense?

A. He that has a gift of the spirit to speak unto edification, exhortation
and comfort.

Q. What is the order of this exercise.

A. That it be performed after the public Ministry by the teachers, and under
their direction and moderation: whose duty it is, if any thing be obscure to
open it: if doubtful to clear it: if unsound to refute it: if unperfect to
supply what is wanting, as they 1. Cor. 14. 4. 24. 25. 1. Cor. 14. 3. Act. 13.
15.
are able.

Q. What believe you touching the Sacraments further then is observed in the
former Principles?

A. That they are to be dispensed according to the tenure of the covenant of
grace, whereof they are seals: in respect both of the persons to whom, and of
the ends for which they are to be administered.

Q. Which are those persons?

A. The faithful and their seed.

Q.May all the faithful partake in the Sacraments?

A. No, except they be also added to some particular Congregation, unto which
the Genesis 17. 1. Cor. 7. 14. Act. 2. 41. 42. 47.
public ordinances and ministry does appertain.

Q. Which are the ends and uses of the Sacraments?

A. The first is from God to the Church, opened in the exposition of the fifth
Principle, where it is showed what a Sacrament is. The second is from the
Church to God, in which it testifies the acceptance of Genesis 17. 9. 10.
the Covenant, and binds it self to the performance of the conditions. The
third is in respect of the members themselves mutually, 2. Cor. 12. 13. Judge.
14. 4.
as being badges of their association. The fourth in respect of all other
assemblies, between whom and the Churches, they are notes of distinction.

Q. What is required touching singing of Psalms in the Church?

A. That they be such as are parts of the Mat. 26. 30. Ephesians. 5. 19. Col. 3. 16.
word of God, formed by the holy Ghost into Psalms or Songs, which many may
conveniently sing together, exhorting and admonishing themselves mutually with
grace in their heart.

Q. What believe you touching the censure of excommunication?

A, That it is to be used by every particular Church, according to the rules of
Christ.

Q.How prove you this power to be in every particular Congregation?

A, 1. By the donation and gift of Christ Math. 18. 19. 11 19. 1. Cor. 5.
the Lord. 2. The particular Church of Corinth had this power, for the neglect
whereof it is reproved by the Apostle. 3. Every particular Church has right to
the Word Sacraments, and prayer, within it self, which are greater, and
therefore to this which is lesser then they.

Q. What are the rules of Christ for excommunication?

A, 1. The sin thus to be censured must be scandalous, and the person obstinate
after due conviction, and patience used.

2 The Church excommunicating must be Math. 18. 14. 1. Cor. 4. 11. Math. 18.
15. 17. 19. 1. Cor. 5. 4. 5. 1
that particular congregation gathered together in the name of Christ, whereof
the sinner is a member.

Q. How prove you that by the Church Math. 18. is not meant the Bishop, or
presbytery representing the body?

A 1. One man cannot be a Church, which as Christ teaches, verse 19, 20, must
be a company, how small soever, gathered together in his Name.

2, The word there used, never signifies in the Scriptures, an officer or
officers, excluding the people.

3. The Apostle 1 Cor. 5. expounds Christ's meaning to be of the whole body
come together.

4. The Elders being public officers, are to exercise the solemn works of
their office; and particularly the work of rebuking them that sin, openly
and before the Church, both that others may fear, and the Church of Faith
consent to the excommunication: and therefore cannot represent the Church 1 Timothy 5. 20.
being actually present.

5. A representative Church in a case of Faith and conscience without the
consent of the represented in the particular decree, establishes the popish
doctrine of implicit Faith.

Q. What is the order of proceeding in this Censure?

A. That a brother offending privately be admonished privately, and after
(without his repentance) with a witness or two, who may give testimony both of
the offense and admonition: and lastly, that by the brother admonishing, with
his witnesses, the sinner (remaining obstinate,) complaint be made to the
Church: which last complaint alone is sufficient in public offenses.

Q. What order is to be observed after complaint thus made?

A. The officers as the governors of the Church, are by the Scriptures
clearly to convince, and seriously to admonish and exhort the offender: and
upon his impenitency (with due conviction and patience) to decree against him
the sentence of Excommunication: and lastly, with the peoples free consent, to
pronounce and execute the same.

Q. How appears the necessity of this ordination?

A. Many ways. 1. By the commandment Math. 18. 1. Cor. 5. Romans 1. 24.
of Christ, and practice of the Apostolical Churches.

2. For the glory of Christ, which is much impeached by the profaneness of
those who profess his service.

3. For the humbling of the sinner, and for the salvation of his Soul.

4 To prevent the infection of others.

5. That by zeal and holiness of the 1. Cor. 5. 1.
Church they without may be gained to the Gospel. Heb. 11. 15.


Q. How is the Church to walk toward a person excommunicated?

A. So as they may make him ashamed by withdrawing from him in all spiritual
Communion, 1 Cor. 5. 11.
and civil familiarity also, so far as may be, without the violation of any
natural or civil bond.

Q. What is to be observed for the Churches contribution.

A. That in their public meeting they contribute, as God has prospered them
to 1 Cor. 11. 6.
the public treasury, by the Deacons to be received and distributed, as there
is need to the relief of the poor, maintenance of the Ministry, and other
necessary uses of the Church, first, and after of others also, as need Act. 5.
Gal. 6. 10.
requires,

And whosoever will walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Galath. 6. 16.

Amen.
