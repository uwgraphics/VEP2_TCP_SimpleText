PROPOSITIONS extracted from the REASONS for the Foundation and Promotion of a
Philadelphian Society: Which were read at the First Meeting of the same in
Westmorland-House, London.
Offered to the Consideration of All Christians.
TO all the Faithful in Christ Jesus, wherever Dispersed or Hidden, Grace be
unto you: and Peace, Love, and Truth from God our Father, and from the Lord
Jesus. Whom we thank that, for the Glory of his Name, we have been thought by
him worthy to suffer Reproach: and to bear a Testimony for him before this
Generation, concerning the Blessed Hope of his Appearance, to prepare unto
himself a Peculiar People, through his Spirit, which may be made like to his
glorious Image, in full Sanctification, according to his Will. Who has
designed to fulfill his Work in you Throughout, that ye may not fall short of
the most Excellent Prize of the First Resurrection: and to revive amidst you
the Apostolical Frame of his Church, and amidst as many as shall not put it far
from them. This is that which has occasioned Satan, who is always the Accuser
of the Brethren, to rage mightily: and to raise many False and Malicious
Reports, that so the Truth might not be seen in the Mist. Wherefore we have
been obliged to Publish these following Propositions, not so much for the
Vindication of our selves, as of the Honor of God, and of the Truth of the
Holy Scriptures.

I. The Church, or Bride of Christ, is to be made conformable to Christ
throughout, Romans 8, 29-12.2. Phil. 3.10.-3.21. 1 John 3.1, 2, 3. II. This
Conformity is the Adornment of the Lamb's Bride, who is now called to make her
self Ready, Isa. 61.10, 11. Rev. 21.2. III. This Preparation and Adornation
cannot be any otherwise, but by the Holy Spirit of God, John 4.24. Romans 8.11,
Gal. 4.6. Isa. 44.3. Joel 2.28. Zach. 4.6. IV. This Spirit is One: and thence
the Church must be also but One. Herein consists the true Undivided Unity, and
Perfect Uniformity, Cant. 6.9. Ephesians. 4.3, 4. 1 Cor. 6.17. Ephesians. 4.13. Phil.
1.27.-2.2. V. This Spirit is Holy: and thence the Church must be also Holy.
Herein consists the Virgin Sanctity of all the Members of this Church, that is
to be Redeemed out of the Earth, Cant. 4.1, 7. Romans 11.16. Ephesians. 1.4.-5.2, 7.
Col. 1.22. 1 Pet. 2.5. Rev. 14.4.-20.6. VI. This Spirit is Catholic: and
thence the Church must be also Catholic; according to the most strict sense of
the Word, in an universal Latitude of Love, without any Narrowness, Partiality,
or Particularity of Spirit, Genesis 1.2.-6.3. Joel 2.28. John 4.2^-25. Luke 10,
30-38. Acts 10, 11-16. 2 Cor. 2.10. VII. This One, Holy, and Catholic Church
is not barely Assisted by an Irradiation from the Spirit of Christ, but is
Actually and Vitally Informed by it, as the Body is by the Soul, Rev.
^^.-11.11.-21, 6.-22, 14. Romans 8.6, 10. 2 Cor. 3, 6.-4.10, 11.-5.4. Ephesians. 4.18.
Gal. 2.20. Col. 3.3, 4. Heb. 7.16. VIII. This Vital Operation, and Information
being at present but in a very languid and faint Degree, there must be a
Resuscitation and Resurrection of the same, in order to the Glorious Kingdom of
Christ, Luke 18.8. Rev. 20.5, 6. Acts 15.16, 17. Ezekiel. 37.1-15. Rev. 11.1-12.
IX. The Resuscitation of this Spirit is to be Waited for, 1 Cor. 12.31. Isa.
40.31.-30. 18.-49, 23. Romans 2, 3. Mark 13.33. Rev. 3.3.-16, 15. Ephesians. 6.18.
compared with verse. 13. X. It is to be Waited for not only Seperately, but also
Jointly, Acts 1.14.-2.1, 46. XI. Such a Waiting is in obedience to our dear
Lord and Master's Command, John 14.16. Mat. 25.13. Mark 13.37. Mat. 18.20.
[This is also Confirmed from the Practice of Christ and his Apostles: and that
too, while they did not Recede from the Public Temple-Worship.] XII. It must
be with these Qualifications; 1. Humility. 2. Resignation. 3. Perseverance.
(1.) Ja. 4.10. Rev. 3.17, 18. (2.) Romans 8.27. Col. 1.9. (3.) Mat. 10.22-24.
Heb. 6.14. Rev. 2.26. XIII. It must be for these ends, (1st) Power from on
High. (2dly) Wisdom from Above. (3dly) Divine Learning and Theosophy. (1) Luke
24.49. 1 Cor. 5.4. 2 Timothy 1.7. (2) Luke 21.15. Col. 2.3.-4.5. 1 Cor. 12.8. (3)
Ephesians. 3.4. Phil. 3.8. 2 Pet. 3.18. XIV. It is lawful to Wait upon God for
Power from on High, or the Return of the Miraculous Deeds, by which his
Kingdom, that has been hitherto withheld, may come to be witnessed and
proclaimed, Luke 24.49. XV. It is lawful to Wait and Pray for the Spirit of
Wisdom and Revelation, descending from the Throne of God, Ja. 1.5. Col.
1.9.-3.16. XVI. This is necessarily required in order to a right Government in
all Spiritual Affairs, Acts 6.3. 2 Timothy 3.15. Isa. 28 26. to the end. XVII. It
is lawful to Wait and Pray for Divine Learning, and to prefer it above that
which is Human, Phil. 1.9. Hab. 2.14. Isa. 28.9. XVIII. This Secret Learning
vastly exceeds the Wit and Industry of the most sagacious Inquirers, Job 28.7.
1 Cor. 2.11. Psalm. 25.12. XIX. It shall be given of the Lord to all the Members
of this Church, Jer. 31.34. Heb. 8.11. Isa. 4, 5. Ephesians. 4.13. XX. God is
stirring up some Persons in several Countries, to Wait in Faith and Prayer for
these Ends, and with these Qualifications, till such a Pure Church may arise.

[ Germany, Holland, Switzerland, France, Scotland and England are Witnesses to
the Truth of this Proposition.]

XXI. To which a Prospect of the Present State of Christendom has very much
conduced, Mat. 24. Mark 13. Luke 17. John 15.16, 17. Dan. 7.8. and most of the
Prophets. XXII. The many Divisions and Sects of Christianity, all pretending to
be the True Church, can not be otherwise cured but by the Effusion of the
Spirit, Lam. 2.13. Jeremiah 30.17.-33.6. Ezekiel 11.19. Zeph. 3.9. XXIII. The
Insufficiency of a^ other Means and Methods have been hitherto experimentally
Proved.

1. Of Human Learning. 2. Of Policy. 3. Of Power.
Particular Proofs hereof are frequently extant in History, both Ecclesiastical
and Civil.

XXV. Neither of which seperately, or all conjunctly, is able to heal the
Divisions, supply the Imperfections, or remove the Corruptions of any one Body
of Christians. As, 1. In the Church of Rome. 2. In the Lutheran Church. 3. In
the Calvinistick Reformation. 4. The Church of England. XXVI. The Consideration
of the Insufficiency of all Human Means, with a deep Sense that Charity is
waxen cold, and that Faith is hardly to be found, must needs be a good Motive
to excite us to seek out and wait upon those Means, which are Sufficient; and
especially to endeavor to keep warm the Former, and to strengthen the Latter,
which is ready to dye, Gal. 1.16. Zach. 2.13-4.6. Dan. 2.34, 45. XXVII. These
Means are not Confined to a Party, but are extended to All; even as far as the
Holy Catholic Spirit reaches, which passes and goes through all things: And
by the Effusion of this Spirit, All shall be taught of God, Isa. 54.13. John
6.45. XXVIII. The Oneness, the Holiness, and the Catholickness or Universality
of this Spirit, will not suffer us to Appropriate it to Any, and therefore not
to our own Society, both With respect to Ordinary and Extraordinary Operations
of the same, Gal. 3.26, 27, 28. Col. 3.11. Romans 10.12. 1 Cor. 12.13. XXIX. The
Design of our Assembling is not to In Pursuance of this Proposition, it has
been our Custom to advise Persons, when Interrogated, to Keep still in the Bond
of Peace in the Visible Unity of the Church: And even our Assemblies have been
very far from being Grounded on Sectarian Principles, as we are able to
Demonstrate.
Divide, but to Unite; not to set up for a New Religion, or Church, but to keep
Warm the Spirit of Love toward those of all Religions and Churches, and to
endeavor after the only Method of Reconciling them into a perfect and lasting
Unity, by the Power of the Holy Ghost, Isa. 58.12. XXX. Catholic Love, and
Apostolical Faith, are the two Grand Pillars of our Society: and the main
Designs, which we labor, Watch and Pray for, both seperately by our selves,
and jointly in our Assemblies, 1 Timothy 1.14. 2 Timothy 1.13. Ephesians. 6.23. Gal. 5.6. 1
These. 5.8. XXXI. The Primary Object of the Apostolical Faith, is the Revelation
of the Kingdom of God within the Soul, Luke 17.21. 1 Cor. 4.20. Col. 1.13.
XXXII. This Internal Revelation of it is by Christ the Sovereign Head of the
Church, 1 Cor. 12.5, 12, 27, 28. Heb. 1.2. XXXIII. Which as it is diligently to
be waited upon, so is it to be held fast, so far as it shall be received; a
Loss herein or Relapse, being extremely dangerous, 2 Timothy 2.13.14. Heb.
3.6.-4.14.-10.23. Rev. 2.4, 5, 11, 13, 25-3.2, 11. XXXIV. Such a Revelation of
the Kingdom of God in the Soul, will constitute a Virgin Church, representative
of its Head in, 1. in Christ-like Holiness, 2. Truth. 3. Power. (1) Rev. 3.7.
Lev. 11.44. Joel 3.17. Obad. ver. 17. 1 Pet. 2.3. Rev. 20 6. (2) Phil. 4.8. 1
John 5 20. 3 John ver. 3. (3) Acts 8.10. 1 Cor. 1.24. 2 These. 1.17. XXXV. The
Members of this Church are to be Anointed with Christ, and Consecrated, 1. into
the Priestly Order; 2. into the Prophetical; 3. into the Royal and Davidical.
(1) 1 Pet. 2.9. Rev. 1.6.5.10.-20, 6. (2) 1 Cor. 14.31. Rev. 11.10.-18.20. (3)
1 Cor. 4.8. Rev. 5.10.-20.6. Zach. 12.8. XXXVI. The Model thereof we do press
after as Attainable, and do not therefore rest in what we have attained, Phil.
3.12, 13, 14. XXXVII. The Perfection of this Model must be Gradual, and the
Beginnings therefore of it consistent with a State of Weakness and
Imperfection, Heb. 6.1, 2. Acts 20.32. Jude ver. 20. XXXVIII. The Personal
Appearance of Christ from Heaven is not to be, till after there be such a
Philadelphian Church on Earth to receive him, Rev. 3.11. compared with 22.7,
17. XXXIX. Our Design is Apostolical; abating only from what was of a Temporary
Constitution, or fitted to such a Particular Church, Acts 1.26.-4, 34,
35.-15.13, to 30. 1 Cor. 7.25. XL. The Will of God must be done in Earth, as in
Heaven, by the Inspiration of his Spirit, Matthew. 6.10. Heb. 10.7. XLI. The
Kingdom of God must come on Earth, as it is in Heaven, by Virtue of the same
Inspirati Dan. 2.44.-7, 27. XLII. We receive the Holy Scriptures of the Old and
New Testament as the Foundation of our Hope and Faith, 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet.
1.19. XLIII. There are some Promises and Prophesies in them, which have not had
yet their Full Completion, Rev. 17.17. Luke 22.16. XLIV. The Civil Government
is an Ordinance of God, as he is Supreme Governor of the World, and is
accordingly to be submitted to, Romans 13.1. 1 Timothy 2.2.
There was written An Essay of Revelation in the Year 1695. by a Member of Our
Society, for the Resolving of this Question, Whether Revelation, or the
Immediate Communication of Divine Knowledge, be Now Attainable? In which the
Possibility, Expediency, and Necessity of Revelation, both Private and Public,
in this Present, and Approaching, Period of the Church is at large Handled.
Which proceeds upon these Postulata, viz. I. That were ever one thing is United
with another, there must be some Likeness betwixt 'em which is the Cause of
this Union. II. That by so much the more any thing has of Likeness to another,
it may be the more firmly United to it. Ete contra. III. That wherever two
Things are so Unlike, that they cant be of themselves United together, they
must be United by something in which they both Agree. IV. That the Works of God
are Always in Just Proportion. V. That the Scriptures have been Delivered down
to us for the Revealed Will of God. VI. That a Thing may arrive to that State,
for which it was Created, and Designed by God. VII. That Happiness is Within.
This Treatise is very large; as taking in great Part of the Scriptures. Whence
the Publication of it has been hitherto Deferred. But it is now designed to be
Shortly put into the Press, if the Bookseller shall be encouraged to undertake
it.

Philadelphian Constitutions, August 23. 1697. Which were Read at Two Meeting
of the Philadelphian Society in Westmorland-House, London, will be shortly also
Published.

Theosophical Transactions by the Philadelphian Society, etc. Number IV. For
the Month of July, 1697. are Now in the Press. And the Rest of the Months
(having been hitherto greatly Retarded) are designed to follow with all
Expedition.
