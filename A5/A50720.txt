The Merry Milk-maids:
OR, THE Country Damsels Pleasure in their Rural Labors. Together with the
Second Part, containing the Plow-man's Praise; concluding with the London
Gallants Prodigality.

To the Tune of, The Milking-pail.


YE Nymphs and Silvian-Gods,
That loves green fields and woods,
when spring newly blown,
herself does adorn
With flowers and blooming buds;
come sing in the praise
(whilst flocks do graze
In yonder pleasant vale)
of those that choose,
their sleep to lose,
and in cold dews,
with clouted shoes,
To carry the Milking-pail.
The Goddess of the morn,
With blushes they adorn,
and take the fresh air;
whilst kinnets prepare
I consort on each green thorn;
the Blackbird and Thrush,
on every bush,
And the charming Nightingale,
in merry vein,
their throats do strain,
to entertain
the jolly train
That carry the Milking-pail.
When cold bleak winds do roar,
And flowers can spring no more,
the fields that were seen
so pleasant and green.
By winter all candid over;
oh, how the Town Lass
looks with her while fac^
And her lips of deadly pale!
but it is not so
with those that go
through frost and snow,
with cheeks that glow,
To carry the Milking-pail.
The Miss of courtly mold,
Adorned with pearl and gold,
with washes and paint,
her skin does so taint,
She Is weathered before she is old,
whilst she in commode,
puts on a cart-load,
And with cusheons plumps her tail;
what joys are found
in russet-gown,
young, plump, and round,
and sweet, and sound,
That carry the Milking-pail?
The Girls of Venus game,
That ventures health a fame,
in practicing feats,
with colds and with heats,
Make Lovers go blind and lame;
if Men were so wise
to value the prize
Of the wares most fit for salt,
what store of beaus,
would daubt their clothes,
to save a nose,
by following those
That carry the Milking-pail.
The country Lad is free,
From fears and jealousy,
when upon the green
he is often seen
With his Lass upon his knee,
with kisses, most sweet,
he does her so treat,
And swears she will never grow stale;
whilst the London Lass,
in every place,
with her brazen face,
despises the grate
Of those with the Milking-pail.
The PLOWMAN's Answer.

A Country life is sweet,
In moderate cold and heat,
to walk in the air,
how pleasant and fair
Is every field of wheat;
the Goddess of flowers,
adorning the ^owers,
And every meadow now;
so that I say,
no Courtier may
compare with They,
who clothed in gray,
Do follow the painful Plow.
They rise with the morning Lark,
And labor till almost dark,
then folding their sherp,
they hasten to sleep,
While every pleasant park,
next morning is ringing,
with Birds that are singing,
On each green tender bough;
with what content,
and merriment,
their days are spent,
whose minds are bent,
To follow the painful Plow.
Brisk country Lads repair
To every wake and fair,
with Sary and Sue,
Nan, Bridget, and Prue,
No manner of charge they spare,
in seasons of leisure,
thus taking their pleasure,
Such liberty they allow:
the rural Train,
through snow and rain,
tript over the plain,
with speed again,
To follow the painful Plow.
But hectering Sparks at court,
According to fame's report,
are commonly foiled,
nay, ruined and spoiled
By following Venus sport;
but this way of sinning,
it is the beginning
Of doting on every Sow,
who will not fail
(for mugs of ale)
to spread her tail;
against these we rail,
Who follow the painful Plow.
The Gallant he is sir'd and sir'd,
By Jenny his pretty Bird,
he calls her his Honey,
supplies her with money,
Till Frenchesi'd claps the word;
and then he runs swearing,
Nay, raving and taring,
And cries, I am ruined now;
and what is worse,
the Spark does curse
his empty purse;
but it is not thus
With any that drives the Plow.
