man comes unto the Father, but by me.

on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and thou shall be saved, and thine House.

THE Author's Epistolary Exhortation, AND Paternal Charge, UNTO HIS CHILDREN.
My Dear and beloved Children,
WHat the Apostle Paul sometimes said with great affection touching Israel, his
Brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh, that with like affection say I now
touching You; My Hearts desire and Prayer to God for you all is, That you may
be saved Romans 11. 1.
. O, that you might be so happy, as to hear that sweetest Sentence of Jesus
Christ at the last day, directed unto you among the rest of his Elect Sheep at
his right hand; Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world Math. 25. 34.
. And that you may be where Christ is (which is far the best of all) to behold
his glory, and to be made conform to him in Celestial glory for evermore Joh.
17. 24. Phil. 1. 23. and 3. 21.
.

But you had need deeply to consider, That there are very many, great, and
dangerous impediments unto Sinners eternal Salvation; without removal whereof,
the Salvation of poor Souls will be rendered not only difficult, but utterly
impossible. A few of these principal Hindrances I shall briefly mention unto
you for your information and instruction. That you may praise God for your
deliverance from some of them: and pray to him for his effectual removal of all
the rest in his due time.

Some grand Hindrances of poor Sinners Salvation are these, viz.

1. The State of Sin and misery, in which all Mankind is involved by Nature,
through the Fall of Adam, the Common root of all Mankind Romans 5. 12, etc. with
Genesis 3.
, whence, All are, by Nature, dead in Sins and trespasses, and Children of
wrath Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3.
. so that, they who are in the flesh, cannot possibly please God Romans 8. 8.
.

2. Man's general Senslessness and ^in apprehensiveness by Nature, of the
Sinfulness and wretchedness of his Natural condition. All Natural men being
Children of the night and of darkness 1 These. 5. 5.
. Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God
through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart
Ephesians. 4. 18.
. And from this senslesness of their Natural malady, it comes to pass, that
they are (till God open their eyes, and awaken their Consciences) altogether
regardless of the Supernatural Remedy.

3. A Sinful course of life and wicked Conversation, resulting from Men's Sinful
state and condition. So that they walk according to the course of this world,
according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spirit that now works in
the Children of Disobedience. -- fulfilling the wills of the flesh and of the
mind Ephesians. 2. 2, 3.
. -- and running to all excess of riot 1 Pet. 4. 4.
. Now these, and like ungodly ways will (without true and timely Repentance)
undoubtedly shut, all that walk therein, out of the kingdom of God for evermore
1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.
.

4. Habitual Hardness of heart and Impenitency, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. Rev. 21. 8.
27. and 22. 15.
which are most dangerous forerunners of Eternal Death and Destruction Ezekiel.
18. 30, 31, 32.
: whereby all hardened and impenitent Sinners do treasure up unto themselves
wrath against the day of wrath, Luke 13. 3. 5.
and Reve^^tion of the righteous Judgment of God Rom* 2. 5, 6, etc.
.

5. That grand Soul-damning Sin of Unbelief in Jesus Christ. Of this the Holy
Ghost peculiarly and principally convincingly reproves the world; of Sin,
because they believe not in me, says our Savior Joh. 16. 8, 9.
. This Sin he puts before others, says Augustine, as if it were the alone Sin:
because this Sin remaining, the rest are detained; and this departing, the rest
are remitted Hoc enim peccatum, quasi solum ^it, prae caeteris posuit: quia hoc
manente caetera detinentur, and hoc discedente -- caetera remittuntur. Aug. in
Joan. 16. Tract. 95. Tom. 9.
. Unbelief rejects Jesus Christ the only Savior: How then is it possible the
Unbelievers should be saved? Our Blessed Savior himself has declared most
plainly; That, he that believes not shall be damned, Math. 16. 6. yea, That he
is condemned already, because he has not believed on the name of the only
begotten Son of God. -- That, he who believes not the Son should not see life,
but the wrath of God abides on him. John 3. 18. 36. and 8. And he places the
Unbelieving in that black Catalogue, which shall have their part in the lake of
fire and brimstone, which is the second Death. Rev. 21. 8.

6. The Embracing of any False counterfeit and irreligious Religions, whether
through Corrupt Education and evil Example of Parents 1 Cor. 12. 2.
, or through Seducement of heretical Impostors and false Teachers 1 John 2. 26.
, or through the just judgment of God, Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. 1 Timothy 4. 1, 2, 3.
Math. 25. 24.
upon them that receive not the Love of the Truth that they may be saved,
sending them strong delusions, that they should believe a lie, that they all
may be damned who believe not the Truth 2 These. 2. 10, 11, 12.
. And chiefly such false Counterfeit Religions, which are most predominant and
bear greatest sway in the world, are these Four: viz. Heathenism, Mahume^ism,
Judaism, and Antichristianism. By the poison of which, it is much to be feared,
far the greatest number of people in the whole world are deprived of Salvation,
and perish. As diverse of our Learned, Orthodox, and Religious Authors Bishop
Andrews, in his Preface before his Expos. of the X. Command^ments, p. 40, etc.
Bishop Hall, in his Serious Disswasive from Popery, in fol. p. 613. to 624. And
in his, No peace with Rome. p. 633. to p. 664. Dr. Willet's Synopsis of Pop^ry;
throughout. See his First Table, showing how Popery militates against the
Person, and all the Offices of Christ. Dr. Whitaker's also is to the like
effect. In Praefat. ad Auditores, ante Disput. de S. Seriptura. p. 258, 259.
Mr. W. Perkins, in his Demonstration of the P^obleme; throughout. p. 486, etc.
Vol. 2. And in his Assertion, That a Papist by his Religion cannot go beyond a
Reprobate. p. ^96, to p. 404. Vol. 1. Land. 1626. And in his Reformed
Catholic. p. 556, etc. Vol. 1.
have demonstrated.

7. The False Hypocritical and Conterfeit Entertaining of the only true
Religion, viz. The Christian Religion, leaves men still in a state of
Damnation, though thereupon multitudes vainly presume and promise to themselves
eternal Salvation. As, when men make a Profession of Christianity, without a
sincere suitable Practice Mat. 7. 21, etc. and 25. 3. Tit. 1. 16.
: having Lamps, without Oil. When they have only a form of Godliness, but
deny the power thereof 2 Timothy 3. 5.
. Having a Name to live, but are dead Rev. 3. 1.
. When they attain to a Temporary Faith, believing for a time, but in time of
Persecution falling away: Become partakers of many Common gifts and en dowments
of the Holy Ghost, but of no true saving Graces of the Spirit: So that though
they may have some flashes of joy in the use of Gods Ordinances, and may do
many things, yet walk not, as the sincere Saints, in all the Commandments and
Ordinances of God blameless Luke 8. 13.
. Now such Persons, Mat. 13. 19, to 23. Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22.
Mark 6. 2 0. Luke 1. 6.
being mere Formal, not real Christians indeed, remaining ^as most in the
visible Church do) without effectual Calling, Conversion, Regeneration, and
true Sanctification, cannot inherit the kingdom of God, as the Holy Scriptures
do abundantly testify Math. 13. 19, to 23. and 7. 13, 14 with Romans 8. 30. Joh.
3. 3, 5. Math. 18. 3. Heb. 12. 14.
.

Now therefore, my beloved Children, I earnestly exhort, charge and beseech
you, by the mercies of God, As you tender the eternal welfare of your precious
and immortal Souls, As you desire to be found in Jesus Christ, and favor with
God when you die, and As ever you hope to be set at Christ's Right hand among
his Sheep, and to be Sentenced by Christ with them to his Everlasting Kingdom
at that great and glorious day of his Appearing: That you use all possible
Care, diligence, and endeavors, by the Grace and assistance of the Holy Spirit
of God, against all these forementioned impediments unto Salvation, and all
such like, that they may be removed out of your way to happiness, and not be
any hindrances at all to your Eternal Glory and Salvation. And that this may be
the more effectually enterprized and performed by you, Let these Ensuing
Instructions sink deep into your hearts, and be most studiously, seriously and
sincerely pursued and practiced in your Lives. viz.

1. Be deeply and thoroughly Convinced of the extreme Sinfulness and
wretchedness of your Natural State and Condition in the first Adam Romans 5. 12.
. How you were shapen in iniquity, and conceived in Sin Psalm. 51. 5. Joh. 3. 6.
. Yea, dead in Sins and trespasses, and by Nature Children of Wrath, even as
others Ep^. 2. 1, 2, 3.
. And, How from this Original and Universal Corruption of your Natures, your
whole course of life is answerably corrupted also: Every imagination of the
thoughts of your hearts (and consequently, every word of your mouths, and every
Action throughout your lives) being Evil, only evil, continually evil, so long
as you continue in your Natural state and condition Genesis 6. 5.
. So then, while you remain in the flesh, you cannot please God Romans 8. 8.
: nor can have an^ actual Hope of Salvation Ephesians. 2. 12.
, upon any solid ground.

2. Hence, you may evidently See, and must needs conclude; That there is so
great a necessity of a Supernatural Remedy, against this your Natural State of
Sin and Misery, and against all the Sinfulness of your Natural Conversation, by
the Application of Jesus Christ unto your Souls, and the Effectual operation of
his Spirit to that End upon your hearts: That without such applying of Christ
by Faith unto you Joh. 8. 24. and 3. 16. 18. 36. 1 John 5. 12. Mar. 16. 16.
, and the operation of his Spirit in and upon you, by Effectual Calling,
Conversion, Regeneration, Renovation and Sanctification, you can never Enter
into the kingdom of God, and be Eternally Saved Romans 8. 30. Math. 18. 3. Joh.
3. 3. 5. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.
.

3. Therefore, See that ye come unto Jesus Christ by Faith without delay Heb.
12. 14.
, and Receive him as your only All-sufficient Savior, that is able to save
you to the uttermost Math. 11. 28, 29, 30. Act. 16. 30. and 4. 11, 12. Heb. 7.
25.
; Accepting him upon his own terms of denying your selves, taking up your Cross
daily, and following him Luke 9. 23.
. So Jesus Christ will be unto you, Wisdom, to guide you in the way to Heaven;
Righteousness, to wash away all your Sins by his blood, and justify you freely
by his spotless Righteousness imputed unto you; Sanctification, to furnish you
sufficiently with all treasures of Grace out of his fullness of Grace; and
Redemption, to deliver you from all your bondage under Sin, Satan, the curse of
the Law, the Wrath to come, and all your Spiritual Enemies 1 Cor. 1. 30.
. O, thrice happy, Everlastingly happy shall you be, if once Jesus Christ
become yours, and you his! Then you shall be espoused to the best Husband in
the world 2 Cor. 11. 2.
; The God and Father of Jesus Christ will be your God and Father Joh. 20. 17.
; The Spirit of Christ will be your Com^orter Joh. 14. 16, 17.
; the Kingdom of Heaven shall be your Everlasting Jointure Math. 25. 34.
; yea All things, The World, and Life, and Death, and things present, and
things to come, All shall be yours 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22, 23.
Then, All things shall work-together for good unto you; Sickness as well as
health, Adversity as well as prosperity, Death it self as well as life Romans 8.
28.
. Then, nothing in the world shall ever be able to separate you from the Love
of Christ, or from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord Romans 8.
35. to the end.
. Then, no Condemnation shall ever befall you in this or in the world to come
Romans 8. 1.
. O happy Souls that ever you were born, if you be born again, and Christ be
formed in you! Christ is the Desire of all Nations Hag. 2. 7.
: Let him be the Desire of your Souls. Christ is the chief among ten thousand
Cant. 5. 10.
: Let him be the Chief of your choice. Christ's mouth is Sweetnesses, yea all of
him is Desires Cant. 5. 16.
: O let your hearts be even ravished with him at all times. Say with that
faithful Minister and Martyr of Jesus Christ, Mr. John Lambert, as he was now
dying in the flames; None but Christ, none but Christ Acts and Man. Vol. 2. p.
427. Land. 1641.
. In a word, I say to every one of you, as sometimes Bernard said unto one
sweetly; Let JESUS be always in thine heart. -- Let Him be unto thee thy meat
and drink, thy sweetness and Consolation, thy Honey and thy Desire, thy Reading
and thy Meditation, thy Prayer and thy Contemplation, thy Life and Death, and
thy Resurrection Bernard. Ex for. bo. vitae, ut citatur in ejus Floribus. p.
2137.
. For, Christ is All in All Col. 3. 11.
.

4. Now, Forasmuch as true saving Faith in Jesus Christ is not of our selves,
but the free gift of God Ephesians. 2. 8.
; and ordinarily God is pleased to work it in the hearts of his Elect,
Instrumentally, by the Hearing of his Word faithfully preached Romans 10. 14, 15.
17.
, Efficaciously, by the Cooperation of his holy Spirit Gal. 5. 22.
; by which Means also it is nourished and increased: Therefore, be ye all of
you Diligent and Constant Hearers of the Word of Christ faithfully preached,
Applying things spoken particularly to your selves, treasuring them up in good
and honest hearts, and bringing forth the suitable fruit thereof by an Upright
practice in your lives Jam. 1. 19. to 26. Math. 13. 23. and 7. 24 to the end.
; and take singular heed, that you never g^ieve, quench, or resist the
operations, stirrings or motions of the Spirit of God in the use of his Word
and Ordinances, or at any other times Ephesians. 4. 30. These. 5. 19, 20. 1 Act. 7. 51.
. For Jesus Christ, by his Word and Spirit especially, stands at the door of
your hearts and knocks, and if any will open unto him, he will come in unto
him, and Sup with him and he with Christ Rev. 3. 20.
.

5. For the increasing also of your Inward Peace, Spiritual Joy and Comfort,
Give all di^igence to make your Calling and Election sure 2 Pet. 1. 10.
; Examining your selves frequently and seriously, whether Jesus Christ be in
you yea or no 2 Cor. 13. 5.
. But how shall this be done? By comparing your Hearts, Lives and Experiences
with the written Word of God, through the assistance and guidance of Gods Holy
Spirit. For, to this End the Word of God was written to us, and the Spirit of
God is given to us, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of
God 1 Cor. 2. 12. Romans 8. 16.
, and that we may know that we have eternal life 1 John 5. 13.
. And for your more ready help in this weighty business, you may make use of
many Characters, marks, or Notes of Trial, which I have at large laid down in
sundry of my Printed Books As my, Believers Evidences, etc. Communicant
Instructed. and Treatise of Gods Covenants, etc.
, which you have by you. Take heed you be not strangers to your own hearts, and
Spiritual States.

6. As you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, so walk in him: rooted, and
built up in him, and established in the Faith Col. 2. 6, (...)
. Be not Christians only in Name and outward Show, but inwardly, sincerely, and
in good earnest. So live and walk, as Christ in his word has directed you to
walk. Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts [even all Sins against the first
and second Table,] living soberly [towards yourselves], righteously [towards
man], and godly [towards the Lord], in this present world Tit. 2. 11, 12.
. Observe and keep all his Commandments Joh. 14. 15. and 15. 13. Math. 28. 19.
. Yield and present your selves, both Souls and Bodies living Sacrifices unto
him Romans 12. ^
. Whether you live, live unto the Lord; or whether you dye, dye unto the Lord;
that whether you live or dye, you may be the Lords Romans 14. 7* 8.
. So live and walk also as Christ has given you an Example. Walk as Christ
walked 1 John 2. 6.
. Walk in love, as Christ has loved us, and has given himself for us, a
Sacrifice, an offering unto God, for a sweet smelling Savor Ephesians. 5. 2.
. Walk in Love toward Jesus Christ, as to love him beyond Father, Mother,
Sister, Brother, or your own dearest lives Mat. 10. 37. Luke 14. 26
: For, he has loved us, and washed us from our Sins in his own blood Rev. 1. 5
. Walk in all well doing as Christ went about, doing good every where Act. 10.
38.
: and imitate him also in innocent and patient suffering for well doing,
commit^ing your selves and your Cause to him that judges righteously 1 Pet. 2.
21, 22, 23.
; for herein he has left us an Example that we should follow his steps.

7. Remember the Lords-day-Sabbath, the first day of the week, (unto which the
Seventh-day Sabbath was translated by the Authority of Christ as appears by the
after observation of that day by the Apostles and Apostolical Churches,) to
keep it holy Exodus 20. Act. 20. 7. ^8. 1 Cor. 16. 1. 2. Rev. 1. 10.
. This is the Princess and Queen of all days -- (...). Ignat. in Ep. ad Magnes.
, This is the Glory of all the week. For, As on this day our blessed Savior
Rose from the dead Math. 28. ^. to 8.
triumphing victoriously over Death, Grave, Sin, and all our Spiritual Enemies:
and thereby assured us of our Spiritual and Corporeal Resurrection by him Ephesians.
2. 5, 6. 1 Cor. 15. 20. to 24.
. As on this day our Savior vouchsafed many of his apparitions to his
Disciples, instructing them and giving them commandments concerning the
Kingdom of God Luke 24. Ma^k. 16. Math. 28. Act. 1. 3.
. On this day the Holy Ghost was most miraculously poured forth upon the
Apostles Act. 2. 1. etc.
. On this day the Apostles and primitive Churches held their solemn Assemblies
for the public worship of God Act. 20. 7* etc.
. This is the solemn Mart, and Market day for furnishing our Souls with all
manner of Spiritual and Heavenly Provisions. This is that Solemn Season and
sweet opportunity which Christ has afforded and ordained for acquainting us
with Himself and the Mysteries of his Kingdom, for maintaining our Communion
with him in his Ordinances, for edifying and perfecting of us in all
Spirituals. And as in the time of the Old Testament, The Sacrifices of the
Sabbath Day were to be double to those on the week day Numb. 28. 9, 10.
: So our Spiritual Sacrifices on the Lords-days are to be twice so much as on
any other day of the week; Especially, in Prayer and thanksgiving; in Reading
the Scriptures, in Hearing the word preached, in Partaking the Lords Supper, in
Catechizing, in Showing Mercy to the poor, etc. that so the sacred tincture and
impressions of this day may remain fresh and lively upon your hearts all the
week following.

8. Let every day of the week be managed by you in a Christian sort. To that
End, Be sure to present unto the Lord your Morning and Evening-Sacrifice of
prayer and praise to God continually: as God of Old appointed a Morning and
Evening Sacrifice for every day in the week Numb. 28. 3. to 9.
. Holy David and Daniel Prayed thrice in a day Psalm. 55. 17. Dan. 6. 10.
. Every day, open with God in the morning, and shut with God in the Evening, by
some religious ejaculation or savourly meditation. Read daily some portion of
Holy Scripture Psalm. ^. 1, 2. Act. 17. 11.
, to keep up your acquaintance with God, with Jesus Christ, and his Spirit, and
the mysteries of true Religion. And then follow the lawful affairs of your
honest particular Calling, diligently and righteously 1 Cor. 7. 20. 24.


9. Do ye Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, Ephesians. 4. 28.
while the evil days [of old age] come not, These. 3. 10, 11, 12.
nor the years draw nigh, when ye shall say, we have no pleasure in them Eccl.
12. 1.
. Gods Eminent Saints have sought the Lord betimes, and addicted themselves
unto Godliness while they were young. As, David, that man after Gods own heart,
while he was but a Youth I Sam. 16* 33. to 38.
. Josiah, that Phaenix. King of Judah, while he was yet young, but sixteen
years old, began to seek after the God of David 2 Chronicles. 34. 1. 3.
. And Timothy, so highly commended by the Apostle Paul, knew the Holy
Scriptures from a Child, Gr. from his insancy 2 Timothy 3. 15.
. God, in the time of the Law, called for the first ripe fruits of the field,
and the firstlings of the flock, to be offered unto him Numb. 15. 20, 21. and
18. 12, 13. Deuteronomy. 18. 4. and 15. 19.
: to teach his people, how acceptable the first fruits of our youth and life
are to God. O how happy are they, that bear the yoke Mat. 11. 29.
of Christ in their youth! Hereby, the flower of their age is best improved!
Hereby, thousands and ten-thousands of sins are prevented. Hereby, they gain
the longer time, for walking with God, for growing in grace, for doing of good,
for increasing of Spiritual Experiences, for treasuring up of Evidences and
assurances of their Salvation, and of preparing themselves for Heaven and
eternal Glory.

10. Herein always exercise your selves to have a Conscience void of offense
both toward God and Man Act. 24. 26.
. That so living in all good conscience before God Act 23. 1.
, This may be matter of singular comfort and rejoicing to you, in your greatest
afflictions and distresses, the Testimony of your Consciences, that in
simplicity and godly sincerity you have had your Conversation in the world 2
Cor. 1. 12.
.

11. Employ and improve to the utmost all the Times and Talents, wherewith the
Lord has entrusted you, to his Glory, your own or others Benefit. That when
the time of reckoning shall come, he may both command you and richly reward
you, and not condemn and punish you with that wicked sloathful and improfitable
Servant Ephesians. 5. 15, 16.
.

12. Hold fast the Platt-form of Sound words Mat. 25. 14 to 31.
, in Faith and Love, which is in Christ Jesus 2 Timothy 1. 13.
. That so you may not be carried aside with every wind of false doctrine Ephesians.
4. 14.
; but may be the Children of the Truth. And to this End constantly retain in
your Memories the Catechism wherein you have been trained up now a long time
together. For, this is an excellent Brevial or Sum of the true Christian
Religion, very useful to direct you both in the Faith and Practice, in the
right ways of God, against error and iniquity.

13. Stand not at a stay, much less go backward, in the affairs of Religion:
But still grown in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ 2 Pet. 3. 18.
. Take heed of backsliding Heb. 12. 13. 15.
. Having put your hand to Christ's plow, Look not back Pro. 14. 14.
: For then you will be unfit for the Kingdom of God Luke 9. 62.
. Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as
much as ye know that your labor shall not be in vain in the Lord Cor. 15. 58.
. Be faithful to the death, and christ will give you a Crown of Life Rev. 2. 10.
.

14. Love God, Father, son and Holy Ghost, over all, with all your Heart, Soul,
Mind and might Mat. 22. 37, 38.
, and that especially for his own sake love such as are begotten of God L^k.
10. 27.
, and true Christians indeed, chiefly for Gods sake, for Christ's sake I Joh. 5.
1.
. And see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently 1 Pet. 1. 22.
: Especially, endeavoring to help and further one another in the way to heaven.

15. Finally, Set your affection on things above, not on things on the Earth:
For all the things on Earth are mere Col. 3. 2.
vanity and vexation of Spirit Eccl. 1. 2. 14.
, being vanity, they are empty shadows and bubles, that cannot continue, that
cannot satisfy, but utterly disappoint you: By their disappointment, they
become vexation of Spirit, heaps of thorns and briars unto you. But your true,
lasting and Soul-satisfying Treasures are above; there is your Crown, your
Kingdom, your Glory, your Eternal life, your Eternal inheritance, your Masters
joy and pleasures at his right hand for Evermore; there is your sweetest and
most glorious Savior Jesus Christ at Gods right hand, and there is your God in
Christ, in whose immediate vision and complete fruition the supreme happiness
of Heaven will consist for ever. Have therefore your Conversation in Heaven
Phil.^ 3. 2o, 21.
, though for a while your conversation be on Earth: and look for your Savior
Jesus Christ from Heaven, to change your vile bodies and make them like to his
own glorious body. Then there shall be no more Sin, Sorrow, Pain, Curse or
Death. Then Christ will wipe all your Tears away Rev. 21. 1. 4.
. Then your everlasting Jubilee will b^gin but shall never end. O how should we
love his appearing, when all those things shall come to pass! Make haste O
beloved, and be as the Hind or the Roe upon the Mountains of Spices Cant. 8.
. Even so come Lord Jesus Rev. 22. 2o.
.

These things, my beloved Children, I have earnestly desired to recommend unto
you in order to your Eternal Salvation; hoping that some of you have a true
Spiritual sense and relish of them already. Now the God of all Grace imprint
them indelibly upon the Tables of all your Hearts, that you may still remember
them and conform your selves unto them, not only while I am with you in this
land of the living, but also after I shall be taken from you by Natures
dissolution, and sleep in Jesus. And let him bless you with all Spiritual
blessings in heavenly-places in Christ Ephesians. 1. 3.
for evermore. Amen.

THE Natural MAN DIRECTED TO CHRIST.
A Premonition to the Natural Man reading the ensuing Directions.
WHoever thou art, that unto this present hour remainest still in thy Natural
State in the Old Adam, unconverted unto God in CHRIST the last Adam; or justly
suspectest thy condition to be such; and perusest these DIRECTIONS following:
Read and understand, Understand and Consider in thine Heart, Consider and
Believe the Scripture Truths therein propounded, Believe and put in Practice
the Scripture Rules therein recommended unto thee; lest otherwise, what thou
read and art convinced in Conscience to be thy Duty, hereafter sting thine
Heart, Rise up in judgment against thee, and condemn thee, both when thy Death
Approaches; and at the Great day, when the Lord JESUS shall be revealed from

Directions, tending to conduct the Natural Man to CHRIST.
I. Direction.
A Waken and rouz up thy Soul and Conscience, O Sinful wretched natural Man,
seriously to consider and deeply to lay to heart, How Sinful and miserable, the
State and Condition of all Mankind since the fall, and of thine own Soul in
particular, is, by Nature in the first Adam. compare together Romans 3. 9. to 21.
1 Cor. 2. 14. Romans 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. Tit. 3. 3. and 1. 15, 16. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3.

1. The Sinfulness of Natural man's State; what Words can enough express! what
thoughts of Man can sufficiently conceive! who can understand his Errors? Psalm.
19. 12. The heart is ^^eeitful above all things, and desperately w^^ked, who
can know it? I the LORD search the heart; I try the Reins. Jer. 17. 9, 10. God
alone, who cannot sin* e^actly knows man's Sinfulness. From his word take a
brief discovery of it.

The Sinfulness of the Natural man's condition, Consists chiefly in these
particulars. viz.

1. In the guilt of Adam's first Sin, Of Eating the forbidden fruit, contrary
to Gods express Command, Genesis 2. 16, 17. with Genesis 3. 6, 7. Romans 3. 9. 19. In
which Eating; Adam's 1 Unbelief of Gods word; 2 Contempt of Gods command; 3
Impious Consent of his most free will; 4 Proud aspiring to be as Gods knowing
good and evil, Genesis 3. 5. 5 Apostasy from God; 6 Disobedience of the whole man;
and 7 Ruin of himself and all his posterity; are comprehended Trelent. Just
Theol. ^. 3. de Peccato.
This sin of Adam, being the Common Parent and Root of all mankind, (as St.
Augustine -- In quo omnes peccaverunt. Romans 5. 12.
well notes) then virtually and seminally in his loins, is imputed to and
charged upon all his ordinary posterity, even upon all mankind ordinarily
propagated form him -- Quia secundum propaginem carius in illo ^ramus omnes,
antequam nati essemus, tanquam in parente, ^anq^am in radice ibi eramus: Sic
venena^a ^st ista arbor, ubi eramus Aug. de verb. Apost. Sermon. 14* p. 325. B C.
Tom. 10.
, Rom 5. 12. -- 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Act 17 26. ^ Cor. 15. 21. 22. 45. 49. As
Levi, who received Tithes is said to ^ay Tithes in Abraham to Melchizedeck, for
that yet he was in the loins of his Father Abraham when Melchizedeck met him.
Heb. 7. 9, 10. So then in Adams eating the forbidden fruit, all mankind did eat
the forbidden fruit; In Adam's Sinning, all his posterity Sinned; In Adam's
disobeying, all mankind disobeyed; In Adam's falling, all his post^rity sell;
In Adams dying, all his Posterity dyed. And thou amongst the rest. And
Therefore, in this Sense, thou wast a Sinner, algrievous Sinner before thou
wast born, even from the foundation of the world.

O thou Natural man! Think of this, Lay this to Heart deeply, was it a small
matter for Adam, and for thee and all Mankind in Adam, thus to Sin. Consider
well the many and great Aggrevations of this first Sin of Man; As 1. The Person
who sinned: 2. Condition and State, wherein: 3. Place, where: 4. Time, when: 5.
Law, against which: 6. Object, against whom: 7. And finally, The manifold and
great Evils both of Sin and punishment ensuing thereupon; (all which I have
elsewhere In my Treat^ of Gods Convenants. Book. 2. Chap. 1 Aphor. 6. IV. p.
41. to p. 59.
at large illustrated,) and then see, if ever Sin was perpetrated in this
world, (all things duly considered,) so Sinful, Heinous, Horrid, inexcusable,
and damnable, as this first Sin!

2. In being wholly overwhelmed with Original Sin, (so as is thought, it is
called by -- Ex Adam tra^i dicimus Originale Peccatum, quod per lavacrum
Regenerationis, non solum in majoribus, sed etiam in parvulis solvitur. August.
Retract. 1. 2. cap. 62. p. 60. B. Basil. 1569. Tom 1. Ecce unde tra^itur
originale peccatum, Ecce unde nemo nascitur sine peccato, Ecce propter quod
Dominus sic Concipi voluit, quem virgo Concepit. Aug. de Temp. Sermon. 45. p.
667. l. 7. m. 10.
Augustine) contracted from lapsed Adam by Natural Propagation, Genesis 5. 3. Psalm.
51. 5. Ioh. 3. 6. Job. 14. 4. and 15. 14.

This Original Sin Consists especially ^. In the privation or loss (1) of Man's
Primitive Integrity or Original Righteousness concreated with him Genesis 1. 26,
27. and 3. 6, 7, 8. Eccles. 7. 29. -- All have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God, Romans 3. 23. (2) and of that sweet communion, which, ^ in that
integrity, he enjoyed with God, Genesis 3. 6, 7, 8, 10. Whereupon man becomes Dead
in Sin, Ephesians. 2. 1. 5. with Genesis 2. 16, 17. 2. In the Depravation, Pollution
and Corruption of his whole nature: His whole Soul and all the faculties
thereof; His whole Body and all the Parts thereof, being universally defiled.
-- to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their
Mind and Conscience is defiled, Tit. 1. 15. See Genesis 6. 5. Ier. 17. 9. Romans 3.
10. to 19. 2 Pet. 2. 14.

Hence, From both these ensue two woeful effects. 1. An Indisposition, and utter
inability, yea an Opposition and Enmity, unto all Good. Romans 5. 6. and 7. 18.
and 8. 8. Col. 1. 21. Romans 8. 7. and 5. 10. 2. An Universal pronity, Propensity
or Proclivity unto all Evil. Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. Romans 3. 10, 11, 12. 1 Pet.
4. 2, 3, 4. Original Sin, being the Root, Seed and Common Spawn of all Actual
Sin in the World Iam. 1. 14, 15. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3.

The Holy Scriptures set forth this Original Sin by sundry remarkable Names or
Phrases. It is styled, 2. Iniquity wherein we were shapen, and sin wherein our
Mothers conceived us. Psalm. 51. 5. in regard of the Natural Propagation of it.
1 Sin. -- That they are all under Sin. Romans 3. 9. 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Romans 7. 14.
Because it is Sin (...) (...), the Sin of Sins, the mother and nurse of all
Sins, virtually and seminally comprehending in it all sorts of Sins. 3 Sin
dwelling in us, Romans 7. 20. from the constant Inherence, Residence and Abode
which it has in all, yea even in the Regenerate themselves, (to whom it is
pardoned, and in whom it is in some measure mortified) during this present
life, Romans 7. 17, 18. 4 The Sin that does so easily beset us. (...), Sin easily
surrounding us, Heb. 12. 1. because it encompasseth Soul, Body, all our
Faculties, Affections, Senses, Parts and whole Man. 5 The Law of Sin. Romans 8.
2. and 7. 25. The Law of Sin in our members, Romans 7. 23. because of the power
and strength of Sin, which is resident in us: A Law is powerful and forcible.
6. The Body of Sin, Romans 6. 6. because, as a Natural Body is compacted of many
Parts, and has diverse proper Members set in it, whereby it acts: So sin
Original has many limbs, called Our members which are upon Earth, as
Fornication, etc. Col. 3. 5. 7 Our Old man, Romans 6. 6. Sin is so called, in
Opposition to the New man, the Regenerate Part, and in distinction from our
humane Natures: because our Corruption of Nature is from the first man the Old
Adam; as our Regeneration is from the Spirit of Christ the last Adam. 8 The Old
Leven to be purged out, 1 Cor, 5. 7. called Leven, because as Leven levens and
sowers the whole lump of Dow, So Sin original levens the whole man, sowers and
infects the whole man. Old, from old Adam. 9. The flesh. Ioh. 3. 6. Romans 8. 18.
Gal. 5. 17. because, As Flesh is opposite to Spirit, So Original Sin is
opposite to Grace. And because as flesh is man's basest and vilest part, Phil.
3. 21. So Original Sin is the vilest evil in man.

Pause here, O Natural Man. Not only Adam's first Actual Sin is thine, being
justly imputed to thee: But this Original Sin, thence contracted, is thine
also, being naturally inherent in thee. It is the Disease, the Poison, the
Plague, the Leprosy of thy whole Nature. Thou art as full of it, as any Sink is
full of filth, as any Serpent is full of venom, as any Toad is full of poison.
Thou art by Nature wholly defiled with it: universally captivated under the
Dominion of it, and Spiritually Dead in it. And in this respect thy Condition
is incomparably worse, than the Condition of any fowl, fish, bruit-beast, or
creeping thing whatsoever. For, they have no Original Sin in them, and thou art
all full of it. And is this thy natural Condition, a State to be rested in by
thee^ wherein thou art far worse than any Dog, Toad, Serpent, mean or vilest
creature under the Sun? Remember that of Augustine; Every one is damned as
Generated: None is delivered, but as Regenerated Omnis Generatus, damnatus:
nemo liberatus, nis^ Regeneratus. Aug. de verb. Apost. Sermon. 14. p. 325. D.
Tom. 1o.
.

3. In the H^ge Heaps and Swarms of all thine actual Sins (the poisonous fruit
of Sin Original) into which thou have broken forth inconsiderately, from thy
Birth until this very day, The sinfulness of thy natural Condition is mightily
augmented and aggrevated Restat us in illo primo homine peccasse omnes
intelligantur, quia in illo fuerunt omnes quando ille peccavit. Vnde pecca^um
n^scendo (...)* quod nisi Renascendo non solvivi^^r. August* cont. dua^ E^ist.
Pe^^g. l. 4. c. 4. p. 910. B. Tom. 7.
, O Natural Man!

Think often in thy Retired hours, of the ^Variety, 2 Multiplicity, and 3
Extremity or Aggravations of thine Actual Sins.

(1) The Variety and several sorts, of thine Actual Sins; How manifold are
they? As actual,

Sins in respect of the Subject, are distributed into Peccata Cordis, Oris,
Operis, Sins of Heart, Word, and Work. ^ In the Heart; what corrupt
imagination, Genesis 6. 5. what abominable, vain, Atheistical, blasphemous,
profane and polluted Thoughts Prove. 15. 26. What deadness, stupidity,
defilement, S^aredness, etc. in the Conscience. Tit. 1. 15. 1 Timothy 4. 2. What
Enmity, Perverseness, crookedness, disobedience, rebellion, etc. in the will
Ier. 44. 16, 17. etc. Luke 19. 14. What impenitency, hardness, deceitfulness,
hypocrisy, Earthiness, Disorder, Confusion, etc. in the Heart and Affections.
Romans 2. 5. 2. In thy words and tongue, What Vain-speaking, Swearing, Cursing,
Lying, Blaspheming, Backbiting, Slandering, False-witness-bearing, etc. Exodus
20. 7. Mat. 12. 36. the Tongue is a world of iniquity -- Iam. 3. 6. and every
idle word must be accounted for at the day of Judgment, Mat. 12. 36, 37. 3 In
thy actions and works, though never so Religious in appearance, How do thou
miscarry in their Ground, Matter, Form, Manner, Circumstances and End, 1 Timothy
1. 5. Tit. 1. 15, 16. Isai. 1. 10. etc. and 66. 3. Hag. 2. 14. Prove. 15. 8. So
that in none of them thou can please God. Romans 8. 8. Yea and even in thy
secular Actions, thou (...) wholly Sinful, Prove. 21. 4. and 15. 9.

And to this Distribution of Actuals into Sins of Heart, Word, and Works; We
may refer that of Sins into Inward, and Outward,

Sins, in respect of the Law or Rule violated by Sin, are, 1 Sins of Impiety or
Ungodliness, contrary to the first Table of the Decalogue 2 Sins of Iniquity
Unrighteousness, or worldly Lusts, against the 2 Table, etc. Romans 1. 18. Tit.
2. 12.

Of Impiety there are many sorts of Sins, properly repugnant to the 4 first
Commandments: Of Unrighteousness are many Sorts also contrariant to the 6 last
Commandments. And this Distribution of Sins according to the ten Commandments
is most accurate.

Sins, in Respect of the Parts thereof, are 1 Sins of Omission, when duties
prescribed are neglected; and this is a Taking from Gods Law. Iam. 4. 17. Mat.
25. 42. etc. Rev. 2. 21. 1 Samuel 15. 2, 3. 8, 9. etc. 2 Sins of Commission, when
things prohibited are Practiced, as Genesis 2. 16, 17. compared with Genesis 3. 6, 7.
Achan's sin, Josh. 7. 1. 15. 20, 21. 25, 26. compared with Josh. 6. 17, 18, 19.

Sins, in respect of the Object offended and wronged, are; 1 Sins against God,
and repugnant to Piety. Romans 1. 21, 22. 28. 2 Sins against Man, against our
Neighbor and contrary to righteousness, to equity. Pro. 14. 21. Genesis 4. 8. 3
Sins against a man's own self, contrary to Sobriety. 1 Cor. 6. 18. Prove, 20. 2.
Touching the two first, See 1 Samuel 2. 25. Luke 15. 18. Touching all the three,
See Tit. 2. 12. But Sin is otherwise against God, then it is against Man.
Against God, as it is a Transgression of his Law: against man, only as it is a
Damage or Injury.

Sins, in regard of Time wherein they are acted, are 1 Sins of youth, Psalm.
25. 7. Eccles. 11. 9. 2 Timothy 2. 22. 2 Sins of riper age. Isai. 65. 20.

Sins, in regard of Place and cognizance, are; 1 Private or Secret, Psalm. 19.
12. and 90. 8. Josh. 7. 1. etc. 2 Public and open, when Sin is perpetrated
boldly, impudently, in the view of others. Isai. 3. 9. Numb. 25. 6, 7, 8. 2 Samuel 16. 22.

Sins, in respect of their Power and Strength, are; Reigning, or not Reigning
Romans 6. 12, 13, 14.

Hither some refer the Distinction of Sin, into Mortal and Venial, not in the
Popish Sense; but in a sound Sense; viz. As by Mortal Sin we may understand Sin
reigning, which not repented of shall never be forgiven. And as by Venial Sin,
we may understand, Sin not reigning, but in Christ upon repentance forgiven,
and not bringing Condemnation though it deserve it. Romans 8. 1.

Sins, in respect of Degree, are Great, or Small, Ezech* 5. 6. 8. and 8. 15.
Ioh. 19. 11. Mat 5. 21, 22.

(2.) The multiplicity of thine actual Sins; how innumerable are they! Are they
not more than the hairs of thine head; Psalm. 40. 12. are they not numberless
like the Sands? and who can u^derstand his errors, how many they are? Psalm. 19.
12. If in one Sin, so many Sins are complicated: as in Adam's Sin See before p.
1, 2. and my Treat. of Gods Covenants. p. 36, 37. p. 41* to 49.
. Genesis 3. In Judas his Sin, Mat. 26 If in one day, in one hour, so many Sins in
Thought, Word and Deed, are done by thee: If in one Prayer, etc. So many Sinful
distractions, distempers, etc. are discovered: what millions, and Ten-thousand
Millions of Millions of Sins proceed from thee in thy whole Life?

(3.) The Extremity and Aggravations of thy Actual Sins, How many and great are
they, Have not thy Sins been,

Heinous, Crying Sins? As, I Bloodshed Genesis 4. 10. 2 Sodom's Sins Genesis 18. 20,
21. 3 Oppression Exodus 3. 7. 4 Deteyning Hirelings wages, Iam, 5. 4. according
to the ancient memorial verse Clamitat aure Dei, vex Sanguinis; and S^domorum:
: Which I may thus do into English; 1 Blood, Vox Oppressorum; Mer^^s de^enta
laborum.
2 Sodom's Sins, 3 Oppressing Tyranny;
4 Detaining Hirelings Hire, are Sins that cry.


Sins against thine own Light? D. Prideaux. in Seha. Theol. Syntag. Murmonit.
3. p. 13.
Ioh. 9. 41. Luke 12. 47, 48. Iam. 4. 17.

Sins against the checks of thine own Conscience? Mat. 27. 17 to 27.

Sins against many Motions of Gods Spirit? Act. 7. 51. Ephesians. 4. 30. 1 These. 5.
19.

Sins against Gods rich Means of Grace? Isai. 5. 1 to 8. Mat. 21. 33 to 45.

Sins against the precious Blood of Christ? 1 Cor. 11. 27. Heb. 10. ^9.

Sins against Gods many and great mercys. Hos. 2. 8.

Sins against Gods severe Judgments; inflicted on others for thine admonition?
1 Cor. 10, 11. Dan. 5. 22, 23. etc. or upon thy self for thy Reformation? 2 Chronicles. 28. 22.

Sins against Gods Patience and Long-Suffering, leading thee to Repentance?
Romans 2. 4, 5. Rev. 2. 21.

Sins, wherein thou have long continued? Isai. 65. 20. Deuteronomy. 9. 7. 27.

Sins, which thou have often re-iterated? Mat. 26. 69. to the end.

Sins, heightened by such and such Circumstances. As of Person, Time, Place,
etc. Levit. 10. 1, 2, 3. Numb. 20. 12. 2 Samuel 12. 7, 8, 9. -- Numb. 25. 6. Ioh.
2. 13. to 18.

Sins, wherein thou have shamefully gloryed? Phil. 3. 19.

Sins, for the effecting of which thou have been far more diligent and
industrious, than ever thou wast for the saving of thy precious Soul? Mat. 23.
13. to 34.

Communion with others in their Sins, many ways. Ephesians. 5. 11. As if thine were
not enough to damn thee.

Oh, thou silly deceived Sinful Soul! When for all these Sins of thine God
shall bring thee to judgment, Where shall thou appear? Psalm. 1. 5. Oh, What
then will thou do, when God rises up? and when he visits, what will thou
Answer him? Ioh. 31, 14.

II. The W^^tchedness of a natural man's Condition, Who can enough Apprehend or
Express! What words can sufficiently declare! Where there is nothing but
Carnality and Sinfulness, there is nothing but misery and wretchedness.

The Natural man's Condition, as it is most Sinful, without all even the least
degree of Sanctity: So it is most miserable, without all even the least measure
of saving mercy or felicity. And such, O Natural man, is thy Condition, in
sundry respects. For,

1. Thou art by Nature wholly destitute of (that Paradise on Earth, that
suburbs of Heaven, that handsel of Glory,) Sweet Communion with God. While Adam
stood in his integrity, He had sweet fellowship with God, Genesis 1. 26, 27, 28,
29, 30. and 2. 3, 7, 8. 16, 17, 18. and so to the end. But Adam had no sooner
fallen but he lost that sweet Communion with God: was afraid of Gods voice, Hid
himself from his presence among the Trees of the Garden: is Convented,
Convinced, and judged for his Sin, and driven out of the Garden, etc. Genesis 3.
9. to the end. And whilst thou art in thy Natural State, in the first Adam
lapsed, Thou art without all Communion with God also. For, What fellowship has
Righteousness with unrighteousness? And what Communion has light with
darkness? 2. Cor. 6. 14. Now God is light, and in him is no Darkness at all. If
we say, we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not
the Truth, etc. 1. Ioh. 1. 5. 6. 7. and every natural man is Darkness Ephesians. 5.
8. and habitually walks in darkness, 1 Ioh. 2. 9. 11.

Now, whilst thou art destitute of Communion with God, thou do still remain
without all these sweet Companions of Communion with God. viz. Thou art

(1) Without all special favor and saving mercy from God. -- which had not
obtained mercy: 1. Pet. 2. 10*

(2) Without any Saving Relation to God art none of his People nor is he thy
God 1. Pet. 2. 10. yea. He is ashamed to be called thy God: or to own thee for
one of his people. Heb. 11. 16.

(3) Without Christ, the last Adam. Ephesians. 2. 12. 1. Cor. 15. 45. By whom alone,
all Saving mercy from God, and all saving Relation to God can be obtained. Act.
4. 11. 12. Ephesians. 2. 13. to the end.

(4) An Alien from the Common wealth of Israel. Ephesians, 2. 12. Thou art none of
his Family and Household none of his mistical body, of his invisible Church: But
of the Synagogue of Satan Rev. 1. 6. For they that are Aliens to Christ, the
Head: must needs be Aliens to his invisible Church and Body.

(5) A stranger from the Covenants of Promise, touching Christ Promised under
the Old Testament: and consequently from the Covenant of Performance, touching
Christ performed and exhibited in Human Nature, viz. The New Covenant. Ephesians.
2. 12. laid down Heb. 8. 8. to the end. Oh what a misery is this! To have
nothing to do with Gods Covenant, not any the Promises* Privileges, Benefits
or Blessings thereof. This is to be shut out of Gods Grand Act of favor and
mercy, His Act of Oblivion, Heb. 8. 12. His Magna Charta, his Great Charter for
eternal happiness in Heaven.

(6) Having no Hope. Ephesians. 2. 12. viz. No true, Salvi^ical, well-grounded hope
of life eternal in Heaven; or of future felicity in the world to come for thine
immortal Soul. And such Hopeless men are most miserable men, 1. Cor. 15. 19.
When thou hopeless wretch come to die, what will become of thy Soul? What
will thou then say to thy Soul? Even as that Atheistical Pope; Animula vagula
Animula, vagula, blandula, Hospes Comesque Corporis, tuos nun^ abibis in (...)
etc.
, etc. Omy poor wandering blandishing Soul, The Guest and Companion of my body,
into what placet art thou now going? etc. To Heaven, or to Hell: to the
glorified Saints, or to the damned Reprobates: to Joys everlasting, or to
endless Torments: To God or to the Devil?

(7) Finally, while thou do remain destitute of saving Communion with God,
thou art without God in the World, an Atheist in the world. (...). Ephesians. 2. 12.
Ephesians. 2. 12. What? without God? Then, without all true Happiness, without the
only supreme Good, and Soul-satisfying Treasure, such God is, Math. 19. 17.
Psalm. 73. 25. 26.

2. Thou, in thy Natural State, art under the severe Curse of the Law; Which
under pain of the Curse, requires of every one, Perfect, Perpetual, and
Personal obedience to all things written in the Law, Gal. 3. 10. which no mere
man since the Fall of Adam can possibly perform. Romans 3. 9. to 29. and 5. 6.
and 8. 3. 4. 7. 8. And whom the law Curses, he is Cursed indeed, not by man,
but by the living God himself.

3. Thou in thy Natural state, remainest still under the dreadful displeasure,
and wrath of God Almighty. -- Art by nature a child of wrath, Even as others.
Ephesians. 2. 3. Under the Wrath of God? Oh! Who knows the Power of Gods anger, or
according to his Fear (i. e. his word the Rule of his Fear, Psalm. 19. 9.) his
wrath? Psalm 90. 11. If the wrath of an earthly King be as the Roaring of a
Lion, Prove. 19. 12. What then is the wrath of God, the King of Kings? Our God
is a Consuming fire. Heb. 12. 29. Consider the prints of Gods wrath, upon the
lapsed Angels, 2, Pet. 2. 4. Fallen Adam. -- Genesis 3. The sinful old world 2
Pet. 2. 5. The Cities of Sodom etc. 2 Pet. 2. 6. Genesis 19. The Beauteous
Jerusalem, and the Jews 2 Chronicles. 36. Yea, upon Jesus Christ the spotless Son of
God himself, when he stood as the Sinners Surety, Math. 26. and 27. Luke 22.
and 23. And then say with the Psalmist; Thou, even thou art to be feared: and
who may stand before thee, when once thou art angry? Psalm. 76. 7. When he is
wrath, The Heavens drop down, The Mountains melt and leap, The Rocks rend in
pieces, The Earth Quakes, The Sea is dried up, The Devils tremble Iam. 2. 19.
And the whole Creation is amazed. Oh! think of the Terror of the Lord, 2 Cor.
5. 11.

4. Thou in thy natural state, art in league with the Devil himself, the Grand
enemy of God and mankind, Math. 13. 28. 39. 1 Pet. 5. 8. that old Serpent,
Revel. 12. 9. and performest thine Homage and obeisance unto him, 1 Ioh. 3. 8.
Ioh. 8. 44. as to thy Conquer^r, Prince, Father, and God. Satan is,

1. As thy Conqueror, leading thee Captive at his will, by his powerful
Temptations, yea by his mere suggestions and snares. 2 Timothy 2. 26. and so thou
art his mere vassal and slave.

2. As thy Prince, Ioh. 14. 30. effectually working in the Children of
Disobedience, and in thee as in one of his Subjects. Ephesians. 2. 2.

3. As thy Father, whose works thou, as his Child; wilt do. Ioh. 8. 44. 1 Ioh.
3. 8. 12. Mat. 13. 38.

4. As thy God, and the God of this world, whom thou, as his Creature, wilt
serve. 2 Cor. 4. 4.

5. Thou, in thy natural State, art liable to all sorts and degrees of miseries
in this present world, not as to Paternal Chastisements of a loving Father (the
lot of Gods dear children. Heb. 12. 5. to 12.) but as to vindictive Punishments
and curses of an angry God. Genesis 3. 16, 17, 18, 19. and 4. 9 to 15. Levit. 26.
to 40. Deuteronomy. 28. 15. to the end. Psalm. 11. 6.

These Miseries are of many sorts: But may be reduced to

1. Miseries incident to thee in thy Goods and Temporal estate. As, when thy
ground is barren, brings forth thorns and thistles, etc. Genesis 3. 18. thy cattle
cast their young, Deuteronomy 28. 18. Fire consumes thy dwelling, Job. 15. 34. thieves
rob thee of thy wealth, Job. 1, 13. to 18, Extortioners catch all thou have,
Psalm. 109. 11. etc.

2. Miseries incident to thee in thy Relations. As, Treachery in thy friends
Judge. 9. 23. falsness and sloathfulness in thy Servants and hirelings, 2 Chr.
24, 25. and 33. 24. Alienation in thy Kinsfolks, Judge. 9. 5. 24. Disobedience
and Undutifulness in thy Children. Deuteronomy. 28. 18. Disaffection, vexatiousness,
etc. in thy wife 1 King. 21. 25. Deuteronomy. 28. 30.

3. Miseries to which thou urt exposed in thy good Name. As Lies, Reproaches,
Slanders, Back-bitings, etc. The Name of the wicked shall rot. Prove. 10. 7.

4. Miseries, whereunto thou art liable in thy Body. As, Hunger and want of
Food, Deuteronomy. 28. 53. etc. Thrist, and want of Drink. Lam. 4. 4. Breaking or
dislocating of bones, Numb. 24. 8. Weaknesses, grievous pains, with sickness
and many sorts of Diseases; Fevers, Agues, Pestilences, etc. Deuteronomy. 28. 21, 22.
Cold and nakedness, Ezekiel 16. 39. Bonds and Imprisonments, Deuteronomy. 28. 63. to the
end. Perils and dangers by land and water, etc.

In thy whole life thou art exposed to Armies of miseries.

6. Thou, in thy Natural state, art subject to death, the (...) and extremity
of all these wordly miseries, for thy sinfulness. Romans 5. 12. and 6. 23. Genesis
2. 16, 17. with 3. 19. Die thou must, that is certain; but when, where, how,
etc. that is most uncertain: and how small a matter may bring thee to thine end?
The bone of a Fish going cross thy throat may choke thee, as it did Tarquinius
Priscus: A Raisin-stone may kill thee, as it did Sophocles and Anacreon: An
hair in a draught of milk may end thee, as it did Fabius the Senator: The tooth
of thy Comb as thou art combing thine head, entering the flesh, may make thy
death's wound, as it befell Ruffinus the Consul: A Needle thrust into thy breast
by a child born in thiue arms, may hasten thy death, as it befell Lucia, the
Daughter of Aurelius. And when Death has severed soul and body, what shall
become of thy soul? Shall it ascend, or descend? Shall it live, or shall it
die, etc. O, never think, that thou who livedst and diedst without God in this
world, shall after death ascend to God, or live with God, in the world to come!

7. Thou, in thy Natural state, can not escape the damnation of Hell, but
shall have part in the Lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the
second Death, there to be excruciated with torments numberless, easeless,
remediless and endless, Mat. 23. 33. Rev. 21. 8. Romans 6. 23. Genesis 2. 17. Mat.
25. 41, 46. Jude, verse 7. There, shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, Mat.
25. 30. There, their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched, Mar. 9. 43,
44. There, not one drop of water from the top of a finger shall be vouchsafed
to cool a tormented tongue, Luke 10. 24, 25, 26. There thou shall have pain of
loss, and pain of sense. There thou shall have plenty and penury; plenty of
torment, penury of comfort. There will be Amissio Coeli, The miss of Heaven,
which was often tendered thee, but thou did refuse: Privatio Terrae, The loss
of Earth, which thou had, but could not keep: Positio Inferni, The Position
of Hell, which thou shall have, and can not be delivered from it. There will
be universality, extremity, eternity of unpityed misery upon thy soul and body,
without the least alteration, mitigation and cessation.

Oh wretched Natural man! Might thy torments in Hell be brought to an end,
after so many millions of years as there are Stars in Heaven, Atoms in the
Air, Dust in the Earth, Drops in the Sea, Grass-piles on the ground, or as
there have been moments of time since time begun; it would be some comfort to
thee in enduring them, some hope of being delivered from, them. But this
eternity of Death and Torments will quite break thy heart; would make the very
stinging of Ants and Fleas intolerable. Eternity is the very Hell of Hell. One
said, O Vita mortifera! O Mors immortais! Et quomodo tandem te appellabimus?
Vitam, an mortem? Si vita es, quomodo occidis? Si mors es, quomodo duras? etc.
Rob. Bellarmin. in Conc. 3 de Cruciatibus Gehennae, part. 2. p. 467. Colon.
1626.
O deadly life! O immortal death! What shall I term thee? Life? And wherefore
then do thou kill? Death? And wherefore then do thou endure? There Is
neither life nor death but has something good in it; for in life there is some
ease, and in death an end; but thou have neither ease, nor end. What then shall
I style thee? Even the bitterness of both; for of death thou have the torment,
without any end, and of life the continuance, without any ease. God has
subtracted both from life and from death, all that is good: the residue he
has mixed together, and therewith tempered the torments of Hell. O bitter Cup,
which all sinners impenitent shall drink at Gods hand!

This, this, O Natural man, is a brief shadow of thy sinful and wretched
condition by Nature. But the one half, the tenth part, is not told thee. O, How
can thine heart hold from breaking, thine eyes from dropping, thy bowels from
turning within thee? How can thou eat or drink with any comfort? How can
thou slumber or sleep one night in quiet? How can thou possess, or go about
any worldly thing with delight, whilst thou art ingulfed in this sinful, and
woeful, Natural condition.

II. Direction.
BE clearly and fully convinced in thy Conscio^ce, O Natural man, That thou
still remainest in this thy sinful and wretched condition, un-converted,
un-regenerate, un-renewed, until this present day. That, thou art still in the
first Adam, and not as yet transplanted into Christ the last Adam. That, thou
art still in thy sinful and miserable state of Nature, and not hitherto
translated into an holy and happy state of Grace. That, thou art in thy sins
still, 1 Cor. 15. 17. Thou art in the flesh still, Romans 8. 8. Thou art dead in
sins and trespasses still, Ephesians. 2. 1, 5. Col. 2. 13. Thou art in darkness, and
very darkness it self still, 1 Ioh. 2. 9, 11. Ephesians. 5. 8. Thou art an enemy to
God still, Romans 8. 6, 7. Col. 1. 21. Thou art wholly displeasing to God still,
Romans 8. 8. Finally, That thou art in thy cursed and damned state still, Gal. 3.
10. Ioh. 3. 18, 36.

Here therefore I shall offer to thee chiefly two things for thy most serious
consideration, viz.

I. That, it is most necessary for thee, O Natural man, to be thoroughly
convinced, That thou still remainest in thy most sinful and wretched state of
Nature, even until now. For,

1. Until thou be thoroughly convinced, O Natural man, that thou still
remainest in thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, thou will be apt to
flatter thy self into a fond and groundless imagination, that thou art in a
good spiritual state toward God, especially if thou have been kept by Gods
common restraining grace, from grosser sins, and have been exercised in some
outward acts of Religion and righteousness. Thus the un-convinced Pharisee,
though in his un-justified Natural state, had an high opinion of his good
spiritual state beyond other men, and beyond the Publican, and bragged of it
even in his prayer to God, because he avoided some gross sins, and practiced
some outward duties, Luke 18. 9. to 15. Thus Paul before his conviction and
conversion, thought himself alive once without the Law, by reason of his
outward unblameableness, legal privileges, and external exercises of Religion:
but when the Commandment came and convinced him, sin revived and he died.
Compare Romans 7. 9. with Phil. 3. 4, 5, 6. Thus the Laodicean Angel had an high
opinion of his own good estate, till Christ convinced him of the contrary, and
taught him the right way of bettering his condition, Rev. 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.
The Natural man's self-opinionateness of his good estate, seals him up
incurably in his bad estate. Many might have attained to a great degree of
Christianity, if they had not presumed themselves to be Christians good enough
already.

2. Until thou art fully convinced, O Natural man, that thou still remainest in
thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, thou will never be kindly humbled for,
nor become weary of, thy Natural state. Without conviction, there is no true
sense of sin and misery: without true sense of sin and misery, who will be
humbled for it or weary of it? Conviction, How did it humble Manasses? 2 Chronicles.
33. How did it abase Paul? Act. 9. Who can clearly see his own Natural
sinfulness and wretchedness, and not abhor himself as in dust and ashes? Zech.
12. 10, etc.

3. Until thou be kindly convinced of thy present sinfulness and
wretchedness by Nature, thou will never seriously and sincerely seek out for
supernatural remedy. When Peter's Hearers were convinced and pricked in heart,
then they presently repair to the Apostles, saying, Men and brethren what shall
we do? Act. 2. 36, 37. When the Iaylor's heart was convinced and shaken as well
as the foundations of the Prison, he presently enquires of Paul and Silas,
Sirs, what must I do be saved? Act. 16. 30. There are three steps toward the
cure of a sick body, and of a sinful soul, viz. Inveuire morbum, To find out
and be convinced of the malady; Adire medicum, To have recourse to the
Physician for direction; and Applicare medicinam, To apply the medicine for the
attaining of recovery. Who will seek to the Physician or apply any remedy, that
feels no smart of his malady?

4. Until thou art fully convinced, O Natural man, that thou continuest still
in thy Natural sinfulness and wretchedness, thou will never repent, and turn
from thy sinful estate to God. Till the Prodigal soundly smarted under sense of
his sin and misery, he never came to himself, or to a penitent resolution of
returning to his Father. But then he comes, and says, Father, I have sinned
against heaven and before thee -- etc. Luke 15. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21.
Here see, how conviction and lively sense of sin and misery, put him upon
serious Consideration: Consideration put him upon penitential Resolution,
Return, Repentance, Confession, Reformation, and humble Supplication.

5. Until thou, O Natural man, shall be thoroughly convinced of the sinfulness
and wretchedness of thy present Natural state wherein thou remainest unto this
present day, thou never give an actual entertainment and present welcome in
thy soul, unto Jesus Christ and him crucified, as the only remedy against this
sinfulness and wretchedness of thy Natural condition. It Is the sense of present
pain, that makes the Patient cry out for means of ease till he find it, and
having obtained it, how does be esteem it and delight in it? It Is the
apprehension of present danger at Sea in a storm, that makes the Passengers cry
to God and man to help, Jonah 1. 5, 6. Psalm. 107. 25, 26, 27, 28. and if the
storm cease, and the Sea becomes still, that they can come to their desired
Haven, Oh how welcome and acceptable is the Haven unto them! Psalm. 107, 29, 30.
So here; It Is the conviction of thy present Natural sinfulness and
wretchedness, that makes thee in thy servent desires even thirst and long after
Christ, the only Redeemer, vehemently; and upon obtaining of Christ, makes thee
prize him highly, love him dearly, and delight in him most contentedly: As the
penitent soul did, in like case, who washed Christ's feet with her tears, wiped
them with the hairs of her head, kissed them, and anointed them with ointment,
Luke 7. 37. to the end. Oh, how acceptable is Christ's Redemption, to them that
feel their bondage under sin and misery! How amiable is Christ's all sufficiency
for salvation, to them that are apprehensive of their sins damnation! And how
precious, sweet and delectable is Christ's sin-cleansing and soul-saving blood,
to them that are aright convinced of the wormwood, bitterness and gall of their
Natural sinfulness and wretchedness! Ease is always acceptable; but double
acceptable after tormenting pain: Health is always sweet; but double sweet
after long, tedious and tyring sickness: Life is always pleasant; but to have
returned from the brink of the grave to life again, is a double life.

Thus, O Natural man, it appears plainly, how necessary and advantageous it is
for thee to be convinced, of the sinfulness and wretchedness of thy Natural
state, wherein thou still remainest even until now.

II. How, and by what Discoveries, thou may be clearly convinced, O Natural
man, that thou still remainest in thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, in
the first Adam; comes now to be considered, and to be considered by thee most
seriously.

Know thou therefore, O man, O woman, whoever thou art, That the great God
has, in his faithful Word, certainly discovered and declared, every one, and
consequently thy self in particular, to be and remain still in the Natural
state of sin and misery: If these ensuing notes and characters of a state of
sin and misery do certainly belong to them and to thee, viz.

1. If thou art without God in the world, (...). Ephesians. 2. 12. compared with
verse 3. wherein the Apostle intimates; That the Ephesians, while in their
sinful and wretched state of Nature, were without God in the world, and while
without God in the world, they were children of wrath, even as others. Art thou
not without God? Where Is the divine Nature? 2 Pet. 1. 4. Where Gods Image? Ephesians.
4. 24. Col. 1. 10. Where the life of God? Ephesians. 4. 18.

2. If thou art still without Christ, [that at that time (i. e. while in your
Natural state) ye were without Christ] Ephesians. 2. 12. with verse 3. Christless men
are Godless men, for it is by Christ, as the way, whereby we come unto God as
the end, Ioh. 14. 6. Heb. 7. 25. And Godless men are graceless men, sinful,
wretched men; for God alone is the Author of all grace, 1 Pet. 5. 10. Ephesians. 2.
8. Art not without God? Then is Christ thine Head and Husband to guide thee?
Ephesians. 5. 22, 24. Thy Lord and King to rule thee? Col. 2. 6. Thy Christ to
anoint thee? 1 Ioh. 2. 20, 27. Thine Inhabitant to dwell in thee? Ephesians. 3. 17.

3. If thou art still without the Spirit of God, and of Christ inhabiting in
thee. Remarkable is that of the Apostle -- Ye are not in the flesh, but in the
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not
the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, Romans 8. 9. Here the Apostle intimates,
1. That, the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Christ, is one and the same
Spirit. 2. That, to be Christ's, and to be in the Spirit, amounts in effect to
the same thing. 3. That, they who have the Spirit of God and of Christ dwelling
in them, are not in the flesh, (i. e. in their sinful and wretched state of
Nature) but in the Spirit, (i. e. in a spiritual, holy, and happy state of
grace. And 4. That, they who have not the Spirit of Christ, are none of
Christ's, are not in the Spirit, but in the flesh, i. e. in their sinful and
wretched state of Nature.

Now, they have not the Spirit of God, and of Christ,

(1) Who are Unregenerate and Unrenewed. For the Spirit of God, and of Christ
is a Regenerating Spirit, Ioh. 3. 5, 6. 8. A Renewing Spirit, Tit. 3. 5. He
renews the whole man, in part. All things become New. 2 Cor. 5. 17.

(2) Who are Unsanctified and Unholy. For the Spirit of God and of Christ is an
Holy Spirit, Psalm. 5. 111. Ephesians. 1. 13. and 4. 30. The Holy Ghost 2 Cor. 13. 14.
Tit. 3. 5. 2. Pet. 1. 21. 1 Ioh. 5. 7. Jude verse. 20. And all those that are
builded by the Spirit for an Habitation of God, are by him made an Holy Temple
in the Lord, Ephesians. 2. 21. 22. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 17. And this Holy Spirit is the
peculiar and immediate Author of Sanctification and Holiness to all Gods Elect,
1 Pet. 1. 2. A Spirit of Grace. Zech. 12. 10.

(3) Who are grossly ignorant of the Spiritual things of God, So as not to
receive them, but to count them foolishness. 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ephesians. 4. 18. For, The
Spirit of God and of Christ is A Spirit of Truth, leading unto all Truth, Ioh.
16. 13. A Spirit of wisdom and Revelation for the knowledge and acknowledging
of the God of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians, 1. 17. etc.

(4) Who are not of Gods own family, are not his Adopted children nor are
furnished with Filial Confidence, Fear, Love, Obedience, and other Childlike
Properties. For, The Spirit of God and of Christ is a Spirit of Adoption where
he dwells, Romans 8. 15. Confirmin^g their Sonship, and assuring them of their
Adopted State, 1. As a Witness Romans 8. 16. 2. As a Seal, Ephesians. 1. 13. 3. As an
Earnest of their Inheritance, Ephesians. 1. 14. And 4. As a first fruits, Romans 8.
23.

5. Who are prayer-less persons, wholly unable with filial faith, zeal and
affection, to cry, Abba Father. For the Spirit of God and of Christ is a Spirit
of prayer, a Spirit of grace and supplication, Zech 12. 10. enabling Gods
children to cry fervently, Abba Father, Romans 8. 15. and the Spirit helps our
prayer- infirmities, when we know not what to pray for as we ought. For he
makes intercession for us, ( viz. by enabling us to intercede for our selves)
with unutterable groans, (i. e. with unutterable desires and longings of soul)
Romans 8. 26, 27.

4. If thou art still without the immediate, fundamental, and saving effects of
the Spirits of God and of Christ, viz. Regeneration, Ioh. 3. 3, 5, 6, 8.
Renovation, Tit. 3. 5. New Creation in Christ, Ephesians. 2. 10. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
Conversion from sin and Satan to God, Act. 26. 18. Effectual vocation, 2 These.
2. 13, 14. 2 Cor. 6. 1, 2. Ioh. 6. 44. And Sanctification, 1 Pet. 1, 2. 2 These.
2. 13. By which Gods Spirit brings sinners out of the state of Nature: Then art
still in the sinful and wretched state of Nature.

5. If thou art still unbelieving, without faith unfeigned, as by Nature all
are, Tit. 1. 15. 2 These. 3. 2. And having no hope, no well-grounded hope of
salvation and happiness by Christ, in this or the world to come, as is the
condition of all in state of Nature, Ephesians. 2. 12. Then thou remainest in the
state of Nature to this hour.

6. If thou continuest still impenitent and un-reformed to this day, not turned
from darkness to light, nor from the power of Satan to God, Act. 26. 18. Col.
1. 13. Thou art still in thy sinful and wretched state of Nature. For by
repentance God brings men unto himself, into a spiritual, supernatural state of
life, holiness and happiness, Act. 2. 38. and 5. 31. and 26. 18. -- Repentance
unto life, Act. 11. 18. Ezekiel. 18. 30, 31, 32.

7. If thou do habitually and primarily mind the things of the flesh. If thy
thoughts, contrivances, designs, etc. are chiefly about carnal and worldly
things, how to grow great, rich, etc. but seldom or never mindest the things of
the Spirit, how to obtain Christ, how to be saved, how to make thy calling and
election sure, how to make Heaven sure, how to walk with God, etc. Then thou
art still after the flesh, Romans 8. 5, etc.

8. If thy mind and wisdom be enmity against God, and cannot endure to be
subject to the Law of God, then it is carnal, Romans 8. 7. Col. 1. 21. The
Natural man's mind is so set upon sinful principles and wicked works, that it
cannot choose but hate God and his Law that utterly condemn them.

9. If thou art not a lover, but a hater of Gods people, in whom Gods image
appears and shines forth. He that hates his brother, is in darkness, (viz. in
the darkness of a sinful and miserable state by Nature) and walks in
darkness, 1 John 2. 9, 19, 11. -- He that loves not his brother, abides in
death. Whosoever hates his brother, (i. e. his Christian brother, for God,
Christ, Grace, Godliness, etc. in him,) is a Murderer: and ye know that no
murderer has eternal life abiding in him, 1 Ioh. 3. 14, 15.

10. If thou art under the Power of darkness, Col. 1. 13. The Natural man is
not only Dark in the Concreet but Darkness itself in the Abstract, Ephesians. 5. 18.
He is so dark, that he is all darkness, and nothing but darkness, therefore he
is under the reign and power of it, so that he cannot by any ability of his own
Extricate or deliver himself out of it.

The Natural man is under the power of a threefold Darkness. viz.

(1) The darkness of Sin, Sins are works of Darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11. The State of
Sin is a state of darkness. Such are dead in Sins and trespasses: and as dead,
they are overwhelmed with darkness, dwelt in darkness. Ephesians. 2. 1. 5.

(2) The darkness of Ignorance. This in part is that darkness that blinds the
Eyes of Natural man, 1 Ioh. 2. 11. So that he cannot receive the things of God,
they are Foolishness to him, neither can he know them; because they are
Spiritually discerned, 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 14. The Gospel is hid to them
that are lost, the God of this world having blinded the minds of them that
believe not, least the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto
them. 2 Cor. 3, 4.

(3) The Darkness of misery, by reason of his Sinfulness. The Scripture
frequently expresses misery under the Notion of Darkness which is very
uncomfortable and dreadful: As, the Miseries in this life, Psalm. 88. 6. and
107. 10. In death, Job. 10. 21, 22. In Hell, where is utter Darkness, Mat. 22.
13. and 25. 30. Blackness of darkness for ever Jude verse. 13. Everlasting
chains under darkness, Jude 6. The Natural man being a child of wrath, Ephesians. 2,
3. having the wrath of God abiding on him, and being condemned already, Ioh. 3.
18. 36 may well be said to be under the power of darkness.

11. If thou art under the Power of Satan hitherto, thou art still in thy
Sinful and wretched State of Nature. For every man Naturally is under Satan's
Power and dominion, till he be supernaturally converted unto God. Act. 26. 18.
Hence Satan is called, The Father of such, Ioh. 8. 44. The Prince of this
world, Ioh. 14. 30. The Prince of this power of the Air, the spirit that
effectually works in the children of disobedience, Ephesians. 2. 2. The God of this
world, 2. Cor. 4. 4.

Now thou art under the power of Satan.

(1) While Satan blinds thine eyes, so that the Gospel is hid to thee. Is a
mystry, a Paradox, to thee, etc. -- left the glorious Light of the Gospel
should shine unto thee. 2 Cor. 4. 4.

(2) While thou art an Unbeliever, 2 Cor. 4. 4.

(3) While thou art (...), a son, or Child of Disobedience. Gr. of
Vnpersuadeableness, Ephesians. 2. 2. who are most disobedient to God, Christ and his
Spirit. Unperswadeable by his word, Promises, etc. to repent, believe, etc.

(4) While thou art acted, and energetically wrought upon by the Spirit that is
the Prince of the Power of the a yr. Ephesians. 2. 2. (...) the spirit now
energetically-working, or effectually working. He effectually works in such,
when he prevails with his Temptations over them, when he attains his will upon
them, etc.

(5) While thou art resolvedly set and determined wilfully, to do the lusts of
the Devil, Ioh. 8. 44.

(6) While thou art held in the Snare of the Devil, and held Captive by him at
his will, 2 Timothy 2. 26. Gr. (...), Taken alive, It seems to be a Metaphor, from
Captains and Conquerors, who in war take their Enemies alive, carry them away
in triumph, and use them as they please: Or from Huntsmen, who take their Prey
wild beasts alive, and do with them as they list. So Satan deals with the
Natural man, while under his power, he wholly enters him, orders him, acts him,
by his Suggestions as he will.

12. If thou art dead in Sins and Trespasses, and not as yet quickened by
Christ, Ephesians. 2. 1. 5. Col. 2. 13. thou art hitherto in thy Sinful and wretced
State of Nature. To be dead in Sin and Trespasses is to be Spiritually dead,
while thou art Naturally alive.

And art not thou Spiritually dead? Are not the Tokens of Spiritual Death
clearly upon thee?

(1) Art not thou quite destitute of the Fountain and Root of all Spiritual
life to the Soul? Christ is the Fountain of all Spiritual Life, being united to
the Soul by Faith, Gal. 2. 20. Ioh. 11. 25, 26. As the Soul is the Fountain of
Natural Life being u^^ted to the body* the body is dead, when without the Soul:
Iam. 2. 26. So the Soul is dead in every Natural man, while he is without
Christ. Ephesians. 2. 1. 5. 12.

(2) Art thou not wholly destitute of any spiritual sense rightly to discern
and receive the things of God? 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14.

And where there is no Soul, there is no life.

(3) Art thou not utterly destitute of Spiritual Breath? viz. The sacred
breathings of strong cries and groans, ^ervent desires and prayers, crying Abba
Father? This is their breath, that are spiritually alive, Romans 8, 15. -- 26,
27. No sooner was Saul* converted and quickened by Christ: but the Lord told
Ananias; -- behold he prays, Act 9. 11. Breath and Life come and go together.
Genesis 2. 7. Psalm. 104. 29. If thou art without this spiritual breathing, this
Spirit of Prayer, thou art without the Spirit of Life from Christ, and
remainest dead in Sin.

(4) Art thou not without all vital Heat and Spirit, warmth of heart, desire,
love, and all good affections toward God, Christ, his people, and his ways:
and even stone-cold as to all matters of Religion, Devotion, divine Worship, as
carnal men use to be? Rev. 3. 15, 16

Then thou art not only mortally ^ick; but quite dead in Sin, stretched-out,
and ready to be buried in the infernal pit. As where there is Natural warmth in
the body, there is life: where nothing but Coldness, there is Death.

13* If thou art still an habitual worker of iniquity, A Tradesman in sin: Thou
art still in thy Natural state and Condition. Such Christ will not at all own,
but eternally reject at the last day. Mat. 7. 23. ^Tis one thing to sin, or
slip into sin accidently; another to trade in sin constantly, habitually, and
to yield up his members as tools of unrighteousness unto Sin. Romans 6. 12, 13.
etc.

14, Finally, Thou art still in thy mere Natural sinful state, if in the whole
course of thy life thou walk according to the Course of this World; The
Lusts and wills of the Flesh, The suggestions, Temptations and operations of
the Devil. All such are dead in sin, and by Nature Children of wrath. See all
this most fully in Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3.

III. Direction.
COnsider often with all Ser^^usness, D Natural Man, That living and dying in
this thy Sinful and wretched Condition of Nature, thou (...) utterly lost both
Body and Soul for evermore: And caust not expect any other portion after this
present momentary Life, than everlasting Torments in unquenchable Fire with the
Devil and his Angels. Compare diligently, Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3. Luke 13. 3. 5. and
Ioh. 3. 36. with Mat. 25. 41. to the end. Luke 16. 24. Jude 7. Math. 9. 43, 44.
As was formerly In the close of the I. Direction.
intimated.

Here therefore, O Sinful and wretched Natural Man, I beseech thee let these 2
things sink deep into thine heart, viz.

1. That, Thou living and dying in this thy Natural State, shall certainly
perish both Body and Soul in Everlasting torments in Fire Prepared for the
Devil and his Angels. Math. 25. 41. For,

1. If thou live and die in thy Natural State of Sin, Thou live and die
Without Christ and without Hope, Ephesians. 2. 1. 2. with verse. 12. Christless and
Hopeless. And therefore Hopeless, because Christless: For Jesus Christ is our
Hope, i. e. The sure foundation of all our Hope of Salvation, 1. Tim. 1. 1.
What? Christless? How then can thou be saved? Who ever was, or can be saved
without Christ? Act. 4: 11. 12. And Hopeless too? yes. For, who can once expect
or look for Salvation by Christ, without Hope?

2. If thou live and die in thy Sinful and wretched state of Nature, Then
thou live and die a most Cursed Creature, Gal. 3. 10. and A Child of wrath,
even as others, Ephesians. 2. 1. 2. 3. what? Cursed? For what? For that thou
continuest not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do
them, Gal. 3. 10. because thou do not perform, as is thy duty, perfect,
perpetual, personal obedience to all things in Gods Law, which, nor thou, nor
any mere man since Adam's Fall, could ever perform. (2:) To what art thou
cursed? 1. To pains of Loss and Sense, Mat. 25. 41. Depart ye cursed -- There Is
pains of Loss. Depart from Christ, from the only Redeemer, Gal. 3. 13. From the
only All-sufficient Savior, Heb. 7. 25. From the one only Mediator betwixt God
and man, 1 Timothy 2. 5. From the only way unto the Father, Ioh. 14. 6. From the
hope and consolation of Israel, etc. 1 Timothy 1. 1. Luke 2. 25. Oh! who can so
depart from Christ, and that for ever, and not be cursed? 2. To pains of Sense:
Depart into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. What, into
fire? What is more sharp and tormenting to the Sense, then fire? Into
everlasting fire? Then no hopes of relaxation or deliverance thence, after
millions and ten thousand millions of years, etc. Everlasting, kills the soul.
Oh! who can dwell with everlasting burnings? Into everlasting fire prepared?
Prepared by God. Tophet is ordained of old, -- he has made it deep and large,
the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the LORD like a stream of
brimstone does kindle it, Isa. 3. 33. And if God have prepared it, whose
wisdom, power, justice, wrath, etc. are infinite, how dreadful is that
Preparation! No men, Angels or Creatures, can make such Preparation. Prepared
for the Devil and his Angels. Oh what a dreadful preparation must that needs
be! What? To be everlastingly racked with the Devil and his Angels; the worst
of all society? To be everlastingly tormented in fire prepared for the Devil
and his Angels? What an aggravation will this be of these infernal fiery
torments? No torments in the world like these torments. (3.) And by whom art
thou, and shall thou be thus dreadfully cursed? By the glorious and living God,
in his Word, Gal. 3. 10. And by the Lord Jesus Christ, at the great day, Mat.
25. 41. O dismal, soul-damning Curse! What Natural man, so dying, can escape
it, or endure it? Whom God and Christ curses, they are cursed; whom God and
Christ blesses, they are blessed indeed.

3. If thou live and die in thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, Thou will be eternally shut out from God, Christ, and all the Blessed Saints and
Angels, unto the Devil, his Angels and Reprobates; from Heaven, to Hell; from
light, to darkness; from joy, to grief; from mercy, to misery; from happiness,
to unhappiness; from life, to death; from all good, into a conflux of all evil.
Compare Mat. 18. 3. Ioh. 3. 3, 5. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. with
Mat. 23. 33. Rev. 21. 8. Mat. 25. 41, 46.

II. That, There Is weighty cause why these thoughts and Considerations should
strike deep into thy heart, and dwell there. For,

1. This Life is the only season and seed-time of grace, for obtaining of
salvation, and preventing of damnation. Behold, now is the accepted time, now
is the day of salvation, 2 Cor. 6. 2. Now is the time of repenting, turning to
God, believing in Christ, of laying up for our selves treasures in Heaven, etc.
Act. 17. 30. Eccl. 12. 1. Mat. 6. 20. Therefore to day if thou will hear his
voice, harden not thy heart, Heb. 3. 7, 8, 15. Whatsoever thine hand finds to
do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor
wisdom in the grave whither thou g^est, Eccl. 9. 10. As the Tree falls, to
Heaven or Hell, so it will lie till the last day.

2. This present life of thine (which is the only seed-time of grace and
salvation) is most frail and short. Thou have here no continuing City; happy
were thou, did thou by faith unfaigned seek one to come. A City that bath
foundations, whose builder and maker is god, Heb. 3. 13, 14. with 11. 9, 10. We
are all strangers before God, and sojourners, as all our Fathers were, 1 Chronicles.
29. 15. Man born of a woman, is but short of days, and full of trouble, Job
14. 1. Man's Life is of no long computation, at most, in ordinary dispensation,
but 70 or 80 years, Psalm. 90. 10. And what is that to eternity? Thy Life is but
a few years, Job 16. 22. Months of number, Job 14. 5. A f^w and evil days,
Genesis 47. 9. An Hirelings day, which at most is but 12 hours, Job 14. 6. As
nothing, before God. Surely every max at his best estate is altogether vanity,
Selah, Psalm. 39. 5. O, with what pathetical similitudes does the Holy Ghost
represent the vanity and brevity of man's Life! Man's Life here is but a vapor,
appearing and disappearing, Iam. 4. 14. A wind, that blows and goes, Job 7. 7.
A flower, that flourishes and fades, Psalm. 103. 16, 17. Job. 14. 2. A fable or
tale told, almost as soon forgot as told, Psalm. 90. 9. A flood, speedily
flowing night and day, never returning, Psalm, 90. 5. A watchin the night, but 3
hours long, Psalm. 90. 4. A sleep, insensibly gone, Psalm. 90. 5. A shadow, or
show, without substance and reality, Job. 14. 2. Psalm. 39. 6.

Such is thy Life, O Natural man, thy day spends apace, thy night hastens
wherein thou can not work. Up and be doing: The journey to Heaven is a long
and difficult way; to fit thy self for Heaven is a great work. Lose not an
inch, a moment of time, lest it be too late. This day is thy flourishing, to
morrow may be thy funeral: So it was with that graceless fool, Luke 12. 20.
This night thou sleep in thy bed, ere many nights come thou may sleep in
thy grave. And then, if thy heavenly work be not done, thou art eternally
undone.

3. Thy Death is sure, Heb. 9. 27. Job 14. 5. 2 Samuel 14. 14. The dismal winter
does not more certainly pursue the summer and autumn, the darksome night not
more infallibly and speedily drive away the day, then thine unexpected Death
will thy momentany Life. Thy Death is then most certain, and most uncertain
thing in the world: most certain that it will come; most uncertain when, where,
how, it will come upon thee. Thy last day is concealed from thee, that every
day it may be expected by thee. Latet ultimus dies, ut observentur omnes dies.
August. Hom. 13. p. 441. B. Tom. 10. Basil. 1569.
Be always in readiness for God and Christ, lest Death surprise thee, and so
thou be shut out with the 5 foolish virgins, and the impenitent thief, Mar. 25.
10, 11, 12. Luke 23. 39, 40, 41.

4. Upon thy Death, O Natural man, Gods impartial judgment, and infernal
torments, will immediately pass upon thy soul, Heb. 9. 27. Luke 16. 22, 23, 24.
And upon both body and soul at the great day of the LORD, Mat. 25. 41, 46. 2
These. 1. 7, 8. And Oh how intolerable, incurable, and undeterminable will they
be! as has been intimated.

5. Finally, It were a thousand pities, that thy precious and immortal soul, OF
Natural man, should ever come into that place of torments. For, 1. Was not thy
sold a spark of immortality, which no mortals nor mere creatures can possibly
kill and destroy? Mat. 10. 28. 2. Was not thy soul, in its first Creation, the
principal receptacle and subject of the blessed Image of God? Genesis 1. 26, 27.
3. Is not thy soul still the seat of all thy reason, understanding, sense,
motion, strength, beauty, etc. and the very rise and guide of thy whole body,
without which it is no better than a dead, senseless, helpless, useless,
worthless, organized lump of earth? 4. Is not thy soul thy most precious jewel,
of more true worth and invaluable consequence to thee, then any thing in the
world, then the whole world besides? Christ who best knew the souls true value,
said; What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Mat. 16. 26. And will thou hazard this thy precious soul unto infernal torments for ever, for a few
rotten pleasures of sin for a season?

Now then, O Natural man, think seriously of all these things. Do thou
believe them? Can thou really be persuaded in thy conscience, that, living
and dying in this thy Natural state, infernal torments for ever and ever will
inevitably be thy portion? And is this a condition for thee to rest in? Is this
a state wherein thou can rejoice, that art every day in danger to tumble
headling into Hell? Is there so small a distance betwixt thee and Death
eternal, even a short span or moment of a temporary life, and will thou not yet
come out of Egypt? O, amend (said Dum potes emenda, dum tempus habes clama ad
omnipotentem Deum, dum datur spacium luge, dum licentia est paeniteas, festina
dum potes, dum anima versatur in corpore, dum adhuc vivis futurum remedium
require tibi prius, quam te profundum absorbeat Pelagus, and prius qu^^m te
malignus rapiat infernus, ubi nulla datur indulgentia, ubi nullus regreditur ad
veniam. De qua paena pius nos Dominus eripere dignetur. Aug. de Sanctis Sermon.
40. p. 1249, etc. Tom. 10. Basil. 1569.
Augustine) while thou can; cry to God Almighty while thou have time; lament
while thou have space; repent while thou have leave; make have while thou
can, while thy soul is in thy body, while thou live seek out for remedy,
before the huge deep swallow thee up* and before that woeful Hell snatch thee
away, where there is no indulgence, whence none return to receive remission.
From which punishment the gracious God vouchsafe to deliver us. So he,
pathetically.

IV. Direction.
DAily and deeply revolve in thy mind, How few they are that are effectually
recovered out of their Natural state of sin and misery, in comparison of the
innumerable multitudes that die and perish therein everlastingly. That this is
so, is evident;

1. By the express words of our Blessed Savior: Enter ye in at the strait
gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction,
and many there be which go in thereat: How strait is the way which leads unto
life, and few there be that find it, Mat. 7. 13, 14. What is this broad way
leading to destruction, but the sinful and wretched way of the world, the
flesh, and the Devil? Who are those many which go in thereat, but all those
that live and die in their sinful and wretched state of Nature? What is that
strait way leading unto life, but the way of God, by Christ, through faith? Who
those few that find this strait way, but those that are converted from darkness
to light, etc. Act. 26. 18. So then how few are the saved, in comparison of the
multitudes that perish!

2. By the paucity of those that were saved of old under the Old Testament,
from the days of the first Adam, till the death of Jesus Christ the last Adam.
For,

1. From Adam till Moses the Church of God was only domestical, confined within
certain Families succeeding one another, as within the Families of the 10
Patriarchs before the Flood, Adam, Seth, etc. and within the Families of the 12
Patriarchs after the Flood. Now during this time, which was above 2400 years,
how few were recovered out of their sinful and wretched state of Nature! For,
how few were within the Church of God, in comparison of them that were without?
And those that were without the Church, and so died, may generally be supposed
to have perished in their Natural state of sin and misery, (...)
which were far the greatest number of the whole world. For, 1. When in the
days of Noah, God brought the Flood of waters upon the old world, to destroy
all flesh that breathed, Genesis 6. 13, etc. and 7. 21, 22, 23. the world of the
ungodly, (as Peter styles them, 2 Pet. 2. 5.) was drowned, when only one Family
of Noah, in the whole world, consisting but of 8 souls, were saved in the Ark,
Genesis 6. 18. and 7. 7. with 1 Pet. 3. 20. And of these 8 one was a wretched and
cursed Cham, that mocked at his own Fathers nakedness, Genesis 9. 21, 22, 24, 25.
2. When God overthrew the Cities of Sodom, Gomorrha, Admah and Zeboim, he found
not 10 righteous persons in all those Cities, for then he would have spared all
for those tens sakes, Genesis 18. 32. Only 4 persons, viz. righteous Lot, with his
Wife and 2 Daughters, escaped the dreadful showers of fire and brimstone, Genesis
19. 15, 16. And one of these 4, for looking back, viz. Lot's Wife, was turned
into a pillar of salt; to season men's unsavory lusts after worldly things, as
Augustine Denique uxor Lot, ubi respexit, remansit, and in salem conversa
hominibus fidelibus quoddam praestitit condimenium, quo sapiant aliquid, unde
illud caveatur exemplum. Aug. de Civit. Dei, lib. 14. ca. 30. Tom. 5.
intimates. 3. In Job's time ( Job is conceived to be of Abraham by Keturah, by
General view of the Holy Scriptures, Edit. 2. p. 126, etc. A work like H.
Broughton's, perfected by T. Hayne.
some; his descent and time is variously reported by others, as I have
elsewhere See in my Key of the Bible, on the Book of Job,. 4.
showed; but generally he is thought to have lived in the times of the
Patriarchs by most) Satan had so overrun the whole earth, that none in the
earth, (i. e. very few, or none in visible and conspicuous manner) were found
righteous, fearing God and eschewing evil, forsaking the Idols of Egypt, as Job
did, Job 1. 1, 7, 8. and 2. 2, 3.

2. From Moses till Christ's Death, the Church of God became National, but was
confined only to one Nation, among all the Nations of the world, viz. the
Nation of the Jews, which were not more in number then any people, but the
fewest of all people, Exodus 19. 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2, 9. Deuteronomy. 7. 6, 7. Therefore,
few in comparison, were, during that time, recovered out of the state of sin
and misery by nature. Salvation was only of the Jews, Joh. 4. 22. And of such
few Proselytes of other Nations as came in and joined themselves to the people
of the God of Abraham, Psalm. 47. 9. All others were as foreigners and
strangers they, the Commonwealth of Israel, and household of God, Ephesians. 2. 12,
13, 19. All other were reputed no people, as having not obtained mercy; no
special saving mercy, they, the people of the living God, that had obtained
mercy, 1 Pet. 2. 9, 10. All others were accounted as dogs; they, the children,
Mat. 15. 26.

And yet all the Jews were not plucked out of their Natural state of sin and
misery* and saved. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel, Romans 9. 6.
And though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a
remnant shall be saved, Romans 9. 27. A remnant is but a small number to the
rest. Consider well; 1. All the men of Israel, able for war, from 20 years old
and upwards, were numbered in the wilderness to be 603550, Numb. 1. 46, 47.
besides the Levites; and all these, save Caleb and Ioshuah, for their unbelief
and murmuring against God, and the promised Land, were destroyed in the
wilderness, Numb 14 1, 2, etc. verse 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. to 39. 1 Cor. 10. 10.
Heb. 3. 17, 18, 19. Jude 5. 2. Many of them also for their other wickedness
were overthrown in the wilderness, 1 Cor. 10. 5. to 12. 3 In the days of the
Judges, they, even the generality of them fell away from Gods true Religion and
worship, unto heathenish Idolatries, and that frequently, therefore God often
gave them up into the hands of several sorts of oppressors, Judge. 2. 11. to 16.
4. In the days of Jeroboam, 10 Tribes of the 12 apostatized from God, and fell
to the Idolatry of the Calves in Dan and Bethel, and at last were carried
captive into Assyria for their wickedness; and the Scripture makes no mention
of their return, 1 King. 12. 28. to the end, and 19. 14, 18. 2 King. 17. 3. to
24. 5. The two Tribes of Judah and Benjamin remaining, grew very wicked from
time to time, especially in the reigns of wicked Kings: insomuch that at last
the face of all things in the Church was so corrupt, that both the King,
Priests and people grew to such an height of impiety, that there was no remedy,
and God gave them into the hand of the Chaldeans, who destroyed them without
pity, and carried them captive to Babylon, where they were in thraldom 70 years
together, 2 Chronicles. 36. 11. to 22. 6. Many of the Jews after their return from
the Babylonish Captivity, whereby they should have been reformed, fell into
sundry offenses in the days of Nehemiah, which he endeavored to reform; as,
most oppressive Usury, Neh 5. 7, etc. Prophanations of the Sabbath Day, Neh.
13. 15. to 23. Marriages with Wives of Ashdod, Ammon and Moab, Neh. 13. 23,
etc. 7. Finally, In the days of Antiochus, the whole face of Religion was
miserably corrupted, and the conscientious were cruelly persecuted, 1 Mac. 1.
45. to the end. And when our Blessed Savior became incarnate, the whole
affairs of Religion lay miserably prostrate and defaced. See Mat. 5. and 6, and
7, and 15, and 23.

Now, all these things Considered, How few can we rationally imagine to have
been plucked out of their sinful and wretched state of Nature, when iniquity so
abounded in the Church!

3. By the Scarcity of the Truth, Life, and Power of Godliness and
Christianity, even in the Visible Churches of Christ, now under the New
Testament: the fewness of those that are effectually recovered out of their
Natural state of Sin and misery may further appear. For,

1. In our Blessed Saviors days, as the Scribes and Pharisees had in a manner
engrossed all Religion to themselves, as is none were Religious but they, Luke
18. 9. etc. Phil. 3. 5. Act. 26. 5. So the whole Religion of the Scribes and
Pharisees stood in outward Forms, hypocritical appearances, etc. Rather then in
any sincere Realities, Math. 6. 2. 5. 16. and 15. 2. to 10. and 23, 2, to 8,
13. to 34. and therefore our Savior tells his hearers plainly; That Except
their Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; they
shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 5. 20.

2. The Apostle Paul has prophesied of perilous times to come in the last
days, viz. That men shall cloak and shelter their many notorious abominations,
under a form of Godliness, denying the Power thereof, 2 Timothy 3. 1 2, 3, 4, 5.

3. In the New Testament we are often informed how rare and precious true
Religion is. As, That, Christ's flock is but a little flock, Luke 12. 32. That,
of the ten Virgins, the one half were foolish, having lamps of Profession, no
Oil of Grace in them, Math. 25. 1. etc. That, in the flower of the Church, as
there is Wheat, so there is Chaff, and more Chaff than Wheat, Mat. 3. 12. That,
of four sorts of Hearers, there are three naught. Mat. 13. Luke 8. And, that it
is very observable, If out of the Visible Church you take away, All the
notoriously Profane, All the mere Moral and Civil honest men, All the gross
Hypocrites whose hypocrisy half an eye may discern, all the privy close
Hypocrites who know themselves to be Hypocrites, and all formal Hypocrites or
Temporary believers that believe only for a time, Luke 8. 13. Mat. 13. 20, 21.
the Residue will be very few, in Comparison, that are plucked by the hand of
Heaven out of their Natural state of Sin and misery, and thereby prepared for
eternal felicity.

V. Direction.
EArnestly and Effectually lay to heart, O Natural Man, How happy it would be
for thy poor Soul, to he one of those few recovered out of the Sinful and
wretched state of Nature; rather then one of those many that live and die and
so perish therein eternally, Luk, 13. 24. Mat* 7. 13, 14.

O, do not follow a multitude to do evil, Exodus 23. 2. To walk according to the
Course of this World; to do, as most do; to swim down the Common stream; etc,
is the Natural man's way and delight, Ephesians. 2. 1; 2, 3. But it is no safe way.
The broad way has most Company, but the worst issue, Destruction: The Narrow
way has fewest passengers, but the best Event, eternal life. Mat. 7. 13. 14.
Will it not be infinitely better for thee, To be converted with afew, then to
remain carnal with a Multitude? To be Justified, adopted, acquitted at last
day, and eternally saved with a few; rather then to be held guilty, cast out of
Gods family, condemned at the last day, and eternally tormented with the
greatest multitude? will it be any ease to thy (...), to be tormented with the
greater Company: when the numerousness of the Tormented will but augment and
aggravate one another torments? Oh it will be far happier for thee, to be in
Abraham's bosom with one Lazarus, then to be tormented in infernal Flames with
Dives and all his five brethren, Luke 16. 23. 28. and with all the ungodly of
the World.

VI. Direction
FUlly be convinced, O Natural Man, How impossible a thing it is for thee or
for any of the Sons of Adam, to be effectually brought out of this Sinful and
wretched state of Nature, into an holy and happy state of Grace, by any ability
or sufficiency of our own, or by the Sole Assistance or influence of any mere
Creature in the whole world.

This is a point of great Consequence. For clearing of it I shall endeavor to
show, 1, what Natural man cannot do for delivering himself out of his Sinful
and wretched state of Nature. 2. What he can and ought to do, 3. How, for not
doing, what he can and ought to do he shall justly perish for ever.

I, Natural man in order to his effectual Recovery out of his Sinful and
wretched state of Nature, cannot do these things following. O Natural man thou
can do none of these things, viz.

1. Thou can not Circumcise thineheart from its natural filthiness, Deuteronomy. 30.
16. nor take away thine heart of Stone, can not remove the natural hardness
of thine heart in unbelief, impenitency, and Sin: Nor free thy self from thy
Death in Sins and trespasses. This is Gods peculiar work, Ezekiel. 36. 26. Ephesians 2.
1. 5.

2. Thou can not furnish thy self with the Spirit of God, the Spirit of
Grace, of Regeneration, of Renovation: nor with the Principle and Habits of
Grace infused into the Soul, as Repentance unto Life, Faith unto Salvation,
etc. These are not of ourselves, they are the proper Gifts of God, See Zech.
12. 10. Ezekiel 36. 26, 27. Act. 11. 18. and 5. 31. Ephesians. 2. 8.

3. Thou can not Actuate, Exert and draw into Exercise the Principles and
Habits of Divine Grace already infused and instilled into thy Soul: but by Gods
special assisting and Cooperating Grace. Turn thou me, and I shall be turned,
-- Surely after that I was turned, I repented --. Ier. 31. 18, 19. -- It is God
that works in us ((...) both to will, and to do, of his good pleasur^* Phil.
2. 13. Christ said; -- without me ye can do nothing Ioh. 15. 5. Paul
acknowledges; -- not that we are ^ufficient of our selves to think any thing
as of our selves: but our sufficiency is of God. 2. Cor. 3. 5. Of God we must
have Preventing Grace, that we may will: Subsequent Grace, that we may not will
in vain. In Gratia pr^veniens, qu^ velimus: subsequens, ne frustra velimus. D.
J. Prideaux. Lect. 3. de Great. universali.. 4. p. 39.
Augustines judgment, they are most sharply and vehemently to be resisted, who
think, that without the help of God, by the very force of Humane will, they are
able either to perfect righteousness, or to profit in tending thereunto. And
elsewhere he speaks notably of Gods Preventing and following Grace; -- He
prevents us, that we may be healed: He will follow us, that being healed we may
grow. He prevents us, that we may be called: He follows us, that we may be
glorified. He prevents us, that we may live piously: He follows us, that we may
live with him perpetually. For, without him we can do nothing. -- Misericordia
ejus praevenit nos. Praevenit autem, ut sanemur: quia and subsequetur ut etiam
Sanati vegetemur. Praevenit ut vocemur, subsequetur ut Glorificemur. Praevenit
ut pie vivamus, subsequetur ut cum illo semper vivamus, quia sne illo nihil
possumus facere. August. lib. de Natura and Gratia contra Pelagianos. cap. 32.
Tom. 7.


6. Thou can not subdue the reign and dominion of thy sins, casting them as
into the depths of the Sea, mortifying them and crucifying them, Mi^. 7. 19.
Romans 8. 13. Gol. 3. 5. Nor can thou finally purge and cleanse thy self so
completely from all incident corruption, that neither spot nor wrinckle nor any
such thing may remain. Ephesians. 5. 25, 26, 27. These are the singular works of God
and of Jesus Christ by his Spirit, with, or without the means of Grace.

4. Thou can not by any power of thine own, or by the help of any creature,
Come unto Christ, so as to accept him for thine only Savior; nor by Christ
unto God, as thy God in Covenant: Except God himself, the Father of Jesus
Christ draw thee. Ioh. 6. 44. But if he please effectually to draw thee, to
draw thy mind, thy Conscience, T^y will, Thine Heart and Affections, then thou
shall not only come to him, but even run after him. Cant 1. 4.

5. Thou can not of thy self seriously and sincerely, so as thereby to please
God, so much as will or desire Jesus Christ, and God in him, in order to thine
eternal happiness. For, It Is God that works in us to will as well as to do,
Phil. 2. 13. It Is Gods Spirit that puts desires and groans into the heart: For,
we know not what to pray for as we ought, what to will or desire as we ought,
etc. Romans 8. 26. 27.

2. Finally, Thou can not of thyself do that which may be acceptable unto
God, nor bring forth fruit unto God, without Christ's special influence and
assistance. Ioh. 15. 4, 5. Philip. 2. 13.

Now then, O Natural man, seeing these things are utterly beyond the sphere of
thine activity, 1. Presume not that thou can be thine own Savior or
Deliverer out of thy Sinful and wretched state of Nature, by any Universal
Grace or Freedom of will. 2. But deny thy self and all thy self-sufficiencies
in this point utterly. 3. Seek for Recovery out of thy Natural state of Sin and
misery, from the omnipotent God alone.

II. A mere Natural man, notwithstanding, is able to do many things and he
ought to do them, in order to his Recovery out of his Sinful and wretched state
of Nature. O thou Natural man God has furnished thee with sundry Talents
improvable in some measure to this End: These thou must not hide in a Napkin,
or bury in the Earth* but ought to improve to the uttermost. Mat, 25. 14, to
31. with Luke 19. 12. to 28. Particularly,

1. Thou art able to consider of many things very conducible to thy Recovery
out of thy Natural state, Ezekiel. 18. 27* 28. Luk 15. 17. etc. These thou
should take into serious Consideration. As, 1. That thy Natural state is most
Sinful and wretched, as was manifested. 2. That Every one living and dying in
his Natural state, shall everlastingly perish without remedy. Mat. ^8. 3. Ioh.
3. 3. 5. and 8. 24. Act. 4. 11, 12. 3. That no man can effectually and fully
rescue himself out of his Natural state, by his own ability, Ioh. 1. 12. Phil.
2. 13. Ephesians. 2. 1. 5. 4. That, now as during this present life, man is to be
recovered out of his Natural Condition, or never. 2 Cor. 6. 1. 2. Ecles. 9. 10.
Heb. 9. 27. 5. That thy Soul is most precious: and no Treasures of this world,
no Pleasures of Sin, no Pinnacle of Earthly Honors, can countervail the loss of
thy Soul, Mat. 16. 26.

2. Thou art able in some measure, to search, prove, and examine thy state and
ways, so as to be convinced of the badness of them, and danger of Continuing
in them, 2 Cor. 13. 5. Lam. 3. 39. 40.

3. Thou have ability, upon discovery of thy Sinful, wretched, and dangerous
Condition, to humble thy self deeply in the sight of God, for it. Manasses in
chains, did it, 2 Chronicles. 33. ^1, 12. The Prodigal in misery resolved it* Luke
15. 17. 18. 19.

4. Thou can confess thine iniquities; upon Conviction vilest offenders have
done it, as, Acham, Josh. 7. 20. 21. King Pharaoh, Exodus 10. 16. 17. King Saul,
1 Samuel 15. 24. Judas, Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5.

5. Thou may in some sort forsake and turn from many iniquities: though not
sincerely, nor from all entirely. Herod for a while did forbear to put John
Baptist to death, though he mortally hated him for Her^dias sake, Mat. 14. 3.
to 13. Haman vexed extremely at Mordicai's not bowing, yet refrained himself
from present Revenge, Est. 5. 9. 10. Pharisees abstained from many outward
gross sins, Luke 18. 11. Saul, whilst a Pharisee, was touching the law
blameless, Phil. 3. 6. Judas lived so inoffensively among the Apostles, that
when Christ declared that one of them should betray him, none suspected Judas
more then themselves, Mat. 26, 21. to 26. Ioh. 13. 21, 22, 23.

6. Thou art able to attend upon, and make use of, all the outward means of
grace, ordinary and extraordinary. Mere Natural men, carnal men, have done thus
much heretofore, and such may do the like hereafter. Can not thou, O Natural
man, hear the Word of God preached? when the three bad grounds, the three sorts
of bad hearers did, Mat. 13. 19, etc. When Herod heard John Baptist gladly,
Mar. 6. 20. When Scribes and Pharisees heard Christ, Mat. 21. 45. When Judas
heard Jesus preach often. When Simon Magus heard Philip preaching, Act. 8. 12,
13. Can not thou partake the Sacraments? when Simon the Sorcerer was
baptized, Act. 8. 13. When the Corinthians came to the Lords Supper, though
many unworthily, and smarted for it, 1 Cor. 11. 29, 30. Could they not have
come better? Can not thou pray after a sort? when the Mariners in^ Ionas's
ship prayed in the storm, Jonah 1. 5, 6. When Pharisees pray, Mat. 6. 5. and
Luke 18. 10, etc. Can not thou sanctify the Sabbath Day? when Scribes and
Pharisees were so zealous against the breach and profanation of the Sabbath,
Mat. 12. 1, 2. Ioh. 5 16, 18. Can not thou humble thy self with fasting? when
Ahab did it, 1 King. 21. 27, 28. When the Heathen City Nineveh did it, Jonah 3.
5. to 10. When Pharisees did it often, Luke 18. 10. 11. etc.

7. Finally, Thou can O natural man, do much good, perform many religious
Exercises and Christian duties, as our hearing reaped much Spiritual Benefit by
the means of Grace. What other mere Natural men have done, thou may do. As,

(1.) Thou may give much Alms to the poor. So did the carnal Pharisees, Mat.
6. 1, 2. So the blinded Papists.

(2.) Thou may show much kindness and favor to Gods people, to Christians,
etc. So did Cyrus to the Jews, Ezra 1. 1, 2. Artaxerxes to Ezra, Ezra 7. 11. to
27. Ahashuerus to Mordecai and the Jews, Esth. 6. and 7. and 8. and 9. and 10.
So Maximinus the Emperor, under Gods heavy judgments, his bowels rotting,
innumerable worms crawling from him, etc. ceased his cruel persecutions of
Christians, and made a Law for their peace, liberty and public meetings.
Eusebius. Hist. Eccl. lib. 8. cap. 27, 28, 29.


(3.) Thou may have Gods faithful Ministers in high esteem, may reverence
them, and hear them gladly. As Ioash did Iehoiadah, 2 Chronicles. 24. 2, 4, etc.
Herod did John Baptist, Mar. 6. 20. Simon Magus did Philip, Act. 8. 13. And as
the Officers of the chief Priests and Pharisees sent to take Christ, were
wonderfully taken with Christ, Joh. 7. 32, 45, 46.

(4) Thou may desire the prayers of Gods Ministers and people for thee. As
Pharaoh desired the prayers of Moses and Aaron, Exodus 9. 27, 28. and 10. 16,
17, 18. King Jeroboam desired the prayers of the man of God for his withered
hand, 1 King. 13. 4, 6. And Simon Magus begged the prayers of Peter and the
Apostles for himself, that the evils feared might not come upon him, Act. 28.
24.

(5.) Thou may wish thy self in as happy a condition, especially in death, as
Gods people. So did Balaam, Numb. 23. 10. And may not only wish, but pray to
God. So did the Pharisees, Mat. 6. 5. and 23. 14. Luke 18. 10.

(6.) Thou may profess the Christian Faith and Religion. So did the five
foolish Virgins, who had lamps, Mat. 25. 3, etc. Simon Magus, Act. 8. 13.
Ananias and Saphira his Wife, Act. 5. 1. to 11. And Julian the Emperor for a
season, but afterward became a woeful Apostate, and cruel persecutor of
Christians. Theod. Hist. lib. 3. cap. 25.


Yea, thou may believe for a time, as the Hearers resembled to the rocky or
stony ground, are said to do, Luke 8. 13.

(7.) Thou may also proceed to practice, and do many things. As did Herod,
Mar. 6. 20. Nay, what can a true Christian do, but an hypocrite (who is the
Christians Ape) may imitate it? Yea, the Natural man may seem to do, with much
zeal and affection. The stony ground heard with joy, Mat. 13. 20, 21. How
zealous seemed Ioash about repairing of the Temple? 2 Chronicles. 24. 4, etc. And
Iehu in rooting out of Ahab's house, and destroying of Baal's Idolatry out of
Israel? 2 King. 10. 16, etc.

III. These things the Natural man may do, and ought to do, in order to his
recovery out of his Natural state of sin and misery. Thou therefore, O Natural
man, if thou do not these things which thou can do, and oughtst to do, in
order to thy recovery, (though neither these things, nor any thing else which
thou can do, is sufficient) thou shall justly perish in thy sinful and
wretched state of Nature for evermore. For,

1. All these abilities which God has furnished thee withal, what are they
but as so many Talents wherewith the Lord has betrusted thee, that thou
should employ them to thy Lord and Master's honor, and thine own eternal
benefit? Mat. 25. 14. to 31. Luke 19. 12, 13. Now Talents are not to be buried
in the earth, or hid in a Napkin.

2. A day of account will certainly come, when God will reckon with every one,
how they have employed their talents, Mat. 25. 19, etc. and happy those souls
that shall be able to give a good and clear account at that day.

3. He that diligently and fruitfully imploys his talents received, is in the
ready way of having his talents and gifts augmented, Mat. 25. 28, 29. Mar. 4.
25. Mat. 13. 12. Luke 8. 18. He that faithfully does what he is able, shall be
enabled to do much more.

4. If thou do not in order to thy recovery what thou art able to do, thou will be found willingly, if not wilfully, guilty of thine eternal perdition in
thy Natural state of sin and misery, Ezekiel 18. 31. and 33. 11. Ah! what a crying
sin is murder? Genesis 41. 10. What a roaring sin then is self-murder, wilful
self-murder both of body and soul for ever?

5. Finally, If thou do not toward thy recovery what thou art able, if thou
improvest not thy talents what thou can, God will account thee an
unprofitable, a slothful and wicked servant, will cause thy talent to be taken
from the, and thy self to be cast into outer darkness, there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth, Mat. 25. 26, 28, 30.

Now go, O Natural man, do to the utmost thou art able toward the rescuing of
thy self from thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, else thou'^t be guilty
of thine own eternal destruction. And yet when thou have done all thou art
able, all this will not fully and completely effect thy recovery.

VII. Direction.
GReat cause thou have then, O Natural man, upon all these foregoing
Considerations, deeply to humble thy self before the LORD, for this thy sinful
and wretched state of Nature, wherein thou remainest even until this very day.
Luke 15. 17, 18, 19, 21.

I. Have thou not causes, more then enough, to humble thy self deeply before
the Lord for this thy sinful and wretched state of Nature, wherein thou still
remainest? For, Consider;

1. While thou art in this state of Nature, thou art in the state of damnation,
Ioh. 3. 18, 36. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3. And thou art posting apace to the place of
execution, as fast as the wings of speedy time can carry thee? And will thou go
laughing to Hell? Thou art condemned already, Joh. 3. 18. And will any
condemned malefactor go merrily to the place of execution? Was it not Agag's
folly to come in delicately to Samuel, as if the bitterness of death had been
past, when he was presently to be hewed in pieces before the LORD? 1 Samuel 15.
32, 33. Art thou on the very pits brink of eternal perdition, and but a small
puff of breath betwixt thee and Hell, and do thou not tremble? Does not thine
heart ache? Is not thy soul round-beset with sorrow, even unto death?

2. While thou art un-humbled under this thy sinful and wretched state of
Nature, thou continuest an un-cured, yea an unconvinced sinner. (1.) An
un-cured sinner. For, humiliation usually precedes and procures reformation: As
in Manasses, 2 Chronicles. 33. 12. to 17. In the Prodigal, Luke 15. 17. to 22. In
the penitent woman, Luke 7. 37, 38, etc. In Saul, Act. 9. 6, etc. In Peter's
Hearers, Act. 2. 37, etc. And in most. Bruising prepares for healing; wounding
for binding up, Luk 4. 18. Burdening makes way for easing, Mat. 11. 28. Godly
sorrow works repentance not to be repented of, 2 Cor. ^. 10. (2.) Yea an
un-convinced sinner. ^or, humiliation, as it makes way for reformation, so it
presupposes a previous conviction. So then, conviction works humiliation,
humiliation inclines to reformation. O do not thou still continue an un-cured
sinner, yea an un-convinced sinner, by remaining an un-humbled sinner.

3. Thine humiliation before the LORD for thy sinful and wretched condition,
will prove, A grateful sacrifice to God, A gainful exercise to thee. 1. A
grateful sacrifice to God. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken
and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise, Psalm. 51. 17. See 2 Chronicles.
33. 12, 13. and 15. 6, 7. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
comforted, Mat. 5. 4. Bruised and broken hearts are fit cures for Christ, Luk
4. 18. Isa. 61. 1, 2. Yea, when sinners lament and grieve for their sins,
Heaven is filled with joy, Luke 15. 7, 10. Fletus peccatorum, triumphus
Angelorum, Sinners tears, are the very triumph of Angels. 2. A gainful exercise
to thee. Humiliation for thy sinful state, (1.) Will help thee to a deeper
sense of thy sinfulness and wretchedness. As blots run abroad, and appear far
larger, in wet paper. (2.) Will somewhat comfort thee, in that thou beginnest
to mourn for that wherein thou did formerly rejoice; and to hate what thou
did formerly love, etc. (3.) Will notably prepare thee to true repentance and
recovery, 2 Cor. 7. 10.

II. But when thou humblest thy self before God for thy sinful and wretched
Natural state, humble thy self rightly, viz.

1. Humble thy self secretly, Ille dolet vere, qui sine test dolet.
seriously and sincerely, without hypocrisy. Not as once Ahab of old did, 1
King. 21. 27, 29. Nor as usually the hypocritical Pharisees were wont to do,
and after them, the Papists in their fastings, Mat. 6. 16. Only formally: But
as penitent Manasseh did, 2. Chron. 33. 11, 12. As the praying Publican did,
Luk 18. As the repenting Prodigal did, Luke 15. As the relenting Woman did,
Luke 7. Cordially and really.

2. Humble thy self unto deepest self-loathing and self abhorrency. Consider
the infinite holiness of God, Isa. 6. 3. Hab. 1. 13. The wonderful purity and
perfection of his Word, Psalm. 119. 140, 96. And thine own extreme sinfulness,
utterly repugnant unto both, Romans 5. 12. Psalm. 51. 5. Ioh. 3. 6. Romans 3. 9. to
19. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3. And then loath thy self, and even abhor thy self as in
dust and ashes, Ezekiel. 36. 31. Job 42. 6. accounting thy self, with humbled
Paul, chief of sinners, 1 Timothy 1. 15.

3. Humble thy self so for thy sins, as to labor and be heavy laden with them,
and quite weary of them, Mat. 11. 28. Be so pricked and wounded in heart for
them, as to cry out to Gods messengers, Men and brethren what shall I do? Act.
2. 36, 37. Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Act. 16. 30. True humiliation for
sin, will make thee earnestly long and desire to be rid of sin.

4. Humble thy self reformingly. So as to repent and turn from thine iniquities
unto God. As did Manasseh, 2 Chronicles. 33. 12, etc. As did Saul, Act. 9. 6, 11,
20. That Is right humiliation that works reformation. That Is true godly-sorrow
indeed, that works repentance not to be repented of, 2 Cor. 7. 10.

5. Humble thyself Continually, till thy God exalt thee and lift thee up with
Comfort, and restore thee from thy Sinful and wretched state of Nature, into an
holy and happy state of Grace. The Sinful woman never ceased hmbling herself at
Christ's feet, and washing his feet with tears; till Christ comforted her, and
told her that her Sins, which were many, were forgiven her, Luke 7. 47, 48. The
Prodigal ceased not confessing his sin and humbling himself for it to his
Father, as no more worthy to be called his Son: till the father called for the
best robe to be put upon him, and expressed many other most affectionate acts
of a most tender paternal love unto him. Luke 15. 21. to 25.

VIII. Direction.
HOwever thou art by Nature, O Natural man, in a most Sinful and wretched
state, and have remained therein from thy very Birth unto this day, for which
thou have cause to be abased to the very dust: yet know thou for thy Comfort,
thy Case is not Desperate, there is Hope in Israel concerning this; God has in
this valley of Achor, in this valley of trouble, opened a door of Hope for
thee, and of his mee^ love and mercy has Revealed in his Covenant of Faith in
Christ, a way how thou may be recovered out of this thy sinful and wretched
state of Nature, into an Holy and Happy state of Grace; and how all Gods Elect,
though lapsed in the first Adam, may be restored in a second Adam, Tit. 3. 4,
5, 6, 7. Gal. 3. 21, 22. Romans 3. 20, 21, 22. 26, 27.

I shall Illustrate this further to thy singular encouragement and comfort, O
Natural man, in certain distinct Positions. viz.

1. The LORD God, of the mere good pleasure of his will, according to his
eternal Purpose which he purposed in himself, elected a certain number out of
mankind unto himself, to the Adoption of children, that they should be holy and
without blame before him in love, to the praise of the Glory of his Grace.
Ephesians. 1. 4, 5, 6.

2, Though the only wise and righteous God ( who can bring good Tanta quippe
est omnipotens ejus bonitas, ut etiam de malis possit facere bona, sive
ignos^endo, sive sanando, sive ad utilitates piorum coapando atque vertendo,
sive etiam justissime vindicando. Omnia namque ista bona sunt, and Deo bono
atque Omnipotenti dignissima, nec tamen fiunt nisi de malis. Quid igitur
melius, quid Omnipotentius eo, qui cum mali nihil faciat, been etiam de malis
facit? Aug. de Continent. lib. Cap. 6. p. 995. C. Tom. 4. Basil. 1569.
out of cvil: Else he could not suffer it to be) permitted Adam, the common
Root of Mankind; and in him, as in his loins, all mankind; and among them all
his elect; to fall into Sin and misery, for the greater manifestation of the
surpassing glory of his Freedom, Mercy, and Justice toward mankind: yet has
he not cast away his people whom he foreknew, nor left his Elect to perish in
that lapsed state, but has most graciously and wisely contrived a way, how all
his Elect shall be recovered out of this state of Sin and misery into a state
of Holiness and Happiness for evermore. Compare Mat. 10. 29. 30. Act. 2. 23.
and 4. 27. with Genesis 3. 1. etc. Romans 5, 12, 13, 14. Romans 11. 2. Ephesians. 1. 4. to
12. Col. 1. 19, 20.

3. God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, was
pleased to contrive lapsed man's Recovery, out of the exceeding riches of his
mere Grace and mercy. Ephesians. 1. 3. to 12. and 2. 4 to 10.

Nothing at all foreseen in lapsed man could move or incline God at all, to
Contrive his Restitution, Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7.

4. Gods Contriving of lapsed man's Recovery, is rendered a Divine favor so
much the more eminent and singularly illustrious, in that God would not
vouchsafe the like favor to the lapsed Angels, though by Nature they were far
more Noble and Excellent Creatures, Compare Psalm. 8. 4, 5. with Heb. 2. 16.

Angels fell vide Augustinum. lib. de fide, ad Petrum. Diacon. C. 3. p. 221. A.
B.
from their happy state, by their own free will without other seducement, and
found no mercy: Man fell through the malicious and subtle Seducement of that
old Serpent the Devil, and found mercy.

5. Our ever blessed God has, immediately upon the fall of man; and afterward
from age to age in diverse remarkable periods of time, revealed in his precious
Promises and second Covenant, the Covenant of Faith, enlarged more and more
till it came to be most complete in his New Covenant, his most Gracious purpose
and pleasure of Restoring lapsed man again from his state of Sin and misery. As
these, and like Scriptures do abundantly testify; viz. with Adam Gen, 3. 15.
Noah, Genesis 6. 18. 22. with Heb. 11. 7. Abram, Genesis 12. 2, 3. with 15. 9. to the
end. and 17. 1. to 15. and 22. 15, 16, 17, 18. Israel, Deuteronomy. 5. 2. to 22. with
Exodus 20. 1, 2. etc. and 24 4. to 9. David, 2 Samuel 7. 11. to 17. and 23. 5.
with Psalm. 89 3. etc. and 132. 11. etc. with the Jews captived in Babylon.
Ezekiel. 34. 20. 23, 24, 25. and 36. 24. to the end, and 37. 1. 21. to the End.
Ier. 32. 1. 2. 3. 36. to the end. Finally, in the New Covenant in Christ
exhibited, the height and top- Turret of all Gods Covenant-Expressures with his
people, Ier. 31. 31. to 35. with Heb. 8. 6. to the end of the chapter. All
which Covenant-Expressures I have elsewhere In my Treat. of Gods Covenants with
man, etc. London printed An. Dom. 1657.
at large explained, which the diligent Reader may peruse.

6. Our most gracious God revealing his good pleasure in his second Covenant,
the Covenant of Faith, for lapsed man's restoration, has opened a door of
hope, of life and salvation for him, who before was in an hopeless, desperate,
dead and damnable condition. For such was the condition of Adam, and of all
mankind in him, after his Fall, until the seed of the woman was promised to
bruise the Serpents head. Compare Genesis 2. 16, 17. with Genesis 3. 6, 7. and 15.
Romans 5. 12. And until Natural man lay hold upon this promise, and this seed of
the woman, (which is our hope, 1 Timothy 1. 1.) by believing, he remains hopeless
still, Ephesians. 2. 12.

7. Gods mysterious contrivance of lapsed man's recovery from his sinful and
wretched state of Nature, brought upon mankind by the breach of the Covenant of
works, Genesis 2. 16, 17. Romans 5. 12. and 6. 23. And revealing this his recovery
in a gratuitous Covenant of Faith, which Faith he promises by his Spirit to
work in them, Romans 3. 27. Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. Luke 11. 13. Ephesians. 2. 8. Gal. 5. 22.
is a mercy of mercies utterly beyond all blessing and praise, that the creature
can present unto the LORD.

IX. Direction.
JEsus Christ, the alone eternal Son of God, who in the fullness of time became
perfect man, is the only meritorious mean and way, by whom lapsed man can be
recovered and redeemed out of his Natural state of sin and misery, into a
supernatural state of grace and glory. Compare Act. 18. 28. Ioh. 1. 41, 45.
Mat. 16. 16. Gal. 4. 4, 8. Mat. 1. 20, 21. with Luke 2. 10. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Job.
3. 16, 17. Romans 5. 6, 8, 9, 10. and with Act. 4. 11, 12. 1 Timothy 1. 5.

Consider here, 1. Who and what the Recoverer of lapsed man is. 2. That this
Jesus Christ is the meritorious mean of lapsed man's recovery. 3. That this
Jesus Christ is the only meritorious mean of lapsed man's recovery.

I. Who, and what the Recoverer of lapsed man is. He is Jesus Christ, the alone
eternal Son of God, who in the fullness of time became perfect man. Here note,
1. The Names. 2. The Natures of Christ in one Person. His Names, point out, 1.
His Office. Jesus, denotes a Savior. 2. His qualification for this Office.
Christ, signifies Anointed, Psalm. 45. 7. His Natures, Divine and Humane,
declare both his matchless suitableness, and sufficiency for the effectual
discharge of his Office.

1. His Names here expressed are two; Jesus, Christ. The first is a Hebrew
Name; The second Greek. He came to redeem and save both Jews and Greeks, Jews
and Gentiles.

(1). Jesus. He was so called at his Circumcision on the eighth day, Luke 2.
21. He was so named by the Angel before he was conceived in the womb, Luke 2.
21. Mat 1. 21, 25. Jesus, i. e. A Savior. That Is his Office. A most sweet and
acceptable Office. Reasons why he was called Jesus, a Savior, and in what sort
he saves, I have elsewhere In my Treatise of Gods Covenants, Book 4. Chap 6.
Aphorism 2. p. 1571, 1572. Land. 1657.
explained. There see.

(2.) CHRIST, i. e. Anointed. This Greek name is of the same signification
with the Hebrew name Messiah, Act. 4. 26. from Psalm. 2. 2. The New Testament
appropriates this Name to him, Luke 2. 26. Ioh. 4. 25. Mat. 1. 1, 16, 18. and
16. 16, 20. He was so called, because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost,
that oil of gladnest above all his fellows, and thereby designed and qualified
for his Office, as I have elsewhere Ibid. p. 1582. to p. 1589.
showed. As also, That this Jesus is the true CHRIST, the promised Messiah, by
ten Arguments.

2. His Natures in one Person are two, viz. 1. Divine, and 2. Humane.

(1.) He is God, the alone eternal Son of God, Mat. 16. 15, 16. Ioh. 1. 14, 18.
and 3. 16, 18. 1 Ioh. 4. 9. Heb. 1. 2, 3. The Names, Attributes, works and
worship, which peculiarly belong to God, are ascribed to him; as elsewhere
Ibid. p. 1572, 1573, 1574.
I have manifested.

(2.) He is man. The man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 1. 5. The Son of man, Joh. 6. 27.
The Son of David, the Son of Abraham, Mat. 1. 1. The Son of the Blessed Virgin
Mary, of the House and lineage of David, Luke 1. 27, etc. and 3. 23, 24, etc.
and 2. 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. 21.

And this Jesus Christ is God and Man in one Person, Ioh. 1. 14. Gal. 4. 4. 1 Timothy, 3. 16. Of, 1. His fitness to become Man: 2. The Union betwixt his two
Natures: 3. The Oneness of his Person: 4. And why it was necessary he should be
God and Man: 5. The Similitudes illustrating this Union: And 6. The effects or
consequents resulting from it. Of all these, see what I have at large laid down
elsewhere. Ibid. ^. 1577 to 158^.


II. That this JESUS CHRIST God-man, is the meritorious Mean of lapsed man's
Recovery. This will be evidenced abundantly many ways, viz.

1. By the many Promises of Christ, under the Old Testament, as the Restorer
and Recoverer of lapsed sinners. As, Genesis 3. 15. Genesis 12. 3. and 26. 4. with
Gal. 3. 16. Psalm. 110. 1, etc. Isa. 9. 6, 7. and 11. 1. to 10. and 42. 1. to
10. and 53. 4. to the end: and 55. 1, 2, 3, 4. and 61. 1. to 4. Dan. 9. 24, 25,
26. Act. 10. 43.

2. By the many Types of Christ, representing him as a Redeemer, Restorer and
Deliverer of his people. Moses and Aaron, Types of Christ, as delivering Israel
out of Egypt, Act. 7. 37, 38. The Judges and Kings, Types of Christ, as saving
Israel from their enemies, Judge. 16 30. Psalm. 2. The Sacrifices slain, and
their blood shed and sprinkled, Types of Christ, who by his death and blood
should expiate our offenses, etc. Heb. 9. 9. to the end. and 10. 1. to 19.

3. By the many Names and Titles given unto Christ, clearly declaring him to be

sinnetrs, the only meritorious Mean of lapsed man's Recovery out of his Sinful
and wretched state of Nature. There is one Mediator betwixt God and man, the
man Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 2. 5. Neither is there Salvation in any other: For
there is none other Name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,
Act. 4. 12.

Direct. X.
KNow also, O Natural Man, That Jesus Christ has wrought Recovery and obtained
Redemption for lapsed man from his sinful and wretched State of Nature into an
Holy and Happy State of Grace, As he is God-man; Testator, Surety and Mediator
of the New Testament, Executing his Mediatory office to this End as Prophet
Priest and King both in his State of Humiliation and Exaltation.

The former Direction shows that Jesus Christ, and he alone, is Sinful man's
Recoverer: This declares, How and in what way he has Effected and obtained
man's Recovery and Redemption. In an abstruse and most mysterious way. viz.

1. As he is God-man in one Person. This I have elsewhere In my Treat. of Gods
Covenants. Book. 4. c. 6. p. 1574, to 1589. and 1593. to 1598.
abundantly cleared. There see.

2. As he is Testator, Surety, and Mediator of the New Testament, or New
Covenant. This also see elsewhere Ibid. p. 1599 to p. 1641.
explicated and Confirmed, for brevity sake.

3. As he Executed his Mediatory office in a Prophetical, Priestly, (where his
Satisfaction to Gods justice for our sins is at large handled page 1607. to
1618.) and Kingly way, both in his state of Humiliation and Exaltation. All
these I have elsewhere Ibid. p. 1599. to 1641.
cleared. Consult the place: that I may not actum agere. Whereby I hope you
will not lose your labor.

Direct. XI.
LEt this sink deep into shine heart, O Natural man, That this Jesus Christ,
God-man, the only Mediator and Savior's Most able, and Most willing (...)
Receive and Save all Lapsed Sinners that come unto him, and to God by him.

1. Jesus Christ is most able and sufficient to save all unto the Uttermost
that Come unto God by him. Heb. 7. 25. Mat. ^8. 18. etc. Col. 1. 19. He is not
an impotent, but an omnipotent Savior, Rev. 1. 8. whether we regard his
Person, or Office.

2. Jesus Christ is most willing to save all that come unto him. Both these I
have already demonstrated. Ibid. p. 1662. to 1665.
Consult them there at large, to avoid prolixity here.

Direct. XII.
MArk well, notwithstanding, O Natural man, That there is a vast difference
betwixt Christ's obtaining of Redemption and Recovery for lapsed man: and
Christ's applying of that obtained Recovery and Redemption so lapsed man.
Betwixt these, there are two great differences.

1. Christ has obtained eternal Redemption for us immediately by his own
Person, and the merit of his obedience, Heb. 1. 3. and 9. 12. Ephesians. 5. 2. 1 Timothy
2. 5, 6. Ephesians. 1. 7, 8. Christ applies this obtained Redemption to us
immediately by his Spirit, effectually working Faith and all saving grace in
us, that so we may close with Christ, have union to him, and communion with
him. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.

Gal. 5. 22. Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. 1 Ioh. 5. 12. 1
Cor. 1. 30.

2. Christ has obtained Recovery and Redemption for his Elect jointly, in
fullness of time, by his blood, Gal. 4. 4, 5. Ephesians. 1. 3. to 9. The virtue of his
sufferings extending it self to them all from the beginning to the end of the
world: As the Sun in the Meridian line, in the fullness of the day, diffuseth
his light, heat and influence backwards toward the East, as well as forward
toward the West. Ephesians 1. 10. Col 1. 20. But Christ applies this Recovery and
Redemption which he has wrought and purchased, in due time to his Elect
severally, as he calls them particularly unto the fellowship of his Son, 1 Cor.
1. 9. 2 These. 2. 13, 14. And he calls some in their youth, some in their
manly-age, some (though very few) in their old age: some at the third hour,
some at the sixth, some at the ninth, and some at the eleventh hour of their
day, Mat. 20. 1. to 17.

Direct. XIII.
NO Sinner in the world can actually have any saving share or interest at all
in the Redemption or Recovery which Christ has fully obtained for his people:
until he actually accept Christ, as his only all-sufficient Savior; and
particularly apply to his own Soul that Redemption and Recovery from sin and
misery, which Christ has procured and obtained. 1 Ioh. 5. 12. Ioh. 1. 11, 12.
and 3. 16. 18, 36. and 8. 24.

And this must needs be so. For,

1. Christ's obtaining of Recovery and Redemption for lapsed Sinners renders
them only Salvable, and that possibly they may be saved, which door of Hope is
not opened at all to the lapsed Angels: but Sinners particularly accepting of
Christ, and applying of his merit unto themselves personally, renders them
actually saved, and that they are indeed in the state of Salvation already.
Compare diligently these and like Scriptures, Ioh. 3. 16, 17. Tit. 2, 14. 1 Timothy 1. 15. Gal. 4. 4. 5. Romans 8. 3. which point out a possibility of Salvation
by Christ and his Death, with Ioh. 1. 12. 1 Ioh. 5. 12. 1 Cor. 1. 9.

And such like as denote their actual Salvation by Christ, who have accepted
him and applied him to themselves particularly.

2. Non-accepting and non-applying of Christ, is so great a sin, that it is
threatened with damnation, Ioh. 16. 8, 9. with Ioh. 3. 18. 36. and 8. 24.

Therefore, though Christ be never so able and all-sufficient to restore and
save Sinners: yet none can have benefit by his Salvation without Application of
him and his merits.

3. The Promise of effectual and eternal Salvation by Christ, is still directed
to the actual acceptance and application of Christ. As, Spiritual Rest of Soul
is promised: but to them that come to Christ, Mat. 11. 28, 29. Eternal life is
promised: but to such as believe in him, Ioh. 3. 16. but to such as eat this
bread of life, viz. his flesh given for the life of the world, Ioh. 6. 51. 57.
58. Remission of sins is promised: but to them that believe in him, Act, 10. 43.

Now, how shall man he saved according to Gods promises, that perform not the
Condition of the Promises?

4. Who ever was Restored and saved by Christ, till he accepted and applied
Christ? not the Apostles; Ioh. 16. 30. Mat. 16. 16. Not the Sinful woman, Luke
7. 50. not the convert thief, Luke 23. 43. not the Jailer, Act. 16. 31. to 35.

Who ever was healed by a Plaster spread and prepared only, but never applied
to the wound and Sore? Who ever was comforted with the richest cordial though
never so accurately prepared, if it were never eaten or drunk? And who ever was
actually saved by Christ, if not particularly accepted and applied? They that
accept not, that apply not Christ to themselves, are without Christ: And they
that are without Christ are without Hope, so remaining, and go without
Salvation, Ephesians. 2. 12.

5. All Communion with Christ in his saving benefits ^lows from Union to Christ
in accepting of him, Ioh. 1. 12 1 Ioh. 5. 12. Romans 8 10. Col. 2. 19. Ephesians. 4.
16. As the Ciour has Communion with the Stock in its life, growth,
fruitfulness, by being united unto the stock, by Ingrafting; or as the Wife
has Communion with the husband in his Name, state, etc. by being united to him
in marriage; or as the members of the Natural body have Communion with the head
and heart in their life, sense, motion, etc. by being united thereunto by
joints and hands.

6. Till the Sinner accepts and applies Christ, he is not thoroughly Convinced
of the Sinfulness and wretchedness of his Natural state, and of the great need
he has of Christ to deliver him out of it. For, Conviction is the first step
to application of Christ, Ioh. 16. 8, 9. And where there is not the first step
of Conviction: There Is no present state of Salvation.

7. Till the Sinner accepts Christ, and applies him, he neglects and despises
him: And he that despises Christ how can he obtain Salvation, yea, how can he
escape damnation. See Mat. 22. 1. to 3. Luke 14. 16. to 25. Heb. 2. 3.

Direct. XIIII.
OBserve diligently, O Natural man, that the Proper and Peculiar way whereby
Jesus Christ is to be accepted and applied to a man's own Soul for Recovery out
of his sinful and wretched state of Nature, is by true saving Faith in Jesus
Christ alone, Act. 10. 43. Ioh. 3. 16. and 1. 12. Act. 13. 38, 39. and 16. 30,
31. Ephesians. 2. 8. Romans 3. 22. to 27.

I. That, by true saving Faith alone peculiarly Jesus Christ is accepted and
applied for Recovery out of Sin and misery, is evident several ways. For,

1. The Nature of true saving Faith in Christ, principally consists in the
Accepting and applying Christ for Salvation as he is offered in the Gospel.
Thus I have elsewhere described it; Justifying Faith is a saving Grace, wrought
in the hearts of the Elect at their Regeneration by Gods Spirit and word;
whereby they not only know, Assent to, and apply to themselves the Promises,
Gospel, and Doctrine of Jesus Christ for gods glory in their justification and
Salvation; but also whereby they afterward walk as becomes justified persons.
There see the Confirmation and Explanation of this Description of Faith In my
Treatise of Gods Covenants, Book 3. Chap 3. Aphorism 4. Quest. 1. p. 576. to
566.
. So that the Nature of saving faith in Christ, stands much in Applying Christ
in the Gospel and promises, who is the Kernel and Soul of them.

2. The Receiving and Applying Jesus Christ for Recovery and Salvation, is one
of the chief Acts of Faith, See all these explained. Ibid.
which thus I illustrate;

The Acts of true Faith in Christ are

1 Direct. 2. Reflexive.

(1) Direct. and these of 2 Sorts.

1. Primary. As, 1. Knowing. Isai. 53. 11. Ioh. 17. 3. 2. Assenting to the
truth of Gods record, 1 Ioh. 5. 9. Ioh. 3. 33. 3. Applying of the Promises, and
of Christ, Ioh. 1. 12. As Paul did, Gal. 2. 20. as Thomas did, Ioh. 20. 8.


2. Secondary. As, 1. Retaining Christ Received in the heart, Ephesians. 3. 17. Col.
2. 6, 7. 2. Purifying the heart, Act. 15. 9. 3. Refreshing the Soul with peace
and joy, Romans 5. 1, 2. and 15. 13. 4. Breaking forth into good works, 1 These.
1. 3. Heb. 11. 5. Working by Love, Gal. 5. 6. 6. Enlivening the Soul, Romans 1.
17. Gal. 2. 20. 2. Conquering all our Spiritual Enemies. 1 Ioh. 3. 2, 3. and 5.
4. 1 Pet. 1. 9. Iam. 4. 7. Ephesians. 6. 16.


(2) Reflexive. When Faith refleanding upon its own acts sees it self
believing, 1 Ioh. 2. 3. 1 Timothy 1. 12. By this it appears that the applying act
of Faith is a very principal act among all the rest. ^ or, All the Acts before
the Applying ast, tend to make way for it as Preparatory to it: And all the
Acts after it, result from the Applying Act especially, as genuine fruits and
effects of it. Thus the Applying act of Faith is among the rest, as the Sun
among the Planets, most illustrious.

3. Faith is so peculiarly eminent among all the Graces of the Spirit, in its
property of Receiving and applying Jesus Christ, for Recovery and Salvation of
Sinners, that it is set forth to us in Holy Scripture by sundry Emphatical
Expressions and Comparisons. All pointing out the Applying Act of Faith. Faith
is,

1. A looking upon Christ, as the Jews did upon the brazen Serpent, when stung.
Ioh. 3. 15, 16. and 8. 56.

2. A coming to Christ. Ioh. 6. 35. Mat. 11. 28.

3. A Receiving of Christ. Ioh. 1. 11. 12.

4. An Embracing of the Promises, and so of Christ in the Promises. Heb. 11.
13. (...) properly notes, Lovingly-embracing, eagerly-apprehending, and thence
signifies Saluting: Saluting being performed with embracing.

5. Eating of Christ's flesh, drinking of his blood. Ioh. 6. 40. 53. 54.

6. Having of the Son. 1 Ioh. 5. 12.

7. Harboring Christ so that he dwells in the heart by Faith. Ephesians. 3. 17.

4. The Doctrine of the Gospel reveals Recovery and Salvation of Sinners in
and by Christ: but as Received and applied by Faith. Act. 10. 43. and 13. 38,
39. Romans 3. 21. to the end; and 10. 9. etc.

5. Convinced Sinners enquiring how they may be saved, are directed to apply
Christ by believing in him. Act. 16. 30, 31.

6. Recovery and Salvation of Sinners is Promised in and for Jesus Christ and
his merit: but then Christ must be Received and applied by Faith. Faith is
often expressed, always to be understood as the Condition of the Promise. As,
Mat. 11. 28. Ioh. 3. 16. and 6. 40. 53, 54. Mark 16. 16. Act. 10. 43. Romans 9.
33. 1 Pet. 2. 6. Act. 16. 30, 31.

7. Without Faith in Christ there is no Salvation. None can be saved, that by
believing apply not Christ for Recovery. Ioh. 3. 18. 36. and 8. 24. Mark 16.
16. 2 These. 2. 12.

II. How is Jesus Christ to be Accepted and Applied by Faith, in order to the
Sinners Recovery and Salvation by him?

Answer. Jesus Christ is to be accepted and Applied by Faith, in order to the
Sinners Recovery by him, in such sort as he is offered in the Gospel. To accept
and apply him otherwise, in any other notion, upon any other terms, etc. then
God offers him: is to apply a Christ of our own, not the Lords Christ. Gods
offer, must be the ground and Rule of our Acceptance.

Now the Gospel offers Christ unto the Sinner, for his Recovery by him; and to
his Faith.

1. As that Messiah and Savior of Sinners, which from the Fall of man was
Promised, Prophesied of, and fore-typified; and in fullness of time was
manifested in humane flesh, for lapsed man's Recovery out of Sin and misery.
Genesis 3. 15. and 12. 3. and 22. 18. Gal. 3. 8. 16. with Act. 8. 10. 43. Ioh. 1.
41. 45. Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20.

2. As that only Messiah, Redeemer, and Savior given among men, by whom alone
Sinners can be saved, and by none other in the whole world. Act. 4. 11, 12.
Ioh. 8. 24.

3. As an All-sufficient Savior, able to save fully unto the Uttermost all
that come unto God by him. Heb. 7. 24, 25, 26. and 9. 11, 12, 13, 14. and 10,
11. to 19. Ioh. 1. 14, 15. Col. 1. 19, 20.

4. As God-man, Mediator betwixt God and man, Ioh. 1. 14. Gal. 4. 4, 5. 1 Timothy
3. 16. with 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6.

5. As man's Surety, Heb. 7. 22. who by his Obedience Active has exactly
fullfilled the Law of God, which we could not perform or keep, Gal. 4. 4. And
by his obedience Passive, to the Death, even the death upon the Cross, has
endured the curse and penalty of the Law for our sakes, which we could neither
have endured nor avoided: that so, satisfying Gods justice to the uttermost for
our sins, we might be eternally released from sin and wrath, and be reconciled
to God, justified and saved by Christ's Obedience imputed to us through Faith.
Romans 5. 18, 19. and 8. 3, 4. Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8. Romans 5. 9, 10. and 3. 25. Gal.
3. 10. 13, 14. Ephesians. 5. 2. Heb. 9. 12. 14. and 10. 10 to 19. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19,
20. Tit. 2. 14.

6. As the Sinners Perfect righteousness before God, ^mputed by God unto him,
through Faith. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Romans 3. 21. 22. to the end. and 4. 11, 12. and 5.
18, 19. and 10. 6. 9. 10. For which all self-righteousness is to be denied,
Phil. 3* 7, 8, 9, 10.

7. As Christ Jesus the LORD. The Gospel tenders him; As Christ or Messiah, i.
e. Anointed by the Spirit above measure for his office, Psalm. 45. 7. As Jesus,
i. e. A Savior Mat. 1. 21. Luke 2. 20. This denotes his office. As the LORD,
to rule and reign over us, in us, and for us, over all our enemies whatsoever.
As he is a JESUS to save: so he will be a LORD to Rule. Thus we are to receive
and apply him, as the Colossians did, Col. 2. 6.

8. As that Redeemer, for whom we are to deny ourselves, take up ou^ Cross and
follow him. Luk 9. 23.

III. What encouragement may a poor lapsed and lost Sinner have, to draw
toward Jesus Christ, to accept and apply him for his Recovery and Salvation by
believing in him.

Answ. Much every way. But especially upon these and like serious
Considerations. viz.

1. Christ himself has plainly declared that it is the great duty of the
Sinner, to believe in Christ, and so to accept and apply him by Faith. This,
the work, which God chiefly requires and accepts: to believe in Christ. Ioh. 6.
28, 29. 1 Ioh. 3. 23.

2. Christ most sweetly invites all distressed Sinners, and thirsty Souls, to
come to him for relief, to believe in him. Mat. 11. 28, 29, 30. Ioh. 7. 37.
with Isai. 55. 1, 2. Rev. 22. 17.

3. Christ holds forth the Golden-Scepter of most great and precious Promises,
to encourage and allure Sinners to approach to him and to apply him by
believing. Mat. 11. 28, 29. Mar. 16. 16. Ioh. 3. 16. 18. 36. and 6. 37. 40. 44.
51. 54. 57. Act. 10. 43. Romans 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6.

4. Christ never did, never will, reject any poor Sinful Soul, that did but
even creep to him by the feeblest Faith, Ioh. 6. 37. why then should thou
fear, that he will not accept and embrace thee?

5. Christ has most readily, tenderly and compassionately received even
greatest and most heinous offenders, upon their coming to him by Faith: And all
these for Encouraging Patterns and Presidents to all that afterward shall
believe in him, 1 Timothy 1. 16. And why should he not in like sort entertain
thee, notwithstanding all thy Sins, if thou can believe in him? Remember the
reception of the Prodigal, Luke 15. 20. to the end: of Nicodemus. the ignorant
Pharisee, Ioh. 3. 1, 2, 3. etc. of Matthew the griping Customer, Mat. 9. 9. of
Zachaeus the oppressing Publican, Luke 19. 5. to 11. Of the notorious Sinful
woman that washed Christ's feet with her Tears, etc. Luke 7. 37. to the end of
Saul, that was injurious, a Persecutor and a Blasphemer, Act. 26. 9, 10. 11. 1 Timothy 1. 13, 14. 16. of the Thief upon the Cross, that even after his
Crucifiction had railed upon Christ, Mat 27. 44. compared with Luke 23. 40. to
44. Yea of those that were guilty of his Death and Blood: yet even some of them
Christ washed from their Sins by the very blood which they shed, Quis
desperaret sibi donanda peccata, quando crimen occisi Christi reis d^nabatur?
Conversi sunt ex ipso populo Iudaeorum: Conversi sunt, baptizati, sunt. Ad
mensam Domini accesserunt: and sanguinem, quem saevientes fuderunt, credentes
biberunt, Aug. de Temp. Sermon. 74. p. 747. B. Tom. 10. Basil. 1569.
Act. 2. 36, 37. to the end. Oh, miracles of Christ's mercy and Compassion to
lost Sinners! when Christ accepts such; who would not hopefully come to him?
When Christ saves such; who have cause to despair, that desire truly to repent
and believe in him?

XV. Direction.
POwer thus to believe in Jesus Christ God-man, and by believing to accept and
Apply him for thy Recovery (O Natural man) out of thy sinful and wretched state
of Nature, thou have none at all of thy self; But all thy sufficiency in this
behalf is wholly of God: Nevertheless thou may, and ought to do some
things for the furtherance of thy Faith in Christ.

I. That, of thyself thou have no power or sufficiency at all to believe in
Jesus Christ, to receive, and apply him effectually by believing, without the
supernatural influence and assistance of God: Is plain. For,

1. The Testimony of Christ and his Apostles is clear for it. No man can come
to me (i. e. by believing) Except the Father which has sent me, draw him, Ioh.
6. 44. He cannot of himself, or by his own power come and believe: till God
influence him and enable him. Again; Without me ye can do nothing. viz. nothing
in fruit bearing; either of Faith, or any other good spiritual fruit, Ioh. 15.
5. That of the Apostles is punctual; By Grace are ye saved, through Faith and
that not of your selve, it is the gift of God, Ephesians. 2. 8. See, The large
English Annotations on. Ephesians. 2. 8. and Mr. Paul Bayns in his Comment on Ephesians. 2.
8.


2. True saving Faith in Christ, and the acting of it unto the accepting and
applying of Christ, is the special work of God and fruit of the spirit, of the
Regenerating spirit of God. Compare and consider well, Ioh. 6. 44. Gal. 5. 22.
with Ioh. 1. 12, 13.

3. Faith in Christ is the Life of the Soul from Christ, it is as the vital
spirits from him, Gal. 2. 20. Romans 1. 17. Now, can the Soul of natural man,
which is dead in sins and trespasses, Ephesians. 2. ^. quicken it self by believing.

Hence, then, these things must needs follow. 1. That, whosoever do believe in
Christ truly, and by Faith apply him effectually and savingly, they owe all
this wholly to the rich Grace and mere favor of God. And are to render unto
him all the praise thereof. 2. That it is a piece of gross Ignorance and
groundless Presumption, for any Natural man whatsoever, to think he can believe
and accept Christ at his pleasure. This is impossible. 3. Let every natural man
take heed he reject not the divine offers of Faith unto his Soul, nor resist
the Spirits motions and operations inclining, drawing, and persuading the heart
thereunto, 1 These. 5. 19. Act. 7. 51. Ephesians 4. Ioh. 6. 44. For, what if the
Spirit of God draw and move the heart so no more? And without God, there is no
believing.

II. Notwithstanding, Though the Natural man cannot of himself savingly believe
in Christ, or apply him, by any self-sufficiency or power of his own, yet
something toward it, and toward the furtherance thereof, he may and ought to
do, Act. 8. 13. Luke 8. 13. For, what a mere Natural man has done heretofore,
why may not a mere Natural man do again? Now then, O Natural man, though thou
can not of thy self believe in Christ, and apply him savingly, yet neglect
not to do what thou can do, in order to this believing in Christ, and
applying of Christ to thine own soul.

Art thou grieved in thine heart thou can not enough believe in him? Art thou
desirous to believe in him alone for Recovery and Salvation? I would fain take
this for granted. Let me then draw thee, thou poor trembling soul, a few steps
further toward Christ. Make use of these few Helps and Furtherances unto Faith
in Christ Jesus. For, this thou can, and ought to do. viz.

1. Know, and Consider Jesus Christ well, both in his Person, Offices, and the
effects or acquirements of his Offices, as all these are delineated in the Holy
Scriptures. Ioh. 17. 3. 1 Timothy 3. 16. 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6. Heb. 9. 12, 13, 14. and
10. 7. to 19. Romans 5. 9, 10. And Assent fully to the Record, that God has
given of his Son in his Word, that eternal life is in his Son, 1 John 5. 10,
11. Now, Knowledge, Heb. 11. 3. Isa. 53. 11. Ioh. 17. 3. Assent, 1 Ioh. 5. 10,
11. And Application, Ioh. 1. 12. Gal. 2. 20. make up the Nature of true Faith.

2. Ponder often and earnestly upon the Promises of God touching Christ, and
touching believing in him. As, That whosoever comes to him by believing, shall
not in any case be cast out by Christ, Ioh. 6 35, 37. shall not be ashamed or
confounded, Romans 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 6. shall not perish, Joh. 3. 16. shall never
hunger nor thirst more, Joh. 6. 35. Isa. 55. 1. shall find rest from Christ
unto his soul, Mat. 11. 28, 29. shall live, though he were dead; yea, shall
never die, Joh. 11. 25. yea, shall have eternal life, and be saved, Joh. 3. 16,
17. Mar. 10. 16. Now these and such like Promises, being Yea and Amen in
Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 20. they are Fundamentum and Pabulum Fidei, The very
foundation, whereupon Faith is bottomed and grounded; and the food, wherewith
Faith is nourished. See Romans 4. 17. to the end. Heb. 11. 11.

3. Consider well the Nature of God, the Promiser. For, this will greatly
encourage Faith to embrace the Promises, and Christ in the Promises. For,

Gods Truth is such: he cannot lie, Tit. 1. 2. It Is impossible he should lie,
Heb. 6. 10.

Gods Fidelity such: he cannot, will not deceive, Heb. 11. 11.

Gods Power such: he can fully perform what he has promised, seem it never so
improbable, impossible, incredible, Romans 4. 20, 21.

His love and free grace such: in giving Christ for us, Ioh. 3. 16, 17. and
offering Christ to us, Romans 3. 21, etc. 2 Cor. 5. 18, etc. That with him he
will freely give all things, Romans 8. 32.

4. Be diligent and constant in attending upon Gods Ordinances, whereby Faith
is bred and nourished. Especially be singularly careful and vigilant in hearing
the Word faithfully and powerfully preached. Faith comes by hearing, and
hearing by the Word of God, Romans 10. 14, 15, 17. The Word preached is the Seed
of Faith and Regeneration, 1 Pet. 1. 23, 25.

5. Cherish and make much of every good motion, stirring, striving inclination,
operation of the Spirit of God in thine heart and soul, tending to thine
accepting and closing with Christ, 1 These. 5. 19. Ephesians. 4. 30. Act 7. 51. For
Faith is the proper fruit o^ the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22.

6. Forget not the exemplary instances of Believers, who, though great
offenders, yet have received and applied Christ by Faith, and have been
graciously accepted and entertained by him: and all this for the encouragement
of thee, and of all that afterward should believe. As, The Jailer, Act. 16.
30, etc. Paul, 1 Timothy 1. 13. to 17. Act. 26. 9. 10, 11. The penitent Woman,
Luke 7. 37. to the end. The Thief on the Cross, Luke 23. 42, 43. The 3000
Hearers of Peter, Act. 2. 36* 37. etc.

7. Ask, seek, knock importunately at the Throne of Grace, for this soul-saving
Grace. The Spirit is promised to them that ask, Luke 11. 13. Fly unto Christ
the Author and finisher of Faith, Heb. 12. 2. And cry, Lord increase my Faith,
Luke 17. 5. Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief, Mar. 9. 24.

XVI. Direction.
QUestion and examine the self often impartially, touching the truth of thy
Faith in Christ for thy Recovery and Salvation, 2 Cor. 13. 5. For, There is a
counterfeit and fained Faith, Luke 8. 13. Act. 8. 13. Iam. 2. 14, 17* 20, 26.
And there is a Faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1. 5. 2 Timothy 1. 5. It Is the Faith
unfeigned that accepts and applies Christ, Ioh. 1. 12, 13. Act. 8. 37. and will
afford thee solid comfort.

Now Faith in Christ unfeigned may be discovered by these and the like
Characters, which if thou can really find in thy self, doubtless thou art a
true Believer.

True saving Faith in Jesus Christ, is,

1. A Christ-applying Faith. If Faith be sincere and salvi^ical, it never rests
till it bring the soul to Christ, till it possess the soul of Christ. It is the
soul's eye, that beholds Christ lifted up, Io^. 3. 15. It Is the soul's feet,
whereby it comes to Christ, Mat. 11. 28. Ioh. 6. 35* 37. It Is the soul's hand,
whereby it receives Christ; and arms, wherewith it (...)
embraces Christ, Ioh. 1. 12. He^. 11. 13. It Is the soul's mouth, wherewith it
eats Christ's flesh that bread of life, Saluting, kissing, or embracing the
Promises.
and drinks Christ's blood that water of life, Ioh. 6. 47, 53, 54, 55. By all
which acts of Faith the soul comes to have Christ, to Metaphora, ut videtur, ^
navigantibus, qui portum eminus conspicati, laetis acclamationibus salutant,
and contingere gand^^t.
possess and enjoy him, and life in him, 1 John 5. 12. True Faith in Christ
contents not it self only to know Christ, or only to assent to the truth of
Gods Record touching Christ, that life is in him; but it further proceeds to
receive and apply Christ to the soul, D. Pareus in Comment. ad Heb. 11. 13.
to appropriate him and enjoy him actually to the particular Believer.

2. A Christ-retaining Faith. True saving Faith in Christ, not only entertains
Christ, but also retains him in the best room of the soul, the heart. -- That
Christ may dwell in your hearts by Faith, Ephesians. 3. 17. The Believer's heart, is
Christ's home: And Faith gives Christ the acceptable entertainment: 1. As it
cleanses the heart of every thing that might be offensive to him, Act. 15. 9.
2. As it ascribes all salvation and sufficiency for it, only unto Christ,
counting all self-excellencies loss and dung, Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. So then, if
Christ be dwelling in thine heart, Faith is there also.

3. A Christ esteeming Faith. Faith most highly esteems Christ, accounts him
most precious. -- Unto them which believe he is precious, 1 Pet. 2. 7. So
precious; That, he sells all that he has for him, Mat. 13. 44, 45, 46. That,
he denies all that he has, yea all that he is, for him, Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10.
Luke 9. 23. and 19. 43. That he disesteems, and as it were, hates all dearest
Relations, in comparison of Christ, Mat. 10. 37. Luke 14. 26, etc. Yea, so
precious; That, it sets more store by Christ, at his lowest, then by all
worldly treasures, at their highest, Heb. 11. 26, 27. If Christ be truly
precious to thy soul, Faith is planted in thine heart.

4. An heart purifying Grace. According to that; -- Purifying their hearts by
Faith, Act. 15. 9. 1 John 3. 3. Faith makes the inside clean; hypocrisy only
the outside, Mat. 23. 25, 26. Faith purifies the heart; 1. Formaliter,
formally, as it is an holy, inherent principle of Grace and Purity, resisting
sin and temptation, Gal. 5. 17. 1 Ioh. 3. 3. Ephesians. 6 16. To this effect it is
styled, (...), most holy faith, Jude, verse 20. Quo titulo nulla ali^ vir^us
Chris^iana insignitur in sacris literis, quia est fundamentum and causa
procreans omnis sanctitatis. Phil. Pareus in Com. ad Jud. 20.
2. Instrumentaliter: Instrumentally it purisieth: the heart, by applying
thereunto Christ's imputed purity, Phil. 3. 9. Christ's blood, which purges the
conscience from the guilt and power of dead works, to serve the living God,
Heb. 9. 14. with Romans 3. 25. By applying Christ's imputed purity and
righteousness.

5. A soul-purifying, and heart-comforting Grace. It affords peace with God:
which produces two excellent effects: 1. Joy, in hope of the glory of God. 2.
Glorying even in tribulation, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3. -- joy and peace in believing,
Romans 15. 13. Now, the peace of God passes all understanding, and keeps, as in
a Garrison, (...) It signifies keeping, as a Castle, Town or City, is in time
of war kept by a Garrison, and Walls, etc. from the enemy. Metaph. a castris,
vallo, and fossis undique munitis, ut null^ hostium vi vel astutia expugna^i
possint. D. Pareus in Phil. 4 7.
the heart and mind in Christ Jesus, viz. safe and secure, Phil. 4. 7.

6. Most dutiful and obediential toward God, and this against all interposing
difficulties: against Reason, against Natural Affection, etc. As in Noah, Heb*
11. 7. In Abraham; when he obeyed God, to forsake his kindred, and follow God,
he knew not whither, Heb. 11. 8. And when he in a sort offered up Isaac for a
Burnt-offering, Heb. 11. 17.

7. Most abundant and fruitful in all good works, Jam. 2. 14. to the end. And
this God expects, Tit. 3. 8. Faith is a most working Grace: it is the root of
all good works of piety, righteousness and sobriety, 1 Timothy 1. 5. Hence that
phrase; -- The work of Faith, 1 These. 1. 3. A workless Faith, is (as James
intimates to us) a worthless Faith, Iam. 2. 17, 26.

8. A Grace that acts and works by love, Gal. 5. 6. How by love?

More generally: Not by love, as fire works by heat, the formal property of
fire; as if love were the form of Faith, as Papists say, contrary to that in 1 Timothy 1. 5. But by love, as an external instrument, (external or outward, as to
the proper nature of Faith) joined or annexed unto Faith, for the exerting of
its acts, as the soul works by the brain, eye, ear, hand, etc.

More particularly: Faith works by love: 1. As it tends to principle and store
the heart with the love of Christ, 1 Pet. 1. 7, 8. Faith is as the
Captain-Grace, that leads on all the rest, 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7. 2* As it actuates
and incites love with a more ardent flame toward God, Christ, and all
goodness. Faith spreads open before the soul Gods love and Christ's loveliness,
how transcendent, how infinite. So that the soul cannot choose but love them
again, Ioh. 3. 16, 17. Romans 5. 5, 6, 7, etc. Ioh. 15. 13. 1 Ioh. 3. 16, 19.

3. As it exercises Oderun^ peccare mali, formidine paen^.
it self in all duties and acts of obedience to God, Christ, etc. not in a way
of servile, slavish fear, Oderunt peccare boni, virtutis amore. Horat.
but in a sweet way of love; because a man loves God and Christ, loves the
ways of virtue, loves his Commandments, and counts them not grievous, 1 John
5. 3. Faith makes all obedience and duty come off lovingly, sweetly,
cheerfully, 1 Timothy 1. 5.

9. A growing Grace. It increases more and more. -- Your Faith grows
exceedingly, 2 These. 1. 3. See also Rev. 2 19. Counterfeit Faith, dead Faith,
is like a painted Tree, or painted Flower upon a Wall, seem it never so fair,
it grows not at all.

10. Vigorous in resisting, and victorious in conquering, all sorts of
Temptations, viz. Of the World, frowning or smiling, 1 Ioh. 5. 4. Ioh. 16. 33.
Of the Flesh, Act. 15. 9. 1 John 3. 3. Of the Devil, ^ Pet. 5. 9. Ephesians. 6. 16.

11. Fervent, and continuing instant in prayer, even against discouragements;
though prayer seem to be neglected, repulsed, denied. As in the Canaanitish
woman, Mat. 15. 22. to 29. In Elijah, who prayed seven times, 1 King. 18. 41.
to 46. Iam. 5. 17, 18.

12. Valiant in confessing Christ, in professing and owning of his Gospel,
Truth and Cause, in days of greatest danger and persecution, 2 Timothy 1. 12.
Saul converted to the Faith, straightway preached Christ in the Synagogues,
that he was the Son of God, though to the hazard of his life, Act. 9. 20, 23.
The Angel of Pergamos, held fast Christ's Name, denied not his Faith, even
there, where Satan's seat was, and even then, when Antipas was his faithful
Martyr, Rev. 2. 12, 13. Rev. 13. 10. The Faith and patience of the Saints, is
most active and illustrious in midst of Antichristian cruelties and
persecutions.

13. Finally, True Faith is constant and persevering. False Faith believes but
for a time, in time of persecution falls away, Luke 8. 13. True Faith holds on
unto the end. Draws not back unto perdition, but believes unto the saving of
the soul, Heb. 10. 39. The true Believer holds on believing, till he attain the
scope and end of his Faith, the salvation of his soul, 1 Pet. 1. 8, 9.

XVII. Direction.
REpentance from head works, not to be repented of, Heb. 6. 1. 2 Cor. 7. 10. is
an inseparable companion of true faith, As I have elsewhere showed in my
Treatise of Repentance. Quest. 2.
(The Scripture usually coupling them together, Mar. 1. 14. 15. Act. 20. 21.
and 2. 37, 38. and 26. 18. Heb. 6. 1.) and therefore every one that would
approve himself to believe in Christ sincerely, must repent of all his sins
unfeinedly, as he expects to have his sins remitted freely, and his soul saved
eternally. Luke 24. 47. Act. 2. 38. and 5. 31. and 3. 19. -- Act. 11. 18. Ezekiel.
18. 30, 31, 32. Luke 13. 3, 5.

To Repent, is set forth by two Greek words, very significant in the New
Testament. 1. (...), Metanoein, which properly signifies, To have an after-wit,
wisdom or consideration; a return to ones wits and wisdom again. As did the
Prodigal, Luke 15. 17. This word is used often, Mat. 3. 8, 11. and 9. 13. -- To
sin, is our folly; to repent of sin, is our after-wisdom. 2. (...),
Metamelesthai, To have an after-care, to be heedful afterward. It Is through
want of care and heed that men transgress: It Is Repentance that makes the
offender more careful to withstand and prevent sin for the future, 2 Cor. 7. 8,
11. This word is used in Mat. 21. 29, 32.

Repentance is twofold,

1. Initial, fundamental and universal: when a sinner at his first coversion
repents of all his sins, original and actual, at once, turning from them unto
God, Mat. 3. 2, 8. Mar. 1. 14, 15. Act. 11. 18. and 20, 21. and 26. 18, 20.
Heb. 6. 1, 2.

2. Secondary and particular: when a penitent after his conversion lapseth into
any sin or sins, and renews Repentance for them particularly. As David, Psalm.
51. tit. etc. Peter, Mat. 26. 75. Here, the former is ^hiefly intended, but the
latter not excluded.

Godly sorrow works Repentance not to be repented of, 2 Cor. 7. 10. But
properly, godly sorrow is not Repentance, but an excellent Preparative, Inlet
and Harbinger to Repentance. The proper Nature of Repentance stands in, 1.
Aversion from Sin and Satan. 2. Conversion unto God and all goodness, Act. 26.
18.

Now there are very many cogent Motives, that may incline a sinner to this
initial, fundamental and universal Repentance. For,

1. God himself greatly desires the sinners initial, fundamental and universal
Repentance. Ezekiel. 18. 23. and 33. 11. and 18. 31, 32. See how, 1. He commands
it, Act. 17. 30. Mar. 1. 14, 15. 2. He invites Non praecipit tantum, sed etiam
hor^atur. Invitat praemio salutem. Tertul. de Paenit. c. 4. p. 114. Franek.
1597.
to it, Isa. 1. 16, etc. and 55. 7. Mat. 3. 2. Ezekiel. 18. 23, 31, 32. Ier. 3. 1.
3. He promises great things to the penitent. Isa. 55. 7. Zech. 1. 3. Act. 2.
38. Hos. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 22. Act. 26. 18. 4. He professes, yea
swears, he has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but that he should
repent and live, Ezekiel. 18. 23. and 33. 11. 5. He receives penitents readily,
compassionately, gladsomly, Luke 15. 3. to the end.

2. Jesus Christ exceedingly endeavors the Sinners universal Repentance and
Conversion. Mat. 4. 17. Mar. 1. 14, 15. Luke 24. 47. Act. 26. 17, 18. For, 1.
He sent John Baptist his Harbinger preaching-Repentance, Mat. 3. 1, 2, 3, 8.
Luke 3. 3. to 15. 2. His first Sermon was of Repentance, Mat. 4. 17. Mar. 1.
1^, 15. 3. He directs his Apostles first to preach Repentance to the Gentiles,
Luke 24. 47. 4. He shows the Necessity of Repenting and Converting, Luke 13. 3,
5. Mat. 18. 3. 5. He upbraids and laments the impenitent, Mat. 11. 20. to 25.
and 23. 37, 38, 39. 6. He accepts penitents most compassionately, Luke 7. 37.
to the end* and 19. 8, 9, 10. and 23. 4 (...) Act. 9. 6, etc.

3. The Holy Ghost most frequently incites unto Repentance in Holy Scriptures.
Isa. 1. 16, 17, etc. and 55. 6, 7. Ezekiel. 18. 23, 31, 32. and 33. 11. Hos. 6. 1,
etc. and 14. 1, etc. Joel 2* 12, etc. Act. 2. 37, etc. and 3. 19. and 17. 30.
Heb. 3. 7, etc. Rev. 2. 4, 5.

4. The time [of the Messiah coming in the flesh foretold] is fulfilled; and
the Kingdom of God, [the Messiah's New Testament-Kingdom] is at hand, yea, as
to us, is already come: therefore all should repent and believe, Mark 1. 15.
Why? That thus they may be fitted and qualified for reception of Christ, and of
his Kingdom, to their Salvation.

5. There Is mention made in Holy Scripture of an whole cloud of Sinners
initially repenting of their ^ins, and turning from them unto God, encouraging
thee to imitate them in this narrow way of Life and Salvation. (...) Manasses,
^ Chron. 33. 12. to 18. John Baptist's Hearers, Mat. 3. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. with
Mat. 21. 32. The sinful Woman, Luke 7. 37, etc. Zacheus the Publican, Luke 19.
7, 8, 9, 10. The Prodigal Son, Luke 15. 15. to the end. Saul the Persecutor,
Act. 9. 3. to 23. Lydia, Act. 16. 14, 15. The Jailer and his House, Act. 16.
25. to 35. Many Gentiles, Act. 11. 18. and 15. 19. Many at Ephesus, Act. 19.
17. to 21. The Thessalonians, 1 These. 1. 5. to 11. The Thief on the Cross, Luke
23. 40. to 44. They that crucified, and consented to the death of the Lord
Jesus Christ, even 3000 of them, Act. 2. 36, 37, etc. All these are propounded
as examples to allure thee, and cords to draw thee unto initial Repentance.

6. Impenitency is most dangerous. 1. Is rebellion against Gods Command, Act.
17. 30. Isa. 1. 16, 20. 2. The fruit of a blinded mind and hardened heart, etc.
Ioh. 12. 40. Romans 2. 5. 3. Seals up the Natural man in his state of sin and
misery, Exodus 34. 7. God will not clear the impenitent guilty; and how woeful is
that state of sin and misery! Act. 26. 18. 4. Shuts him eternally out of Gods
Kingdom, Mat. 18. 3. 5. Treasures up wrath against the day of wrath, Romans 2. 5.
6. Renders their condition who live under the Gospel, worse then that of
Heathens at the judgement-day, Mat. 11. 20. to 25. 7. Exposes impenitents to
all judgments in this present world, Lev. 26. 23. Amos 4. 6. to 13. And to
everlasting damnation in the world to come, Luke 13. 3, 5. Ezekiel. 18. 20, 26,
30, 31.

7. True Repentance is most desirable and beneficial to the penitent Soul. For,
1. It is never to be repented of, 2 Cor 7. 10. 2. It thoroughly removes the
Natural man's sinfulness, though never so great, Isa. 1. 16, 17, 18. and 55. 7.
Luke 24. 47. Act. 5. 31. and 3. 19. And wretchedness, though never so deep,
Act. 26. 18. Luke 15. 32. Ezekiel. 18. 27, 28. 3. It returns the Sinner unto God,
the only supreme Good, Act. 26. 18. Zech. 1. 3. 4. It occasioneth much joy: To
the Saints on Earth, Act. 15. 3. To the Angels in Heaven, Luke 15. 7, 10. And
as it were to God himself, Luke 15. 20. to 25. 5. It intituleth the Penitent to
sundry precious Promises. As, Isa 1. 16, 17, 18. and 55. 7. Ezekiel 18. 21, 22.
Zech. 1. 3. Act. 26. 18. 6. It is the ready way to Life and Salvation, Act. 11.
18. 2 Cor. 7. 10. 7. It puts into possession of the Inheritance of the Saints,
of the Kingdom of Heaven, even Paradise it self. Act. 26. 18. Mat. 18. 3. Luke
23. 41, 42, 43.

XVIII. Direction.
SEarch out and try the truth of thy Repentance, as well as of thy Faith, lest
in this necessary Grace and fundamental Duty, thou mistakest a shadow for a
substance, an appearance for a reality, and so overthrow the whole Fabric of
thy Christianity.

Mock-Repentance, counterfeit Repentance, is of no account at all with God, nor
of any avail for spiritual blessings or eternal Salvation. Hos. 7. 16. Ahab got
no spiritual good, 1 King. 21. 27. Nor Judas, Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5. by their
counterfeit repenting.

Sincere Repentance may be discovered by the 1. Antecedents. 2. Constituents.
3. Concomitants. And 4. Consequents thereof.

I. The Antecedents, going before true Repentance, are; Conviction,
Illumination, Godly Sorrow, Hatred of Sin.

1. Conviction of sin, if true and sincere, when it

1. Leads a man from sin to sin, from actual to original. Psalm. 51. 1. to 6.

2. Smites the Conscience sharply for sin. Psalm. 51. 3, 8. Act. 2. 37.

3. Provokes the Soul to seek for remedy. Act. 2. 36, 37. contra Mat. 27. 3, 4,
5.

2. Illumination touching Christ, the remedy against sin. Act. 26. 18. If true,

1. Gives a more clear and perfect insight into the mystery of Christ and
Christianity, then any Natural man has. 1 Cor. 2. 6. to 15.

2. Melts the Heart into love to Christ, and tears, or at least, mourning for
sin. Luke 7. 37. to the end.

3. Conducts the Soul, like the Star, to Christ, Ioh. 6. 45.

4. Inclines the Soul to deny, do, and suffer any thing for Christ. Phil. 3. 7,
8, etc. Act. 9. 4, 5, 6. Heb. 10. 32, 33, 34.

3. Godly Sorrow, and Contrition, working Repentance, 2 Cor. 7. 10. If true and
sincere,

1. Wounds the Heart most for sin, as it is against God. Psalm. 51. 4. As
against Christ. (...) 12. 10, 11.

2. Drives the Sinner to seek spiritual relief. Act. 2. 36, 37, etc. Luke 7.
37, etc.

3. Deeply humbles and abaseth the Soul. Ezekiel. 36. 31. Luke 15. 17, etc.

4. Secretly refreshes the Heart that it can mourn for sin. Isa. 61. 3. Dolet
de morbo, gaudet de medicina: L^ments at the malady, rejoices at the remedy.

5. Is very great. Zech. 12. 10, 11. Psalm. 38. 3. to 11.

6. Is permanent and lasting. Psalm. 51. 3.

7. At last works Repentance not to be repented of. 2 Cor. 7. 10.

4. Hatred of Sin, if sincere,

1. Arises from true Love to God, that cannot endure sin. Psalm. 97. 10.

2. Comes from due esteem of Gods Word, that detects sin. Psalm. 119. 113. 128.

3. Flows from true Love to Holiness and Righteousness. Psalm. 45. 7.

4. Is chiefly for the sinfulness of it. Gal. 5. 17.

5. Is Universal against every sinful way. Psalm. 119. 104.

II. The Constituents of the proper Nature of Repentance, Aversion from evil,
and Conversion to God, Act. 26. 18. Col. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 9. discover the truth
of Repentance, viz.

1. Aversion from evil, if upright,

1. Is from sin cordially and really hated. Psalm. 119. 104.

2. Is from sin for its sinfulness against God. Genesis 39. 9.

3. Is consequently from all known sin. Ezekiel. 18. 21, 30, 31.

4. Is also from his own more peculiar iniquity, to which by Natural
Constitution, Calling, Temptation, etc. he was more specially inclined. Psalm.
18. 22.

5. Is from the power of sin. Col. 1. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 9. Ephesians. 2. 1, 5. With
crucifying and mortifying of sin. Col. 3. 5. Gal. 5. 24.

6. Is constant and continuing. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22.

7. Is joined with eschewing fellowship with others in their sins. Ephesians. 5. 11.
Psalm. 1. 1, 2.

2. Conversion to God, if sincere,

1. Is upon serious consideration, Luke 15. 17. to the end. Ezekiel. 18. 27, 28.

2. Is immediately unto Christ, the way to God* Act. 11. 21. with Ioh. 14. 6.

3. Is unto God as a reconciled Father in Christ. Lu^e 15. 18, 19, 20, 2 Cor.
5. 18, 19, 20, 21.

4. Is by the regenerating Spirits operation. John 3. 3, 5. Ephesians. 2. 18.

5. Is to God cordially and entirely. Io^l 2. 13. 1 Kings 8. 47, 48.

6. Turns to God, so as to resign himself to Gods Power and Government. Act.
26. 18. Col. 1. 13.

7. Turns to God, with fixed resolution never to turn away from him. Deuteronomy.
10. 20. with Psalm. 86. 11. and 73. 25, 26.

III. Concomitants, accompanying true Repentance, may give some light to the
truth of Repentance. Noscitur ex comite, qui nondignoscitur exse: A man is
oft-times better known by his company, rather then by himself. These are
Concomitants or Companions of true Repentance, viz.

1. An hearty, impartial, self-abasing and self-condemning confession of sin to
God. Psalm. 51. 17. and verse 1, 3, 5, 14. Ezra 9. 6. Dan. 9. 5, 6, 7, 8. Luke
15. 18, 19.

2. Faith in Christ: Mark 1. 15. Act. 26. 18. Heb. 6. 1. of which formerly.

3. Penitential Desires, and these vehement, viz. Against sin, that it may be
pardoned, subdued, extirpated, etc. And for abundance of Grace to these ends. 2
Cor. 7. 10, 11.

4. Prayer. Act. 9. 11. Even the Spirit of Prayer. Zech. 12. 10. Psalm. 51. 1.
etc.

IV. Consequents of true Repentance, a^e

1. More generally, All good fruits and good works, meet for Repentance. Mat.
3. 8, 9, 10. and 7. 19. Luke 3. 8, 9. with Gal. 5. 22, 23.

2. More particularly, These, and such like:

1. Vigilant care against sin for time to come. 2 Cor. 7. 11.

2. Enlarged thankfulness for Gods mercies in Christ, to the penitent and
pardoned sinner. 1 Timothy 1* 13. to 18. Luke 7. 37, 38.

3. Vehement and sincere Love; To Christ, for his Grace, Luke 7. 47. Phil. 3.
7, 8, 9, 10. To his Ministers, for their Embassey. 1 These. 5. 12, 13. Gal. 4.
14, 15. To his members, for his image. 1 Ioh. 3. 14. and 5. 1.

4. Singular joy in Christ, and in all his ways. Acts 2. 46. and 8. 39.

5. Cheerful new obedience to God in Christ. Acts 2. 42, etc. Isa. 1, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20.

6. Compassionateness to other sinners, with desires and endeavors to gain
them to Christ by Faith and Repentance. Psalm. 51. 12, 13. 1 Cor. 9. 19. to 23.
Luke 22. 32. Acts 26. 29.

7. Holy zeal to the peace and prosperity of Christ's Church, into which the
penitent is now implanted. Acts 2. 41. to the end. 1 Cor. 9. 19, etc. Psalm. 51.
18, 19.

XIX. Direction.
TUrn now unto God in Christ (O Natural man) by repenting: Come now unto Jesus
Christ, and apply him by believing: Delay not, tarry not, but make all speed,
all present speed, in thy life, in thy health, in thy youth, this day rather
then to morrow, as ever thou desire to make sur^ of life and eternal
salvation by Christ Jesus. Eccl. 12. 1. Heb. 3. 7, 8, 13, 15. 2 Cor. 6. 2.

To incline thee forcibly hereunto, consider seriously,

1. God calls for the early sacrifices and services to be performed to him. As,
The firstfruits of the Ground, The first fruits of Dough, the firstfruits of
all Fruit Trees, Neh. 10. 35, 36, 37. The Firstlings of Beasts, Exodus, 13. 1, 2.
The Firstborn of man, Exodus 13. 1, 2. The First Fruits of thy days: Remember
now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, Eccl. 12. 1. The first fruits of thy
study, care, diligence, affections, etc. First seek the Kingdom of God and his
righteousness, Mat. 6. 33. And will thou put off God with the last? with the
dross and dregs of all?

2. Gods Elect have come in to Christ, repented and converted speedily
immediately upon Gods call; and do thou still stand off, after so many calls
and invitations? The Apostles immediately upon Christ's call came to him and
followed him, Mat. 4. 18. to 23. The sinful Woman presently relented upon
Christ's preaching that sweet Sermon, Mat. 11. 28, 29, 30. (her History is
thought See Chemnit. Harm. Evaingel. cap. 57 in ratione ordinis.
next in order to succeed those words) Luke 7. 37, etc. Zacheus the Publican
was presently converted upon Christ's coming to him, Luke 19. 6. to 11. The
Thief upon the Cross, (who possibly never saw or heard Christ before) was
immediately converted, and assured that that day he should be with Christ in
Paradise, Luke 23. 41, 42, 43. Cornelius and his Company were gained to Christ,
as Peter was uttering his Sermon, Acts 10. 44, etc. The Ethiopian Eunuch, upon
Philip's preaching, instantly believed and was baptized, Acts 8. 35, etc. At
one Sermon of Peter 3000 were brought home to Christ, and added to the Church,
Acts 2. 36, 37, etc. The Hearers of the Apostles were speedily converted, about
5000, Acts 4. 4. Saul upon Christ's call instantly believed and repented, so
that Missus est ad Gentes, ex Latrone Pastor, ex Lupo Ovis. Aug. de Temp. Sermon.
74. p. 747. D. Tom. 10. Basil. 1569.
of a Wolf he became a Lamb, of a Persecutor a Preacher of Christ and of his
Gospel, Acts 9. 3, 4, etc. 19, 20, etc. At Paul's preaching Lydia's heart was
presently opened to entertain Christ, Acts 16. 14. The Jailer presently
believed upon the preaching of Paul and Silas, Acts 16. 30, etc. The Ephesians,
after they heard the Word of Truth, speedily converted to God, Ephesians. 1. 13, 14,
15. with Acts 19. 17, 18, 19, 20. The Thessalonians, upon Paul's entering in
unto them with the Gospel, turned from Idols to serve the living God, 1 These.
1. 4, 5, 9. and 2. 1. And what shall I say more? The Colossians believed and
were converted speedily. Non est procrastinandum auditoribus vangelii, sed ex
quo di praedicatur, ^os oportet and credere, and fructus proferre. Heb. 3. 8
Jo. Daven. Exposit, ad Coloss. 1. 6.
the Gospel bringing forth fruit in them, from the very day they heard it, Col.
1. 4, 5, 6. Now this Catalogue of early Repenters shall rise up in judgment
against thee, and condemn thee for thy delay.

3. The present time is of all other the very fittest time in the world for
thee, and for every one, to turn from sin by repenting, and close with Christ
by believing. For, (...) God says, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden
not your hearts, Heb. 3. 7, 8. 13. 15. and 4. 7. And do thou, with the Devil,
San^ diaboli vox est quae dicit, Da peccato quod praesens est, Deo and
Evangelio quod futurum est, peccato florem aetatis, Evangelio reliquias. Jo.
Baren. Exposit. in Ep. ad Col. 1. 6. p. 40.
say, Tomorrow? 2. Now is the acceptable time, now is the day of salvation, 2
Cor. 6. 1, 2. Hereafter may be the un-acceptable time, the day of damnation. 3.
Now, God may be found, is near: hereafter God may be afar off, and may not be
found, Isa. 55. 6, 7. 4. The present time is the time of mercy: God holds out
to the sinner his white Flag, his golden Scepter of many precious Promises. The
future time may be the time of judgment, and he may hold forth the red and
black Flags of blood and death, Prove. 1. 24. to 32. Isa. 65. 12. and 66. 4. I^.
7. 13. 5. The present time is only thine. Time past is irrevocably gone. Time
to come may never come to thee. The rich fool, that promised himself many
years, had not many hours to live; that night his soul was taken from him, Luke
12. 20. And then, if that prove thy condition, what will become of thy
impenitent; hardened, unbelieving, and Christless soul?

4. Delays in this case are very dangerous. For, 1. While Repentance is
delayed, iniquity is daily increased, and sin multiplied. Such go on still in
their trespasses, Psalm. 168. 21. 2. While Repentance is delayed, the heart will
be daily more and more hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, Heb. 3. 13. 3.
The more the heart is hardened, the more impossible it will be for the sinner to
repent, Romans 2. 5. 4. Late and long-delayed Repentance is seldom true, always
difficult. Unfit to day, more unfit to morrow. Qui non est body, ^ras minnus
aptus erit.
Long festering and rankling Sores are hardly cured, if curable at all. True
Repentance indeed is never too late, but late Repentance is seldom true. Late
Repenters do not so much forsake sin, as sin forsakes them. 5. While Repentance
is delayed, the sinner treasureth up unto himself the greater pile of wrath
against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
Romans 2. 5.

5. Thy life is short; but Believing and Repenting are a great and long work.
He that has much work to do, a long journey to go, had need to neglect no
time, but to be up early and doing.

For, What is thy life? Vita vapor, ventus, flatus, f^os, fabula, foenum, etc.
A vanishing vapor, Iam. 4. 14. A wind that passes, Job. 7. 7. A blast, or
puff of breath, Isa. 2. 22. A flower, flourishing and fading, Psalm. 103. 15,
16. A tale told, Psalm. 90. 9. Grass, now growing, now withering, Psalm. 103. 15.
A flood, still flowing away, never returning, Psalm. 90. 5. As yesterday, when
it is past, Psalm. 90. 4. An hand-breadth, Psalm. 39. 5. A watch in the night,
but three hours long, Psalm. 90. 4. A shadow, Job 14. 2. A sleep, Psalm. 90. 5.
An image, or show, Psalm. 39. 6. Nothing, and altogether vanity, Psalm. 39. 5.

Now, Believing and Repenting are great and long works. None can believe or
repent, but such as are regenerate by the Spirit of God, John 1. 12, 13. By
Believing we must know Christ savingly, Isa. 53. 11. Job. 17. 3. Must assent to
Gods Record touching Christ fully, Ioh. 3. 33. 1 Ioh. 5. 11, 12. Must embrace
the Promises, and accept Christ in the Promises, Heb. 11. 13. John 1. 12. Must
purify the heart, Acts 15. 9. Must conquer the world, 1 John 5. 4. Must quench
the fiery darts of the Devil, Ephesians. 6. 16. And must live by it upon Christ
continually, Romans 1. 17. Gal. 2. 20. Are these easy things? Repentance turns
from darkness to light, from the Power of Satan to God, Acts 26. 18. Tends
continually to mortify and crucify sin, Romans 8. 13. Col. 3. 5. And to perfect
holiness in Gods fear, 2 Cor. 7. 1. Tit. 2. 12, 13.

6. Death is most certain, that it will come, Heb. 9. 27. Sam. 14. 14. Psalm.
49. 6, 7, 8, 9. and 89. 98. Most uncertain when, where, or how it will come;
whether in youth, manhood, or old age; in the evening, midnight, Cock-crowing,
or daybreak watch, Mark 13. 35. Therefore seeing thou know not the year,
day, nor hour of thy death, thou have need to be prepared for it every day,
every hour. So true is that Verse; Mors certa est, incerta dies, hora agnita
nulli;
Extremam quare quamlibet esse puta. Joh. Gerhard. in Huzin. Evangel. cap. 162.
p. 226. Genevae 1645.



I may thus English it; Frail Man; most certain is thy death,
Uncertain is the day,
None knows the hour of his last breath;
Then look for it always.
In this respect Angustine's Diem ultimum suum quisque salubricer cogitet.
Misericordia Dei est, quia nescit homo quando moriatur. Latet ultimus dies, ut
observentur omnes dies: Aug. Homil. 13. p 441. B. Tom. 10. Basil. 1569.
Advice is very good; -- Let every one wholesomely think of his last day. It is
Gods mercy that man knows not when he shall die. Man's last day is concealed
from him, that every day may be observed by him. What Householder is there, that
being certainly informed that such a week or such a night, thieves will assault
his house, but at what hour is wholly uncertain, will not prepare and watch
every night, lest his house be broken through and robbed? Or, what condemned
Malefactor, being assured that in a short time he shall certainly die, on what
day he is wholly uncertain, but will make it his serious work to prepare for
his death, that he may die penitently? And wilt no^ thou, O sinful mortal Soul,
who know thy death is certain, the time when uncertain, endeavor by speedy
and sincere Repentance and Faith, to prepare for dying well?

Especially considering; That after death, this work of Repenting and Believing
has no place, no such work is to be done in the grave, Eccl. 9. 10. There,
thine heart can send forth no sighs, thine eye no tears, thy tongue no
confession, etc. in reference to thy sins. There, there, is no knowledge,
assent, or application of Faith to be exerted in reference to the Promises, or
Christ. But as the Tree falls, so it lies unalterably toward Heaven or Hell.
As soon as a man dies, there is a great gulf fixed, so that there is no altering
of his present condition, from better to worse, or from worse to better. Luke
16. 26.

7. Finally, O Natural man, Repent now, believe in Christ now, or never. 2 Cor.
6. 1, 2. Heb. 3. 7. to 16. Isa. 55. 7. Eccl. 9. 10.

(1.) Now embrace the acceptable time, now close with the day of salvation, or
never. 2 Cor. 6. 1, 2. For, when the acceptable time is out, when the day of
salvation is ended, thou can expect no acceptance from God any more, no
salvation for evermore. Prove. 1. 24. to verse 33.

(2.) Now believe in Christ, and repent according to the tenor of the Gospel,
and Ordinances of Christ, continued unto thee, Mark 1. 15. Luke 24. 47. or
never. For, if the Gospel be taken from thee, or thou from the Gospel, how
can thou repent? How can thou believe?

(3.) Now entertain Christ's sweetest ^nvitations and offers of Grace, with all
affectionateness and readiness of mind; or never. Mat. 11. 28, 29, 30. John 3.
15, 16, 17. and 6. 37, 38, 39, 40, 50, 51, etc. and 7. 37, 38, 39.

For, Christ will not be always inviting the obstinate, always offering Grace
to them that do reject it. The Guests that were bidden to the Marriage of the
Kings Son, ( i. e. of Christ with the Elect) and rejected the invitation, were
invited no more. Mat. 22. 2, 3. and 8. with Luke 14. 16. to 25.

(4.) Now open the door of thine heart unto Christ, while he stands at the door
patiently, and knocks importunately, by his Word, by his Rod, by his Spirit,
etc. Rev. 3. 20. or never. For, if Christ be still slighted and repulsed, so
that he being weary of standing and knocking, finally depart, he will wait no
more, he will knock no more, much less come in unto thee, and sup with thee,
etc.

(5.) Now, while thou art in the land of the living, believe, repent, turn to
God, work out thy salvation, etc. or never. For if Death surprise thee, if the
Grave shut her mouth upon thee, all these works will cease for ever. Eccl. 9.
10.

(6.) Now, like a wise Virgin, furnish thy Lamp of Christian Profession with
the oil of true Grace, that, when Jesus Christ, the Bridegroom, shall come to
the solemn marriage with his Church, thou may go forth to meet the
Bridegroom; or never. Mat. 25. 1. to 14. For if thou, like a foolish Virgin,
have thine oil to provide when the Bridegroom shall come, They that are ready
shall enter in with him, and the door will be for ever shut against thee,
though thou knockest and cryest, Lord open, with the greatest importunity. Mat.
25. 10, 11, 12. Then if thou be once shut out of Heaven, thou art shut out
for ever; if once thou art cast out into Hell, thou art shut up in it for ever.

(7) Finally, Now give all possible diligence to enter in at the strait Gate,
to attain eternal life by Christ, and to make thy Calling and Election sure;
while thou art here on earth, while thou art in this present world under the
heavenly deaws of the Gospel, Mat. 13. 44, 45, 46. Luke 13. 24. Phil. 2. 12. 2
Pet 1. 5. to 12. before thine immortal Soul be implunged into the intolerable
and everlasting torments of Hellfire, Luke 16. 23, 24, 28. Mat. 25. 46. Or
never. For if once thou art cast out into the Lake of Fire, there is no mercy,
no mitigation of torment, no repenting, no possibility of reconcilement with
God, etc. And thence is no hopes of Redemption or Recovery. Oh if the damned in
Hell, could by any tears or importunities obtain liberty, though but for a few
months, weeks or days, to be on Earth again, how diligently would they strive
to enter in at the strait gate, Luke 13. 24. How zealously would they attend
upon the preaching of the Gospel! How religiously would they sanctify the
sabbath! how devoutly would they pray! Once more offer Christ unto us; Once
more touch our hearts and Consciences; Once more enlighten us, let us partake
of the Holy Ghost, taste the good word of God, and the Powers of the world to
come. Heb. 6. 4, 5. Once more open the gate of mercy, etc. How deeply with
sighs and tears would they lament their sins day and night. How would they
endeavor to believe in Christ, repent and obey, yea to do or suffer any thing,
that they might come no more into that place of torment. But all such hopes are
for ever dashed. They had their time and season for all these things, which they
neglected and lost, and now shall never enjoy more, so long as Heaven is
Heaven, and Hell Hell.

O that all these things could be seriously thought upon, before it be too
late! But when must it be? NOW or NEVER.

XX. Direction.
UPon the sincere closing with Christ, accepting and applying him to thy self
as thine only Savior and Redeemer, what fullness of all spiritual blessings in
heavenly things in Christ, will be heaped upon thy Soul. Ephesians. 1. 1, 3, 4. etc.

What tongue can utter them; What heart of man can comprehend them? 1 Cor. 2.
9, 10. Be thou careful to walk worthy of them continually. Ephesians. 4. 1. Col. 2.
6, 7.

1. What heavenly Relations are presently vouchsafed to thee. Thou art a
fellow-citizen with the Saints, and of the household of God. Ephesians. 2. 19. and
they all thy brethren and sisters in Christ, 1 Pet. 2. 17. God is thy Father,
and thou his Child, 2 Cor. 6. 18. Ioh. 20. 17. Christ is thine elder brother
and not ashamed to call thee one of his brethren, Romans 8. 29. Heb. 2. 10, 11.
Christ thine head, and thou his member, 1 Cor. 6. 15. Ephesians. 4. 15, 16. Christ
thine Husband, and thou his Spouse, 2 Cor. 11. 3. Christ thy Redeemer and
Savior, and thou his redeemed and saved, Heb. 9. 12. Luke 2. 10, 11. The Holy
Ghost is thine Inhabitant, and thou his Temple and Habitation, 1 Cor. 6. 19.
and 3. 16, 17. Ephesians. 2. 21, 22. Therefore be thou holy in all manner of
Christian conversation, 1 Pet. 1. 14. to 18.

2. What great and precious Promises are thereupon given thee? 2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.
Promises; 1. Of the life that now is; 2. Of the life to come; and what Promises
can thou desire more? 1 Timothy 4. 8. Now Gods Promises are not like man's
Promises, yea and nay, off and on, sometimes performed, sometimes violated,
etc. but they are all Yea and Amen in Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 20. altogether
immu^able, it being impossible that therein the God of truth should lie, Tit.
1. 2. Heb. 6. 18. Having then these Promises, cleanse thy self from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor.
7. 1.

3. What a cluster of soul-beautifying Graces are immediately together with
Faith in Christ, instilled and infused into thy soul! Faith is the Captain and
leading Grace, all the rest follow. 2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, etc. These are the Divine
Nature, and Image of God, whereby the Believer resembles the heavenly Father, 2
Pet. 1. 4. Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 11. These make the Kings Daughter all glorious
within, so that her clothing is of wrought gold, Psalm. 45. 13. These make the
Church beautiful, even to the ravishment of Christ, Cant. 7. 1. to 10. and 4.
1. throughout. Labor thou to abound and grow in these Graces continually, 2
Pet. 1. 8. and 3. 18. And as he that has called thee is holy, so to be holy in
all manner of conversation, 1 Pet. 1. 14, 15, 16.

4. What eminent Privileges are upon thine accepting of Christ, heaped upon
thee ^ 1. Thou art eternally redeemed from all thy spiritual bondage under sin,
Satan, etc. under which thou wast enthralled, Heb. 9. 12. Gal. 4. 4. 1 These. 1.
10. Gal. 3. 13, 14. 2. Thou art reconciled unto God, who wast formerly at
enmity with him, Romans 5. 10. 3. Thou art justified freely through his Grace,
thy sins being pardoned fully through the blood of Christ, and thou art so
justified and accepted of God, that thou art become the Righteousness of God in
him, Romans 3. 24, 25. Ephesians. 1. 7. 2 Cor. 5. 19, 21. 4. Thou art adopted into Gods
Family, and art become one of the Household of God, and so art made an heir of
God, a joynt-heir with Christ, Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. Ephesians. 2. 19. Romans 8. 15, 16, 17.
5. Thou have access with filial boldness, by the Spirit unto the Father, and
may confidently cry, Abba Father, Ephesians. 2. 18. Romans 8. 15. 6. Thou art brought
into sweet communion with God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which is even the
Saints ^eaven on earth, 1 Ioh. 1. 3. 2 Cor. 13. 14. 7. Thou have a Treasury and
Fountain of all true Comfort bestowed upon thee, the Holy Ghost the Comforter
dwelling in thine heart, 2 Cor. 1. 3. 4, 5. John 14. 16. 8. Thou have in Christ
a new and most excellent Title to all the good things of this present life, 1 Timothy 4. 8. Matthew. 6. 33. 1 Cor. 3. 20, 21. 9. Thou art assured, that all
things, even the worst of afflictions and persecutions, shall work together for
thy good, for thy best, Romans 8. 28. 10. And finally, Thou have well-grounded
hopes of eternal Happiness in Heaven, when this life shall be no more, in the
immediate vision and fruition of God in Christ face to face, which is far best
of all, 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, etc. Romans 5. 1, 2. Ioh. 17. 24. Phil.
1. 23.

And therefore give all diligence to walk worthy of all these blessed
Privileges. Enthral not thy self again in the yoke of any spiritual bondage.
Provoke not God unto enmity by thy renewed sins. Blot not, blur not the
evidence of thy sins pardon by lapses and falls against thy Conscience. Behave
thy self toward thy God and all his Children, as one of the Household of Faith.
Restrain not Prayer, but pray continually, with groans that cannot be uttered,
by the assistance of the Spirit. Have no fellowship at all with Sin and Satan,
nor any needless fellowship with any workers of iniquity, Ephesians. 5. 11. Psalm. 1.
1. and 26. 4, 5. Psalm. 119. 115. Walk not disconsolately and dejectedly, but in
the fear of the Lord, and in the comforts of the Holy Ghost, Acts 9. 31. Be
abundantly contented in all conditions allotted thee by God. Fully expect good
by the worst of afflictions that may befall thee; and be ever careful to keep
thy Hopes and Evidences for Heaven firm and clear, that when thou come to
die, thou may lift up thine head, and triumph that thy Redemption and
celestial Coronation with Christ draws nigh.

XXI. Direction.
Wrestle also most vlgorously, (O thou that wast Natural, but art
spiritualized, wast dead, but art alive again) against all thy sins, spiritual
enemies, and their temptations, Heb. 12. 4. Col. 3. 5. to 12. Ephesians. 6. 11. to
19. for all time to come, that they may none of them in the least measure
eclipse any of these thy spiritual Privileges, or embitter any other thy sweet
enjoyments.

Holy David, by his lapses, brought many deep wounds and scarrs upon his
Conscience, Psalm. 51. 3, 8. some of which he probably carried to his Grave.
Loving and confident Peter, by his triple denial of his Lord and Master Christ,
purchased to himself a torrent of bitter tears, Mat. 26. 75. The Ephesian
Angel, by leaving his first love and first works, was so offensive thereby to
Christ, that he threatened the removal of his Candlestick, Revel. 2. 4, 5. The
Church her self by her carnal sluggishness and security, lost her sweet
Communion with Christ for a season, and was involved in deep spiritual
distress, Cant. 5. 2. to 9. Be thou warned by their examples, which are written
for thine admonition, lest through thy spiritual oscitancy and sluggishness,
thou bring upon thy self like spiritual calamities, and so far wound thy
Conscience, as to go bleeding to thy Grave.

XXII. Direction.
EXpress upon all good occasions, all possible tenderness of heart, and bowels
of compassion, toward those that yet remain in the first Adam, in their sinful
state of Nature, unrege^erate, especially toward thy kindred according to the
flesh, using all good endeavors to convince, convert, and gain them to Christ,
that they, as well as thy self, may be eternally saved. Luke 22. 32. Romans 10.
1. and 9. 1, 2, 3. Acts 9. 20, with 1 Cor. 9. 19. to 23.

For,

1. Even thou thy self wast sometimes foolish, disobedient, serving diverse
lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating others,
Tit. 3. 3. An enemy to God by wicked works, Col. 1. 21. Yea, dead in sins and
trespasses, etc. -- and a child of wrath, as well as they. or any of them, Ephesians.
2. 1, 2, 3. But God, who is rich in mercy, has saved thee by the washing of
Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. Have thou
then experimentally felt the Wormwood and the Gall of thy Natural state of sin
and misery? And do thou not commiserate such poor souls, as are still in the
gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity? Acts 8. 23. Have thou had the sweet
experience of the riches of Gods Free Grace and Love, in restoring thee from
death to life, from thy Natural state of sin and misery, into a supernatural
state of sanctity and felicity? And do not thy bowels yearn within thee after
other lost souls, especially those of thy kindred, that they also may be turned
from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God? Acts 26. 18.

2. Are not their souls, as well as thine own, very precious? O, Consider, 1.
Their immortal Constitution, which no Creature can kill or destroy, Matthew. 10.
28. 2. The invaluable price paid for their Restitution, even the most precious
blood and death of Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, 1 Timothy 2. 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1.
18, 19. 3. The incomparable and transcendent value which the wisdom of God
himself puts upon the soul; as being of far more worth then the whole world,
Matthew. 16. 26. And then think with thy self; Shall not I endeavor to hinder
the eternal loss, and to promote the eternal salvation, of such precious souls?

3. What advantage will redound in sundry respects, if God bless thine
endeavors, to the convincing and converting of their souls to Christ! For,
Hereby 1. Thou shall save a soul from death, Jam. 5. 19, 20. And what a great,
what a glorious work is it, to have an hand in saving a soul from death^ 2.
Thou shall hide a multitude of sins, Jam. 5. 19, 20. Even an heap, a sink, a
dunghill of hundreds and thousands of sins, thou shall hide from the revenging
eye of God, by Christ's righteousness, 2 Cor. 5. 20, 21. 3. Thou shall occasion
great joy in Heaven, among the blessed Angels of God, who exceedingly rejoice
at the Conversion of sinners, Luke 15. 7, 10, 22, 23. 4. Finally, Thou shall
hereby not a little further thine own eternal felicity, Deuteronomy. 12. 3.

Thou therefore commiserate thy Brethren in their sinful and wretched state of
Nature, as thy God has in thy like condition had compassion on thee. Can
thou lend an hand to pluck a Beast out of the mire, or a Sheep out of a pit;
and will thou not lend an hand to help poor lost souls out of the mire of sin,
snares of Satan, and pit of eternal destruction? O, warn them, convince them,
counsel them, exhort them, rebuke them, lament them, pray for them, weep over
them, do any good for them, that thou may by any means gain and save their
souls.

XXIII. Direction.
YIeld, with all enlarged thankfulness, all possible Praise, Love, and
Obedience, unto God, and unto the Lamb; who has loved thee of the riches of
his Free Grace before the world began, who in fullness of time has ransomed
thee by the invaluable price of his death, and in due time has washed th^e
from thy sins in his own blood, and in the Laver of Regeneration, by the
renewing of the Holy Ghost. Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 John 4. 19. -- Gal. 4. 4, 5.
1 Timothy 1. 15. and 2. 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20* -- Rev. 1. 5. Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6,
7. For,

1. Thou ought to be thankful for all Gods blessings of all sorts, the least
of them being beyond, yea contrary to, thy deserts, Ephesians. 5. 20. Col. 3. 17. 1
These. 5. 18. with Genesis 32. 10. but especially for those choicest spiritual
blessings in heavenly things in Christ, Ephesians. 1. 3. Psalm. 103 1, 2, 3.

2. The reality and sincerity of thy thankfulness, will inwardly best approve
it self, in thy cordial affection and un^eigned love toward thy gracious God
and Jesus Christ, for all his love, and all the fruits of his love in Christ.
Kindness begets thankfulness, and love breeds love, as fire begets fire, 1 Job.
4. 19. Thus, when the Psalmist would signify his great thankfulness to God for
his great mercies, he professes his dearest love to God; (...), I will love
thee dearly, [Heb. I will love thee with inmost bowels] O LORD my strength,
etc. Psalm. 18. 1, 2, etc. So Psalm. 116. 1. (...), I have loved, because the
LORD has heard my voice, etc.

3. The integrity of true love and thankfulness, does outwardly best discover
it self in a cheerful and sincere obedience to God and Christ, Job. 14. 15, 21.
1 Ioh. 5. 3. Such obedience is a real retribution of thankfulness, Psalm. 116.
12. to the end. Then we praise God aright, when we extol him, not only with our
hearts and lips, but with our lives.

XXIV. Direction.
ZEalously endeavor to promote the Glory of God, and of Jesus Christ, in all
things, throughout the whole course of thy life; and to be where Christ is, to
behold his Glory, that so thine inchoate happiness may be completely
consummate, in the immediate vision, and full fruition of God in Christ unto
all eternity. 1 Cor. 10. 31. and 6. 20. 1 Pet. 4. 11. 2 These. 1. 12. -- Ioh.
17. 24. Mat. 5. 8. 1 These. 4. 17. Rev. 22. 3, 4, 5. For,

1. Gods Glory, and the Souls felicity in the full enjoyment of God in Christ
unto all eternity, are the two principal Ends of all, which thou, and every
man, should chiefly intend and aim at in his whole life, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Romans 11
36. Psalm. 73. 24. to the end: God^ made all things for his glory Pro. 16. 4.
And all things ought to be levelled to his Glory. Man is made capable of God.
and therefore he is restless till he can fully center in God, in whom alone in
Christ all his happiness is treasured up. Augustine said sweetly -- Feei^ti nos
^d te: and inquietum est Cor nostrum, d^nec requiescat in te. Aug. Conf, lib.
1. c. 1. Tom. 1.
; -- Thou have made us for thee; And our heart is unquiet till it rest in thee.
As the Needle once touched with the loadstone, is unquiet till it come to the
Magnetic Center, and point toward the Pole.

2. Thou, that wast dead in sin, and a child of wrath, but art quickened by God
and made a child of Grace, of the riches of his Grace. Ephesians. 2. 1. 5, 6, 7.
Can never do enough for this God, and for his glory* And therefore he has
provided heaven for his people wherein they may glorify him eternally. Yet
while thou art on earth, glorify him to the uttermost in thy momentany life,
for thy Redemption, Reconciliation, Vocation, Sanctification, Justification and
hopes of Salvation: So shall thou by this heavenly employment begin Heaven on
Earth and pr^posses^ thyself of Paradise.

3. If a little taste, a short glimpse of Gods favor in Christ, breaking
thorough the thick clonds of thy manifold frailties here on earth, be so sweet,
as to transcend incomparably all subl^nary enjoyments, Psalm, 4. 6, 7. Cant. 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7: Then how sweet, how delicious, how ravishing will be the full
Sunshine of his Love unto thy Soul in Heaven for ever when all imperfections
and infirmities shall be totally and finally done away, Ephesians. 5. 27. Act. 3. 19.
Rev. 21. 4. and 22. 3. To haev Communion with Christ in this world by Grace, is
a blessed Privilege Ioh. 1. 3. Ephesians. 1. 3. But to be with Christ in Paradise
and to have Communion with him in glory is (...) by much more better. How
elegantly! Here being, as it were, 3 Comparatives. Phil. 1. 23. viz. To be with
Christ is far the best of all. Herein our Blessed Savior himself places the
height of his peoples eternal felicity, That they may be where he is, to behold
his glory, Ioh. 17. 24. That will be an immediate vision: Not as now through a
glass darkly, but face to face clearly 1 Cor. 13. 12. That will be a perfect
Vision: For we shall see him as he is, 1 John 3. 2. and know even as also we
are known, 1 Cor. 13. 10, 12. That will be a glorious Vision: we shall behold
Christ's Glory, which is infinitely beyond all Celestial, Angelical, or Created
Glory, Ioh. 17. 24. That will be a transforming Vision: for, we shall be like
him, because we shall see him as he is, 1 John 3. 2. Phil. 3. 21. That will be
a Beatifical Vision: for the chief blessedness Christ places in seeing God,
Mat. 5. 8. That will be a Vision with fruition: we shall so see Christ, as
fully to enjoy him, as our Head, as our Husband, as our Redeemer, as our
Happiness, as our Treasure, as our Glory, as our All. That will be an eternal
Vision and fruition: for, so we shall be ever with the LORD, 1 These. 4. 17.
There we shall (said Augustine) Ibi vacabimus and videbimus; videbimus and
amabimus; amabimus and la^dabimus. Ecce quod erit in fine, sine fine. Aug. de
Civit. Dei, l. 22. cap. 30. sub finem. Tom. 5.
rest and see; we shall see and love; we shall love and laud. Lo what shall be
in the end, without end. This will be the very Heaven of Heaven, and Glory of
Glory. Unto this eternal Bliss, the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, bring him
that writes these things, and him that reads them with an honest heart, in
his due time. Amen, and Amen.
