A DECLARATION OF THE COMMITTEE of ESTATES OF THE PARLIAMENT of SCOTLAND,

In Answer to some Printed Papers, Entitled, The Declaration of the Parliament
of England, and the Declaration of the Army of England, upon their March into
SCOTLAND.

^^inted by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majesty 1650.

Edinburgh July. 1650.
THE Estates of Parliament understanding that diverse persons, Subjects of this
Kingdom, with their ships and goods, had been lately seized at Sea, and carried
into the Ports of England; And being likewise informed that an Army was
marching Northward, to In-invade this Kingdom; Being resolved, so far as is in
their power, to use all possible ways and means to prevent War and Blood in
these Kingdoms, did upon the 22. of June last, send t^o Messengers into England
with Letters to Mr. Lenthal, Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Fairfax,
and the Governor of Newcastle, Complaining of the Injuries done unto us, and
desiring to know whither they would observe the rule and order prescribed in
the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms, concerning the remonstrating first the
breaches of Peace, seeking reparation, using all fair means, and giving three
Months warning before any Engagement of these Nations in War; to which
Letters, we did long before this time expect an Answer, but in place thereof,
Our messengers are there detained, and A Declaration is emitted by those, who
arrogate to themselves the Title of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of
England, that they have judged it just and necessary, that an Army be forth
with sent into Scotland, which accordingly is advancing to our Borders to
Invade the Kingdom, without any previous Warning. The justice of this their
undertaking, they offer to demonstrate from the late Invasion of England,
Authorized and Commanded by the Parliament of Scotland, in which design (they
say) all of us concurred to make a Prey of the English, though some difference
fell amongst us who should have the greatest Power of Command, and thereby the
greatest opportunity of advancing of either party, under the specious pretense
of the Covenant.

This does not well consist with what they say, Page 3. Concerning such in this
Nation who may have kept themselves f^ee from the guilt of these things, and
far less does it consist with the truth, but we desire not to be our own
Judges in the matter, let them ask their own Consciences whether ever any
people in the World did more evidence their freedom from guiltiness in a time
of defection then we did in that matter of the Engagement against England: Did
we not dissent and protest in Parliament against it? Did not all the
Judicator^es of the Church unanimously oppose it, and declare against it? did
not the Ministers faithfully and freely Preach and Pray against it, and
generally all that feared GOD in the Land Petition against it? did they not
suffer for not concurring in it? Yea, many choosed rather to expose their Lives
and estates to the mercy of their Adversaries tyrannizing over them, then to
contribute one sixpence toward the furthering of that Engagement, whereof the
Commissioners of both Houses residing in this Kingdom were witnesses, as by
some of their number was represented to the House of Commons, who upon
consideration thereof, wrote a Let^er to the General Assembly; Professing they
were assured that these impious and unwarrantable Actions could not be done
with the approbation and assent of the Religious and well affected people of the
Kingdom of Scotland, and that they did understand there was very few amongst
those who were in the Engagement against them that first engaged with them in
the Covenant and Cause, but such as are professed Enemies to them, however they
were then content to proceed thereunto, that they might the b^tter deceive the
people of England, and that therefore they were unwilling to impute such evils
to this Nation in general: Did we not before we heard any thing of he defeat
of the Engagers resolve to rise in Arms against the promoters of it, and being
in Arms did we not refuse to make any agreement with them, though never so much
to our advantage, until in the first place Berwick and Carlisle should be
restored to the Kingdom of England, Concerning which, L. General Cromwell
professed in his Letter of the 15. of October 1648, that he sho^^^ ever be
ready to bear wi^nes of our forwardness to do right to the Kingdom of England,
and in a former Letter of the 19. September, Acknowledges our care of the
Interest of England, and desire to preserve the unity of both Nations: Did not
both Houses of Parliament by their Votes of the 28. September 1648. appoint,
that in case the Noblemen and others that dissented against the Invasion of the
Kingdom of England, by the Army under the Command of the Duke of Hamiltoun
shall desire the assistance of L. General Cromwell that he be ready to afford
them all seasonable relief and assistance? which Votes were communicated to us
by Lieu. General Cromwell himself, and in the same Letter, after a particular
enumeration of all the wrongs and damages sustained by the Kingdom of England
from the Engagers, he did demand, in the name of England, this security, that
none who had been active in, or consenting to the said Engagement, should be
employed in any Public place or t^^st whats^ever, which was a cordingly
granted by the Committee of Estates, and ratified in Parliament. Did We not
also send Commissioners to both Houses of Parliament to Treat and correspond
with them in all thing which might concern the continuance of the former Amity
and Friendship betwixt the Kingdoms, and authorized to join with them in
presenting the Propositions of Peace to his Majesty, which Commissioners were
received, and our interest in the Propositions of peace acknowledged by both
Houses of Parliament. This is a short, but true account concerning our carriage
in relation to that Engagement, and how matters stand betwixt us and the
lawful authority of England: And as touching those who now quarrel with us,
if their own consciences condemn them not (as we have reason to think they do)
there is one greater then their consciences, even the Lord Jesus Christ, who
knows all things, let Him Judge between us concerning the truth or falsehood
of that which they would charge upon us, that all of us concurred in design to
to make a prey of the English, though some difference fell out who should have
the greatest power of Command. It is not the first time we have met with
Calumnies of this kind from that party, but we shall study to bear it the
more patiently; that still it is for our adherence to the Cause of Christ we
are reproached: And as for the good people of England, we trust they will not
readily give belief to such suggestions against the well-affected of this
Kingdom, when they consider we have two several times returned from England
with strong Armies, when there was better opportunity to have prosecuted such
designs.

Touching what is farther said upon this point, to aggravate the miscarriages
of the Engagers, in their taking of Berwick and Carlisle, and invading England
without an antecedent warning; We have nothing to say on their behalf, their
proceedings were palpably gross and inexcusable; But if their ways were so
bad, why do these, who now prevail in England, trace their steps, not fearing
their end, Will they justify themselves in that very thing for which they have
condemned others? We desire they may remember some expressions of a Letter
written to us by Lieu. General Cromwell and his Counsel of War the 18.
September 1648. shortly after the defeat of the Engagers, the words are these:
Give us leave to say, as before the Lord who knows the secrets of all hearts,
that as we think a especial end of Providence, in permitting the enemies of
God and goodness in both Kingdoms to rise to that height, and exercise such
tyranny over His people, was to show the necessity of Unity amongst His of both
Nations, so we hope and Pray, that the late glorious dispensation in giving so
happy success against your and our Enemies, may be the foundation of the
Union of the people of God in love and Amity, unto that end we shall (God
assisting) to the utmost of our power, endeavor to perform what may be behind
on our parts, and when we shall, through any wilfulness, fall herein, let
this Profession rise up in judgment against us, as having been made in
hypocrisy, a severe a venger of which God has lately appeared in his most
righteous witnessing against the Army under Duke Hamilton Invading Us, under
specious pretenses of Piety and Justice; We may humbly say, We rejoice with
more trembling, then to dare to do so wicked a thing.

We may here also correct a mistake of theirs, where they say, by the Treaty
six months warning was to precede War; it is strange how they have learnd to
multiply when they speak against others, and to mince in relation to
themselves: But because it may belong since they read the Treaty, We shall
pass that, and only desire to know how it comes, that not only contrary to the
Treaty, but to the law of Nations and common reason, they have, without any
previous warning, seized our ships, stopped our trade, and now have published a
Declaration, showing their resolution forth with to send an Army into this
Kingdom, even the late Engagers (who are justly condemned for not giving
previous warning according to the Treaty) sent particular demands to the Houses
of Parliament three months before invasion, which they declared they would
prosecute, and about a month before invasion, they published a Declaration of
their resolutions to march into England.

Another ground of the justice of their undertaking is, that they being invited
to come into Scotland, and having settled us in the power we now enjoy, we
exercise it for their destruction, That we take on us to determine what is
fundamental in their Government, and direct and threaten them if they change
not what is now established, and form it to our mind or accomodate it to our
interest, which they say is sufficiently cleared by the Protestation of our
Commissioners the Earl of Lothian, Sir John Cheislie, and Mr. Glendoning, who
have been owned and justified by the Parliament of Scotland, and no censure
passed upon them.

We shall first answer to this alleged invitation, They say Sir Andro Ker,
and Major Strachan were sent to them for that purpose, the letter then written
was directed to the Commander in chief of the forces of the Parliament of
England, which we heard were upon the borders, and we held it very necessary
for us to acquaint the Kingdom of England, or any entrusted by them, that we
dissented and protested against that unlawful engagement, and were then in
Arms in opposition to the contrivers and abettors thereof, and were firmly
resolved not to lay them down, until the garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle were
restored to the Kingdom of England; We likewise gave instructions to these
Gentlemen, But neither in the letter, nor instructions, as may be seen by the
printed copies published by order of the House of Commons, is there any call
given for the coming of the English forces into this Kingdom? We did only
signify to the Commander in chief of the English forces, that we were to send
to the Houses of Parliament to desire their assistance, and that by joint
counsels and forces, the disturbers of the peace of both Kingdoms may be
brought to trial and condign punishment, and that we expected the English
forces on the borders should be in readiness to concur with us when we
should give them a call, yet before any other address made by us either to the
Houses of Parliament or to those forces, yea before the answer of our letter
came to our hands, L. G. Cromwell marched into this Kingdom with his forces,
without waiting for our call, which we did not intend to have given to them,
but to have desired the assistance of the Houses of Parliament, with whom this
Kingdom had joined in Covenant, and to whom we had formerly given assistance;
In the next place, we were to have desired that those who were sent might be
such as had signed the Covenant, and would preserve and defend the doctrine and
discipline of this Church, according to the Covenant, and particularly, that
none such should be sent as would disturb the peace of this Church, or vent
strange opinions contrary to the Confession of Faith, directory of worship, and
Church Government. In the third place, that their number should not exceed four
thousand. And lastly, that the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlisle being restored,
and the engagers being subdued, or having submitted, the English forces should
remove out of this Kingdom; Therefore so soon as we received Lieutenant
General Cromwels letter signifying that upon defeat of the forces under
command of the Duke of Hammiltoun, he had received commands to prosecute the
victory until the Enemy were put out of a condition of growing into a new
Army, and the Garrisons of Berwick, and Carlisle, were reduced; in order
whereunto, he had resolved to march into Scotland, we dispatched away the Lord
Marquis of Argyle, Lord Elcho, and others unto him with Instructions, desiring
that the number of the forces should not exceed four thousand, that such as
should come were qualified as is before expressed, And that the Garrisons of
Berwick and Carlisle being restored, and those in Arms against us having
submitted, his forces should return to England.

As matters then stood, though we were very unsatilfied with many of the
proceedings of that Army, yet we could not but look on them as the servants
of both houses of Parliament, by whose authority they acted, and to whose
commands and directions they professed obedience and subjection; wherefore the
Houses of Parliament having, upon knowledge of the State of affairs in
Scotland, appointed Lieutenant Genesis Cromwell, by their votes 28. September,
1648. to afford us assistance; which votes were communicated to us by
Lieutenant Gen: Cromwell, on the fist of October, after serious debate and
consultation upon the matter, we judged it lawful for us to accept from the
houses of Parliament their offer of assistance, and accordinly desired that
some of the English forces might stay here for sometime, and when they were to
return to England, we wrote a letter to both houses of Parliament, wherein we
Acknowledged the benefice and advantage we had by the assistance of their
forces, and gave them a testimony concerning their fair and civil deportment
during their abode amongst us; all which we are yet ready to acknowledge, and
wish that these who had the charge and command of these forces would with the
same readiness acknowledge that they were then clearly convinced in their
consciences of the reality of our detestation of, and opposition to the late
unlawful Engagement against England. But though we have owned them sometime
as servants of the Parliament of England, will this infer that we should own
them now as their masters; by what law have they succeeded to their masters
inheritance, and clothed themselves with all the power of England; have they
not since that time they were in Scotland, violently seized the person of their
King, and murdered him in the face of the Sun? have they not turned the point
of their swords against the Houses of Parliament who gave them Commission to
rise in Arms, and whose privileges they were sworn to defend? have they not
taken away the House of Lords, imprisoned diverse, and secluded most of the
House of Commons? have they not overturned both civil and ecclesiastic
Government, and in place there of brought in a law less lliberty, and godless
Toleration, not withstanding their manifold Declarations and solemn engagements
to the contrary? had we known them as well when they were in Scotland as we do
now, we would have looked upon them as the Prophet Elisha did on Hazael the
servant of Benhaddad King of Syria when he weeped because of all the evil
Hazaell was to do unto the children of Israel.

They do next charge us with Ingratitude, claim to themselves the title of
being our preservators, and say we Exercise the power we have received by their
means to their destruction, This might well have been spared, if they had
remembered what assistance and preservation they had from this Kingdom, when
they were very low, and their greatest Commanders (though then not very
considerable) were countenanced because of their high professions for Religion
and Monarchical Government; Let the letter from L: G. Cromwell, and other
Officers of that Army written from their quarters about Bristow, to the
Scottish Army after the defeat of our forces at Kilsyth, speak what was their
own sense of the relief and assistance afforded them by the well affected in
Scotland, and we shall be silent. Though we would not detract from the
commendation of any, even adversaries coming in a hostile way against us, but
shall be ready to acknowledge all their good deeds; Yet we may say, that while
they were in Scotland, they neither shed their blood, nor sustained hardship
for us, nor will the time they stayed be much above a week, for every year
that the Scottish Army, stayed in England for their assistance, And for any
power which is in our hands, it has been continued therein by the Established
laws of the kingdom, and the Lords blessing on lawful and warrantable means,
and therefore we are to exercise it for the honor of God, and the ends of
that solemn Covenant which both they and we have sworn with uplifted hands to
the most high, and it cannot be made appear that we have in the least sort
exercised our power to their destruction, unles they conceive their destruction
to be included in the attainment of the ends of the Covenant which we are
inviolably obliged by the oath of God to endeavor in our stations and
callings. But they insist, that we pretend to matters of their Government, and
take upon us to determine what is fundamental there, and threaten them to
form it to our interest, which they say is sufficiently cleared from our
ouneing and approving the protestation made by our Commissioners at London, and
our not censuring them; surely they are far to seek for a ground of Invadeing
us, when they would found it upon that protestation. Is there any thing in it
but a representation of their engagements and declarations, a sober regrate
that they have not been kept, an earnest desire that they may be observed for
the future, and incase they should proceed otherwise, a protestation that we
might be free before God and man of the guiltines, evils, confusions, miseries
and calamities that might follow thereupon to these distracted Kingdoms; Is it
not Lawful for us in a common cause, wherein we are both concerned, if we
apprehend them proceeding in an ill course contrary to our engagements, to warn
them of it, and if they will not forbear, for our own exoneration to declare
that we will not concur with them, nor be Involved in the guiltines by our
silence. Will they quarrel with us for a meet profession of adherence to our
principles? will they for this, now after 16. Months are past, come in a
hostile manner to invade this Kingdom, dissolve our Judicatories by the sword,
conquer and subdue the nation, force upon us a change of government Civil and
Ecclesiastical, Establish Anarchie and toleration under the pretense of
furthering our just freedom and of preferring the peace and love of the Gospel
to discipline and Government: How disagreeable is this to their own principles
of liberty and toleration? The scriptures tell us that men may think it strange
that we run not with them to the same excess of riot, but for men of one
Nation to conquer, subdue and destroy another Nation because they will not run
with them, is almost a new thing on earth; however we shall comfort our selves
in this, that we have not given them just grounds of offense, and that they
shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.

And these are the two grounds of the justice of their undertaking to invade
this Kingdom, our accession to the late engagement against England, and the
owning of the Protestation made by our Commissioners, touching the first of
which, We dare say, their own consciences are convinced of our Innocence, and
touching the second, that their own judgments may freely absolve us from all
just ground of offense, if they be not altogether blinded.

We shall proceed to consider in the next place their pretenses for the
necessity of this War, F^st, they say all fair and amicable ways of procuring
reparation of the damages which England has sustained by occasion of the late
Invasion, have been denied, and rejected, and so We have owned the wrongs done
to that Nation. First, We answer, that no application has been made to us for
any reparation; except in one Letter 23. May, 1649. and therein their demands
for satisfaction were General; and therefore in our return 26. of June, 1649.
We say they cannot so well receive a particular answer; how then have all
amicable and fair ways been used, when there was only one letter written, and
that in general terms; Secondly, the way proposed by them for obtaining
satisfaction was such, as we could not agree to without sin, for they proposed
that we should meet and treat with Commissioners authorized by them, on the
behalf of the Commonwealth of England, which was to acknowledge them the
lawful authority of England, which we look upon as sinful to do, being bound
by Covenant to maintain and defend the Privileges of the Parliament of
England, which if it amount to any thing, does at least require that we hold
them as the lawful authority of England, and shall not give their titles and
styles to any other that by force would usurp the same, and seeing the wrong
complained on, was done against England, when the Houses of Parliament were
unquestionably the lawful power in England, and now the complaint is made by
those that have usurped that power, let any unprejudiced mind judge, whether
there be not cause for us to make it a case of conscience, considering the
strict Obligations betwixt us and the Parliament of England. Neither do those,
who would so earnestly have us to acknowledge them propound any thing to rid us
out of this difficulty, for we suppose they will lay this common ground with
us, that every new power which shall arise in any Kingdom, and prevail by
force, is not forthwith to be acknowledged by the neighboring Nations, the
very heathen Nations will stand at some distance in this case, and forbear to
acknowledge; much more ought we to be tender in Christian and Covenanted
Kingdoms. Now it is clear and evident, that there is a change both of
Governors and Government in England of late, and how this change comes, they
will not allow us to examine, if we speak anything relating thereunto, they
tell us that we take upon us to determine what is fundamental there. It is
strange to see what latitude they can allow themselves in their own Actings,
even to break and dissolve powers at their pleasure, laying aside forms (as
themselves express it) for the substance sake, yet how exact are they in
setting up their own form, requiting even from neighboring Nations, the
observance of the smallest punctili^ in their knowledgment of their new Titles
and Styles, otherwise they will count it a ground of Invasion.

Thirdly, We proposed to authorize Commissioners on behalf of this Nation, to
treat with Commissioners of both Houses of the Parliament of England sitting in
freedom, concerning all matters of just complaint which either Nation may have
against the other, and for redress and reparation thereof, and to do every
thing that may conduce for the happy Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and
never refused to speak and commune anent any particular wrongs or redresses
thereof in such a way, as did not import our Acknowledgement of their unlawful
Titles, and unlawful Parliament, which justly we esteem the present pretended
Parliament to be; for it has often been declared by many Acts, Ordinances,
Declarations and Protestations, that the Parliament of England does consist of
King, Lords and and Commons, and should never be altered: and in the beginning
of that Parliament, it was enacted by King, Lords and Commons, that that same
very Parliament should never be raised, nor dissolved, without consent of both
Houses of Parliament.

Fourthly, We answered to the matter of that Letter sent to us, so far as the
generality of the expressions would guide us to conjecture what they meant; and
if any other wrongs should be made known to us, we promised to return such an
answer as might give just satisfaction: and until this Declaration came to to
our hands, We never understood that they were unsatisfied with our Answer, for
that dormant Declaration of theirs, dated the 14. July. 1649. never came to our
hands, either in write or Print till now; nor do we think that ever it saw the
light, till the publishing ^f their other Declaration of the 26. of June last,
1650. which came to our hands but the other day; How then can they with a good
conscience say, that all fair and amicable ways have been used and rejected.

Fifthly, Although we cleared our own innocence in the matter of that
Engagement, yet when it was demanded, that those who were guilty, should not be
employed in places of public trust, it was granted accordingly; and it was
never craved (and so was never denied by us) that they should be liable to give
satisfaction for the wrongs and damages sustained by England; And while they
demand satisfaction, they might very well have remembered that the money and
great spoil which they got from that engaging Army, was very considerable, and
should likewise have remembered that the Irishes who were Subjects of the Crown
of England, had contrary to the large Treaty wherein England was bound to
suppress them; done much more harm in this Kingdom, and that no reparation or
satisfaction was given, though frequently and earnestly pressed, all which
being considered, it is most apparent, that all fair and amicable ways have
not been used, and so the inference which they would make, that we have owned
the wrongs and damages done by the late Invasion of England, falls to the
ground. The next reason of the necessity of their Invasion of Scotland, is
taken from the design and resolution which they say we have to invade England;
And this they would have appear, first, because when they demanded a Treaty for
satisfaction for the former Invasion, we have in expres terms, declared our
selves enemies to the Government of their Commonwealth. This has been already
cleared, that we cannot acknowledge them to be the lawful authority of
England, which they would assume to themselves excluding the King, the House of
Peers, and the fa^re greatest part of the House of Commons. We would gladly
know what Law, Reason, or Conscience, there is obliging us to acknowledge
their usurpations to be lawful actions, and though we have professed that we
cannot acknowledge them; and declared our resolution not to comply with them,
how does it follovv, that therefore we have resolved to invade England, have
we not often declared our judgment against Popery, and Tyranny in other
Nations, yet, neither did they fear, nor we so much as dream of an intended
Invasion.

Secondly, They would prove our intended Invasion of England, in that we have
taken upon us to proclaim the Kings Majesty, whom they term Charles Stewart, to
be King of England and Ireland, and in our Treaty since have promised him
assistance against England, to which we answer, That we claim no authority or
jurisdiction over them, and when the King was proclaimed, our Records were
searched, and he was proclaimed with the same titles his Father was proclaimed
both in England and Scotland, he was first proclaimed in England as King of
Greet Britain, and then in Scotland, and neither Nation took exception against
the other, or conceived that there was any claim of Jurisdiction, or any
Invasion intended, more then there was in relation to France, of which he was
proclaimed King by both Kingdoms, and as to the promises made in the Treaty of
assistance against England, there is nothing of that kind in the Treaty, but
that which has been long since published to the world in the proceedings of
our Commissioners the last year, to wit, that this Kingdom would contribute
their utmost endeavors by all necessary and lawful means according to the
Covenant, and the duties of faithful and Loyal Subjects, that his Majesty may
be restored to the peaceable possession of his other dominions, accoding to his
undoubted right of succession, which both Houses of the Parliament of England,
and those who make this pretense of Invasion of this Kingdom, did protest and
declare they would never wrong not alter.

And further, The Estates or Parliament have declared to his Majesty, that the
expressions of the Treaty concerning our endeavors for his restitution to his
other dominions, shall not import any Engagement or Obligation upon this
Kingdom to make War in England or Ireland, without the previous
consideration, and determination o^ the Parliament of this Kingdom, and the
General Assembly of this Kirk, or the Commismissioners of this Kirk,
concerning the lawfulness and necessity thereof, which was never so much as
taken into consideration in either of them to be debated, much less to be
determined, and our Letter 6. of March, renewed the 22. of June last, declares
our obligation, and resolution to observe, the Articles of the large Treaty, so
that it remains very clear from our proceedings, that there was no design
laid, or resolution taken by this Kirk or Kingdom, to invade the Kingdom of
England.

Fifthly, They say the Engagers refused to treat with the Parliament of
England, and they were answered only with the immediate March of an Army into
England, therefore we having refused to treat with them, they are to expect the
like, but the difference is very wide and manifest, both in relation to persons
and proceedings, if they had considered all things duly, they should have
ranked us with the Houses of Parliament, and themselves with the Engagers, for
their ways are not unsuitable. What they allege concerning the refusal of a
Treaty with them has been answered abundantly, Neither have we marched
immediately after our Answer into England, as the Engagers did, there are now
12. Months elapsed since our answer to their Letter, and they will find us
yet in Scotland.

Fourthly, they say, we have equally declared against them as Sectaries as
against those of Montrosse his party, ranking them with Malignants and Papists,
though we know the faith which they profess; But our declaring against
Sectaries in England, does no more prove a design to invade them, then our
declaring against Malignants in England, or the bloody rebels in Ireland, or
Papists in France or Spain, does prove a design to invade them. To declare
against the sinfulness of any course of backsliding apostasy or rebellion in
another Nation, (either for our own vindication from jealousies and suspicions,
or to warn the Subjects of this Kingdom to keep themselves from the like
defection, and from compliance) or the declaring our judgment in a way of
friendly admonition, will not be found a probable ground to argue, much less
to be an evidence of a design to invade another Nation; there may be many
sufficient grounds which may warrant to give a testimony against an evil
course that will not give a good calling to make a War against it. Concerning
the Faith which they profess and say, cannot but be known unto us; this is the
first confession of their faith that we have seen, and it is so short, that we
shall not wrong them to comment upon it, until they shall be pleased to give
us a larger, but touching the desire which they profess to restrain licentious
practices, and to have them punished by the Magistrate, they can never satisfy
the world, nor the most charitable disposition that is in it, that there is any
such desire in their hearts so long as their practices be quite contrary, the
fig trees leaves of flourishing words, may seem to serve for a covert, wherein
to lurk from the eyes of men, but how do they think to escape the searcher of
hearts, before whom all things are naked; yea, we think they should be ashamed
to say it before the world, that they are ready to bear witness against
licentious practices, and desirous to restrain and punish them, and yet for all
their readiness and desire, be silent and fit still, we wish they did not
countenance and encourage them; and showed not themselves too ready and active
against others, who strive to keep their garments clean, and to be free of
that contagion. When they have labored to vindicate themselves, they return to
cast aspersions upon us, and would have it believed that interest, dominion,
and profit under pretense of Presbytery and the Covenant, is our design
wherein (though we be conscious to our selves of many sins and infirmities in
the prosecution of the work of the Lord, yet) since we are so grossly charged,
we trust we may in humility and sincerity of heart, desire that he who knows
the secrets of hearts, may judge between them and us, whether they, do not
falsely accuse us, and we seriously exhort them to consider whether under the
pretenses of preferring the peace and love of the Gospel, to the Discipline and
Government of the Church, they be not undermining and subverting the Ordinance
and Government of Jesus. Christ, that they may set up the devices of their own
heart, and erect a sanctuary for errors, heresy, and schism. And now having
answered the reasons given by them to make it appear that we had a design to
invade England, we shall give clear evidences that we neither had, nor have any
such design; First, The Estates of Parliament having about the end of February
1649. received several Intelligences that there was a design in England to
invade this kingdom, did then appoint a levy of horse and foot; but withal,
declared (as is expressed in the narrative of the said Act of Levy, then
published in Print) that they did enjoin it only for the mere just and
necessary defense of this Kingdom from Invasion without any design or
intention, against any who shall not first invade this Kingdom, and so soon as
they understood that the forces raised in England, were marching for Ireland,
they made stop of their Levy. Also upon the 6. of March, 1649. they wrote a
Letter to Mr. Lenthall Speaker of the House of Commons, declaring that it was
very far from their intention to assume any power over the Laws and
Government of England, or any ways to raise sedition, or lay the grounds of a
new War, or do any thing in pursuance of the late unlawful Engagement, and
that no such thing could be inferred from the paper given in by their
Commissioners containing only an adherence to our former Principles
acknowledged by both Kingdoms. That they were so tender of the union betwixt
the Nations, that they did think the remonstrating of the breaches of Peace,
the craving of just reparation, and the using of all fair and amicable means,
should be first essayed, and then three months warning should be given
according to the large Treaty before any Engagement in war, and they expected
the like from England; and however any prevalent party in either Kingdom, had
infringed, or might break these bonds, yet they did not conceive it either
agreeable to Gods will, or conduccable to the welfare of these Nations, to lay
those sacred ties aside, as dissolved and cancelled, but rather that they
should be preserved for the good of both Kingdoms, and benefit of those who
have no accession to such breaches, and of succeding generati^ns, who are
innocent thereof, and may sustain manifold inconveniences, by dissolution of
the same.

To this Letter we never received any answer, nor any reply to our Letter of
the 26. June, but all this spring for these three or four months past, have
weekly heard of great preparations made against us, both by Sea and Land, yet
until the Estates of Parliament understood that the English Forces were upon
their March Northward, and some of our Ships were taken at Sea, they did not
so much as make ready for our Defense, and so soon as they took any resolution
therein, which was about the middle of June before they made any dispatch to
the Shires: Upon the 22. of June they sent Messengers to England with Letters
to Mr. Lenthal, Speaker of the House of Commons and others, wherein they
complain of the wrongs done unto them, and desire redress, declare their
obligations and resolution to observe the rules, prescribed in the large
Treaty, before any engagement in War, and desire to know whether these who have
the present power in England, do acknowledge themselves obliged, or will oblige
and declare their resolutions to observe the way and order aforesaid, and
plainly and clearly to declare, whether they march for offense or defense, and
withal acquainted them in that Letter, that they had renewed the Acts of
Leavy, and for Posture of Defense, made the last year, wherein the same
narrative is kept, as in the former, and in the power granted by the Parliament
to the Committee of Estates: It is expressly excepted and reserved that they
shall not have any power to give orders to the Forces of this Kingdom for any
other ends, then for the just and necessary defense of this Kingdom.

Upon the whole matter, there is neither justice nor necessity of their present
undertaking against us, nor can it be laid that all fair and amicable ways and
means which were used have been refused, but on the contrary, we have since
that pretended refusal used the means to prevent a War, and yet an Army is on
our Borders ready to Invade us: Wherefore we may safely conclude that there is
no just cause, much less any necessity for them to Invade this Kingdom, and if
they shall Invade us, that we are obliged by all Laws, both of God and man to
stand to our own just and necessary defense.

Whilst this Declaration was under consideration, there was another sent unto
us by a Trumpeter from L. General Cromwell, Entitled, A Declaration of the
Army of England, upon their march into Scotland, to which, except where we meet
with repetitions, we have resolved to make a further answer, And first to the
way of address, set down in the frontispice of that Paper; It is not directed
to those in Authority, more then to any other persons in the Kingdom, but after
this manner, To all that are Saints and partakers of the Faith of Gods Elect in
Scotland; So, as if there be none in Authority, whom they apprehend Saints, it
is directed to none of them, Can there be a more lively portraytour of Anarchie
in the World then this? and that varnished over with the color of Piety and
Religion! or can there be a more seditions, usurping way devised, to draw away
the hearts of the people from their obedience to Authority? May we not here
with great reason return them their own words, They pretend to matters of our
Government, and take upon them to determine what is fundamental here, and
direct and threaten us, if we change not what is Established, and form it to
their mind, or accomodate it t^ their Interest, And may we not justly declare
against them, as they did in another case, most uniustly against us; That the
said Paper does contain much scandalous and reproachful matter against the
just proceedings of the Parliament of this Kingdom, and an assuming to have
power over the Laws and Government of this Nation to the high dishonor
thereof; And lastly, a design in the contrivers of it to raise sedition, and
lay the grounds of a new War in this Land. They begin with suge^ed words,
wi^hing like mercy and truth, light and liberty with themselves; but are
marching with an Army to conquer and subdue us cruely, under error, darkness
and slavery; and then they ^urther preface, with a desire to make a distinction
and sepa^ation betwixt some and others in this Kingdom; but, blessed be the
Name of the Lord, there is not a different thought amongst all the godly in
this Land concerning the unlawfulness of their Invasion, and the lawfulness
of our defense against the same: They boast much of their great successes, and
reproach the Great Name of the Lord of Hosts, fathering upon him their
transgressions, but consider not that the Lord might have a hand of justice, in
the same things wherein they had a hand of injustice and that he in His wise
dispensation can correct one extreme by another, and yet remain displeased
with both. They begin also with an appeal (concerning the truth of the
particulars, which they are to remonstrate) to the Lord, who should they come
to day of engagement (they say) will be a sore witness against them, it they
utter these things out of hypocrisy, and they end with another appeal
concerning the truth of what they have said, desiring the God of Heaven to
Judge them accordingly, when they come to meet their enemies in the field, to
which we shall say no more, but beseech the Lord to look upon these
provocations, and to vindicate the honor of His great Name.

They labor in the first place to make good their proceedings in relation to
the late King, from his actions, which we intend not to justify, But who made
them the Kings Judge? or where is there warrant to take his life: When such a
thing was suggested to David (though anointed King of Israel) against Saul, who
was rejected of the Lord, he said, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing:
wickedness proceeds from the wicked, but mine hand shall not be upon him.
They endeavor to vindicatte their actions against the Houses of Parliament,
and concerning the change of the fundamental Government from the true and
equitable intent of the constitution of England, which we shall not insist upon
to answer, but we think they might with as great confidence have said to us,
that white is black, and black is white, and bring arguments to make us believe
it to be so in England, They would also clear their proceedings from the
example of ours, in the year 1648. for (say they) We acted contrary to Acts of
Parliament, and called a new one, excluding whom we thought fit; all which was
done by virtue and authority from the Committee of Estates, which was no
Committee, being constituted of such persons, as by Act of the foregoing
Parliament had not legal right to sit or Act therein, they not having taken
the Oath in reference to the late engagement which was enjoined by Parliament,
or else to have no place therein.

To which ^e answer, that whatsoever we acted, was in performance of the solemn
League and Covenant, and Treaties betwixt the Kingdoms, which are above any Act
of Parliament, and according to which, the Committee of Estates were by their
Commission bound and appointed to manage the affairs of the Kingdom. The
solemn League and Covenant, being an oath to God allowed and appointed by the
authority of both Kingdoms, cannot be repealed, or made void by any subsequent
Acts of Parliament though of both Kingdoms; nor can all the powers on earth
absolve those that have taken it from their duty therein expressed, by which
they are bound all the days of their lives, zeal^usl^ and constantly to
continue in maintaining and pursuing the ends thereof against all opposition,
and to promote the same according to their power against all lets and
impediments whatsoever.

2. What we acted was for our own just defense against an actually oppressing
Army, whose proceedings were so wicked and boundless, as they were not only
contrary to the Covenant and Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms, but to the very Acts
and Determinations of the Parliament from whom they had their Commission.

3. Though the Members of the Committee of Estates were appointed at their
first meeting in the Committee, to accept their Commission, and give their
oaths for faithful discharge of the trust reposed in them, in reference to the
Engagement against England, or else to have no place therein, yet there is
nothing in the Act of Parliam-declaring their proceedings null, and void,
incase they did not take the Oath aforesaid, and the Engagers themselves did
admit some to sit and vote, who did not tak^ that Oath: will it therefore
necessarily follow, that all which they did, was in Law null and void? Besides,
the last Act of Parliament concerning the power of the Committee of Estates,
does not at all limit the Members to any Oath.

4. It was agreed in the Treaty at Sterling, by common consent, that such
Members of the Committee of Estates, as were accessory to the Engagement,
should forbear coming to the Committee of Estates, until the next Session of
Parliament; to which, the determination of differences were referred, and our
whole proceedings were ratified by the Parliament, and now also by the Kings
Majesty.

We have not done any thing against our Vows, Oaths, Covenants, Protestations
and Declarations, as they have done; but in pursuance of them, we have acted in
our own defense against visible and actual tyranny and oppression, not upon
jealousies or suspicions against a Parliament, consulting and voting peaceably,
as they have done. We have adhered to the Laws and Constitutions of the
Kingdom, and have not altered the fundamental Government thereof, as they have
done, without any power, warrant, or calling. But what suppose they were able
to justify their proceedings, as they are not, what would that contribute for
to nuke up a just ground for invading the Kingdom, even suppose they had the
authority of both Houses sitting in a full Parliament, and the Kings consent
thereunto, they have no power or jurisdiction over this Kingdom, the Lord has
been pleased these many hundred ye^rs to preserve our Freedom, whilst there
was little knowledge of the Gospel in the Land: And we do confidently trust
in his Name, and are persuaded, that he will not now give us up to the
vvilland power of those that would bring in Darkness for Light, Error for
Truth; and instead of Government, make way for Toleration, Anarchie and
Confusion.

If Treaties be urged against them, they were broken, say they, by the full
Authority of the Parliament of Scotland, they very well know the contrary, that
a very considerable number of the Parliament protested against it (which
certainly even in Law much weakened the Authority) and that it was revoked by
the full Authority of Parliament, and the House of Commons, in their Letter to
the General Assembly, has acknowledged us free of it, and our Commissioners
have been since admitted and received by both Houses of Parliament, and our
Interest in the Treaty acknowledged, as has been already more fully expressed.
How well can they take upon them to person at the Houses of Parliament (whom
they have broken in pieces) in making up challenges against us, but they will
not own their actions in any thing that may plead for us. They insist, that
the breach is not made up so, as to challenge England on agreements, unless we
think that Scotland may break, and England should remain bound, whereas it is a
known Law of Nations, that in the breach of the League by the one party, the
other is no longer obliged; We never said, either that the one Kingdom could be
free, and the other bound; or, that the one Kingdom having broken, the other
was obliged to keep; if reparation of the wrong done was refused; but that
notwithstanding a prevailing Party break, yet both Kingdoms are bound still
against the breaking Party, and that reparation ought to be made. This will
appear, if the scope and intent of the large Treaty made betwixt the Kingdoms,
be considered, as it is expressed, to wit, That the great blessing of a
constant and friendly conjunction of the two Kingdoms, now united by
allegiance and loyal subjection to one Sovereign and Head, may be firmly
observed and continued to all posterity, it is agreed, etc. And words to the
same purpose are again twice repeated, the several cases of breaches of the
Peace which may fall out; and the way of remedy are set down: for Commissioners
are appointed in the Intervals of Parliaments for conservation of the Peace, to
which Commissioners in the Intervals, as afterward to Parliaments, all breaches
are to be remonstrated, which had been altogether needless, if every breach of
the Treaty had made it null and void: According to this sense, the Houses of
Parliament have formerly declared, particularly in the year 1641. when there
was some appearance of the beginning of trouble in this Kingdom, the Houses of
Parliament did in their sense and apprehension of the National Alli^nce
betwixt the Kingdoms settled and confirmed by the large Treaty and Acts of
Parliaments of both Kingdoms declare, that they were bound to apply the
Authority of Parliament and power of England to the preservation and
conservation of our Peace, and when the troubles of England, did grow to a
greater height, about the end of the year 1642. the Houses of Parliament did
again declare, that seeing the subtle practice of the common Enemy of the
Religion and Liberty of both Nations, did then appear in England, with more
evidence, strength and danger than it did in Scotland the former year:
therefore in their judgment, the same obligation did ly upon their Brethren of
Scotland by the aforementioned Act, with the power and force of this Kingdom
to assist England in repressing these amongst them who were in arms against the
Parliament, and fordestruction thereof from which and other Declarations, and
the express meaning and intent of the Treaty; it may be easily collected that
what wrong is done by the common enemies of both Kingdoms, though it ought to
be repaired, yet it is not to be looked on as that which should cancel and
dissolve the Treaty and the mutual amity and alliance that is betwixt the
Kingdoms, but that either Kingdom ought when they a^e desired and called
thereunto to be assistant to other in their str^^ts, and the treaties ought to
continue undissolved, and to be preserved for the good of the present and
future generations, unles it be intended that they shall for ever here^fter
remain in hostility, or that the one shall conquer the other; for they cannot
be tied by stricter bonds then they are already.

If the Covenant be alleged against them, they affirm they have kept it
religiously, which they would make out by a distinction thus; The Articles
concerning Religion and civil Liberties have the first place in the Covenant
(say they) and these which concern the Kings Interest and constitution of
Parliament the last, and these with subordination one to another, the Covenant
tied them to preserve Religion and liberty as the ends of it, even when these
were inconsistent with the preservation of the Kings Interest and the frame of
Parliament, because when the means and the end cannot both be enjoyed together
the end is to be preferred to the means. That there was a real inconsistence,
because the Houses accepted of his Majesty's concessions at Newport, which were
destructive to Religion and the Covenant, and acquiesced therein, but the Army
appeared against them, and so Religion and liberties are preserved; But first
there is no such distinction in the Covenant betwixt Articles, as that one is a
mean, and another an end, though each of them may conduce to the strengthening
another, the ends are expressed in the title, narrative and Articles thereof,
and are unitive and copulative not disjunctive, nor is there any inconsistencie
betwixt the Articles and ends thereof, otherwise it had been unlawful for to
have taken the Covenant. And the third Article, with which they quarrel most,
does oblige us expressly to endeavor the prosecution thereof with the same
sincerity, reality and constancy as the rest; Neither regal nor Parliamentary
Government are in their own nature inconsistent with the preservation of
Religion; It were absurd to say so, both reason and experience evidencing the
contrary, and there is great fallacy in the argument given to prove their
inconsistencie, for the Instance is concerning the actions of Governors, which
are sa^d to be destructive to Religion, But what is that to the Government,
they might as well have reasoned thus; The English Army did in the year 1647,
offer proposalls to the King, which were destructive to religion, therefore the
Army must be taken away, and we will have no more Armies: If then the
preservation of Religion and the civil Government be consistent, as the
Covenant it self does necessarily presuppose, then certainly our end^avours to
preserve them may very well consist, and ought to be performed with sincerity,
realty and constancy, and unavoidably it will follow, that an endeavor to
destroy any of them is a clear breach of, and inconsistent with our Covenant
and oath to God, their distinction then falls to the ground, and consequently
their conclusion, so that their endeavoring to destroy and actually destroying
the King, and changing the fundamental Government, is in our judgment so far
from being a keeping of the Covenant, as it is a clear and evident breach
thereof.

It might have been much more strongly argued for Zedekiah then any thing that
can be said in the present case, that the keeping of his oath, made to the King
of Babylon was destructive to Religion, and inconsistent with his duty to God,
as King of Israel, and with the civil liberties of the people of God, when the
King of of Babylon had spoiled the temple and carried away all the Princes, all
the mighty men of valor all that were apt for war, and all that were crafts
men and smiths, that the Kingdom might be base and not lift it self up, yet
what says the Spirit of GOD, Shall he prosper? Shall he escape that does such
things? Or shall he break the Covenant and be delivered? As I live says the
Lord God, surely in the place where the King dwells that made him King, whose
Oath he despised, and whose Covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of
Babylon shall he die.

When it was alleged against the late engagers, that their invading England
was contrary to the 5. Article of the Covenant, by which they were obliged to
endeavor that the Kingdoms may remain conjoined in a firm Peace and union to
all posteri^y; they were ready under the pretenses of endeavoring the
reformation of Religion, the rescuing of his Majesty's Person and preservation
of the privileges of the Parliament of England, to declare before God and the
world that they were resolved never to break the Union betwixt the Kingdoms,
nor to entreanch upon the National rights of the subjects of England, or their
liberties, not considering that the Articles of the Covenant were unitive and
copulative, and that the Covenant is broken, and not kept, when any one Article
thereof is broken. And now under the like pretenses of the advancement of Gods
glory and the furthering just freedom, the Sectaries are invading Scotland,
contrary to that 5. Article of the Covenant, but the same Lord who avenged the
quarrel of His broken Covenant upon the late Engagers, lives and reigns to
avenge it upon the Sectaries.

Whereas they mention their appearing against the Houses of Parliament, who had
accepted of the Kings concessions at Newport, which were destructive to
Religion, and that thereby they have preserved both Religion and Liberty, how
do they know that Religion and Liberty would have been destroyed if they had
not appeared? the Lord could have preserved them by lawful means, and stands
not in need of sinful assistance to accomplish his work: But how they can say
to those that fear the Lord in Scotland, that Religion and Liberty are now
preserved, we very much wonder, let them read over that testimony of the Kirk
of Scotland against Toleration, (from which they borrow that proof that the
Kings concessions were destructive to Religion) and compare it with the state
of Religion this day in England, and they shall find in the Judgment of the
Kirk of Scotland, Religion is by that Army endeavored to be destroyed, and not
preserved. As their arguments from inconsistence do not, so these taken from
the subordination of the ends of the Covenant, will much less help them; Gods
Ordinances are not contrary to, nor destructive of other; Christ commands us to
give unto God what was Gods, and also unto Caesar what was Caesar's, which is
agreeable to that known maxim subordinata, non pugnant; some duties do deserve
preference to other, yet never so, as to take off the obligation of
endeavoring to perform other duties so far, as is in our power, much less
does it allow us a liberty to do the contrary; we should not be carnally wise,
and over anxious about the issue, but ought to perform duties according to Gods
revealed will, and leave the event to him. The Malignants under a pretense of
doing duties to the King, neglect all duties to God; and the Sectaries under
pretense of Religion and Liberty, neglect all duties to the King, but neither
of these ways have been blessed of God, the Malignants have never done real
service to the King, but were seeking their own interest, and and ends under
the pretense of his service; so the Sectaries for all their fair pretenses to
preserve and defend Religion, are but destroying it, and can dispense with
oaths and sacred Covenants, in order to their own interest; making Religion
subservient to their particular ends.

When the Covenant is alleged against their proceedings for changing the civil
Government, the Army says that they have kept it religiously, and they labor
to answer objections to the contrary, by distinctions, granting that they have
alterd the form, but say they have kept the substance, but those who claim to
be the Parliament of the Common wealth of England, would seem to deal more
ingenuously in their Declaration of the 14. July, 1649. for say they, the
Parliament has not by the Covenant Treaties and Declarations, excluded it
self from the use and exercise of the supreme legislative authority, to alter,
repeal, and make void any thing whatsoever, appertaining to the Government of
that Nation, or if they have, it is not to be imagined, that any Covenant,
Treaty or Declaration in that behalf, could be binding in things which a
Parliament cannot give away from if self; or lastly, if any thing of that kind
could be urged from the Covenant, Treaties, and Declarations, the late Invasion
of England has cancelled it, and made it invalide, as to any obligation upon
England. They plainly disclaim all obligations by the Covenant, in relation to
the preservation of the form of Government, yet what strange subterfuges are
here, perhaps they would be thought to have some regard to the Covenant. In a
word, that which they say, is, either there is noth^ng in the Covenant, which
rerstrains the use and exercise of the legislative authority in altering any
thing appertaining to the Government of that Nation, or if there be any thing
in it of that nature, it is not binding, or if it be binding, the late Engagers
of Scotland have loosed if, and so it is cancelled. Is it not a wonder to see
how men can so dally with the oath of God, and how their consciences can rest
upon such doubtful alternatives, and yet in all this hesitation and darkness,
act so forwardly. As to the first case which they make, it is very clear that
they are bound by the Covenant all the days of their lives, to endeavor to
preserve the rights and privileges of the Parliament, and if any rights or
privileges, certainly these which the Parl. has both before, and since the
taking of the Covenant, declared to be fundamental, they are likewise to
endeavor to preserve the Kings person and authori^y, in the preservation and
defense of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms, that the world may
bear witness with their consciences of their loyalty, and that they have no
thoughts or intentions to diminish his Majesty's just power and greatness, and
herein the legislative authority is undoubtedly restrained and limited from all
endeavors to the contrary. And as to the second case where they say it cannot
be binding, they know they should not change, though they swear to their hurt,
the Almighty (blessed be his glorious name) holds himself obliged to keep
Covenant, even with his own Creatures, and shall not the creature be bound to
keep Covenant, when they swear to him. We know not what a vast power they
would ascribe to their legislative authority, but as it is used, it seems to be
like that madman in the Gospel that brake all bands, so as nothing could hold
him fast. The power of dispensing with oaths, is condemned in Popes and
Princes, and there is no reason to maintain the same power in others. Neither
will the third serve their turn, to say that the late Engagers have broken the
Covenant, and so they are free; for the transgressions of others, cannot
absolve their consciences from the obligation of a Covenant made with God, the
knowledge of their sin and punishment, may well aggravate their guiltiness in
the sight of God. We shall say no more on this subject, but pray the Lord to
direct us, sincerely and uprightly to mind all the ends of the Covenant, and
to keep us from declining or shifting the obligations which it lays upon us
as some do, and from that which others call a religious keeping of it, though
they break it in some Articles. For Presbyteriall Government (they say) it is
not to be imposed by force, but wherefore have they opposed by force the
Establishing of it as was Ordained by the Houses of Parliament, and if they
desire not themselves to be forced to any way, why came they in a hostile
mannner to force their ways upon us: Certainly that is no effect of Faith,
working by Love.

They tell us of the danger we are in from Malignants, and bring in one
instance from the procedings of some Lords and others in the North of Ireland,
and another from the late engagers against England, to which we say, that we
are so far associating with Malignants, as we have neither admitted them to
trust in our Counsels or Armies, nor permitted them to come into our armies,
but have discharged them under high penalties, yet however, we do acknowledge
there is danger from the pretenses of Malignants, but that is no argument why
we should not also beware of the smooth pretenses and dangerous insinuations of
Sectaries: We trust the Lord, who has called us to a trial on both hands,
will with the tentation give us the issue: We must not be discouraged, but
rather count it all joy when we fall into diverse temptations.

Concerning our agreement with his Majesty; we know there is scarce any
possibility to satisfy those who have declared themselves enemies to
Monarchical Government, but we desire all good men to consider how we have
been led thereunto by following our duty in prosecution of the National and
solemn League and Covenant. After the death of his Majesty's Father, having
sought the LORD for his direction and had serious consultation amongst our
selves, we found it a duty lying upon us by Covenant (wherein we have
professed in the sight of GOD that we had before our eyes the Honor and
Happiness of the KING and his Posterity, and made an appeal to the World as
witnesses with our consciences of our loyalty, and that we had no thoughts to
diminish his Majesty's just Honor and Greatness) that we should proclaim and
declare to all the world his Majesty to be by the providence of GOD, and
Lawful Right of undoubted succession and descent, KING of Great Britain, France
and Ireland, and that all the Subjects of this Kingdom were bound faithfully
to obey Him, maintain and defend Him according to the National Covenant, and
the Solemn League and Covenant betwixt the Kingdoms, with all declaring, that
before He were admitted to the exercise of His Royal Power, He should give
satisfaction to this Kingdom in these things that concerned the security of
Religion, the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and the good and Peace of this
Kingdom, resolving for that end, to make our humble and earnest addresses to
His Majesty. This was the only way left unto us to prosecute our duty,
without giving advantage to Malignants upon the one hand, who would admit
Kings, without minding any thing of Religion, or else giving advantage to
Sectaries upon the other, who without regard to the obligation lying upon them
by Covenant, have altered the Fundamental Government. Having made application
to His Majesty once and again, He has now given satisfaction to all our
Demands, for he has sworn and subscribed the National Covenant, and the
Solemn League and Covenant, acknowledged the Authority of Parliament, and
approved the acts thereof, agreed that all matters Civil be determined by the
Parliament, or such as shall be authorized by them, and all matters
Ecclesiastical by the General Assembly of this Kirk, or such as shall be
authorized by them. He has further agreed to recall and disclaim all
Commissions issued forth for acting any thing by Sea or Land, to the prejudice
of the Covenant, or of the Kingdom of Scotland, or of any, who do or shall
adhere to the Solemn League and Covenant and Monarchical Government in any
other of his Majesty's Dominions, and all Declarations made by any in his name,
or by his warrant against the same, and that he shall disallow and disclaim, or
declare null and void all Treaties and agreements with the bloody Rebels in
Ireland, and that he will never allow nor permit any liberty or the Popish
Religion in any part of his Dominions; That he shall swear the Coronation Oath,
and that he shall then declare he will in matters Civil follow the Counsel of
his Parliaments, and such as shall be authorized by them, and in matters
Ecclesiastical, the General assembly, and such as shall be authorized by
them. Having granted these Demands, and the Lord in his providence having
brought him amongst us, and he professing his grief and sorrow for his former
ways, whereunto he was led by evil Counsel (of which we are bound to
construct charitably, considering his age and education) The Estates of
Parliament of this Kingdom, have thought it their duty to ^^st^re His Majesty
to the exercise of His Royal Power: And if from a tender regard and conscience
of the Oath and Covenant of God, we have been following our duty herein, and
not for worldly Interests and designs, where is our offense? or what reason or
just grounds can be given by these who are now upon our Borders for invading
this Kingdom? None of His Majesty's actions before His coming into this
Kingdom can in the least sort be charged on us, unless they had been owned by
us, and for the future, it shall be our care, that there may be no just ground
of complaint. As for the blood and other sins which the Lord may put on the
account of the KING, and that Family, we shall mourn before the Lord for it,
and pray, that his wrath may be turned away, and that as the Lord has now been
pleased in his wise and gracious providence, to admit hi^ to enter in Covenant
with Him and His People, so also that he would give him a new heart and spirit,
so to guile him in all his ways, as may be matter of rejoicing to all that
fear the Lord, and may convince his greatest Adversaries, and stop their
mouths from reproaches. Themselves might be here put in mind of that Scripture
which says; I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu: But we
take no delight in recriminations.

To conclude, it has been cleared, there is no just cause of their invading
this Kingdom: For in the matter of the Engagement against England, we bless
the Lord we are innocent; and for the testimony given by our Commissoners at
London, and approven by the Parliament, it was necessary duty: Neither can
there be any just pretense for the necessity of this War; all fair and amicable
ways have not been used. We have not refused to do them right. We had no
design to invade England; nor have we given any other just ground of offense.
Wherefore this War made without any just cause, necessity, or antecedent
warning, is most unjust on their part, and most just on ours, being for our own
lawful and necessary defense

Having answered their Declarations, we desire now to let the Kingdom know who
are these that come thus in a hostile manner against us, are not these the men
who in their low Estate by their solemn professions, of intending nothing but
the Reformation, and defense of Religion, and the prosecution of uniformity
therein between the Churches, and unity between the Kingdoms, the honor and
happiness of the King, and his posterity, and the Peace and safety of these
dominions engaged us in a solemn League and Covenant with God, and with them,
and by Treaties to join in a War for these ends in the year 1643. and now in
place thereof have by their crafty counsels, undermining designs, and force
of Arms obstructed and opposed the work of Reform^aion, established a
multiformity of Religions, destroyed the King and his family so far as is in
their power, overturned all Government Civil and Ecclesiastical in England
and Ireland, and cannot rest there, but have now resolved to prosecute a war
against this Kingdom also, unless as we did swear a Covenant with them, we
will renounce and forswear it, and the ends thereof? are not these the men who
are abusers of the Ordinances of God in our neighbor land, tolerators of
errors, proclaimers of liberty, dispensers with Bands and Oaths in Gods
matters, but rigid exactors and oppressors of persons, yea of Nations, in their
Consciences, Liberties, and Estates, in their own matters, and for their own
ends, who have brought great scandal and reproach upon the name of God, the
the name of his people, and the study of piety, and who have not only broken
the solemn and sacred Covenant betwixt God and these Nations, but have in
effect rejected it, and trampled upon it, are become enemies to all the ends
thereof, and persecutors of the servants and people of God for their adherence
to it; do they not follow the ways of the Prelaticall and malignant party,
who in the beginning of these troubles came to invade this Kingdom, but
blessed be the Lord returned with shame, are they not walking in the same
paths, that the late Engagers did against England, sinning with an high hand
against God, his Cause, Covenant, and People, the sinfulness of their ways,
means, Instruments, ends, and aims, and the evident injustice of their
quarrel against these who never gave them just ground of offense, make it
apparent. We assisted and relieved England twice since the beginning of these
troubles, and returned both times peaceably out of the Kingdom; Not only their
own expressions, but their consciences can bear witness to our sufferings and
opposition in reference to the late engagement, and will they requite us with
War for our kind assistance? hostility for friendship, and render evil for
good? Surely he sees all these things, whose eyes run to and fro throughout
the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him, and can speak peace unto their helpers, and bring in the
day of his vengeance, and the year of recompense, for the quarrel of his
broken Covenant, upon these who have set up Thresholds by his Thresholds, and
Posts by his Posts, and not only do so themselves, but endeavor to compel
and force others to do the same, do they thus provoke the Lord to jealousy,
are they stronger nor he? has he not sworn by his great name, that his people
shall knov whether his designs, or his enemies, his counsel or theirs, his
word or theirs, his work or theirs shall stand? In the pride of their heart,
because of former successes, and trusting to their Power, skill, and
experience, they think to do with Jerusalem as with Samaria, with Israel, as
with Edom, and with the Covenanted people of God, as with Malignants, against
whom they were raised as a scourge and a rod of indignation, not considering
that when the Lords work is done, and the axe boasts it self against the
hewer, then the Lord uses to send among their fat ones leanness, under their
glory, to kindle a burning, and the light of Israel uses to be for a fire, and
his holy one for a flame to destroy the briars and thorns, in one day says the
Lord. If we shall keep malignancy out of our quarrel, and malignant
Instruments out of our Counsels, and forces, and our selves free from every
thing which may provoke the Lord, and do every duty that may engage them for
us; the case of the Ammonites against Jepthah and Israel, the case of Jeroboam,
against Abijah, the case of Amaziah against Joash, the case of Zennacherib
against Hez^kiah, the case of Moab against Jehosaphat, and the judgments which
came on these Invaders; speak terror to our Adversaries that come against us,
and courage and comfort to the necessary defenders, for the Lord lives and
reigns for ever, to confirm the word of his servants, and perform the counsel
of his Messengers, and turns the wisdom of the wise, and strength of the
strong backward, makes the Diviners mad, and the despisers to wonder and
perish, for he will work a work which they shall in no wise believe, though a a
man declare it unto them.

Let us therefore arise and be doing for the Cause, and for the Cities of our
God, and the Lord will be with us, and will not forsake us, if we forsake not
him, And who then can be against us? He will be Jehovah Nissi, and spread a
banner of love over His people, and send the angel of His presence among them
for a sun and a shield, and will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone, a cup of
trembling and a torch in a sheif to all that dare meddle with Sion, and break
the staffes of beauty and bands, and he will soon go through the briars and
thorns let in battle against him, for the Cause, and the battle is the Lords:
Let us wait on His salvation. There is cause of humiliat^on, when we consider
our formality in the Worship of God, our neglect of duties, of true piety, our
undervaluing of the precious Gospel, our unthankfulnes for mercies, our
stupidity under judgments, our manifold backslidings of heart, and
se^f-seeking our not minding as we ought the inward work of Reformation, and
resting too much on the out side of duties, the profanes of many in the Land
and in our A^my, and many other transgreshons. ^or these things we should lie
low in the dust, and acknowledge that it were just with the Lord to leave us,
to let our enemies prevail over us, and let in a floodgate of error, heresy,
schism and profanesse to overflow the Lan^; But there is no cause of fear or
fainting, if we will consider that the Lord delights to be called on, as a God
who will keep Covenant and mercy to, and with his people, notwithstanding their
failings, if we look either to the Lords former dispensations, or present
engagements for his Work, and the honor of his great Name, or if we will look
to the e^emies quarrel, their aims and designs, or to the resolutions of
this K^rk and Kingdom, to stand for the Cause and Covenant against enemies and
dangers on all hands. If the Lord had intended to destroy the Land, he would
not have done so much for us and amongst us, nor received a sacrifice off our
hands; Though the enemy should come in like a flood to overflow Immanuels Land,
His Spirit shall lift up a standard against him, and not suffer His people to
say a confederacy to such, but shall magnify himself in the borders of Israel.
Wherefore we desire all the people of the Land to beware that they be not
deceived and ensnared with the fair offers and smooth pretenses of the
Sectaries, whole words are soft as butter and oil, but gall and bitrernesse is
in their hearts and actions; they have the smooth voice of Jacob, but the rough
hands of Esau. And we do in the name and by the warrant of the Estates of
Parliament discharge all persons whatsoever within the Kingdom to give them
aid, counselor assistance, or to correspond or comply with them any manner of
way, under the same pains and certifications that they are discarged to join,
assist, correspond or comply with Malignants and Rebels in Arms.
