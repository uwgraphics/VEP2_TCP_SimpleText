THE PRINCIPLES OF Holy Christian Religion: OR, The Catechism of the Church of
England paraphrazed.

For the use of Borwick-Hall.

Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering,

Heb. 10.23. LONDON, Printed by E. Cotes, and are to be sold by R. Royston at
the Angel in Ivie-lane, 1656.

The Preface, Touching the necessity of Catechizing: the authority, usefulness,
and general Heads of our Church Catechism.
AS all tender conscienc't men do sadly lament the manifold Sects and
divisions, and various opinions in Religion amongst us: so all wise and prudent
persons do withal consider and observe the causes thereof: that such disorders
and confusions may be remedied and prevented.

And the greatest cause of so much Jam. 1.6.
giddiness in the minds of men, why so many waver like a wave of the sea, Jam.
1.6.
driven to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, and tossed, is for want of a
good bottom, or sure foundation to stand upon; which consists in being well
Catechized, or thoroughly instructed in the principles of the holy and true
Religion.

There is no want of Preaching or Hearing Sermons, nor can this be the source
and original of so much inconstancy in Religion, (it may be the cause of
ignorance, but not of error) since we see by experience, that the most fickle
and giddy people, are commonly the most eager hearers of many Sermons, and
several Preachers: and what is the reason? but that such Sermons as men
ordinarily hear, being not first well Catechized, render their minds like a
ship without ballast, which cannot keep a steady course, but tosses, rolls, and
tumbles, and is by every gust of wind overthrown.

For Preaching without Catechizing first, is as if a man should go about to
build a house without a foundation, which can prove no other, but some Castle
in the air; or as if we should think to be perfect men, and never pass through
the state of infancy and youth: or as if sucking Infants in stead of milk
should feed upon strong flesh, and this too often raw, 1 Cor. 3.2. Heb. 5.12,
13.
and indigested also.

Hence it comes to pass, that there are so many 1. Upon whom that Prophecy of
Isaiah is fulfilled, Mat. 13.14.
By hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and by seeing ye shall see and
not perceive: and that of S. Paul also, Ever learning, 2 Timothy ^.7.
and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.

Hence 2. Prove. 26.12.
so many become wise in their own conceits, Prove. 26.12.
who really are but fools in the knowledge of saving truth, Romans 1.21, 22.
who wax vain in their imaginations, and their foolish hearts are darkened,
through the glimmerings of conceited knowledge: who will take upon them to talk
of this, and that point in Religion, argue against such, and such doctrines and
practices of the Church, and yet understand nothing of what they say, or
whereof they affirm.

Hence 3. it is, That the holy Word of God, which is in it self rightly
understood the pure fountain of truth, is made by many uncatechized,
unprincipled men now a days, the very sink of errors, being misinterpreted and
misapplyed to the maintenance of false opinions, and even doctrines of Devils.

Whereas undoubtedly, were there a sure foundation laid in the true, and
thorough understanding of the principles of Christianity, there could not be
possibly either so much ignorance and blindness besotting the minds of men, so
much giddiness and wavering in Religion, or so much abuse and wresting of holy
Scriptures to the ruin of souls: for holding fast the foundation, the mind of
man, like a house built upon a rock, Mat. 7.24.
stands firm against the shock of every temptation, and is not tossed to and
fro with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men, Ephesians. 4.14.
and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.

For the practice therefore of this duty of Catechizing, we have many both
commands and examples in holy Scriptures: see amongst many others, Genesis 18.19.
Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7. Psalm. 34.11. and Psalm. 78. from the 1. to the 8. verse. Prove.
22.6. 2 Timothy 3.14, 15.

necessity and usefulness of being well Catechized, being thus apparent, and by
all wise and knowing men considered, has occasioned the penning and printing
of several Catechisms: many of which, though they may be good in themselves,
and useful in their kind, yet none of them are to be ranked with, or to be
esteemed of equal authority and usefulness with our Church Catechism: because,

1. It Is not of private but public authority, and consequently to be preferred
before all others, as much as the Laws and Statutes of a national Council,
before the conceptions and dictates of private persons.

2. Ephesians. 4.13.
For the maintenance of unity in the Faith, it is necessary that there should be
one common form of sound words, 2 Timothy 1.13.
which all should hold fast, and stick close unto; that as we are all members
of one Church, (or should be so at leastwise) so we should all stand upon one
ground, be built upon one foundation, and steer our course toward the land of
Promise in one and the same bottom.

3. There is no other Catechism can be more exact and complete, more beneficial
and useful, then this of our Church, which will appear by considering the
order, and general heads thereof.

Catechisms; it is confessed, That the holy Word of God, or the inspired
writings of the Prophets, and Apostles, are the ground and foundation all holy
and true Religion is built upon: Ephesians. 2.20. We are built upon the foundation
of the Prophets and Apostles, etc.

But because the holy Scriptures are both spacious and difficult, containing
many things, some more, some less necessary to salvation, and these both
intermixedly and diversely delivered, here and there respersed in several books
and chapters, and expressed both by way of command and counsel, of exhortation
and admonition, of promise and threatening, of history and example, under many
Metaphors, Types, and Allegories, which render them both hard to be understood
aright, and as hard to be rightly distinguished, and reduced to their several
heads, for the more clear understanding, and firm memory thereof; therefore it
seemed good to the wisdom of the ancient Fathers of the Church, to reduce the
pith, sum, and marrow of all saving Doctrine contained in the Scriptures under
so many several ways of expression, to four several heads, viz. 1. The
Apostles Creed. 2. The 10. Commandments. 3. The Lords Prayer. 4. The Doctrine
of the Sacraments. To one of which 4. general heads, all that the whole book of
God contains, absolutely necessary to salvation, is reducible: For,

1. All that we are bound to believe, in general and in the gross, is sum'd up
in twelve Articles by the Apostles, or Apostolical men, and is commonly known
by the name of The Apostles Creed, and that is the object of our faith, and a
little breviary or sum of the Gospel.

2. All that we are bound to practice and obey, is commanded in the 10.
Commandments, and that is the Rule of our Life, and the Epitome of the Law.

And these are the two parts of holy Religion, Faith and Obedience; Faith,
which the Gospel requires; and Obedience, which the Law exacts: which Obedience
is also called Charity, or Love; For Love is the fulfilling of the Law: Romans
12.10.
therefore S. Paul reduces all Religion to Faith and Love, Gal. 5.6. 2 Timothy
1.13.

But because we can neither believe nor do any thing as we ought, Phil. 2.13.
without the Divine Grace assisting us thereunto; therefore God has ordained
and commanded unto us, the use of Prayer, and of the Sacraments, as the means
and conveyances of his Graces into our souls, to enable us both to believe in
him, and also to love and obey him in a manner holy and acceptable unto him.

3. Therefore the next general head of Catechism, is the Lords Prayer, as the
sum, pattern, and perfection of all Prayer and Devotion.

4. And the fourth and last head, is the Doctrine and use of the Sacraments:
the ground and reason whereof is briefly this: All those things which concern
the good of our souls, are according to the nature of the soul, spiritual,
divine, and invisible, and so are not easily conceived by our frail
understandings, which apprehend not, but by organs of sense; therefore God has
been pleased mercifully to ordain certain outward visible elements, to signify
and seal his inward invisible graces unto our souls, and to be pledges to
assure us thereof: and these are Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

And upon these four general heads, all the several questions in the
Catechism besides, do depend; either 1. By way of introduction, to put us in
mind of our obligation hereunto by solemn vow and promise, when we were
Baptized: Or 2. for the connecting and joining of these generals together by a
fit method for memories sake: Or 3. for the more clear and full understanding
of each of them; as will further appear in the several Questions and Answers
ensuing.

Open mine eyes O Lord, and enlighten my mind, that I may both see and rightly
understand the wondrous things of thy Law, and carefully frame my heart, and
all the actions of my life thereafter through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

THE PRINCIPLES OF Holy Christian Religion: OR The Catechism of the Church of
England paraphrased.
The Introduction.
1. Question.

BEcause your Name is the badge and cognizance of that holy Christian Religion
you profess, therefore it is first demanded of you

What is your name?

Answer.

R. T. W.

2. Question.

And since together with your Name you received Christianity, it is therefore
secondly asked.

Who gave you this name?

Answer.

Such as scruple at the name, and use of Godfathers, may remember, 1. That it
is the universal practice of the Church, against which no modest man will
presume to argue: since Church Customs are of sufficient authority with S.
Paul 1 Cor. 11.6. That 2. it is not without example in holy Scripture, Isa.
8.2, 3. Luke 1. from verse. 57. to 64. 3. That Infants cannot come themselves to
Baptism, nor therein answer for themselves. 4. That their parents may die
before they come to years, or else may be seduced into Heresy, or Schism. 5.
That hereby a spiritual kindred amongst Christian neighbors is contracted, and
Charity, which is the life of Christianity, is maintained and increased: And
for the name of Godfathers, it is more proper then that of Witnesses or
Sureties, if we consider either 1. Their office, which is both to offer up unto
God the party baptized, and devote him to his service, and also to profess
Repentance, Faith, and Obedience unto God in their names. Or, 2. The benefit
they receive by Baptism, which is to be made the children of God, in which
respect chiefly their sureties are called Godfathers.
My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism, wherein I was made a Christian,
and therefore it is called my Christian name.

3. Question.

What happiness or benefit is it unto you to be baptized and become Christian?

Answer.

I am thereby made 1. A member of Christ, 2. A child of God, 3. An heir of the
Kingdom of heaven: or more fully thus:

Whereas I was born in sin, Psalm. 51.5. Ephesians. 2.3. Romans 5.12. Joh. 3.5. 1 Cor.
12.3. Romans 8.7. Gal. 4.7. Act. 22.16.
and am by nature the child of wrath, and heir of Death, and Hell; by being
born again of water, and of the Holy Ghost in Baptism: I am not only 1.
ingraffed into Christ's Mystical body, the Church; but am also 2. reconciled
unto God through Christ, and made his child by Adoption, and Grace; and not
only a child, but also 3. an Heir, even an Heir of God, and joynt-heir with
Christ of the Kingdom of heaven.

4. Quest.

Are these great Blessings conferred upon you through Baptism, absolutely, or
upon condition only?

Answ.

Upon condition, Mark 16.16. Act. 8.37. and 2.38.
that I do observe and keep that promise and vow which was made in my name,
being baptized.

5. Quest.

What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then promise and vow for you?

Answ.

They did promise and how three things in my name: 1 That I should forsake the
Devil and all his works, Luke 1.74, 75.
the pomps, and banities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the
flesh. 2 That I should believe all the Articles of the Christian faith. 3 That
I should keep Gods holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the
days of my life.

6. Quest.

Do not thou think that thou art bound both to believe, and do what they
have promised for thee?

Answ.

Yes verily I do believe it to be my bounden duty: and by Gods help I will
perform the same: And I heartily thank our heavenly Father, Act. 3.19.
who through Baptism has called me to this state of salvation through Jesus
Christ our Savior. And I pray God to give me his grace, that I may continue in
the same to my lives end: carefully observing this vow of my Baptism, which is
the general duty of every Christian.

7. Quest.

What is the meaning of the first part of your Christian duty, or vow in
Baptism?

Answ.

By promising to forsake the Devil and all etc. I do oblige my self to resist,
Ephesians. 6.10, etc. 1 Timothy 1.18, 19. and 6.12. Joh. 8.34.
and manfully to fight under the banner of Christ against all temptations,
whether arising from the Devil, the world, or the flesh, and not suffer my self
to be vanquished by them, and be led captive to the service of sin.

And this is that which is also called Repentance from dead works, Heb. 6.1.
Act. 26.18. Ephesians. 4.22, etc. 1 Pet. 2.1, etc. Heb. 12.1, 2.
where it is remembered as the first of the principles of the Doctrines of
Christ, because I must forsake the service of sin, and all temptations leading
thereunto, before I can truly serve God, or receive any benefit by the means of
Grace.

O God which art the author of peace, and lover of concord, in knowledge of
whom stands our eternal life, whose service is perfect freedom; defend me
thy humble servant in all assaults of my ghostly enemies, the world, the flesh
and the Devil: that I surely trusting in thy defense, may not fear the power of
any such adversaries, through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord.

CHAP. I. Of the Creed.
Quest.

WHat is the second part of that promise you made when you were baptized?

Answ.

To believe all the Articles of the Christian faith: that is, Act. 1.1.
all those chief heads of Doctrine which Christ commanded and taught, as also
what himself did for our example, and suffered for our salvation.

Quest.

What is the sum of them?

Answ.

The Apostles Creed.

Quest.

What mean you by a Creed?

Answ.

A Creed is as much as Belief: And it is a brief Summary of all the chief heads
of Religion which we are bound to believe as necessary to everlasting salvation.

Quest.

Why do you call it the Apostles Creed?

Answ.

Because 1. it contains the sum of that Doctrine which the Apostles preached.
2. It was compiled either by the Apostles themselves, or Apostolical men: and
it consists also of 12. Articles according the number of the 12. Apostles.

Quest.

Rehearse the Articles of your Belief distinctly.

Answ.

1. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth:

2. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,

3. Which was conceived by the holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary,

4. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried,

5. He descended into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead,

6. He ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God the Father
Almighty:

7. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

8. I believe in the holy Ghost,

9. The holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints,

10. The forgiveness of sins,

11. The Resurrection of the body,

12. And the life everlasting, Amen.

Quest.

What do you chiefly learn to believe in these Articles?

Answ.

Hence I learn to believe in that only true God, who being one in essence,
Deuteronomy, 6.4. Mar. 12.29. 1 John 5.7.
is three in subsistence:

1. God the Father, Mal. 2.10. 1 Cor. 8.6.
who has made me and all the world:

2. God the Son, 1 Timothy 2.5. Rev. 5.9.
who has redeemed me and all mankind:

3. God the Holy Ghost, Ephesians. 4.30. Romans 15.16.
who has sanctified me and all the elect people of God: which divides this
Creed into three general parts, according to the number of these three Persons
of the Godhead.

Quest.

What does the first general part of of your Creed concern?

Answ.

God the Father, Artic. 1. Genesis 1.1. Col. 1.16. Heb. 11.3. Psalm. 36.5, 6. Mat.
6.26 and 10.29, 30.
who by his Almightiness of nothing has made all things, both the Heavens and
the Earth, and all that is contained therein: and by the same his power does
still sustain and govern all things: which is the sum, and meaning of the first
Article.

Quest.

What use are you to make of this?

Answ.

That I am therefore bound to serve, Mal. 1.6. Dan. 5.23. Rev. 4 11. and 5.12,
13. Deuteronomy. 32.18. Act. 17.24, 25, 26, 27, 28. Deuteronomy. 10.12, 13, 14
and worship him, and obey his Laws, as being the great Lord and Father of
all, from whom I have received all that I am, and all that I have in the world.

Quest.

What does the second general part of your Creed concern?

Answ.

God the Son, Gal. 3.13. Luke 1.68, 69, 74.
and the Redemption of mankind by him from sin and death.

Quest.

By what means and titles is he known?

Answ.

He is first called Jesus which signifies Salvation: 2. Christ, Artic. 2. Mat.
1.21. Act 10.38. Rev. 1.5. Heb. 6.20. and 12.24. Act. 3.22, 23. Luke 1.32. Joh.
8.56, 57, 58. 1 Cor. 6.20. Act. 2.3. Mat. 28.18. 1 Cor. 8.6.
which signifies Anointed, and denotes his threefold office of King, Priest,
and Prophet: 3. The only Son of God, viz. by eternal generation: 4. Our Lord,
in that he has bought and redeemed us, and has the sole power over us.

Quest.

What do you believe that he did and suffered to redeem you?

Answ.

I do believe that he came down from heaven, Artic. 3. Joh. 16.28. Luke 1.35,
31. Gal. 4.4. Luke 2.7. Joh. 8.46. Tit. 2.11, 12.
and was by the power of the Holy Ghost after a wonderful manner conceived and
made man, in the sanctified Womb of the blessed Virgin Mary; That he was born
of her; that he lived a most holy life, and by his doctrine and example guided
and directed us in the way to heaven.

That he suffered for our sins many grievous and bitter things under Pontius
Pilate, the Governor of Judea; Artic. 4. 1 Pet. 2.21. and 3.18. and 4.1. Mat.
27.26.
that he was by his command crucified, or the several parts of his body were
stretched out upon the cross as upon a rack, and nailed thereunto, to his
unspeakable torment, until through the violence of his pangs he gave up the
ghost, Mat. 27.50, 60 Phil. 2.8. 1 Cor. 15.3, 4.
and being dead, was also buried, to manifest the reality, and truth of his
death.

That he descended into hell, Artic. 5. Ephesians. 4.10. Col. 2.15. Heb. 2.14. Rev.
1.18. and 20.14. Psalm. 16.16. Act. 10.40. and 5.30. Romans 14.9. Col. 1.18.
vanquishing both the first and second death, and him who had the power of
death, that is the Devil, and all the spirits, and powers of darkness. That he
rose again the third day, thereby declaring his victory over death, and over
all our ghostly enemies.

That having accomplished the great work of our Redemption, Artic. 6. Luke
24.51. Act. 1.9. Ephesians. 4.8. etc. Heb. 6.20. Mark 16.19. Col 3.1. Phil. 2.9, etc.
Romans 8.34. and 7 27.
he again ascended into heaven, from whence he came down: That he sits at
the right hand of God: reigns as King over all, and intercedes for all them
that call upon God in his name

And that he shall come again at the last day to judge the quick and the dead,
Artic. 7. Mat. 25.31, etc. 1 Thessalonians. 4.16, 17. 2 Timothy 4.1. Rev. 1.7. Psalm.
62.12. Mat. 16.27. Romans 2.6. Rev. 22 22.
and render to all men according to their works.

Quest.

What use are you to make of this second part of your Creed?

Answ.

That I therefore put my trust only in the mercies of God through the merits of
Christ, Ps. 2.12. and 34.8. and 44.6. Romans 8.32. Act. 2.38. and 3.19.27.30.
Mat. 9.13. Tit. 2.14. 1 Cor. 15.3. Mat. 11.29. Joh. 15.10. 1 Pet. 2.21. Col.
3.1. Luk 21.34, etc. Tit. 2.11, 12, 13. Mat. 24.42 etc.
for whatever concerns the good either of body or soul. That I repent me truly
of all my sins, which were the cause of my Saviors sufferings. That I obey his
Doctrine, and follow his example, as the way to heaven. That I seek those
things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God: and by
perseverance in all good works, wait for the coming of my Lord to Judgment.

Quest.

What does the third general part of your Creed concern?

Answ.

God the Holy Ghost, Artic. 8. Romans 15.16. 2 Thessalonians. 2.13. 1 Cor. 12.4, 7, etc.
Gal. 5.22. etc
and his sanctification of me, and of all Gods people, by his Gifts and Graces,
to the sacred service of God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ.

Quest.

In whom is this work of sanctification wrought?

Answ.

In all the faithful and elect people of God, Artic. 9. 1 Timothy 3.15. Heb. 2.12.
Ephesians. 5.27. Psalm. 2.8. Mat. 28. ult.
called the Holy Catholic Church: Holy, because sanctified by the Holy Ghost;
and Catholic, that is, universal, diffused and spread over the face of the
whole earth.

Quest.

How is this Sanctification wrought by the Holy Ghost upon the Church, or
people of Christ?

Answ.

It is begun in this life by the communion of Saints, and remission of sins:
and it shall be perfected hereafter at the Resurrection of the Body, in life
everlasting.

Quest.

What do you mean by the communion of Saints? Joh. 17.21. Ephesians. 4.13. and
6.18. Phil. 1.27. and 2.4. Romans 16.16, 17 1 John 1.3. 1 Pet. 1.22.


Answ.

I do profess to believe, that all true members of Christ's holy Catholic
Church, by the secret impressions of the Holy Ghost, have both union and
communion with Christ, who is our head, by faith, and also one with another the
members of Christ, by charity.

Quest.

What do you mean by Remission of sins?

Answ.

I do believe that there is both for me and for all other good Christians,
Artic. 10. Act. 2.38. and 13.38. Joh. 20.23. Mark 16.16. Joh. 3.16. 2 Cor.
5.21. 1 John 1.7, etc.
pardon and forgiveness of all our sins to be obtained by the mercies of God,
through the merits of Christ our Savior: we sincerely performing the
conditions of a lively faith, and true Repentance thereunto required.

Quest.

What do you mean by the Resurrection of the body?

Answ.

I do believe that this body of mine, Artic. 11. 1 Cor. 15.29, etc. Joh. 5.29.
and 6.39. and 11.24, 25. Mat. 25.16, etc
and the bodies of all men, though they be dissolved by death into dust and
ashes, yet shall be again raised out of the dust of death, and rejoyned to our
immortal souls, that so we may receive according to our deeds done in the body,
whether they be good, of whether they be evil.

Quest.

What do you mean by life everlasting?

Answ.

I do believe that when we shall be raised up at the last day, Artic. 12.
we shall never die any more, 1 Thessalonians. 4.17. Rev. 21.4. Joh. 5.29.
but live for ever, either in endless joys, if we have done well, or in
endless torments, if our deeds have been evil.

Quest.

What use are you to make of this part of your Creed?

Answ.

That I do not grieve Gods holy Spirit by my sins, Ephesians. 4.3. 1 Thessalonians. 5.19.
Heb. 10.24, 25 Gal. 5.6. 1 Cor. 13.13. 1 John 3.23. and 1.7. and 2.1, 2. Col.
3.3, 4, etc.
nor hinder his work of Sanctification upon my soul, by resisting his good
motions, and incitements to holiness of life. That I continue a faithful, and
true Member of Christ's Mystical Body, the Church, both by a true and lively
faith in Christ, and an universal unfeigned charity toward all Christians.
That I trust not in my own righteousness, but rely on the merits of Christ
only for the pardon of my sins, truly repenting of all my misdoings, and for
ever abjuring and forsaking the same: Denying ungodliness, Tit. 2.11, etc.
and worldly lusts, and living soberly, righteously and godly in this present
world, Phil. 3.20.
as looking for the Resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.

Quest.

Why do you conclude with Amen?

Answ.

I do hereby acknowledge, and ratify with my steadfast belief the undoubted
Truth, and certainty of this Creed in general, and of every Article thereof in
particular, secretly wishing, and humbly praying, that through the
steadfastness of this faith I may evermore be defended from all adversity, and
be preserved in the way of eternal salvation, even from God the Father, through
God the Son, and by God the Holy Ghost; to whom be glory for ever, Amen.

I Believe, Lord help my unbelief: and evermore preserve thy servant in the
unity of the true faith: Grant me with the heart to believe unto righteousness
of life, that I may in the end obtain the end of my faith, which is the
salvation of my soul, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

CHAP. II. Of the Commandments.
Quest.

WHat is the third part of your vow in Baptism?

Answ.

To keep Gods holy will and Commandments, Luke 1.75. Levit. 18.5. Ezekiel. 20.11.
and to walk in the same all the days of my life: and it is but just, and
reasonable that I should do what God has commanded me in this life; Mat.
19.17. Luke 10.25, 26. Rev. 22.24.
if I will obtain what he has promised me in the life to come: If thou will
enter into life, keep the Commandments.

Quest.

What are these Commandments God has enjoined, and you have promised to
observe and keep?

Answ.

The same which God spoke in the 20. chapter of Exodus, saying, I am the Lord
thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage: which is the Preface, showing Gods right to command, Lev. 18.5. Ps.
105. -- 95. Isa. 42.8. Deuteronomy. 27.9, 10. and 30.20. Joh. 14.15. 1 John 2.4, 5.
and our obligation to obey.

Quest.

Are the Commandments of God under the Gospel, the same they were under the
Law?

Answ.

They are the same for substance, Mat. 5.17, 18, 19 Mal. 3.6. Jam. 1.17. Luke
16.17. Jam. 2.8.
for God is the same God for ever, and changes not: they differ only in
ceremonies, and the manner of dispensation.

Quest.

In what particular respects do they differ?

Answ.

Under the Law the commands of God were more clogged with ceremonies, Col. 2.16,
17. Exodus 34.33. 2 Cor. 3.13, 14, 15, 16.
more dark and obscure, and not so fully understood, as to the spiritual sense
and meaning of them. But as Christ under the Gospel has delivered them,

1. Mat. 11.19. and 23.4. Act. 15.10. Gal. 4.3, 4, 5. Heb. 9.10.
They are freed from the burden of manifold ceremonial rites, which were
figurative and typical.

2. They are more clear, perspicuous and intelligible, Mat. 5.21, 22, 27, 28.
Ioh. 6.63.
and this not so, much in the letter, as in the spirit and life of the Law,
Romans 7.6. Heb. 4.12.
as it reaches to the very heart, and the thoughts and desires thereof.

3. 2 Cor. 1.20. and 6.18. and 7.1. Heb. 11.40. and 8 6. 1 Timothy 4.8. Heb. 4.8,
9.
The promises under the Gospel to those that shall be obedient to Gods
commands, are greater and more full, or at least more clear then under the Law.

4. Ier. 31.31. and Heb. 8. Joel 2.28. and Act. 2. Ioh. 1.16, 17. Iam. 4.6.
More grace is communicated to us Christians under the Gospel for the
observation of Gods commands, then was given to the Jews under the Law.

Quest.

How many Commandments are there?

Answ.

The words God himself delivered on Mount Sinai consist of ten Commandments:
Deuteronomy. 5.22. Mat. 22.40. Romans 13.9, 10.
and the text says he added no more: Because all that is through the whole
Word of God enjoined besides, may in some respects or other be reduced to one
of these ten words of command.

Quest.

What general rules are to be observed to understand the full meaning of each
Commandment?

Answ.

Two most especially. 1. That where any duty is commanded, the contrary
thereunto is forbidden: and where any sin is forbidden, the contrary duty is
commanded. 2. That in all duties commanded, and sins forbidden, the means
conducing thereunto are commanded, and forbidden also.

Quest.

What is the first of these ten Commandments?

Answ.

Thou shall have none other Gods before me.

Quest.

What is herein commanded, and what forbidden you?

Answ.

1. Prove. 3.6. 1 Chr. 28.9. Deuteronomy. 6.13, 14. and 10.12, 20. Mat. 4.10. Deuteronomy.
6.4, 5. Joh. 14, 15. Romans 10.14. Psalm. 32.6. and 50.15, ult.
I am herein commanded to acknowledge the God of Israel for the only true God,
and accordingly to serve and worship him as God, viz. To believe in him, to put
my whole trust in him, to fear him, and to love him above all: and to express
my inward faith, hope, and love toward him by the reverent performance of all
external acts of divine worship commanded by him, and most especially by my
daily prayers unto him, and praises of him.

2. Exodus 24.14 Deuteronomy. 6.14. Isa. 42.8. and 48.11. Mat. 6.24. Romans 1.25. Rev.
22.9.
I am forbidden to acknowledge any other god besides him, or to pay any such
divine worship to any other, neither yet to prefer the love and service of any
creature before the love and service of my Creator, who is God blessed for ever.

Quest.

What is the second Commandment?

Answ.

Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water
under the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them: For I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the fathers upon the
children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and show
merry unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my Commandments.

Quest.

What is herein commanded, and what forbidden you?

Answ.

1. Exodus 34.11. Deuteronomy. 4.2. and 12.32. Mat. 28 20. Ioh. 4.24. Psalm. 95.6. and
132.7. Romans 12.1. 1 Cor. 6.20.
I am herein commanded to worship this only true God after an holy and true
manner, that is, after such a manner as himself has prescribed in his holy
Word: And that I do it not only internally in spirit, and in truth, but also
externally, with all lowly, humble and reverent prostration of body before him.

2. Lev. 19.4. and 26.1. 1 Cor. 10.14. Ezekiel. 14.4, 6. 2 Cor. 10.5. Rom 2.22.
I am forbidden to worship the true God after a false manner; not to worship
him by an Idol, nor by an Image, neither yet according to the fond
imaginations of my own heart: And that as I must avoid Idolatry, and all false
worship on the one hand, so I must also take heed of sacrilege, which is to
rob God of the maintenance of his true worship on the other side.

And the reason of this Law is given; Deuteronomy. 4.24. and 5.9. and 6.15. 2 Cor.
11.2. Deuteronomy. 23.2. Rev. 2.6.
because God is so jealous of his worship and glory, lest we should give it to
any other, or to our selves, that he will severely punish all such as deprave
his worship, Exodus 34.7. Deuteronomy. 5.10. Dan. 9.4. Ioh. 15.14, 15.
even to the third and fourth generation, accounting of them as his enemies;
but he will mercifully reward them that obey, and serve him according to his
will, as being his friends and promoters of his interest.

Quest.

What is the third Commandment?

Answ.

Thou shall not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will
not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

Quest.

What is herein commanded, and forbidden you?

Answ.

1. 1 Cor. 10.31. Psalm. 93.5. Ezekiel. 22.8. Psalm. 105.15. Luke 10.16. Ezekiel. 44.23.
I am herein commanded to propose to my self the honor of Gods holy Name in
all my actions both divine and moral: And to have a separate, and distinct
respect for all such such things and persons, as have the name of God called
upon them, and more immediately relate to his service.

2. Lev. 18.21. and 19.12. and 21.6. and 22.2, 15, 32. Mat. 23.16, 20, 22. Hos.
10.4. Lev. 24.14. Jam. 3.9. Prove. 30.9. 2 Timothy 2.19. 2 Samuel 12.14. Romans 2.24.
Psalm. 5.7. Heb. 12 28. Prove. 13.13. Isa. 62.2. 1 Cor. 11.22, etc.
I am herein forbidden all rash, unadvised, wilful profanations of Gods ever
blessed Name, by oaths, perjuries, execrations, cursings of the creatures, of
my neighbors, or of my self; not to use the name of God slightly, idly,
foolishly, and vainly, much less to cover any deceits, falsehoods, or what is in
any respect unlawful, or sinful: not unadvisedly or irreverently to
entermeddle, with Gods holy Word, Sacraments or any parts of his holy worship:
neither yet to slight, undervalue, or despise either things, or persons,
wherein, and whereby God is honored, and whereupon his holy Name is called.

And the reason is given, Zach. 5.3, 4. Deu. 28.58, 59 Heb. 12.28, 29.
because God will never excuse such irreligious profanations of his Majesty,
but will assuredly punish all offenders in this kind.

7. Quest.

What is the fourth Commandment?

Answ.

Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: fix days shall thou labor and
do all that thou have to do; but the sebenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God. In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, thy man-serbant, and thy maid-serbant, thy cattle and the stranger
that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made beaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and rested the sebenth day; wherefore the Lord
blessed the sebenth day, and hallowed it.

Quest.

What is herein commanded, and what forbidden?

Answ.

1. Col. 2.16, 17. 1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 4.10. Exodus 31.15. and 35.2. Luke 23.56.
Heb. 10.25.
I am commanded in general to dedicate every day of my life a spiritual Sabbath
unto God, that is, a rest from sin and vacancy to his service: And in
particular that I devote every seventh day, or one day in seven to the public
and solemn worship of God, with the rest of his Church and people.

2. I am forbidden on this day, Exodus 31.14. and 34.21. Jer. 17 21, etc. Deuteronomy.
5 14. Mat. 12.10, 11, 12, 13.
either my self to do, or suffer any I have command over to do any servile
work, but what is of necessity, or charity, that so I may the better attend the
service of God both public and private.

And the reason is given, Genesis 2.2, 3. Exodus 31.17. Heb. 4.4.
because the Lord after six days labor in the work of the Creation, rested on
the seventh: called therefore the Sabbath, which signifies rest: the
commemoration whereof we Christians observe on the first day of the week, which
is Sunday, Mat. 28.1. Ioh. 20.19. Rev. 1.10.
because our blessed Lord arose on that day from death to life, and perfected
thereby the great work of our Redemption.

Quest.

What is the fifth Commandment?

Answ.

Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which
the Lord thy God gives thee.

all disobedience to the commands, and contempt of the persons of my Parents,
and of all higher powers: all murmurings and repinings against such as are in
authority over me, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical.

And this is the first Commandment with promise: Ephesians. 6 2. 1 Timothy 2.2.
For that all peace and security depends upon this; that every one do his duty
in all his relations unto others.

my pleasure, to cover his wife, maid; neither yet in relation either to profit
or pleasure, to covet any thing that is his.

Quest.

What do thou chiefly learn by these Commandments?

Answ.

I learn two things to be chiefly, and summarily enjoined, and commanded me:
namely 1. My duty toward God. 2. My duty toward my neighbor: Mar. 22 37, 38,
39, 40. Exodus 31.18. and 32.15, 16.
which divides these ten Commandments into two Tables, the former consisting
of the four first, and the latter of the six last Commandments.

Quest.

What are the particulars of your duty toward God, in the four first
Commandments enjoined?

Answ.

The sum of all in general, is, Deu 30.16, 20. Mat. 22.37. Luke 10.27
to love the Lord my God with all my heart, and with all my soul, with all my
mind, and with all my strength. More particularly;

To beliebe in him, to fear him, to put my whole trust in him, to call upon him
by servent and frequent prayers, to give him thanks for his mercies, and daily
to praise and magnify his name.

To worship him, and that not only with all inward devotion of soul, but also
with all outward reverence and low prostration of body.

To honor his holy Name and hie Word, and what ever has his holy name, and
mark imprinted thereon.

To serve him truly all the days of my life, and also punctually to observe
those days that are consecrate to his public, and solemn worship.

Quest.

What are the particulars of your duty toward your neighbor, in the six last
Commandments enjoined?

Answ.

The sum of all in general, Romans 13.9. Mat. 7.12.
is, to love my neighbor as my self, and to express this love, by doing unto
all men as I would they should do unto me. More particularly,

To love, honor, and succor my father and mother: to honor and obey the
lawful Power of the land, whether supreme or subordinate: to submit my self to
all my Governors, Teachers, spiritual pastors, and Masters: to order my self
lowly and reverently to all my betters, and affably, courteously, and kindly to
all persons whatsoever.

To hurt no body by word nor deed, to bear no malice nor hatred in my heart.

To keep my body in temperance, soberness, and chastity.

To be true and just in all my dealings, and to keep my hands from picking and
stealing.

To avoid all evil speaking, lying and slandering.

Not to covet or desire other men's goods, but to learn and labor truly to get
mine own living, and to do my duty in that state of life, whereunto it shall
please God to call me.

Lord have mercy upon me, and write all these thy Laws in my heart, I beseech
thee: and give me thy grace enabling me to express my obedience hereunto in all
the actions of my life, through Jesus Christ our Lord: Amen.

CHAP. III. Of the Lords Prayer.
Quest.

Do thou think that thou art able to do all these things of thy self, to
walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve him?

Answ.

I do most humbly confess that without Gods special Grace, Isa. 26.12. Joh.
15.5. Phil. 2.13. and 4.13. Psalm. 105.4. Mat. 7.7, 11. Luke 11.9, 10, 11, 12.
I cannot observe to do the least of Gods commandments, and I must therefore
learn at all times to call upon God by diligent prayer for the assistance of his
divine grace.

Quest.

After what manner are you to pray unto God?

Answ.

After the same manner that Christ in his holy Gospel has taught me, saying,

Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed etc.

Quest.

Of how many parts does this prayer consist?

Answ.

Of three parts: 1. The Preface. 2. The Petitions. 3. The Doxologie, or
conclusion.

Quest.

Rehearse the parts distinctly.

Answ.

1. The Preface in these words: Our Father which art in heaven.

2. The Petitions are six in number: The three first concern the glory and
service of God: viz. 1. Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. 3. Thy will be
dome in earth as it is in heaven. The three last concern our own wants and
engagements, viz. 4. Give us this day our daily bread. 5. Forgive us our
trespasses as we forgve them that trespass against us. 6. Lead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil.

3. The Doxologie or conclusion in these words: For thine is the Kingdom, the
power and the glory, forever and ever: Amen.

Quest.

What do you desire of God in this Prayer?

Answ.

I desire my Lord God our heavenly Father, Preface.
who is the giver of all goodness, and gives willingly because a father, and
plentifully because in heaven; that he would be pleased to send his grace unto
me, and unto all people,

That we may worship him as we ought to do: That his ever blessed name may be
sanctified by me and by all men upon whom his holy Name is called.

That we may serve him as becomes the faithful subjects of his kingdom,
submitting unto and walking after his most holy Laws.

That we may obey, and do his will both readily, sincerely, and constantly here
upon earth, as it is done by the blessed Angels and Saints in heaven.

pray unto him, that as our necessities are renewed every day, so he would be
pleased to send us day by day, all things that be needful both for our souls
and bodies,

That he would be merciful unto us and forgive us our sins through Jesus
Christ, resolving for his sake, and according to his command to forgive all
others in what they do, or shall offen ^^nd trespass agninst me.

That he would save and defend us from all dangers ghostly and bodily:
preserving us from the evil of sin by his Grace and delivering us from the evil
of punishment by his Mercy: and more particularly, that he would deliver us
from all the temptations of that grand enemy of our souls, the Devil: that so
we may be delivered from the wrath of God, and from everlasting death and
damnation hereafter.

And this I trust he will do of his great mercy and goodness, Conclusion.
being infinite in both, as he is in glory, power, and dominion: His Kingdom
is over all, His Power is infinite, and His Glory is above the heavens, and
this from everlasting to everlasting. And it is the hearty desire of my soul,
that it should be so: and therefore I say Amen, that is, So be it.

Quest.

Must you always make use of this form when you pray unto God?

Answ.

This is always to be annexed to my prayers, Mat. 6.9, etc. Luke 11.3.
either before or after: for it is both the Pattern according to which I am to
pray, Mat. 6.9. And the form also I am to use when I pray; commanded, Luke 11.3.

O Holy Jesu, who have taught me to pray unto God aright; give me the heart
with all religious carefulness, and devotion of soul to observe thy directions
and commands herein: and daily to power forth my soul unto God in that divine
and heavenly inspired prayer which thou have taught me. And let my prayers be
ever acceptable unto God through thy blessed mediation and intercession for me:
who art my only Advocate and Mediator, blessed for ever: Amen.

CHAP. IV. Of the Sacraments.
Quest.

WHat other means has God ordained for the conveyance of his graces into our
hearts?

Answ.

The use of Sacraments.

Quest.

How many Sacrament has Christ ordained in his Church?

Answ.

Two only as generally necessary to salvation: Exo. 31.13, 15. Ephesians. 5.31, 32.
Act. 13.3. Mat. 28, 19. and 26.26, 27, 28. Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.27. Col. 2.7. Joh.
6.53, 54, 55, 56.
There are other external representations of Gods mercies, and rites of
conveying the same, but there are only two commanded as absolutely necessary to
salvation: that is to say, 1. Baptism, 2. And the Supper of the Lord: By
Baptism we are admitted members of Christ's Church: by the Lords Supper we are
confirmed and grow up to be perfect men in Christ: therefore children are
admitted to the Sacrament of Baptism, but not to the Lords Supper till they be
grown up to ripeness of years.

Quest.

What meanest thou by this word Sacrament?

Answ.

I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, given and
ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a
pledge to assure us thereof. Or thus:

Because the graces and mercies of God in Christ are inward and invisible, 1
Pet. 3.21. 1 Cor. 11.26.
therefore Christ complying with the weakness of our souls, which understand
not but by bodily organs, has ordained in his Church certain Rites called
Sacraments, which are not only visible, and apparent signs of his invisible and
hidden Graces; but also the means whereby we are made partakers of his Graces,
and pledges to assure us of them.

Quest.

How many parts be there in a Sacrament?

Answ.

Two: 1. The outward visible sign, or thing signifying: 2. The inward invisible
Grace, or thing signified.

Quest.

What is the outward visible sign or form in Baptism?

Answ.

That which we see with our eyes in Baptism, is Water, Act. 10.47.
wherein the person baptized is dipped or sprinkled with it: And the form of
words to be used when the person is so washed, is, In the Name of the Father,
Mat. 28.19.
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

Quest.

What is the inward or spiritual Grace, thereby represented?

Answ.

The washing of the soul from sin, 1 Cor. 6.11. Ephesians. 5.26. Act. 22.16. Romans
6.3, 4. Phil. 3.10. 1 John 3.14. Joh. 3.5. Psalm. 51.5. Ephesians. 2.3. Joh. 1.12.
and sanctification to the sacred service of God: which is called in holy
Scripture, A death unto sin, and a new virth unto righteousness: for being by
nature born in sin, and the children of wrath, we are hereby made the children
of grace.

Quest.

What is required of persons to be baptized?

Answ.

Two things: Act. 2.38. and 8.36, 37.
1. Repentance, whereby they forsake sin, and consequently the service of the
world, the flesh, and the Devil, tempting unto sin. 2. Faith, whereby they
steadfastly believe the promises of God made to them in that Sacrament.

Quest.

Why then are children baptized, when by reason of their tender age they can
neither believe nor repent?

Answer.

They have Faith and Repentance in the possibility, Mar. 10.14.
though not in the actual being thereof: and they do perform these duties,
though not by themselves, yet by their sureties, who promise and vow both Faith
and Repentance in their names, 2 Pet. 2.20.
which when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform; otherwise they
forfeit the benefits of their Baptism.

Quest.

Why was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ordained?

Answ.

For two reasons chiefly: 1. For a Sign: 2. For a Seal. 1. For a Sign: to
signify and represent unto us the sacrifice of Christ's death for the sins of
the world: Luke 22.19. Joh. 6.56.
whereof we ought to have the continual remembrance. 2. For a Seal to convey,
or pledge to assure us of the great benefits we receive by the death of Christ.

Quest.

Since in every Sacrament you say there are two parts, the outward sign, and
the inward grace: what is the outward part, or sign of the Lords Supper?

Answ.

The outward elements in this Sacrament are Bread and Wine, 1 Cor. 11.23. Luke
22.19.
which the Lord has commanded to be administered, and received: saying, Take,
eat, drink ye all of this, do this in remembrance of me.

Quest.

What is the inward part, or thing signified by the Sacramental Bread and Wine?

Answ.

The body of Christ, Joh. 6.51.
broken upon the Cross, by the Bread: and his blood powered out, by the Wine:
and as the Bread and Wine are truly taken and received corporally: so verily
and indeed is the body and blood of Christ taken and received spiritually of
every true faithful soul in the Lords Supper, Joh. 6.56, 63. 1 Cor. 10.16.
if rightly administered.

Quest.

What are the benefits, whereof we are made partakers by the right receiving of
the Lords Supper?

Answ.

Our souls are thereby strengthened with divine grace, Mat. 11.28. Romans 8.32.
Phil. 4.13. Ephesians. 1.7, 8. 1 Pet. 2.3. Ephesians. 5.30. Joh. 6.55, 56. Psalm. 104.15.
and refreshed with the sense of Gods mercy, by the virtue of Christ's body and
blood spiritually received, even as our bodies are strengthened and refreshed
in the use of common and material bread and wine.

Quest.

What is required of them that come to the Lords Supper, that they may be made
partakers of the benefits thereof?

Answ.

To examine themselves 1. 1 Cor. 11.28. 2 Cor. 6.14. Psalm. 24.4. and 26.6.
Whether they repent them truly of their former sins, steadfastly purposing to
lead a new life. 2. Whether they have a lively faith in the mercies of God
through Christ: 2 Cor. 7.1. Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. Joh. 3.15, 16. and 6.25 and 7.38.
Jam. 2.14, 17, 20, 24, 26. 1 Cor. 11.24, 25. 2 Pet. 1.15. Psalm. 53.2, 3. Mat.
5.23, 24. 1 Timothy 6.18. Heb. 13.16. Mat. 6.14, 15. Ephesians. 4.32. Col. 3.13.
now the life of faith is obedience, or good-works; for faith without works is
dead. 3. That they have a thankful and devout remembrance of Christ's death. 4.
That they be in charity with all men: which charity is exercised in giving, and
forgiving: 1. Giving unto others, what their necessities require, and our
abilities afford. 2. Forgiving others in what they have any way provoked or
injured us.

O Holy Jesus, who have vouchsafed, not only to redeem me unto God in thy
blood, but also to ordain Sacraments whereby I may not only be engraffed into
thee, but also nourished by thy most precious body and blood: O fill my heart
with true thankfulness unto thee for such unspeakable mercies: and grant that
in the wise and pious use hereof I may grow up into thee in all grace and
godliness, to the hopes of a full and immediate enjoyment of thee face to face
in glory, blessed Jesus, Savior and Redeemer: Amen.
