THE SPEECH OF THE Recorder of Bristol To His HIGHNESS The Prince of Orange.
Monday, January the 7th, 1688.
The Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and Commons of the Principal Citizens, of the
City of BRISTOL, Waited upon the Prince of ORANGE, being introduced by His
Grace the Duke of Ormond, their High-Steward, and the Earl of Shrewsbury: Where
the Recorder spoke to this effect:

May it please Your Highness,
THE Restitution of our Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and the freeing us from
that Thraldom which has rendered us, for many years useless, and at last
dangerous to the Common interest of the Protestant World, by your Highness's
singular Wisdom, Courage, and Conduct, are not only a stupendous Evidence of
the divine favor and providence for our preservation; but will be, and ought
to be an Everlasting Monument of your Highness's Magnimity, and other the
Heroic Virtues which adorn your Great Soul, by whom such a Revolution is
wrought in this Nation, as is become the Joy and Comfort of the Present, and
will be the Wonder of all Succeeding Ages.

In the Contrivance and Preparation of which Great Work, your Highness (like
the Heavens) did shed your propitious Influences upon us, whilst we slept, and
had scarce any Prospect from whence we might expect our Redemption.

But as since your happy Arrival in England, we did amongst the first,
Associate our selves to assist and promote your Highness's Most Glorious
Design, with our Lives and Fortunes, to which we think our selves bound in the
highest Obligation of Gratitude, most humbly to present to your Highness, our
humble and hearty Thanks, for this our Deliverance from Popery, and Arbitrary
Power and likewise, for declaring your Gracious Intentions, That by the Advice
of the Estates of this Kingdom, you will rectify the late Disorders in the
Government, both Ecclesiastical and Civil, according to the Known Laws. The due
and inviolable Observation of which, will, in our poor Opinion, be the only
proper Means to render the Sovereign secure, and both Sovereign and Subject
happy.

To which His Highness returned a most Gracious Answer.
