A CATALOGVE OF SVCH TESTIMONIES IN ALL AGES AS PLAINLY EVIDENCE BISHOPS AND
PRESBYTERS TO BE BOTH ONE, EQUAL AND THE SAME IN JURISDICTION, Office,
Dignity, Order, and degree, by divine Law and institution, and their disparity
to be a mere humane ordinance long after the Apostles times; And that the name
of a Bishop is only a Title of Ministration, not Dominion, of Labor not of
Honor, of Humility, not of Prelacy, of painfullnesse not of Lordlinesse, with
a Brief Answer to the Objections out of Antiquity, that seem to the contrary.

The EPISTLE to the READER.
Christian Reader,
THere is nothing more fr^quent in the mouths of our Lording Prelates and
their Flatterers, then to vaunt, That their Hierarchy and Episcopal
S^periority over other Ministers is by divine Right and Institution; and that
all Antiquity from Christ's till Calvin's days, and all learned men, except a
despicable small number of Factious Puritans ( as they term them) suffragate to
this Conclusion. This was the more then thrasonicall b^ast of Dr. La^d,
Arch-prelate of Canterbury, and some others, not only at the Censure of Dr.
Layton in the Star Chamber, and Dr. Bastwicke in the High Commission some few
years past; but likewise at the late Censure of Dr. Bastwicke, Mr. Burton, and
Mr. Prynne in the Star Chamber, June 14. 1637. where, in his learned Speech
(since Printed by special command, through his own underhand procurement) he
thus magisterially determines, page 6, 7. This I will say ( he might have done
well to have proved it first, but that his Ipse dixit only is now an O^acle)
and abide by it, That the calling of Bishops ( to wit Archbishops and
D^ocaesans, superior to, and distinct from Pres^yters, else his Speech is not
only idle but impertinent) is Iure divino: though not all adjuncts to their
callings: ( he should have done well to have specifie^ what adjuncts in
particular^) And I say further, that from the Apostles times in all ages, in
all places the Church of Christ was governed by Bishops ( to wit Diocaesan
Bishops like to our Prelates now, which he will prove at Graecas Calendas.) And
Lay Elders never heard of, till Calvin's newfangled devise at Geneva. To
disprove which fabulous assertion, I have not only particularly encountered it,
in the Unbishoping of Timothy and Titus, to which no Answer yet has been
returned by this Over-confident Boaster, or his Champions, though specially
challenged to Answer it) but likewise by way of Supplement to that Trea^ise,
drawn up this ensuing Catalogue ( which I challenge his Arch-grace, with his
brother Prelates, Doctors, Proctors, Parasites to encounter with as many
contrary Authorities if they can;)^ whereby both learned and illiterate may with
ease discern, that both by divine Institution, the suffrages of Fathers,
Councels, foreign and domestic writers of all sorts as well Papists as
Protestants, and the resolution of the Church and State of England in
Convocation and Parliament, Bishops and Presbyters are but one and the sam^ in
point of Office and Jurisdiction; and that the Superiority of Bishops over
other Ministers is a mere humane Institution long after the Apostles days,
introduced, partly by custom, partly by the Bishops own insensible
incroachme^ts upon their fellow brethren; but principally by the grants,
connivances, or indowments of Christian Princes, destitute of any divine
foundation to support it.

I confess, in the Histo^y of the Council of Trent: Edit, 3. p. 589, 590, 591.
to ^16.
Council of Trent, it was much debated among the Popish Prelates and Divines
there present; Whether Bishops were by divine Ordination, Superior to Priests?
But the Council being divided in opinion, left the Controversy undetermined.
Those Bishops and Divines who held the affirmative, produced nothing out of
Scripture, or solid Antiquity to justify their opinions, worthy answer, but
that Aerius was deemed an Heretic for affirming the contrary ( which I have
^ere disproved:) ye^ Idid. p. 59^ See M^^i^^ de Sacra. Horm. Origin et Cont.
l. 1. c. 5.
Michael of Medina who alleges this of Aerius, was so ingenious to conf^sse,
that Hierome, Austin, and some others of the Fathers ( as Ambrose, Sedulius,
Primasius, Chrysostomus, Theodoret, Oecumenius) did fall into Aerius heresy in
this point, it being no wonder that they did so, because the matter was not
clear in all points. This his boldness, to say that Hierome and Austin did
savor of Haeresie, gave great scandal: but h^ insisted the more upon it: The
Doctors says the History) were equally divided into two opinions in this
point. And when this Ibid. p. 589.
Article was propounded in this Romish Council; That the Bishops are instituted
by Christ, and are Superior to Priests de Iure divino; The Legates with others
answered, that the Lutherans and Heretics having affirmed, that a Bishop and
a Priest is the sam^ thing ( Ib. 591.60^.606.
putting no difference between a Bishop and a Priest, but by humane
constitution; and affirming, that the Superiority of Bishops was first by
custom, and afterward by Ecclesiastical constitution, for which they ci^e the
Augustane Confession made by the German Churches;) it was fit to declare, that
a Bishop is Superior, but that it was not necessary to say qu^ jure, nor by
whom a Bishop is instituted From whence it appears clearly; That half or more
of these Trent Fathers, with all the Lutherans and Protestant Churches at that
time were clear of opinion; That Prelates Episcopacy is not Iure divino: and
those who peruse that History and De Clericis. l. 1. c. 14.
B^llarmine may at first discern, that all our Prelates arguments and
Authorities now produced to maintain their Episcopal Jurisdiction to be
divine, are taken verbatim from these Popish Fathers of Trent who maintain
their assertion, and Bellarmine de Clericis the stoutest Champion for their
cause. Alas! to what miserable Shifts are our Prelates driven, when they must
thus fly to Trent, to Bellarmine for aid to support their tottering Thrones!
And yet these will stand them in no stead, all the Trent Prelates confessing
with S. Hierom. History of the Council of Trent: p. 220.
That in the first beginnings of Christianity, the Churches were governed by a
kind of Aristocracy, by the common Council of the Presbytery, and that the
Monarchical government and Superiority of Bishops and Archbishops crept in by
custom, as the Page 220.330. to 335. an excellent considerable place.
History of the Council of Trent relates at large; where you may read the
original of their Courts and Jurisdictions, with the steps and means of their
exorbitant growth and encroachments upon the temporal Jurisdiction and
Prerogative of Princes, well worthy the greatest Statesmens consideration.
Besides, Dionysius Cathusianus, and Cardinal Contarenus in their Commentaries
on Phil. 1.1. confess, that in Paul's time, Bishops and Presbyters were both
one, and that either Order was conferred on the Presbyter. That Presbyters are
there meant by Bishops, whence it is usually said, That in the Primitive times
Bishops were not distinguished from Priests. Azorisus the Jesuit Moral. part.
2. l. 3. c. 16. confesses, that in the Apostles times, every where, those who
were ordained Elders in Cities were Bishops: Cardinal Cusanus. De Concordia
Cathol. l. 2. c. 13. writes the same in effect: All Bishops; and perchance also
Presbyters are of equal power, as to Jurisdiction, although not of execution;
which executive exercise is restrained by certain positive Laws ( not Divine
but Canonical) whence the cause of these Laws ceasing, Glossa, Decret.
Distinct. 93 c. Legimu^.
the Laws themselves determine. And Johannes Semeca a Popish Canonist, avers;
That in the first primitive Church the Office of Priests and Bishops was the
same: but in the second primitive Church, ( to wit, some space after the
Apostles times) both their names and Offices began to be distinguished.

The same Doctrine, together with the Identity and Parity of Bishops and
Presbyters is professedly averred, not only by those hereafter cited in the
Catalogue; but also by In John Crespin. L'estate de Leglise f. 254.

John Ma^jor de Gestis Scotorum: l. 2. c. 3. w^ites, that in ancient times the
Scots were instructed in the Christian faith, by Priests and Monks, and were
then without Bishops. And John Fordon Scotichronicon. l. 3. c. 8. before him,
records, That before the coming of Palladius, the Scots had only Presbyters or
Monks to instruct them in the Faith and administer the Sacraments, following
the custom of the primitive Church. And Henric^ (...) man, (...) Tom. 1 p. 31^
from Palladius days till the reign of Malcolm the 3d; the Bishops of
Scotland had no Diocese at all ( and so were no Diocesan Prelates) but every
Bishop whom holiness had made reverend in that age, exercised his Episcopal
function without distinction in every place he came. If then Bishops and
Presbyters were all one and the same in the first Primitive Church, which
Church, together with that of Scotland, was anciently governed only by
Presbyters, not by any Lordly Prela^es, or Diocesan Bishops ( which Dr. William
Fulke in his Answer of a true Christian, etc. p. 20.50. professes ^o be
Antichristian, Pa^all and no divine institution,) why the Churches of Scotland,
and England may not now be governed by Presbyters only without Bishops, as well
as at first, I cannon conceive^ their regiment of late having been so
tyrannical, unchristian, antichristian and exorbitant, that they have almost
wholly ruined our Religion, Church, State, and lef^ them in a most perplexed,
if not desperate condition; which proves their Hierarchy to be rather
Antichristian and Diabolical, then Divine.

And how can it be otherwise, if we rightly consider the Persons or Condition
of our Hierarchy^ and their Antichristian Attendants? I remember a merry S^ory
in Itinear, l. 2. c 13.
Giraldus Cambrensis, and out of him related by Mr. Camden in his Britannia: p.
604. It happened that a certain Jew traveling toward Shrewsbury with the
Archdeacon of Malpas ( in Ches-shire) whose surname was Peche, that is, Sin,
and a Deane named Devil; when he heard by chance the Archdeacon telling, that
his Archdeaconry began at a place called Ill-street, and reached as far as to
Malpas toward Chester; he considering and understanding withal as well the
Archdeacons Surname as the Deans, came out with this merry and pleasant
conceit; Would it not be a wonder ( quoth he) and my fortune very good, if ever
I get safe again out of this Country, where Sin is the Archdeacon, and the
Devil is the Dean; where the entry into the Archdeaconry is Illstreet, and the
going forth of it Malpas? It was Fratres sic facit Jesus h^di^, multos si^i
elige^^ Dia^olos Episc^po^. In Gone^^. Rhemensi S^imo.
St. Bernards complaint in his age, that Jesus Christ elected many Devils to be
Bishops, as he chose Judas to be an Apostle. Since then there be so many
Archbishops, Deanes, and Bishops, Devils, so many Archdeacons Sinners, if not
Sin; and the entrance into these Offices (by reason of Symony, Ambition, and
the like) a mere Illstreet, and their going forth of them ( by reason of their
wicked lives, and exorbitant actions occ^sioned by their very Office) Malpas,
it is almost a wonder, and very good fortune, if any ^onest godly Minister or
Professor ever get safe again out of their Courts and Diocese, or escape
drowning in their Seas.

Hence is it, that the devoutest men in all ages since Prelates became Lords
paramount to Ministers, have either utterly refused to accept of Bish^pricks,
or resigned them after acceptance; as I have In the Epistl^ Dedica^o^y before
the Vnbishoping of Timothy and Titus.

^ther evidences. Les Fl^wrs de^ vies des So^^cts: part 1. Parisiis: 1637. p.

Ribadenerra a Jesuit, records it to the great praise of Bernardine of Sennes,
canonized at Rome for a Saint; that out of his humility he refused the 3.
Bishoprics of Sennes, Ferrara, and Urban, which several Popes offered to him:
and though one Pope put a Bishops Mi^er on his head with his own hands, yet he
put it off again, humbly beseeching him not to impose the charge of any
Bishopric upon him, and to change that estate of Poverty to which God had
called him; because he should bring more advantage to the Church by preaching
the Word of God, and ayding the Souls of many Bishoprics, then by being a
Bishop in one Church: The Pope hearing his reasons confessed them true, and
left him to his own liberty. Ribadenerra Ibid. p. 3^8.
Vincent Ferrier another Popish Saint, is highly magnified, for that' being
urged by the Pope to accept the Bishopric of Leride, the Archbishopricke of
Valence, and a Cardinalship; it was impossible to move him to accept of any of
these charges; deeming it a greater advantage to free one Soul from the
chains of Sin, then to gain all the great preferments of the world. For he
perceived that these honorable dignities seemed like so many golden chains,
whereby he should be detained at the Court, and deprived of liberty to go and
preach the Gospel with poverty, as God had commanded him. So Thomas of Idem
Ibidem, p. 313.
Aquin, canonised for a Saint, is highly applauded for refusing the
Archbishopricke of Naples, with other great dignities offered unto him by the
Pope. In like sort Idem Ibidem, p. 303^ 304.
Raimond of Roche^ort, another Roman Saint, is extolled, for refusing to accept
the Archbishopricke of Arragon, which the Pope himself conferred upon him, and
commanded him to accept within few days; at which news he was very sad, and
most humbly and instantly entreated his Holiness, not to lay such a burden
upon him, which he knew not how to bear: and seeing that the Pope was resolved
to enforce him to accept it, he fell sick with indignation, a ^ieuere
continuing upon him till he died of regret, and so discharged him of this care.
Idem Ibidem, p 358.
Antoninus another ^ate Romish Saint, being elected Archbishop o^ Florence by
Pope Eugenius the 4 th, refused to accept thereof, because being retired out of
the tempests of the world, he should thereby return into them to the great
peril of his Salvation. The Pope hereupon commanded him by his Bull to accept
it, threatening else to excommunicate him: whereupon by the advice of his Covent
and the Magistrates of Florence, who informed him, that he ought to obey the
Pope herein, he unwillingly accepted it; and kneeling down before them, he lift
up his eyes and hands to heaven, saying; O my Lord thou know full well that
it is much against my will to accept this charge; which I have undertaken for
fear to resist thine and thy Vicars will: and since thou know it, I beseech
thee direct me to do what I ought. Then entering into his See, he had only 8.
persons in his house; He had no Cupboord, Tapistry or hangings of Say in his
Chamber; no vessels of Silver; no Horses nor Coaches, riding upon a Mule that
was given him; saying, that the goods of the poor ought not to be spent in
nourishing beasts, and providing Superfluities. He had the Scripture always
read at his Table: and ever said, they should do him a special favor to
thrust him from his Archbishopricke, wherein he continued with as great regret
as he received it. Add to these, that John Crespin Lestate de ^eglig^, f, 29,

Richard Havering, Archbishop of Dublin, voluntarily renounced his
Archbishopricke upon this occasion^ One night he dreamed that a certain
Monster heavier then the whole world stood eminently aloft upon his breast, from
the weight whereof he chose rather to be delivered, then alone to have all the
goods of the world. When he wakened, he thought thus with himself, that this
was nothing ^ls but the Church of Dublin, the fruits whereof he received, but
took no pains for the same: ( the case of most Prelates now:) as soon as he
could therefore he came to the Pope, of whom he was much beloved, and there
renounced and gave over the Archbishopricke; for he had fatter and better
livings then the Archbishopricke came unto. Why should not our Archbishops and
Bishops now follow these many virtuous examples, in resigning and abandoning
all their Bishoprics, for the setting of a sweet peace and blessed Harmony in
our distracted Church and State, which their ambition, pride, tyranny,
Exorbitances and Innovations have almost brought to ruin? Had they but their
humility and piety, they would speedily renounce their most pernicious
Hierarchy, to embrace a fraternall unity and parity with their fellow-brethren,
whom Christ has made their equals, as these and other Prelates have done; and
as our present Relation of ^ Con^erenc^, p. 169 in the margin.
Archbishop of Canterbury confesses that famous Nazianzen, rather th^n the
peace should be broken, freely resigneth the great Patriarchate Constantinople,
and retired: whose steps he should do well to follow.

But if he or they refuse to do it for our Churches peace, and Kingdoms
safety, let them know that it is no new thing to abolish Bishoprics by Act of
Parliam^ by which 31. H. 8. c 9.33 H. ^. c. 31.34. H. 8.^.
most Bishoprics were first created, and so not Jure Divino. How many

there, being not now extant. The Bishopric of Westminster was no sooner
erected almost, but instantly suppressed; And 7. Ed. 6. The Rastall Du^ham: f.

Acts of Parliament in a moment.

If any de^m the continuance of our Lorly Prelates necessary in regard of their
presence in Parliaments, which some conceive cannot be held without the
presence of these ^ord^ Spiritual.

I Answer, first, that Abbots and Priors before the dissolution of Mona^teries
were Spiritual Lords in Parliament as well as Bishops: since then Parliaments
both may, have been, and are now held without Lord Abbots and ^riors, they may
by the same reason be held without Lo^d Bishops. Second^^, Bishops sit not in
Parliament of right as they are Bishops ( for as Bishops, they are not
Cromptous Jurisdiction, ^, 12, b, Stamford Plee. d^l Corone l, 3, c, 1, ^, 153,

Scr^ope, Fisher, and Cranmer were) bu^ as they hold of the King per (a)
Baro^iam, in right of their Churches, which few of them at this day do:
Therefore their si^ting in Parliament is not of right, but of mere grace of the
King, who may Sommon or not Sommon them at ^is pleasure: sinc^ they are no
Lords, nor yet so styled by the King, in any of their Paten^s; though they so
in^itle themselves in some of their Cromptons Jurisdiction of Courts, f, 12, b,
late Prin^ed Books. Thirdly, In Bishop White Bishop Morton, Arcshbishop Laud,
and Bishop Hall, in the T^tles of their late Books,
matters of Treason, Felony, blood and Capital Crimes debated in Parliament,
the Bishops both by Common and Canon Law o^ght not to give their votes, nor yet
to be present in the house, but to depart, which no other Peers do ^ut they:

If then the Parliament in these cases of highest nature may pass a complete
Judgment without them, their presence is not necessary in it, nor they any
needful members of it. Four^hly, Bishops in former ages even under Popish
Kings, when they had most sway, have been excluded Parliaments, much more then
may they be so now: Fox Acts and Monument^ in the old Edition, p. 748. 901 905,
9^7 b 1706, b, i, 17, b,
Gardner and Bonner in King Edwards days; and all Bishops that were married (
as most then were) in the first Parliament in Queen Mary's reign were excluded
the Parliament; and in King Edward the 1. his time at the Parliament held at S.
Edmonds Bury, Anno 1296. all the Bishops were put out of the Parliament and
Kings protection, and that Parliament held good and made Laws without them. And
Anno 1273. in the 20. year of Henry the 3. the Statute of Merton cap. 9.
to^ching Bastardy, was made by the Lords temporal and Commons without and
against the consent of the Bishops. ^h^se two Presiden^s are cited by Bishop
Jewel in his Apology against So Cr^mt^n quotes it. But it ^s in his defense of
hi. Apology, at part 6 c. 2 p. 5, i 522

Bishops; to which Crompto^s Iuri^diction of Cou^^s f ^9 b.
Mr. Crompton, and Bishop Bilson likewise assent: therefore I shall no l^nger
debate it, as being pas^ all doubt; concluding this point in Bishop Bilsons
words (a great Champion for Episcopa^y) which are full and notable. Of the true
dif^e^ence between Chri^^ian ^ubjection^ and Antichristian ^ebellion, part 3,
p, 541, 542, 543,
Claim you ( Bishops) that interest and prerogative, that without you nothing
shall be done in matters of Religion, by the Laws of God, or by the liberties of
this Realm. By the Laws of the Land, have no such privilege. Parliaments have
been kept by the King and his Barons, THE CLERGY WHOLLY EXCLVDED. And when the
Bishops were present, their voices from the Conquest to this day were never
negative. ^y Gods ^aw you have nothing to do with making Laws for Kingdome^,
and Commonwealths: o^ may teach, you may not command: P^rswasion is your part,
compulsion is the Princes. I^ Princes embrace the Truth, you must obey them; If
they pursue Truth, you must abide them. By what Authority then claim you this
dominion over Princes; that their Laws for Religion shall be void, unless you
consent? After which he proves at larg^, that the Kings of Judah and Israel of
old, with many godly Christian Kings and Emperors since, have made not only
Civil, but ^cclesiasticall Laws without a Council, or any suffrage of Bishops:
Much more then may they hold a Parliament without their presence; as Bishop
Jewel proves at lange. It was a no^able Speech and true of Ludovicus Cardinal
Arelatensis in the Council of Basil; For Acts and Monu^ent^ Land. 1^10^ p^
624^ 625^
where he maintained the parity of Bishops and Presbyters: That rich and Lordly
Bishops fear the power of the Prince, and to be spoiled of their
temporalities, neither have they free liberty to speak as is required in
Councels. Albeit if they were true Bishops and true Pastors of Souls, they
would not doubt to put their lives in venture for their Sheep, nor be afraid to
sh^d their blood for their Mother the Church. But at this present (the more is
the pity) it is too rare to find a Prelate in this world, which does not
prefer his temporalities before his Spiritualities, with the love whereof they
are so withdrawn, that they study rather to please Princes then God; and
confess God in corners, but Princes they will openly confess. Concluding that
the poor are more apt to give judgment then the rich, because their riches
brings fear, and their poverty causes liberty. For the poor fear not
tyranny as rich men do, who being given over to all kind of vanities, idleness
and sloth, will rather deny Christ then lack their accustomed pleasures; Such
are they whom not their flock but their revenues make Bishops. Have ye not
heard how they said, they would consent to the Kings will and pleasure? But the
Inferiors are they which have had truth, righteousness and God himself before
their eyes, and they are greatly to be commended for showing themselves such
men unto the Church of God. If ^hen any desire the continuance of Lord Bishops
in Church or Parliament, yet it will be necessary to strip them of their
Temporalities and Lordships, and to confine them to one living with Cure, where
they may reside and preach like other Ministers, because their Temporalities
will make them Temporizers, and to vote amiss ag^nst God and the Republike
both in Parliament and Convocation, as this Cardinal truly informs us from
experience.

To close up all in a few words. I shall desire (...) ^ordly Prelates and
others to observe; that Rev. 4.4.10.11. c. 5, 6.11, 12.14. c. 7.11, 12, 13, 14^
15. c. 11.15, 19, 17, 18. c. 19.4, 5, 6. The 24 Elders are placed next in rank
to the very throne of Christ, as being next to him in Authority and
Jurisdiction, no Archb^shops or Bishops ^^ing there named, much less
interposed between them. That the Angels ( whom our Prelates will needs
interpret ^o be Diocesan Bishops in the 2d and 3d of the Revelation, though the
Contents of our last ^ranslated Bibles expressly define them, to be the
Ministers, not Bishops, of the 7 Churches) stand round about the Elders, and
are remoters from Christ's throne then they^ therefore not so honorable. That
Christ stands in the midst of the Elders; to signi^ie, that ^hey are subject
to no Diocesan Bishop, but Christ alone, and that no Lord Bishops, but Elders
only belong to the Kingdom and Government of Christ, who is never said to be
in the midst of Archbishop^ and Bishops (none of his institution) but of the
24. Elder^ only: That these Elders alone worship and prostrate themselves, give
thanks, and resolve doubts upon all occasions^ not Bishops: And that when the
Kingdoms of this world, become the Kingdom of o^^ Lord and his Christ, and
when the Lord God omnipotent is said to reign, the Elders are still said to be
about Christ's throne, and to adore and praise him, there being no mention at
all of Bishops. Therefore our Prelates must needs confess themselves to be but
Elders only and properly; or else acknowldge, that Elders by divine ^nstitution
are Superior to them in dignity^ and that Archbishops and Bishops have no
place at all appointed them by Christ about his throne, or with^n his Church
and Kingdom, and therefore must needs be Antichristian and in^o^erable in our
reformed Church; out of which I doubt not ^re long to see them quite ejected,
and Man. ^.13.

Bishops and P^esbiters Iu^^ D^^m^, ^sterly subverts and ruine^^ I shall close
up this Squ^dr^n with the ^^e Authorities of some Semi^^^ Priests in En^land.
As namely of Ni^c^^las Smi^h, in his modest and b^iefe discussion of certain
Assertions which are taught by Mr. Doctor ^^l^ison in his Treatise of the
^cclesiasticall (...). where thus he determines, See C^^su^ ^a u^ta^tis
Pa^^^ien^is (...) 16.31. p. 16 21 24.2^, 37
I judge is no rashness to affirm that since England enjoyed a Bis^^p^ (to wit a
Po^^s ^ishop^ to confirm the Papists, and control the P^iests, namely Rich^^d
bis^op of Ch^lced^^ created the general ^ishop and superintend^nt, both of
England^ and Scotland, by Pope Vrbaus special Bull, dated the 4 th. of August,
Anno 1625. The Copy whereof you shall ^ind printed, in Censura Proposition^m
qua^undam etc. per sacram facultatem Theolog^a Parisi^nsis factae Pa^isiis,
1631, p, 63, 64, 65: that more damage has happened to the Catholics in
general by reason of discord, and frequent loss of charity, then they have
received benefit, by the Sacrament of Con^irmation only conferred on some few.

That all holy men have exceedingly e^deavoured to s^un such an high dig^ity.

That a Bishop is in a State which presupposes but yet gives not perfection:
which the State of Religion, not only presupposes but gives.

That a vow not to receive a Bishopric is valid and sacred.

That ^o desire a Bishopric even for that which i^ best in it, to wit for the
good of souls according to St: Thom^s s^cunda s^^u^da, que 185. Art, 1, seems
to be presumpti^n, and there are some who stick not to say (and that commonly)
it is a mo^tall sin.

That these ^ropositions following are strange, idle, and absurd.

That it is d^ iure divine, and that the law of God is, that every particular
Church (as England is) ought to have a Bishop.

That without a Bishop England were not a particular Church.

That unless every particular Church has its Bishop or Bishops, the whole and
Vnive^sall Church could not be) as Christ has instituted it) an Hierarchy
composed of diverse particular Churches.

That without a Bishop we cannot have con^irmation etc.

All which principles (says he) are worse then the concultion it self and
demonstrated by us (to ^it in that Treatise) to have no foundation at all.

Thus this Popish Priest who proving that the Church of England may well
subsist without a Popish Bishop to sway and order it; grants that it may do
the like without our Protes^ant Prelates, and that plainly resolves that it is
not from any divine law or institution, that the Church of England should have
any Bishop at all to govern it. Daniell a Jesus another Priest, and a Reader of
Divinity thus seconds him, in his Apology for the proceeding of the holy see
Apostolic, as to the government of the catholics in England during the time
of Persecution Cens^rae Pa^isi^nsis p, 40, 48, 49, 60
That it is most false and of dangerous consequence, that a particular Church
cannot be without a Bishop: That Gods law requires no more, but that there be
some Bishops in the Church to wit so many, that there be no danger, that the
whole Order should suddenly be taken away by their deaths and so dispersed
through the world, that all Christians may be sufficiently provided of learned
and virtuous Priests.

If this be done the law of God is satisfied although there be no Bishops in
F^ance, Spain, or, England.

Give me there^o^e a mul^itude of Christians how great soever who want not a
Bishop to ordain Priests, and I will boldly affirm that there is n^ need that
the governor of that society should be a Bi^^op.

Yea let us suppose the Ordina^ion o^ Priests and the Ministry of the Church,
not to be necessary in the Church, and presently it follows, that there is no
need the universal Church should be governed by Bishops who are superior to
Priests.

That in the time of Persecution it is neither good, nor convenient, nor any
solace or comfort to the Church to have a Bishop.

That those who of Bishops are made Religious persons may be said in some sort
to fly ^igher, and not at all to descend.

That if the Catholics of England should yield to this motion (name^y to
receive the Bishop of Chalcedon as their p^oper Pastor and Bish^p they could by
no means excuse themselves^ from being worthy of that reprehension which the
C^rinthians received from Saint Paul, namely, that they rashly, and
indiscreetly, put themselves into subjection that they should bestow their
temporal goods, so as they could exspect no reward from God, as exercising
humility, Obedience, Pat^ence, for which no crown of Righteousness is
prepared: yea that they may by their blind receiving o^ him (though by the
Popes own Bull and authority) expose themselves to manifest peril by falling
into mortal sin etc.

These Positions of theirs were publicly taught and maintained by many other
Priests both in England, and Ireland as appears by the censure of the faculty
of Paris, and Nicholas I^ Maistre his Instauratio antiqui Principatus
Episcoporum Parisijs 1633. Written upon this occasion in answer of these
Treatises and some others. Some of which Propositions though they were censured
as Eronious, by the faculty of the Divine^ of Paris. Anno 1631. through the
power of the Bishop of Chalcedon, as striking at the Popes Supremacy and the
Bishops Hierarchy, yet in all that censu^e, I find not one passage of
Scripture produced to prove them contrary to the word of God, and therefore that
censure of theirs not much to be regard^^.

humane and canonical institution long afte^ the Apostles most of them
co^demning it as Antichristian, unlawful. Diabolical, pernicious, to
Religion, and the Church of God, and the cause of all the tyranny, schisms,

c, 2. wiih all the High Commission Patents grounded on 1 Eliz, c. 1. all which
expressly resolves, That all manner of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, whereby
Bishops are extinguished from, and elivated above ordinary Ministers, is wholly
vested in, and for ever, inseperably united and annexed to the imperial Crown
of this Realm: that our Archbishops, Bishops, Arch-Deacons^ and other
^cclesi^sticall Persons have no manner of jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, but
only by, under, and from the Kings Majesty, that they ought to have the
jurisdiction delegated and divided to the^ by special Letters Patents and
Commissions under the Kings great Seal to execute the same, not in their own
names and right, but only Nomin^ vice, Authoritate nostris Regijs (as King
Edwards, Patents run) in the Kings own name right and Authority, as his
Officers and subs^itutes, making out all their Process, Citations,
Excommunications, Commissions o^ Administration, Probate of wills, and writs of
Iur^ Patron^^us etc: in the Kings name only, and under his Seal of Arms, not
their own under pain of imprisonment and a praemunire; for the neglect and
wilful contempt whereof all our Bishops and their Officers have encurred
several Premunires to the forfiture of all their temporalities, goods,
estates, and liberties to his Majesty, who may much enrich his Exchequer
thereby.

All which Acts and Patents judicially condemn and overturn our Bishops
pretended superiority, over their fellow Brethren by a divine right, the very
claim whereof alone makes them all liable to a Praemunire and mere perjured
persons both to God and the King, being directly contrary to the very oath of
Supremacy, prescribed by 1 Eliz, c, 1, which every Bishop often times takes, and
every graduate and Clergy man whatsoever who must either abjure this pretended
Ius Divinum with which they would support the Hierarchy, or prove: perjured
disloyal Subjects to their Sovereign.

parity ^quality, and identity of Bishops, and Presbiters by divine right and
institution.

I shall now challenge all our great swelling ^relates, and their s^attere^s
jointly and severally (^s^ecially the two Archbishops who have made so many
throsonicall bragg^s of the proof of their divine Title in open Court before
thousands of people) to produce a contrary Catalogue of Auth^rities of these
several kinds eviden^ing their divine pretended right, supe^io^ity and
jurisdiction over other Minis^e^s, ^f they are able to do it and to give a
satisfactory, answer to this Treatise, I shall su^s^ib^ to their opinion, and
recant what I have written.

But if they cannot perform ^t, (as I am certain they are altogether unable)
then let them retract their former vain glorious vaunts^ and abjure their
pretended Ius Divinum by subscribing to that truth, (which they are unable to
contradict) and laying down their Bishoprics at (least their Rochests^) as
they have oft-times solemnly protested they would do.

If they can or will do neither, they must give all the world leave to pass
this censure on them.

That they have neither that learning truth or honesty in them as hitherto they
would make the world believe they had^

And that they may have no starting hole to evade: I shall in as few words as
may be, answer what ever they can Object for themselves out of any undoubted
A^tiquity which is but this^

That Acce^s was bran^ed for an Heretic by Epipha^i^s and Augu^tine, Object 1.
for affirming Bishops and Presbiters to be equal one to the other: by divine
insti^ution:

This is all that either the Thomas Waldensis Tom: 3, c. 60, 61, 62. Rhemists

373, 44^.
our Prelates do or can allege for their Hierarchy out of the Fathers or
Antiquity; and this in truth is a good as nothing.

For first this opinion of Aerius was never condemned as Heretical, by any
Counsel or Father whatsoever, but only by Epiphanius, who alone is
unsufficient to brand or make any man an Heretic. Saint Augustine indeed (if
the Book be his cites this opinion of his, out of Epiphanius in his Book de
haeresibus, c, 53, yet he brands it not as an Heresy, but styles it Proprium
Dogma in express terms to wit, his proper assertion (and his own too) taxing
him only of Heresy for^siding with the Arrians in their branded heresy,
Origi^um l, ^, c, 5
Isiodor Hispalensis and Causa ^. qu, 3,
Gratian reciting the Heresy of Arrius makes no mention a all either of this
as an Heresy or error in him, passing it over in silence and expressly
averr^ing it themselves as a truth.

Wherefore no ancient Counsel or Author whatsoever but Epiphanius branding it
either for an heresy or Error. I see not well how it should be so esteemed.

Epiphanius and some few of late (out of him alone) have rashly deemed it.



Fourthly, Epipha^ius there condemns Aerius as much for reprehending and
censuring Prayer for the dead, as for affirming Bishops and Presbiters to be
equal.

But this our Prelates must confess (unless they renounce this Doctrine of
our Church) was no Error or Heresy in Aerius but rather in Epiphanius, why not
therefore the other.

Fifthly, Epiphanius himself does not A^rius his opinion in this particular
for an Hereticko but only as a fond opinion (as his words) E^ quod tota res
stu^titiae plena est apud prudentes manifestum est.

Sixthly, St. Hierom^ Nazia^zen, Basil and Augustine taught the same Doctrine
that Aerius did, at or about the same time, but they were never taxed of
Heresy or Error for it either then or since: why then should A^rius only be
blamed who argues just as Hierome does, producing the same Sc^ipture to prove
his assertion as Hierom^ has done in his Epistle to Evagrius and on Tit. 1.

Seventhly, Epiphanius his refutations Aerius his Arguments and opinion is very
ridiculous, false, and absurd.

For first he says, that Presbiters then had not the power of ordination,
neither did they use to lay on hands, in the election and Ordination of
Ministers, which is a mere falsehood, as Hierom in Soph. c. ^. with the ^th.
Counsel of Carthage, witness, and I have elsewhere manifested at large.

Secondly, he says that Presbiters had See Appendix catalogo testium veritis

Boicorum, l, 3, p. 214, 219, and heretofore p: 9^.93, 103.
contrary to all Antiquities, extant, and a most palpable untruth.

Thirdly, he says that there were then more Bishops then Presbiters and men
sufficient and worthy enough to be made Bishops but no^ Presbyters, and
therefore the Apostle writing to the Philippians and others makes mention only
of Bishops, not of Presbyters, because they had then Bishops but not Presbyters.

A miserable ridiculous, answer, which subverts that he contends for, and
constitutes Bishops without any Ministers under their command or jurisdiction^
whence it will necessarily follow. That seeing the Apostles instituted Bishops
without Ministers under them, and more Bishops then Presbiters, there ought now
to be no Presbiters subject to Bishops, but Bishops to be pl^ced in every
church^ without any Ministers under them, but Deacons only and more Bi^hops
then Ministers, which I presume the Lordly Prelates will not grant, for this
would over-turne not only their Lordships, but their ^ioces^e and Episcopalities

Fourthly, he says that the Apo^^les first constituted Bishops only in the
Church, without Elders and then they afterward elected Elders as they f^und
them worthy, which is contrary to St^ ^^i^^. ad Ev^^r^^ and (...), in Ti^^ 1.
Jerome and ^ll antiquity averring that Elders were first ordained in every
Church, (...) 14^ 23, Tit. 1, 5, and that they afterward elected a Bishop out
of themselves.

^hil. ^. 1. Tit. 1, 5, 7, Act. 20, 17, 2^.

Timothy to be a Bishop which I have elsewhere proved false, and from this
false ground would prove Bishops and Presbiters distinct.

Seventhly, he interprets an Elder Tim. 5.1, to be a Presbiter which most
Fathers else expound only to be an ancient man.

Timothy a Bishop and Bishops to be Superior too, and distinct from Presbiters,
because Paul exhorts him not to rebuke an Elder, but to exhort him as a Father,
and not to receive an accusation against an Elder, but under two or three
witnesses, which are gross inconsequence (as I have else where manifested) so
that Epiphanius whilst he goes about to prove Aerius his assertion still of
folly steps into many Errors, follies, and absurdities himself, as Tom. 1

Bellarmine is enforced to confess, though desirous to make the best of it.

judgment of a Synod or of the Church, condemning his answers to Aerius his
reasons as notoriously absurd and impertinent yea as foolish and Childis^
worthy to be hissed and derided I shall therefore conclude as does our learned

equ^ll Presbiters^ with Bishops be heretical. Nihil Catholicum esse potest,
Nothing can be Catholic, so far as it from being either an Heresy or Error
as o^r absurd Prelates and their Sycophants Pretend.

If they object the Authority of Object. ^.
Epist. 5, 6, 7 8, 9, 10. Espenc^us digresi. in Tim. l 3, c, 1, 2, 3
Ignatius that he advances Bishops above Presbyters commanding them to obey
the Bishops as the Apostles obeyed Christ, and willing the people to be subject
to their Bishops as to God and Christ, and to their Elders as to Christ's
Apostl^s: therefore in his days Bishops were Superior to Presbiters.

To this I answer, A^s^er.
that these Epistles of Ignatius are false and spurious as many C^ci censu^^ p,
5^, etc.
of our learned men have proved at large, therefore of no Authority.

Secondly, it is clear by Acts 10.2^ Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1, 5, 7. that in Ignatius
his days Bishops and Presbiters were all one both in Title, office, and
jurisdiction: that there were many Bishops in every chief City and Church, not
any sole ^ishop paramount the Presbiters, over one or many Churches: and that
Dioc^san Bishops were instituted long after the Apostles and therefore after
Ignatius his days (who lived in the Apostles age) as all Authors forecited
accord and the whole Clergy of England, in their Institution of a Christian
man dedicated to King Henry the 8 resolve in direct terms, These Epistles
therefore of Ignatius which spe^k of one Bishop in a church, distinct from and
superior to Presbyters must needs be ^orged.

Thi^dly, Ignatius in these Epistles makes Bishops successors to Christ and to
s^and in his stead, and Presbyters to succeed the Apostles, whereas all others
ma^es them successors to the Apostles only, not to Christ, who Heb, 7, 24.
le^t no successor or Vicar general behind him, b^t Heb. 7:17, ^1 24, 28, 1
P^t, 2, ^9.
remains himself for ever the High Priest, chief Shepherd and Bishop of our
S^ules, and has promised Matthew. 28, 20.
to ^e with us always even to the end of the world: This therefore ma^es his
Authority but suspici^us and co^te^ptible.

Fourthly, Ignatius has not o^e word in him that Bishops are superior to
^^e^biters ^y any divine l^w or i^stitution^ (the thing in question) therefore
his Authority (if ge^uine) proves nothing for the oposites.

Fifthly, Igna^ius equals Bishops and Presbyters both in jurisdiction, rule,
and Authority, for ^pist. ^. ad ^ral^^anus he writes thus: ^ut be ye subject to
the Presbyters as to the Apostles of Christ: for the Presbyters are a certain
conjoined Sessions and ^ssembly of Apostles Epist. 6. ad Magnesianes ^rebyteri
president ^oco Sinatus Apostolis The ^resbyters rule in the place of the Senate
of the Apostles. Epist. 10. ad Symenses. Do ye al ^ollow the College of the
presbiters as Apostles: Now if Presbyters succeed the Apostles in the
government o^ the Church, and al are to be Subject to them, to follow them as
Christ's Apostles, then certainly ^hey are equal at least to Bishops, who at
the highest are by Gods institution only to be obeyed and followed but as
Christ's Apostles not to be pre^erred before them, if equalized with them, as
the proudest Prelate of them must acknowledge and and the Isiodor ^^isp: de
Eccles. O^^^^ cii^ l, 2, c, 17, Amalarius ^or^unatus de Eccles^ Officij^ l^ 2,
c, 13.6
Fathers witness.

Sixthly, Epist, 5, 6, 10.
Ignatius confesses that the Churches in those days were not ruled by the
Bishops as they are now but by the College Senate and Synod of the Elders, and
communi Praesbyt^oum concilio as Hierome Epist. ad Enagrilem and in Tit. 1.
and all other after him affirm the Presbiters therefore had then equal and
joint authority with the Bishops even in point of Jurisdiction and governments
and did r^le and govern, the Church in common with them, therefore the Bishops
were not then Lords Paramount, as now they ma^e themselves, but equal and one
with them, yea their Colleagues and companions as Quid ve^^ S^c^^do^ium aliud
estquam sacerc^^as consiliary and assessorores E^iscopo Epist: 5.
Ignatius and the Can, 35, collegam se Presbyterorum ess^ cognos^at^
^our^h counsel o^ Ca^^h^ge style the^.

Seventhly, his words Epist 5 6 7.
that they should ^e s^bject to the Bishop as to God and Christ, if rightly
understood ma^e nothing for the Prelates Hiera^chie^ ^or Saint Paul Ephesians. 6,
5.6, 7. commands servants to be obedient unto them that are their Masters
according to the flesh, with ^eare and ^^embling in singlenes^e of heart as
unto Christ, not with eye-service as ^en pleasers but as the servants of
Christ, doing the will of God from his heart, with good will, doing service
unto the Lord, and not to men, etc. Is therefore every Master a Bishop, equal
unto Christ, and superior in inrisdiction and degree to Presbyters No, So
Polycarpus in his Epistle to the ^hilippians charge them Subjecti esto^e
Presbyteris and Diacon^s sicut Deo et Christo Ibid^
to be subject to their Elders as unto God and Christ using the same words of
Elders as Ignatius does of Bishops. Are Pre^byters therefore Paramount Bishops,
and succes^o^s to Christ himself? I trow not Ignatius his meaning therefore is
not, that Bishops are as high above Presbyters and the people as God and Christ
are above the Apostles (as some See Espen^^us Digress. in Ti^ l, 1, c, 12, 3.
ambitious Prelates fancy) but only that we must obey Bishops in all things
that they command and prescribe us out of Gods word, as far ^orth as we would
obey God or Christ himself, for he that hears them, hears Christ himself,
and he that despises them, despises God and Christ himself. Luke 10.16. 1
These. 4^ 8. In this manner likewise are we to be subject to every Minister
whatsoever^ Heb. 13.17.7.1 These. 2.13. This therefore proves nothing for the
Prelates superiority over other Bishops, especially since this Igna^^us
himself Epist. 5 charge the Trallians to reverence De^cons (in^e^^or to
^resbyters) as Christ himself, whose Vicars they are. As for those extravagail
expressions of Ignatius Epis^l. 5.
Episcopus typum Dei Patris ^mnium ge^ut, quid enim aliud est Episcopus quam is
qui ^mni ^^incipatu and protestate Superior est and quod homini licet pro
viribus imitator Christi Dei factus, (and the Sea Coci censura p. 61.62.63
like) on Esp^encaeus digres, in Ti^^l, 1 ^^ 1.2^
which same ground both the Popes and Prelates Monarchy, they are so
ridi^ulous, ^alse, ambitious, and hyperbolical, as favor neither of Ignatius or
any Christian, but rather of a mere papal and Antichristian spirit^
discovering these Epistles to be none of his, and those ^rela^ts who ass^me
these speeches to themselves to be Romans ^.9.
none of Christ's Mat. 11.29. All which considered^ this forged A^tiquity will
stand the^ in no stead at all, to prove them superior or distinct from
Presbyters by any divine institution, and other Antiquity, making for them I
find not extant.

That Presbyters and Bishops by Gods law and Ordination are both one and the
same and of equal authority and jurisdiction as all these authorities resolve,
I shall undeniable manifest by this one Argument.

Presqyters by the express resolution of the Scripture have the very name, and
not so only but the very office of Bishops Act. 20.17, 28. P^^l. 1, 1, 1. Tim.
3.1^ to 5. Tit. 1, 5. to 1^. the same mission, and commission, the same
function, charge, Ordination, and quallification. Matthew. 28.19.20. 1 Timothy 3, 1.
to 7. c. 4.14. c. 5 17. 2 Timothy 4.1, 2, 1, Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3. Tit. 1, 5. to 12.
neither does the Scripture in any place make any difference distinction, or
superiority between them, or attribute any power to the one, that it does not
to the other, ^s the premises evidence, and Matthew. 20 25.26, 27, 28. Mar. 10,
42, 43: 44 Luke 22.25.26.

Therefore by Gods law and institution they are one and the same, and of equal
authority power and jurisdiction in all things.

As for that distinction in power, precedence, and jurisdiction, whi^^ has
since been made between them it has proceeded, partly from Canons and
constitutions made by Bishops themselves, Institution of a Christian man chapter o^
Orders,
partly by mere usurpation, and encrochment, but principally from the grant and
largeness of Christian Princes, who as they erected Bishoprics and Diocese
and multiplied them or divided them as they saw occasion, so they limited See

and granted them all that Episcopal power, and jurisdiction whereby they were
distinguished from, or advanced above Ordinary Ministers, as appears by the
Original Charters of the foundations and erections of our own English
Bishop-rickes, the forecited Statutes, and by our own and foreign Histories,
Now that jurisdiction and superlority thus acquired, is but mere and humane
not divine. Again Bishop-ricks are mere h^mane institutions directly contrary
to the Holy Ghost, who ordained many Bishops in every Church and City, not one
Bishop over many (which he can never well instruct, rule, and oversee) Acts 20.
17.28, 1 Timothy 5.17. P^il. 1, 1, Tit. 1^ 5, 7. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3. Now that
Episcopal jurisdiction which distinguishet^ Bishops from Presbyters. was See

If then all our Bishoprics in several ages have been void thus, 2, 3, 4, 5,

omit all annual vacancies) without any prejudice to the Church or State, and
with great benefit to the Kings of England, who enjoyed the temporalities in
the mean time, t^en certainly Bishops are no such necessary creatures of
divine institution, but that we may spare them all together, For if we may want
them 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, years without prejudice, Why not an Hundred?
why not 500. years? yea why not altog^ther, as they do in all reformed
Churches, who have quite cacashierd them long ago? when as no Church can spare
or want their Pastors and Ministers that are of Gods institution above 6
months, at most Rostall Advi^son 1, 2, concil^ Lat^ran^nsis 2 Can. 29, S^^ma

neces^ary which the Bishops are not^ I shall close up this discou^se with a
m^morable I resident of the D^nes, An Dom, 1537 Christian the third King of
Denma^^e, removed and suppressed by public Edict, all the Bishops of his
Kingdom, for their intolerable Treasons and Rebellions, abolishing their
Bishoprics as contrary to our Saviors institutions, (the means that made
them, Idle, proud, ambitious, unpreaching ^relates, and seditious t^echerous
Rebels to their ^rinces, and in stead of 7, Bishops of De^mark, he instituted
7, Superintendents to execute the office of Bishops, to give orders to others,
and execute all Ecclesiastical af^ai^es, which 7, Superintendents, (Aug^st 26,
1537.) ^eceived their ordi^ation from John Bugenhagius (^ P^otestant minis^er)
in the Cathedral of H^sina, in the presence of the King, and Se^ate of the
Kingdom, Lo ^e^e all Bishops cashiered as false rebellious Traitors to their
Sovereign, (as they have ever been in all States and ages, the^e having been
more noto^i^us Traitors Rebels, and conspir^tors, of Bishops then of all other
ranks of men in the world (as I ^m able to ma^e good) as contr^ry to divine
institution, and see not Iure divino, as they now bo^st, and Superinte^dents
ordained by a mere ^^es^iter in their stead, to confer orders unto others in
all the Danish Churches. In the beginning of reformation in Germany and other
places, Luther and other Ministers usually ordained Deacons and Ministers, and
set out Books of the manner of Ordination without any Bishops assistance,
which power of Ordination and imposition of hands has, ever since been
pr^ctised by Ministers in all reformed Chu^ches which have abandoned Bishops
(such as ours are and ma^e themselves as contrary to Gods word,) ^atrick
Adamso^ (Ar^h-Bishop of St. Andrews in Scotland,) in his recantation publicly
made in the Synod of Fi^^e, (April 8, 1591,) con^es^eth, that this office of a
Diocesan Bishop Omne ^uthoritate verbi dei destituitu^ and solo politico
h^minum c^n^mento ^u^datur is destitute of of all authority from Gods word, and
is only ^ounded in the politic figment of men, out of which the primacy of
the ^ope or Antichrist ^ath sprung, and is worthily to be condemned, because
the as^embly of the ^^esbytery penes qu^m est j^risdictio and inspectio^^m in
visitationibus tum in ordinationibus, which having the jurisdiction and
inspection, both in visitations and in Ordinations, will perform all these
things, with greater authority, piety, and zeal, then any Bishop whatsoever,
whose ca^e is for the most part, intent not upon ^od or his ^^^ction, but the
world which he especially serves, A (...) bl^w to our prelates Hie^achie. For
i^ Bishops be not Iure divino and have no ^oundation in the word of ^od, the^
the power of Ordinatio^ belo^gs not ^to them Iure divino as they a^e Bishops
neither can do or ^ught, they to con^e^^e Orders as Bishops but ^rely as they
are Ministers: And if so (as is most certain,) Then this power of Ordination
belongs not at all to Bishops as Bis^ops, but only as Ministers, and every
Minister as he is a Minister, ^ath as much right and authority to give o^ders
as any Bishop whatsoever, the true reason why even among us at this day,
Ministers ought to join with the Bishop in the imposition of hands, neither can
our Bishops ordain any one a Minister, unless 3, or 4, Ministers at least,
join with him in the Ordination and laying on of hands. This being an apparent
^^uth, I shall hence from the Bishops own principles prove Presbyters Superior
and greater then Bishops, in jurisdiction dignity and deg^ee.

These, say they, to whom the power of Ordination belongs of Right are ^^eater
in jurisdiction, dignity, ^^d degree then those who have not this power, and
the Ordainer higher in all these then the ordained,

But the power of Ordination belongs only jure divino to ^resbyters as
presbyters, not to Bishops, as to Bishops themselves, not, as Bishops, but
Presbyters and Bishops when they ordain in a lawful manner, do it only as
Presbyters not as Bishops.

Therefore Presbyters are Superior to Bishops in jurisdiction, Order, and
degree, and Bishops themselves ^arre greater in all these^ as they a^e
Presbyters, an office of divine ^^nction, then as they are Lordly Prelates or
Diocesan Bishops, a mere humane institution.

Thus are our great Lord Bishops who vaunt of the weakness of puri^^ne
principles, whereas their Episcopal are far more feeble and absur^, wounded
to death with their own weapons, and all their Domi^eering, swelling authority
overthrown by that very principle, and foundation on which they have presumed
to erect it, the ancient proverb being here truly verified, vis ^^nsilij
^^p^rs ^ol^ ruit s^^. I shall close ^p this with the words of acute A^t^^ius
S^d^^l, who after a large proof of Bi^^ops and presbyter^ to be both ^ne and
the same by divine institution, winds up all in this m^nner. We couclude
therefore, seeing that Superior Episcopal dignity is to be avouched only
humane institution, Tantum ess^ h^m^ni iuris, that it is only of hum^ne right:
On the contrary, since it is evident by the express^ testimonies of Scripture,
that in the Apostles times Bishops were the same with Presbyters jur^ diuin^
p^t^st^t^^ ordinandi no^ minus presbyt^ri^ qu^m Episc^pis convenir^, that by
God^ law and divine right, the power of Ordination belongs as much to
pre^biters as to Bishops.

I have now, I hop^ sufficiently ma^ifested our Lordly prelates, Arch-^ishops,
Dioces^n Bishops, distinct from presbyters to be none of Gods institution being
therefore: none of Gods Bishop^, as they vainly pretend whose then must they
be, not the kings^ for th^n they are only Iur^ human^ which they have
publicly ^^s^l^imed i^ Court^ therefore certainly either the Popes or the
^evils or both, as many of the recited writers style the^, for I know no other
that can claim or own them: wherefore being neither Gods nor the Kings, but the
Pope^ or Devills^ or both^ what remains but that now at last they should be
sp^red out of our Church^ as no members at all of Christ's Church, or body^ but
of the Devil, Pope, or Antichrist of Rome (whose limbs and creatures in truth
they are as Mauritius d^ D^ Pra^^ll^nti^ Episcopal^^ dignitatis l, ^. ^, 1,

Church or congregation, as all other Christians are beside^ themselves. I read
in the Magnum chro^ B^lgicum A^^^ 1433, p. 374.
great Dutch Chronicle written by an Augustin^ Friar, that in the year of our
Lord 1033, beyond Poland there was a strange Fis^ taken, of the quantity,
length, and breadth, and shape of a living man, adorned with a Bishop^ Miter^ a
pastoral Staff, a Cassock, a white Surplesse, a Chessible Sandals^ Gloves^ and
all oaths Robes^ and ornaments requisite to the Dignity of ^ Prelate, like a
Bishop solemnly attired and prepared to say divine Service^ his Cassocke might
be well lifted up before, and behind, from the feet, to the knees, but not
higher^ and he permitted himself to be sufficiently ^andled, and touched by
many^ but especi^lly of the Bishops of that Country^ which Fish being presented
to the King, and demanded in the Language of that Country^ and of diverse other^
nations who he was, and answering nothing, albeit he had opened hi^ mouth,
giving reverence and hono^r to the Bishop^ that were there in the Kings
presence, one Monster and dumb unpreaching beast^ saluting and respecting
another, the King being a^gry when he had determined to commit him to priso^^
or shut him up i^ so^e strong tow^r, the Fis^ being very sorrowful at this
news, thereupon closed his eyes and would by no means open them until the
Bishops, of that Kingdom ( One Monster ininterceeds for another safety, but
^id they ever so for a good pious christians life or liberty?
kneeling down before the king in the fish^s presence, had with many prayers
entreated and obtained of the King that he should be sent back again alive to
the Seashore^ where he had been taken^ that God whose works are
incomprehensible might show his nature and Acts, least otherwise a plague
should there ensue, both to the King and his Subjects, which their suit the
King had no sooner granted, but presently the ^oresaid Monster opened his eyes,
giving great thanks as it were to the King, and especially to those Bishops.

After with a Chariot being prepared to carry the Fish back again, the Fish
in presence of an infinite multitude (of both sexes) ascending into it in a
decent manner with the said Bishops, ^ate down between them like ^ Domestical
tame creature endued with reason.

The Bishops whiles they were yet f^rre off from the Sea, descended out of the
Chariot, and the Fish like^^se ^omming down from the chariot by himself,
stood upon his feet and began to walk between two Bishops, putting one of his
hands upon one Bishops shoulder^ and the other upon the other Bishops ^houlder,
(so lovingly ^id these Monsters embrace on the other) as if he had been^ a
reasonable creature, neither wondered he or was he moved with the tumult of the
people^ who flocked round about the^, but walked modestly.

When he was come to the Seashore he courteously beheld the Bi^hops and rout
of people there present and craving leave to depart of the Bishops with all
humility, by the gesture of hi^ body, and obtaining it he thereupon went into
the Seawater.

And going into the Water, on his feet as high as his belly (the Se^ being hard
^y to deep for him to wade in^ turning himsel^e toward the Bishops, and people
expending the end of this matter he bowed down his head in a most humble
manner^ bestowing a blessing on them with his right hand in form of ^ crosse^
and fo^thwith descended into the depth of the Sea after which he was no more
seen of any man.

Thus the Historian ve^batim.

Now what should I make this strange dumb Devil or Monster, in the shape, the
habit and attire of a Lordly Bishop, so courteous loving, and ^^miliar toward
these Lordly Bis^ops^ and they re^iprocally thus to him, or what does or could
all this pretend But that Lordly Prelates with their pontificiall Masse-array,
and muming disguises are mere monsters in Gods Church, and for the most part
as mute as thi^ dumb or other fishes in the Pulpit opening their mouths wide
oft-times, to bite, yea devour their fellow Brethren, and God^ faith^ull
people with their teeth like so many ravening wol^es or Sea Monsters, but
seldom or never piously to instruct the^ with their diligent, pious, gracious
preaching tongues, and that therefore they shall one day and I hope that day is
now at hand,) with all their Antichristian Pomp, Pride, Vestments, Trinkets,
and masking massing disguised, be eternally cast out of the Church of God, sent
back again to (the Sea of Rome) from whence they came, and there so utterly
drowned, that they shall never be seen nor heard of more in our or any other
true Christian Church.

This has been already fulfilled, not long after the appa^ition of this
Monster in Chri^^au^ chron, Saxo^i^ l. 11, p 33^, ^40, ^41, l, 14, and 15, p,
412, 43^, 4^4, 4^5,
Denmark, and most of the reformed Churches beyond ^he Seas, which cast out
their Lordly Prelates, as mere Antichristian, dumb, mishappen, ravenous
Monster,, devouring Christ's dear flock, and likewise in Biscaie among the
Papists Peter Heyl^ns Geography. Edit. 3, p. 55.
where Bi^hops a^e so execrable, to the people, that they will admit no Bishop
so much as to come among, them or enter into their Territories, (such terrible
mons^ers are they) insomuch that when Ferdinand the catholicie came in
Progress thither accompanied among others^ with the Bishop of Pamp^line, the
people ar^se in Arms, drove back the Bishop and gathering all the dust which
they thought he had trodden on^ and ^lung it unto the Sea.

And certainly their late intolerable ty^anny, pride, amb^tion, cruelty,
oppression, cove^uous^es, Popery, secularity (for now they are altogether
secula^, not spiritual Lords, injustice malice, persecutions, impieties, and
monstrous prophannes, have deservedly made our Bishops as detestable as
execrable to all sorts of English men (who now groan and languish under these
outrageous dumb silencing and silent Monsters,) as ever ^hey were, or are to
Bis^ane^s, so as we shall doubtless shortly see their fatal final ruin who
now seek nothing but the utter overthrow both of our Church, our State, and
our Religion, as I will make good, at my uttermost peril, to all their faces,
and prove it to their shame.

We know, that two of their Cathedrals, Ely and Chichester, where Bishop White
and Mountague, two late Innovaters and Champions of the Prelates, Lord it, were
lately s^attered and much of them blown down, and that the Bishop of Lincolnes
chair with the fall of his study of Bugden shattered all to pieces, with a
poor despicable instrument a sudden unexspected blast^ of wind, all in one
day on November. 4 1636.

What is this and their present great wrath, and malice against Gods people:
but a certain prognosticke, that Rev, 12, 12.
their time and Lording tyranny is short, and their total final ruin near at
hand, though to carnal reason it seems impossible: and that a sudden
unexpected puff of wind, (even the prayers, c^ie^, and tears, of those many
Godly Ministers, and poor christians they have lately si^enced, persecuted,
oppressed, and still proceed to vex and greiue with all despite and cruelty,
not withstanding all God^ plagues, all late discoveries of their vileness,
tyranny and injus^ice, shall shortly and suddenly overturn their Lordly
Chaires, throw down their Epicureous Sees, Dismount their mushrom Lordships,
unexspectedly sprung out of the earth, the dunghill, and swollen so great with
pride and ambition, that they will be all head, yea heads and Lords over all
in Church and State affairs, and dash ( Psalm. 137.^.9.
, these Babilonish brats of Rome in pieces so as they shall never recover or
get head again.

In the mea^e time I shall pray and conclude all in the words of our English
Letany^

From all our Lordly Prelates evil and mischief, from the crafts and assaults
of the Devil, (who rules and works both in and by them) from their wrath and
unjust damnations, in any of their courts and High^commissions, mere Spanish
inquisitions,) from all their blindness of heart, their pride vain glory^ and
Hypocrisy, their envy hatred, malice, and all their uncharitableness, from
all their sedition and privy conspiracy (with Rome Priests Jesuits and
between themselves^ to ruin, and root out our faithful preaching Ministers
and Religion, and set up popery) from al their false doctrine and Heresie^
(both in Press and Pulpit,) from their hardness of heart, against their poor
persecuted and oppressed Brethren, against all Gods mercies, threatenings,
Judgments, and Plague^ of late inflicted) and from all their contempt of Gods
word and commandements^ in suppressing the frequent Preachers, and preaching of
the one, and most insolent violation of the other, especially the 2, 4, 6th
Command^men^s, by setting up Altars, images, crucifixes, crosses etc, and
bowing down unto them, by idolizing their own canons^ ceremonies, an^ Romish
Fopperies, by maintaining the open profanation of Gods holy Sabbath, with all
Heathenish sports and pastimes^ and spurring men on headlong to this sin, and
starving, murdering the very souls of thousands of Gods people, by robbing
them of their ^pirituall ^ood, and encouraging them to al sin and
dissolutenes.) Psalm. 10^, 4^,^
Good Lord deliver us And le^ all the people say Amen.
