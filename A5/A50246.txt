A CATECHISM OR, The Grounds and Principles of Christian Religion, set forth
by way of Question and Answer.

Wherein the sum of the Doctrine of Religion is comprised, familiarly opened,
and clearly confirmed from the Holy Scriptures.

By RICHARD MATHER, Teacher to the Church at Dorchester in New England.

Hold fast the form of sound words which thou have heard of me in faith and
love, which is in Christ Jesus. 2 Timothy 1. 13.

When for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one teach you
again the first principles of the Oracles of God, and are become such as have
need of Milk, and not of strong meat. Heb. 5. 12.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
THe public Catechizing of Children by way of familiar Dialogue in short and
plain Questions and Answers, though it be scrupled by some, as if it wanted
Scripture warrant: yet such as acknowledge children to be members of Christ's
Kingdom and Church, (as all but Antipaedobaptists do) Mar. 10. 14. they
cannot deny, that (being members of Christ's house) the Stewards of his house
must (in faithfulness to Christ, and them) dispense a portion of Spiritual
food to them in due season, Luke 12. 42. And evident it is by daily experience
that long Discourses (Sermon-wise) run over Childrens heads (like water over
a Mill, that grinds no meal at all) and pass their capacity. No way of
instruction is so proper for them, as that which the Prophet describes as most
suitable to the understanding of children, line upon line, here a little and
there a little (Isai 28. 9, 10.) which can no way so conveniently be dispensed,
as in brief and familiar questions and answers put into their mouths.

But as this way of short and familiar catechizing is the fittest portion of
young childrens bread: so there is a larger Doctrine of Catechism, containing
the whole body of Divinity, which being solidly compacted together, and
evidently confirmed from Scripture light, and familiarly delivered to the
apprehensions of Gods people, it will be a seasonable portion for children of
riper age: not only for their further building up in the faith and obedience of
the doctrine of the Gospel: but also for their establishment in the truth, that
they be not plucked away with the error of the wicked. Hence Luther had his
major as well as his minor Catechismus: and Beza his larger confession of the
Faith as well as his shorter. Yea the Apostle Paul (whose example was now
precedentiall, as being indeed Authentical and binding to imitation) he
committed to Timothy a platform of sound and wholesome words, in Faith and love:
which he commanded and charged him, not only to hold fast himself, 2 Timothy 1.
13. but likewise to commit the same to faithful men, who might be able to
teach others also, 2 Timothy 2. 2. This charge, as it then was (and always will
be) weighty, and seasonable: So never more important and necessary, then in
this capritious and fastidious age, when men will nor suffer wholesome doctrine,
but having itching ears and wits, do turn away their hearts from the truth,
and are given up to such empty and windy notions, wherein it is hard to judge
whether Arrogance or ignorance be the more predominent: arrogance of higher
attainements in Christ, or ignorance of the true Christ, and of life in him.

Now for casting in some help, (by the grace of Christ) to prevent the
spreading of such a gangrene of vanity and apostasy; and to establish the
people of God in the truth of the Doctrine which is according to godliness:
Our reverend brother (according to the precious Talent of wisdom, and found
judgment given unto him, etc. out of his faithful love to the flock of
Christ) he has compiled this ensuing platform of wholesome Doctrine, in way of
a larger Catechism: wherein you shall find the sum of the Doctrine of
Christian Religion, with pithy solidity and orderly dexterity digested
together; and with clear evidence of truth confirmed from the holy Scriptures:
and both with such familiar plainness of savory language, as (by the blessing
of Christ) the simple-honest-hearted Reader may be informed and established in
the highest truths, and the most intelligent may be refreshed and comforted, in
revising and recounting the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which they have
received and embraced, and the grounds upon which they have believed; and all
may be led on in the constant profession and practice of the faith and love
which is in Christ Jesus.

So we commend this ensuing Treatise to the diligent perusal of the Christian
Reader; and both it and thee to the rich blessing of the grace of Christ, and
rest

Thine to serve in the faith and love of the Gospel, JOHN COTTON. JOHN WILSON.

THE Grounds and Principles of Christian Religion.
CHAP. I. Of Catechizing as an Introduction to that which follows.
Quest. WHat is Catechizing?
Ans. An instructing of the people in the grounds, or principles, or
fundamental points of Religion.

Q. How are these Catechisticall, and fundamental points called in the holy
Scripture?
A. They are called thge foundation Heb. 6. 2.
, the first principles of the Oracles of God Heb. 5. 12.
, the beginning of the doctrine of Christ, Heb. 6. 1.
the entrance into Gods word, Ps. 119. 130.
milk for babes, Heb. 5. 12, 13. 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.
and the form of wholesome words 2 Timothy 1. 13.
.

Q. How may the warrantablenesse of this kind of teaching appear?
A. Both by express testimony of Scripture Heb. 5. 12, 23. and 6. 1, 2. 1 Cor.
3. 1, 2.
, and because Catechizing is nothing else but the drawing of the doctrine of
Religion into brief sums; and this has plentiful warrant in the word
Eccles. 12. 13. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. Matthew. 22. 37, 38, 39, 40. 2 Timothy 1. 13. Mat. 6. 9.
.

Q. What need is there of this kind of teaching?
A. The doctrine of Catechism being milk for babes, and the laying of the
foundation, there cannot but be great need thereof; for all men know the
foundation must be laid before there can be any building; and babes must have
milk before they be fed with stronger meat.

Q. What is the benefit of catechizing?
A. It is a means of well grounded knowledge, Psa. 119. 130.
and of profiting by Sermons; the want whereof being an hinderance that men
cannot profit by other higher points of doctrine Heb. 5. 12, 13.
.

Q. What else may be the benefit thereof?
A. It is a means to prevent apostasy Prove. 22. 6.
and the infection of error, which they that are ignorant and unstable are apt
to be seduced withal 2 Pet. 2. 14. and 3. 16.
.

Q. Do you then think that the doctrine of catechism is wholesome and useful
to the souls of Gods people?
A. As common and ordinary meats are most wholesome to the body, more then
curious and dainty dishes: so the doctrine of Catechism is specially wholesome
to the soul, and therefore is expressly called the form of wholesome words 2 Timothy 1. 13.
.

Q. How should the doctrine of catechism be handled?
A. Briefly, many things being contracted into narrow sums, for the helping
of memory Eccles. 12. 13. Heb. 8. 1. Deuteronomy. 4. 13. Matthew. 22. 40. and 6 9, 10.
etc.
, and yet plainly Heb. 5. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 2. Mar. 4. 33. 1 Cor. 14. 19.
, as may be for the understanding of the simple.

Q. What are we to think of that usual way of catechizing by questions and
answers?
A. This way of teaching has plentiful warrant in the Scriptures Luke 2. 47.
Act. 2. 38. 1 Pet. 3. 15.
, and is suitable to the notation, and signifitation of the word Catechizing,
which is taken from that return or answer which is given in an Echo

Q. Who are to be catechized?
A. All that have need thereof, as being not well instructed in these points;
and therefore little children Prove. 22. 6. Deuteronomy. 4 9, 10. Psa. 78. 5, 6. and
34. 11. Mat. 21. 15, 16. Luke 2. 47. Ephesians. 6. 4.
are to be catechized as soon as they shall be able to learn, and others also
that are ignorant Heb. 5. 12, 13 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2.
or children in understanding.

Q. But is it not a shame for persons of years to be catechized?
A. It is a shame, and justly reproveable as a sin, when persons grown to
years are so ignorant as to have need to be catechized. Heb. 5. 5. 12, 13. 1
Cor. 15. 34.

Q. But how if they be not willing to be catechized?
A. It is much more a sin and shame, if being ignorant they refuse to have
their ignorance helped by being instructed, Psalm. 58. 5. Prove. 17, 22. and 13.
18. and 15. 32.

Q. But is it not indeed a reproach and shame unto a man to be catechized?
A. It is so far from being a shame, that indeed it is the duty of all to be
willing to learn Prove. 4 13. and 8. 32, 33. and 23 12, 23.
, and therefore not a shame unto any; but the commendation of every one that is
so willing Prove. 1. 5. and 10. 17. and 12. 1. Job 34. 32. Act. 18. 26.


CHAP. 2. Of the holy Scriptures.
Q. YOu have showed that to be instructed in the principles of Religion, is
both warrantable, needful, and profitable; tell likewise whence we must take
direction for attaining wel-grounded knowledge in these principles, and all
other points of Religion?
A. Out of those sacred books or writings, which are called the holy Scriptures.

Q. Has the word and will of God always been set down in writing?
A. No: Moses was the first Penman of holy Scripture, who Iived not till above
two thousand years after the creation.

Q. How was the will of God made known to his people in those times before the
Scriptures were written?
A. By diverse and sundry means Heb. 1. 1.
, as by visions Number. 12. 6, 8.
, by dreams Job 33. 14, 15. Genesis 40. 8.
, by visible signs Genesis 32. 24. Exodus 13. 21.
, and by audible voice Genesis 22. 15. Exodus 20. 2.
.

Q. Why did God afterward cause his will to be set down in writing?
A. That it might be the better preserved Is. 30. 8.
, that it might be conveyed to posterity Deuteronomy. 31. 9. Psa. 102. 18
, and that it might be an infallible standard to try all doctrines by Isa. 8.
20. 2 Pet. 1. 19.
.

Q. What are the books of holy Scriptures?
A. The books of the Old Testament 2 Cor. 3. 14.
as they are expressed in our Bibles.

Q. Why are these writings called holy?
A. They are called holy 2 Timothy 3. 15. Romans 1. 2.
because they have an holy Author, which is God Act. 1. 16. and 4. 25.
, were written by Penmen who were holy men Luke 13. 28. 2 Pet. 1. 21.
, and because the doctrine which is contained in them is all for the promoting
of holiness in us Tit. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 6. 3. 2 Timothy 3. 17.
.

Q. How may it he proved that these Books are indeed the word of God?
A. Because it is said they were given by inspiration of God 2 Timothy 3. 16. p 2
Pet. 1. 21.
, and that the Penmen of them spoke as they were moved, or acted by the holy
Ghost p.

Q. How elseb
A. By the wonderful efficacy of them, as in other things, so in this, that
they enter into the heart, for conviction, and humiliation Heb. 4. 12. 1 Cor.
14. 25. 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.
, and are mighty through God to convert and comfort the soul Psalm. 19. 8, etc.
and 119 93, 103.
.

Q. How else may it be proved that the Scriptures are the word of God?
A. Because they must either be the word of God, and have him for the Author of
them, or else some creature must be the author of them; which latter is not
possible.

Q. It is true indeed, if no creature be the author of them, then God the
creator must; but why may not some creature be their author?
A. A good creature, Angel or man, could never be so impious, presumptuous, and
blasphemous, as to father his own doings upon God, falsely making him the Author
of them; and a wicked creature would never show such care and zeal for the
glory of God, such dislike and detestation of all kind of sin, as the book of
the Scriptures does.

Q. What particular uses are the Scriptures profitable for?
A. For the teaching of true doctrine, and convincing the contrary, for
correction or reformation of errors in life, and for instructing unto good
duties, 2 Timothy 3. 16.

Q. Are the Scriptures a complete and sufficient rule of direction for all
points of faith and life?
A. Yea; for they were written for that very end, that we might believe on
Christ Jesus, and believing have eternal life through his name John 20. 31.
: and they are able to make one wise unto salvation through the faith which is
in Christ Jesus 2 Timothy 3. 15.


Q. How else may this sufficiency and perfection of the Scriptures appear?
A. It may appear also by this, in that by the Scriptures, the man of God, who
needs more abilities then other men, may be perfect, and thoroughly furnished
unto all good works 2 Timothy 3. 17.
; and because it is a cursed thing to add any thing thereto Gal. 1. 8, 9.
Revel. 22. 18.
.

Q. Does the knowledge of the Scriptures belong unto all, or only to the
Learned?
A. Not only Magistrates Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19. Josh. 1. 8.
and Ministers 2 Timothy 3. 17. 1 Timothy 4. 13.
, but every householder Deuteronomy. 6. 7.
, yea simple people Ps. 19. 7. and Prove. 1. 4.
; yea women Acts 18. 26. 2 Ioh. 1.
, young men Psa. 119. 9.
, and children 2 Timothy 3. 15
, ought to be acquainted with the Scriptures; and therefore the knowledge of
them does belong unto all sorts of people.

CHAP. 3. Of God.
Q. YOu have showed that the means of well grounded knowledge is the holy
Scripture; tell me now what it is that the Scriptures do especially teach us?
A. They teach us especially the saving knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ.
John 17. 3. Col. 2. 2, 3.


Q. How may it be proved that there is a God?
A. The Scriptures do abundantly, and plainly testify it Exodus 20. 3. Isa.
42. 8. Heb. 11. 5. John 17. 3.
; and the creation of the world does show it Romans 1. 20. Psalm. 9. 1. Job 12. 7,
8, etc.
.

Q. How does the creation of the world show that there is a God?
A. Even as a fair and sumptuous building does show that some body was the
maker of it, so this great world does show there was a maker of it which is
God. Heb. 3. 4.

Q. But why might not the world be without beginning and have its being of it
self?
A. Because then the world should be God, for that which has its being of its
self, and is without beginning, is God.

Q. How else may it be proved that there is a God?
A. The succession of day, and night, and other seasons with the sustentation,
and ordering of the Creatures and the motions of them, does plainly witness
that there is a God. Psalm. 19. 2. 3. Acts. 14. 17. Amos. 4 13. and 5. 8.

Q. How may this be expressed in some familiar comparison.
A. When a ship is seen at Sea with her Sails spread, and her passage rightly
guided unto the harbor, it appears thereby, that there were men that guided
the same; for if there were no men, there would never be any ships upon the
Sea: Even so the preservation of the great ship of the world, and the guidance
of its motions, does evidently show, that there is a God by whom the same is
preserved, and guided.

Q. What else may be a further proof that there is a God?
A. That there is a God is manifestly declared by the strange and wonderful
plagues and judgments, that sometimes are inflicted upon notorious sinners upon
earth. Exodus 8. 19. and 9. 16. Psalm. 9. 16. and 58. 10. 11: and 79 10.

Q. What may be thought of those accusations, and terrors of conscience, that
sometimes are found in men, upon the committing of heinous sins, though known
to no man living, but to the sinner himself?
A. This also is another testimony that there is a God, before whose judgment
seat a man must answer for his deeds; for otherwise why should a man be
afraid where no fear is? Romans 2. 15. Isa. 33. 14. Psalm. 14. 5. and 53. 5.

Q. How many Gods are there?
A. No more but one. Deuteronomy 4. 39, and 6. 4. Isa 44. 6. 8. and 45. 5. 18. 1 Cor
8. 4. 6. Ephesians. 4. 6.

Q. Why may there not be more Gods then one?
A. Because that is contrary to the nature of God which is to be infinite, and
everlasting, that is the first, and the last; now there cannot be many
infinites, nor many firsts and lasts, but one only.

Q. How else does the nature of God show that there can be no more but one God?
A. It is the nature of God to have his being of himself, and so give being to
whatsoever else has being; for so much is signified by the word Jehovah. Exodus
3. 14. and 6. 3. and 15. 3.

Q. And how does this prove that there can be no more but one God?
A. Because if there were many Gods, then either they must one give being to
the other, or each one have his being of himself, both which are utterly
impossible.

Q. Why might not one of them give being to the other?
A. Because then that other could not be God, as not having his being of
himself.

Q. And why might they not be many Gods, each one having his Godhead of
himself?
A. Because then none of them could be God, as not giving being to all others
which had being.

Q. Though there be but one God, yet is there not more persons, or subsistences
in the Godhead then one?
A. Yes; the Scriptures do apparently witness that in the unity of the divine
essence, there is a plurality of the divine persons. Genesis 1. 26. and 3. 22. and
11. 7. Isai. 6. 8. and 41. 22, 23.

Q. How many are the Persons in the Godhead?
A. They are three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Math. 3. 16, 17.
and 28. 19. Ioh. 14. 16, 17. and 15. 26. 2 Cor. 13, 14. Gal. 4. 6. 1 Ioh. 5. 7.

Q. Whether are these three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost several,
and distinct Persons, or only several names, and titles of one, and the same
person.
A. The Father is not the Son but another person; Ioh. 5. 32. and 8. 16, 17,
18.
the Son is not the Father, but another; Ioh. 1. 1. 1 Ioh. 2. 1. Phil. 2. 6.
and the Holy Ghost is neither the Father nor the Son, but another; Ioh. 14.
16. and 15. 26. Is. 48. 16.
and therefore they are each distinct from other as several, and distinct
Persons.

Q. What are the personal properties, whereby each is distinguished from other?
A. The property of the Father is to beget the Son Ps. 2. 7. Ioh. 3. 16.
, the property of the Son to be begotten of the Father Ioh. 1. 18. Heb. 1. 13.
, the property of the Holy Ghost to proceed from the Father and the Son Ioh.
15. 16.
, who is therefore called the spirit of the Father Matthew. 10. 20.
, and of the Son Gal. 4. 6. Romans 8. 9.
,

Q. Are every one of these persons God?
A. Yea: Of the Father there is less question, and the Scriptures do witness
that the Son is God Col. 29. Isa. 9. 9. Ioh. 1. 1 Romans 9. 5. Prove. 8. 22. etc.
Ioh. 17. 5. Col. 1. 16.
, and also that the Holy Ghost is God Acts 5. 3. 4. and 28. 25. with Is. 6. 9.
1 Cor. 6. 19. with 2 Cor. 6. 16. Job. 33. 4. 1 Cor. 2. 10.
,

Q. You have showed that there is a God, and and only one God, and three
persons; tell me now what God is?
A. God is so infinite, and incomprehensible, that no creature is able fully to
comprehend or know him. Exodus 33. 20. 23. Job. 26. 14. and 11. 7, 8, 9. 1 Timothy
6. 16.

Q. How then may we conceive of him?
A. As he has revealed himself to us Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
, in his back parts Exodus 33. 23.
, which are his divine attributes Exodus 34. 6, 7.
, and by his works Psalm. 19. 1. and 8. 1. Job. 36. 24. etc. and 37. 1. 2. etc.
,

Q. What are those Attributes or back parts of God?
A. Wisdom Job. 12, 13. Romans 11. 33. and 16. 27.
Power, Genesis 17. 1. and 18. 14. Matthew. 19. 26. Psalm. 115. 3.
Goodness Matthew. 19. 17. Psalm. 119. 68.
, Truth Psalm. 108. 4. Romans 3, 4. Tit. 1. 2.
, Justice Psalm. 92. last. Zeph. 3. 5. Romans 9. 14. Job. 8. 3. and 34. 10. and
36. 23.
, Mercy Psalm. 103. 11. Iam. 5. 11.
, and the like, in all which he is infinite 1 Kings 8. 27. Isa. 66. 1. Ier. 23.
24. Psalm. 139. 7, etc.
, and everlasting Ps. 90. 2. and 93, 3. and 102. 26, 27.
.

Q. What are the works of God?
A. They are three, Decree, Creation, and Providence.

CHAP. 4. Of Gods Decree.
Q. WHat is Gods Decree?
A. That whereby he has before determined and decreed with himself whatsoever
shall come to pass.

Q. Do you say that Gods decree reaches to all things whatsoever comes to
pass in time?
A. Yea all things whatsoever have been, are, or that shall be hereafter, were
before decreed, and determined by God. Ephesians. 1. 11. Act. 15. 18.

Q. What are some of the principal things that are so decreed?
A. Things that are most casual Exodus 21. 13. Prove. 16. 33.
things that are most freely done by the creature, Prove. 21. 1. Ps. 33. 15.
and things wherein the creature commits abundance of sin Act. 2. 28. and 4. 28.
,

Q. What else?
A. Such things as seem small and little Matthew. 20. 29. 30.
, are also great, and special events.

Q. What are some of those great and special events that are decreed by the
Lord?
A. The coming and death of Christ, and all the works of his mediatorship 1
Pet 1. 20. Rev. 13. 18.
, the salvation of the Godly Ephesians. 1. 4. 2 Timothy 1. 9. 1 These. 5 9.
, the damnation of the wicked Iud. 4. Romans 9. 22.
, the day of every man's particular death Job. 14. 5. 14.
and the day of the general judgment Act. 17. 31.
,

Q. When were all these things decreed by God?
A. Before the world was created, even from everlasting, 1 Cor. 2. 7. Ephesians. 1.
4. and 3. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 20. 2 Timothy 1. 9.

Q. What was the cause of Gods decrees?
A. The cause that moved him to decree was nothing foreseen in the creature,
but his own will, and good pleasure. Romans 9. 11. 18. Matthew. 11. 25. 26.

But since some are appointed by the decree of God to damnation, if his will be
the cause of that decree, how is that just?

Yea, it is most just and righteous notwitstanding, Romans 13, 14.

Q. How may that appear.
A. Because the will of God is the rule of all righteousness Ephesians. 1. 11. Psalm.
115. 3. and 135. 6.
, and because the Lord has absolute power over all creatures, as the Potter
has power over his clay Romans 9. 19, 20.
.

Q How else may the justice of the Lord in his decrees appear?
A. Because what ever be the Lords decree, there is no man actually condemned
till he be first defiled with sin. Romans 3. 9, 19. and 2. 6, 9. Genes. 4. 7.

Q. Whether is the decree of God certain, and immutable, or such as may be
changed, and not take effect?
A. It is altogether unchangeable, and shall surely be accomplished, Psalm. 33.
11. and 135. 6. Isa. 46. 10. and 14. 27. Romans 9. 11.

Q. If the decree of God be unchangeable, then what needs man to be careful in
the use of means for his own good?
A. Yes, the means must be used notwithstanding God decree; and that partly
because the means are appointed, and decreed of God as well as the end Acts
27. 24. Ephesians. 1. 4. 2 These. 2. 13. Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
; and partly because the revealed will and command of God is our rule, and not
his secret decree n.

Q. Do you think then that Gods decree does not excuse men from blame in the
sins which they do commit.
A. It does not excuse them at all Luke 22. 22. Mat. 18. 7.
, and the reason is because the decree of God infuseth no Corruption into the
hearts of men, not constrains them to sin against their will, but they
sin most freely, and willing of their own accord.

Q Is the decree of God secret within himself or revealed and made known?
A. It is secret within himself, till himself do reveal it, and therefore
further then so it is not to be searched into. Romans 11. 33. 34 1 Cor. 2^ 16.
Deuteronomy. 29. 29.

Q. How does God reveal his decree?
A. Partly by his word, wherein this doctrine is plainly, and plentifully
taught Romans 9. 11, etc. Ephesians. 1. 4, 5, 11. Math. 25. 34, 41, Luke 10 20.
, and partly by the execution and accomplishment of things in time.

Q. How does the execution or accomplishment of things reveal Gods decree?
A. Yea very clearly, because nothing was decreed but he executes the same in
time; and whatsoever is brought to pass in time was determined and decreed
before: Ephesians. 1. 11. Psalm. 135. 6. Isa. 46. 10.

Q. How many ways may the decree of God be considered?
A. As respecting all the creatures in general, or as it respects the
reasonable Creatures, Angels and men, in special.

Q. What are the parts of Gods decree as it respects man?
A. Election and reprobation.

Q. What is Election?
A. It is the decree of God or his predestination Ephesians. 1. 5. 11. Romans 8. 29.
whereby of his own free love Romans 9. 3. Ier. 31. 3.
and good pleasure Ephesians. 1. 5. Romans 9. 15. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
he has from everlasting Ephesians. 1. 4. Ier. 31. 3.
appointed and chosen some certain men 2 Timothy 2. 19. Act. 13. 48.

Q. And what is reprobation?
A. It is the decree of God whereby of his mere will and good pleasure Romans 9.

some certain men Jude. 4.
are not elected and ordained to life Mat. 7. 23. Rev. 13. 8. and 17. 8.
, but on the on the contrary are appointed to destruction or damnation Jude. 4.

to be inflicted upon them for their sin Romans 3. 9, 19.
, to the praise of Gods glorious justice 9. 17, 22.
,

CHAP. 5. Of Creation.
Q. HAd this world a beginning by Creation, or was it from everlasting?
A. The scripture in many places, and speci* in the first of Genesis does declare
that the World was not from everlasting, but had a beginning by the Lords
creating of it, Heb. 11. 3. Reu. 4. 11. Prove. 8. 22. etc. Ps. 90. 2. Ephesians. 1. 4.

Q. Who was it that created the world?
A. God that is without beginning, and has his being of himself, he it was
who gave beginning, and being to the world. Genesis 1. 1. Act. 17. 24. Isay. 40.
28. and 44. 24.

Q. Whether was this the work of the Father, or of the Son, or of the
Holyghost?
A. Of every person in the trinity; not of the father only but also of the
son Ioh. 1. 3. 10. Col. 1. 16.
, and of the Holyghost Job 26. 13 and 33. 4.
.

Q. What are the things that are created?
A. All things without exception, that have a being, except God only who did
create them, Act. 4. 24. and 17. 24. and 14, 15. Genesis 2. 1. Rev. 4. 11.

Q. Do you mean that the third heaven was also created by God?
A. Yes, for that heaven is said to be a city whose builder, and maker is God,
Heb. 11. 10. 16.

Q. But what think you of the Angels, were they also created by God?
A. Angels are the chief of those invisible things, those thrones and
Dominions, Principalities, and powers, which are expressly mentioned to have
been created by the Lord. Col. 1. 16.

Q. Wherewith did God make the world?
A. Though men must have tools, and instruments, and sometimes more hands then
their own for the effecting of works; yet when the Lord made the world, with
him it was not so.

Q. How then or wherewith did he make it?
A. He made it himself alone Isa. 44. 25. Job. 9. 8.
, and without any other means but only by his word Genesis 1. 3. psalm. 33. 6. 9.
and 148. 5. Heb. 11. 3.
.

Q Whereof or of what materials did he create the world?
A. Not of any praeexistent matter, but of nothing Heb. 11. 3. Romans 4. 17.

Q. How do you mean when you say that all things are made of nothing? for the
body of Adam was made of the dust of the ground, and fishes of the waters, and
therefore it may seem all things were not made of nothing.
A. I mean that some things were made of nothing without any matter at all,
and that the first matter whereof other things were made, was not eternal, but
was immediately created of nothing; and that that first matter was so in*
disposed to be the things that were made of it, that no less a power was seen
in making other things out of it, then in making that first matter, or the
lump it self; as it was as great a work to bring great whales out of the
waters, as to bring forth the water out of nothing; and in these respects, all
things may be said to be made of nothing.

Q. In what time was the world created?
A. Every particular thing quickly, and as it were in an instant Psalm. 33. 9
, and the whole in the space of six days Genesis 1. Exodus 10 11.
.

Q. What was the work of Each day?
A. The work of the first day was Heaven, the dark and deep lump of earth,
and waters, and light.

Q. What of the second day?
A. The firmament which is called Heaven.

Q. What of the third day?
A. The gathering of the waters together, which is called Sea, the drying of
the earth, and making it fruitful.

Q. What of the three last days?
A. On the fourth day sun, moon, and stars, on the fifth day fish, and
foul, on the sixth day beasts and creeping things, and man.

Q. When was the highest heaven, and Angels created?
A. Most likely on the first day, Genesis 1. 1. Job. 38 7.

Q. Why was God six days in making the world?
A. Not because he needed so much time, but that we might more distinctly
consider of his works.

Q. Why did God make the world?
A. Not because he needed it, for he is alsufficient in and of himself, not
needing any thing, but giving into all life, and breath, and all things Act.
17. 25.

Q. Did he make it out of necessity of nature, ot because he could not choose?
A. No, for had he pleased, he might have made it sooner, or later, or not at
all.

Q. Why then did he make it?
A. Because it so pleased him, Revel. 4. 11.

Q. For what end did God make the World?
A. For the declaration of his own glory. Prove. 16. 4. Romans 11. 36. Col. 1. 16.

Q. What was the state of all things by creation?
A. God looked upon all the work which he had made, and behold it was very
good. Genesis 1. 31.

CHAP. 6. Of Gods providence.
Q. WHat is the Providence of God?
A. That whereby God does preserve, and govern, dispose, and order all
creatures with all their actions.

A. What scriptures do show that there is such a providence of God?
Q. Many, and namely these, Ioh. 5. 17. Ephesians. 1. 11. Act. 17. 25. 28. Lam. 3.
37: Eccles. 3. 1. 2 etc.

Q. How else may the same be proved?
A. Such is the wisedme, and knowledge of God, that nothing can come to pass,
but he must needs know it, and such is his omnipotency, that what he
absolutely would not have to be, he is able to hinder it, and therefore nothing
falls out but he sees it, and by his providence has an hand therein.

Q. What are the parts of Gods providence, or the several acts of it?
A. Preserving of the creatures Act. 17. 18. 1. Tim. 4. 10. Ps. 36. 6.
and government of them Psalm. 29. 10. and 103. 19.
.

Q. What need is there of the providence of God for the preservation of
creatures?
A. Yes very much, as well as of his power for the creating of them.

Q. How may that appear?
A. Not only because making, and preserving of the creatures, are Coupled
together as acts of the same power Neh. 9. 6.
. but also because otherwise the creatures could not continue in being, but
would soon return to nothing Ps. 104. 29.
.

Q. And why must the government of the creatures be also ascribed to God?
A. Partly because it would argue inperfection in God, if he should make
creatures, and leave the government of them to others; and partly because the
creatures would never certainly* attain the ends for which they were created,
if they were not governed by the same power by which they were created.

Q. What are the things whereto the providence of God does extend?
A. All things without exception of any. Romans 11. 36 Ephesians. 1 11.

Q. What are some sorts of them?
All persons, and all living things, though never so mean Psalm. 145. 15, 16.
and 104. 21. and 147. 9. Luke 12. 6.
, and all the very accidents, and Circumstances of actions, as the times, and
seasons of them Prove. 16. 1. 33. Ioh. 14. 5. Psalm. 31. 16. Ephesians. 1. 10. Ioh. 8.
20.
and the like.

Q. What kind of actions of the Creatures are ordered by the providence of God?
A. All kind of actions, whether they be great or small Dan. 4. 25, 32, Psa.
76. 12. Job. 12. 17, 18, 19, 20. Ps. 135. 7. and 113. 7, 9. Mat. 10. 29. Prove.
16. 1. 1. King. 20. 23.
, whether they be of kindness, and favor unto men, or of judgment and
correction Amos 3. 6. Isa. 45. 7. Lam. 3. 37, 38.
.

What else?
A. Actions that are most contingent, and casual Prove. 16. 1, 33. Exodus 21.
13. 1 King 22. 34.
, and actions wherein the creature is most sinful, and wicked Ezekiel. 14. 9.
Deuteronomy. 2. 30. Isa. 29, 9. 10. Genesis 45. 8. 2. Sam. 12. 11.
.

Q. How far forth has God an hand by his providence in the sinful actions
of creatures?
A. Partly by permitting sin to enter, when he could easily hinder the same,
if he pleased; and partly by disposing and ordering of it for good ends.

A. How does God permit the entrance of sin?
A. Partly by leaving men to themselves, not bestowing upon them his grace,
that might keep them from sin Deuteronomy. 29. 3, 4, 2 Chronicles. 32. Act. 14. 16.
, and partly by letting Satan loose upon them to be blinded, and misled by
his temptations 1. King. 22. 22, 23. 1 Samuel 16. 15. 16.
.

Q. How is this just that God should deny the assistance of his grace, and
leave men to themselves, and the temptations of Satan?
A Yes, it is very just, because he is debtor to none, but may bestow his grace
where, and upon whom he pleases. Romans 11. 35. Mat. 20. 15.

Q. What else may be said for the clearing of Gods justice herein?
A. God being the Judge of the world may punish sin with what punishment he
sees meet, and so by giving sinners up unto further sin, Ps. 8^. 11. 12.
Romans 1. 24, 25, 26. etc. 2 These 2. 11, 12.

Q What may be some instance of Gods disposing and ordering of sin for good
ends?
A. The sin of Joseph brethren when they sold him into Egypt, which God
disposed, and ordered for the preserving of Jacob and his house in time of
famine. Gen 45. 5. 7. and 50. 20.

Q What else?
A. The sin of Amnon, and Absalom which God disposed and ordered for the
Correction, and Humiliation of David. 2 Samuel 12. 10. 11, 12.

Q. What may be a third instance hereof?
A. The great sin, and wickedness of them who put the Lord Jesus Christ to
death, as foul a fact as the sun ever saw, and yet even this did the Lord
dispose, and order for the redemption and salvation of his elect, Act. 2. 23.
and 4. 27, 28.

Q. But if God by his providence have a stroke in ordering of the sins of
men, is not God himself then tainted with sin?
A. No, by no means: for God cannot be tempted of evil Iam. 1. 13.
, neither does any sin proceed from him 1. Ioh. 2. 18.
, but contrarily he is then holy, holy, holy, when he gives men up to be
hardened in their sins Isa. 6. 3, 9. 10.
.

Q. What else may be said for the further learning of this truth?
A. God is so far from being tainted hereby with the uncleanness of sin,
that his wisdom and goodness does hereby the more appear, in that he can
work good by evil instruments, and make even sin it self to seem to his
glory.

Q But whether may not sinners then hereby have excuse for themselves, and lay
the blame of their sin upon God?
A. If God did infuse corruption into the hearts of men, or incline them or
command them to sins who else were unwilling so to do, then there were more
color for this demand; but this cannot be affirmed with truth.

Q. What then is truth in this case?
A. God made man altogether righteous and upright Eccle. 7. 29,
, and gives men an holy commandment that prohibits all sin Genesis 2. 17. Romans
7. 12.
, and yet they sin of their own accord Eccles. 7. 29.
, and therefore their destruction (and so their sin as cause thereof) is of
themselves Hos. 13. 9.
.

Q. May not this be illustrated by some similitude, to show how God may have an
hand in the evil actions of men, and yet all the sinfulness of the action be
wholly of the creature and not of God?
A. As he that spurs a lame horse, is the cause of his going, but not of his
halting, which is from the beast himself; and as the sun shining on a
carcass, or a dunghill, is the cause of the savor, but not of the stench
which is from the carcass it self; even so it is in this case.

Q. How or in what manner does the providence of God put forth, and show it
self?
A. Most freely and as it pleases him Psalm. 115. 3. and 135. 6.
, most commonly in the ordinary use of the means 2 King. 14. 27. Hos. 2. 21, 22.
and sometimes it pleases him to work without means Deuteronomy. 9. 18. and 29. 5,
6. 1 King 19. 8, Isay. 37. 30.
.

Q. How else does the providence of God put forth and show itself?
A. Sometimes by working great and mighty works by weak means 1 Cor. 1. 26,
27. Judge. 7. 2, 3. 2 Chronicles. 24. 24. 2 Samuel 14, 7. Amos 5. 9. Ier. 37. 10,
, sometimes by disapppointing the best and the most probable means that they
become ineffectuall, Ps. 78. 9, 10. Eccles. 9. 13. Hos. 4. 10. Ps. 127. 1, 2, 3.
; and sometimes by working contrary to all means, and the natural course of
things Josh. 3. 15, 16. and 10. 13. and 2 King. 20. 10, 11. Dan. 3. 27. 2 King.
6. 6.
.

CHAP. 7. Of Angels.
Q. WHat are the Kinds of Gods providence?
A. It is either general toward all Creatures, or specially toward some.

Q. What are those special creatures which the providence of God does extend
unto?
A. Angels and men.

Q. What is the nature of Angels?
A. They are Spirits Ps. 104. 4. Heb. 1. 14. Luke 24. 39.
or spiritual substances, and therefore invisible that they cannot be seen
with bodily eyes, no more then the wind that blows, or the souls of men, nor
are they preserved by sleep and food, and raiment, as living bodies are Mat.
22. 30.
; and yet they are immortal, and cannot dye Luke 20. 36.
.

Q. What else are we to know concerning the nature of Angels?
A. That they are creatures of excellent strength Ps. 103. 20. 2 Pet. 2. 11.
, great acuteness of understanding 2 Samuel 14. 20. mat. 18. 10.
, very swift and speedy in their motion Isa. 6. 2. Ezekiel. 1. 6. Dan. 9. 21.
, and by creation very pure, and holy Genesis 1. 31. Luke 9. 26.
.

Q. What is the number of Angels?
A. Though they be not infinite, yet their number is very great, and to us they
are innumerable. Dan. 7. 10. Ps. 68. 17. Mat. 26. 53. Heb. 12. 22

Q. What end and office were they created for?
A. To celebrate the Lords praises, and to execute his commands Isa. 6. 2, 3.
Ps. 103. 20.
, specially toward the heirs of salvation Heb. 1. 14.
.

Q Do the Angels continue in that estate wherein they were first created?
A. Not all, for a great many fell away from that happy condition who are now
become devils, Ioh. 8. 44. 2. Pet. 2. 4. Jude 6.

Q. May the rest also fall away, and perish with the devils?
A. No, because they are elected of God, and so for ever upholden in that good
estate. 1 Timothy 5. 27.

CHAP. 8. Of the estate of man in Innocence by creation.
Q HOw does the providence of God exercise it self toward man?
A. In a fourefold estate; the state of Innocence by creation before the fall,
the state of Corruption by and fince the fall, the state of grace in this
world, and the state of Glory in the world to come.

Q What was the state of man in Innocence by by creation before the fall?
A. God did as it were deliberate with himself, the father son and spirit
consulting together about the making of man Genesis 1. 26.
, and therefore it must needs be that the state of man at the first by Gods
creating of him, was very excellent.

Q. Wherein did his chief excellency consist?
A. In that he was made in the Iikenesse and image of God. Gen 1. 26. 27.

Q. What was that image of God?
A. Principally it stood in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness Col.
3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. Eccles. 7. 29.

Q. What was the knowledge that man was endued withal in that estate?
A. He did then truly, and distinctly know God, and the will of God Romans 1.
19, 20. Ier. 31. 34.
, with the nature of the creatures Genesis 2. 19, 20, 23.
, and his own present happiness Genesis 2. 24. Romans 2. 15.
.

Q. What was that holiness and righteousness?
A. That his will, and affections, with his whole heart and soul, was exactly
conformable to the revealed will of God.

Q. Did not man in that state besides this conformty to God enjoy communion
with God?
A. Yes, at that time there was great amity, and love between God and man Genesis
1. 29.
, all the destance that is now being risen since as the effect and fruit of
sin.

Q Did not the place where man was then put, something set forth his happiness
in that estate?
A. Yes; for he was placed in Paradise which was an excellent garden planted by
God himself, and abounding with all delight, and pleasures. Genesis 2. 8, 9, 10,
15.

Q But seeing man was to work and labor in the garden in dressing and keeping
it, how does this agree with happiness?
A. Yea very well, because happiness does not consist in idleness; and as for
his labor, it then was, and always should have bin without pain, and
weariness, if man had continued in that estate.

Q. What was man's condition at that time in respect of food and raiment?
A. The earth at that time was furnished with plenty, and variety of wholesome
and delightsome fruits, and he had liberty to eat of them all, except only of
the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Genesis 2. 16.

Q. His food then was excellent; but what was his apparel?
A. Such was the strength and beauty of his body outwardly, and the perfection
of Gods image, wherewith he was clothed inwardly, that he had no need of other
bodily apparel either in respect of shame or season of weather, and therefore
he lived naked. Genesis 2. 25.

Q. What was his condition in respect of other creatures?
A. All the fishes of the Sea, all the birds of the air, and beasts of the
field were all of them subject to his dominion, and rule, Genesis 1. 20, 28, and
2. 19, 20.

Q. But what help had he in his condition against solitariness?
A. The Lord saw it was not good for a man to be alone, and that amongst all
the other creatures there was not a meet help for him, and therefore of a
ribbe of his side he made a woman and brought her to the man to be his wife.
Genesis 2. 18. etc.

Q But why was man created last of all ceatures?
A. This also does declare his excellency and happy estate by creation; for
being made last it appears thereby, that he was under God the end for which
the other creatures were made, and so was more excellent then they, as the end
is more excellent then the means.

Q How else did the time of man's creation declare his happiness?
A. It appears thereby, that God would not make him before he had first
provided for him, but brought him into the world as into a great storehouse
already fully furnished with all variety of good things that might be for his
service and comfort.

CHAP. 9. Of the fall of our first Parents.
Q. YOu have already showed the state of man in Innocence by creation, what
things are to be dered concerning the state of corruption?
The beginning thereof which was the fall of our first parents, and the
consequents of that fall in respect of sin and punnishment.

Q. What Scriptures do prove that Adam and Eve did fall from that state of
innoceney and purity where in they were created?
A. Many, but most especially the third chap. of Genes. Eccles. 7. 29. Isa. 43.
27. Romans 5. 12, 18, 19. 1. Tim. 2, 14.

Q Who did fall?
A. First Eve 1 Timothy 2. 14
, then Adam Gen 3. 6.
, and in him all man kind Romans 5. 12, 19. and 3. 23. 1 Cor. 15. 22.
that proceed from Adam after the ordinary way.

Q. How did man fall?
A. By transgression 1 Timothy 2. 14. Romans 5. 15. 17, 18
and disobedience Rom 5. 19:
to the commandment of God, which was that they should not eat of the tree of
knowledge of good and evil Genesis 3. 6. and 2. 17.
.

Q Wherein was this such a great offense? for it may seem a small matter to
eat an apple or other fruit forbidden.
A. This sin was not small, but very great, as comprehending in it an heap
and multitude of many other heinous evils.

Q What are some of those evils comprehended in this sin?
A. There was great umbeliefe to doubt of the truth of Gods threatening, there
was great Idolatry in preferring the counsel of Satan before the commandment of
God, and great blasphemy in yielding to Satan, when he said God forbade them
that tree because he did envy their happiness.

Q. What evil else was there in that offense?
A. There was discontent with their estate, though it was exceeding good,
abominable pride that would be like unto God, and horrible unthankfulness to
sin against God that had so highly advanced them.

Q. What further evil was in it?
A. There was curiosity in desiring to know more then God would have them to
know; also also they sinned needlessly and wilfully, that commandment being so
equal and easy to have been kept.

Q. How may that appear?
A. Because man then had no inward Concupiscence or corruption of nature, as we
now have, that could move him to break the commandment, nor was he any
necessitated thereto through any want, having such variety and abundance of
other fruits, whereof he might freely eat.

Q. What may be a last particular to show the heinousness of this first
offense?
A. Man showed himself herein to be wretchedly careless of the good of his
posterity, to whom in this act he was both unkind and Cruel.

Q. How may that appear?
A. In that by this means he brought sin and misery upon them all. Romans 5.
12, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 15. 22.

Q. Why should this sin of Adam bring the guilt of sin and misery upon all
his posterity?
A. Because he stood at this time as a public person in the room of all
mankind, we being all considered in him as members in the head, as children in
his loins, as debtors in our surety, and as branches in our root.

Q. What was the cause of this great and lamentable offense?
A. It was not any weakness or want of power in man to stand; for being made
in Gods Image he might have stood if he would.

Q. You think then he was not compelled and forced to sin and break the
commandment?
A. God was so far from forcing him to sin that he gave him power to have
obeyed, and threatened him with death in case of disobedience.

Q. But might not Satan compel him to it?
A. Satan could do nothing against him by compulsion or constraint, and
therefore does only assault him by Crafty and subtle persuasions?

Q. What then was the cause of this their sin?
A. The principal cause was man himself in abusing his own freewill, to
receive the temptation, which he might have resisted if he would, Eccles. 7. 29.

Q How far was Satan a cause of that first offense?
A. Though he could not constrain man to sin without his own consent, yet he
was justly to be blamed for that sin of man, in that it was through his
entisements that man was drawn unto it.

Q. How did he entise man to it?
A. By abusing the serpent to seduce the woman, and the help of the woman to
seduce the man. Genesis 3. 1, 6.

Q. What are the effects and fruits of his Fall?
A. By means of this Fall both the Serpent and Satan became accursed, and Adam
and Eve and their posterity plunged into a depth of sin and misery. Genesis 3.

CHAP. 10. Of Sin; the definition of it, and the distribution into Original
and actual.
Q. WHat is sin?
A. Transgression of the moral Law of God, by a Creature that is bound to keep
it?

Q. Why is sin said to be a transgression of the Law?
A. Because the Apostle John does expressly so call it 1 Ioh. 3. 4.
, and elsewhere it is said where there is no law Romans 4. 15.
, there is no transgression

Q. Why say you that sin is a Transgression of the law of God only? for are
not Transgressions of the Lawful commandments of parents and other Superiors,
sins also?
A. Yes so far as they tend to the dishonor of Superiors, such
Transgressions are also sins; but the reason of that is because obedience to
the lawful commands of Superiors is enjoined in the fifth commandment of the
law of God, in which respect God is said to be the only Lawgiver Iam. 4. 12.

Q. But why do you make sin a Transgression only of the moral law, since
unbelief and Impenitency though they be against the gospel, are also sins,
and so were violations of the Ceremonial law that was given to Israel by Moses?
A. Violation of the Ceremonies by the people of Israel was a sin, because
the observation of them was enjoined to that people in the second commandment
of the moral law, like a^ the observation of baptism and the Lords Supper are
now enjoined to Christians by the same Commandment.

Q And why are unbelief and Impenitenci^ sins?
A. Though these be directly against the Gospel, yet they are also sins when
they are found in them to whom the Gospels comes, as being against the first
commandment of the law, which enioynes obedience to God in whatsoever he has
showed or shall show to be his will.

Q. Why do you make sin a Transgression of the law by a creature?
A. Because God the Creator may do things forbidden in the Law, and yet not
sin, as to kill and destroy; because the law is not a rule to him but to us,
his own will being his rule, Ephesians. 1. 11. Ps. 115. 3.

Q. Why is it added, by a Creature bound unto it?
A. Because though Angels may sin, yet many things in the law, specially in
the fifth and seventh commandment are not applyable to Angels; and as for
other Creatures, the Law is no rule to them at all.

Q. Who among men are tainted with sin?
A. All that are mere men, none excepted Eccles. 7. 20. Romans 3. 23. and 5. 12.

Q. How many sorts of sin are there?
A. Besides that first offense of eating the forbidden fruit, there is the
corruption of nature which is usually called original sin, and the sins of
life which are usually called actual.

Q. What is the nature of original sin? wherein does it consist?
A. It consists in the loss of Gods Image wherein man was created at the first
Romans 7. 17. Ephesians 21. and 4, 18.
, and in a contrary vitiousnesse instead thereof Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. Romans 7.
23.
,

Q. What is the measure or greatness of this sin?
A. It contaynes not only some one or few particular evils, but a mass of all
iniquities, even the most abominable that can be named or Imagined Romans 3. 12.
13. etc.

Q. How far does this sin extend?
A. It overspreads the whole race of mankind as a contagious leprosy and
epidemical disease Romans 3. 10, 11. and 5. 12. and 3. 23.
, and infects all the powers and parts both of soul and body 1 These. 5. 23.
Ier. 10. 14. Tit. 1. 15. Romans 8. 7. Gal. 5. 24. Romans 6. 19.
.

Q. How is this sin propagated?
A. It is conveyed from parents to children not by imitation but by generation;
Gen 5. 3. Psalm. 51. 5. Job 14. 4. Ioh. 3. 6.

Q. What do you understand by actual sins?
A. All omissions of good 2 Ephesians. 3. 1, 2. mat. 25. 42, 43 etc. Iam. 4. 17.
. and failing in the manner of doing it Iam. 4. 3.
, and all committing evil whether in thoughts Genesis 6. 5.
, words Math. 12. 34, 36, 37.
, or deeds Col. 1* 21. Isa. 59. 6.
, against any of the commandments of God.

Q. Who are guilty of actual sins?
A. All the children of men Rom 3. 10. 11 etc. Iam. 3. 2. 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Eccles.
7. 20.
; and they that sin the least, yet doubtless would do more if the Lord did
not restrain them Isa. 37. 29. Hos. 2. 6, 7.
.

Q. But though all men be thus defiled with sin, yet may not a natural man
do some things that are good?
A. He may do things that are good for the act or matter of them Romans 2. 14,
15.
, but his person not being accepted Genesis 4. 4.
, and hsi heart Genesis 6. 5. Ier. 17. 9.
. so exceedingly corrupted, therefore all that he does as it proceeds from him,
is corrupt also and so most odious unto God math. 12. 33, 34, 35. and 15. 19,
20. Pro. 15. 8. and 28. 9.
,

CHAP. 11. Of the Punishment of Sin.
Q. Since all the children of men are thus woefully defiled with sin, what
punnishment is due by reason of the Sin?
A. In one word all kind of death Genesis 2. 17. Romans 5. 12. and 6. 23.
, and Cursednesse Col. 3. 10.
. which in the particulars contains all the plagues that are written in Gods
book Deuteronomy. 28. 15. and 29. 20.
, and many more which are not written Deuteronomy. 28. 61.
.

Q. What are the general heads of those plagues?
A. They are temporal, and spiritual, and eternal.

Q. What are the temporal plagues.
A. The Cursing of the earth Genesis 3. 17, 18.
, and the Creatures made subject to vanity Romans 8. 20, 21.
, and the bodies of men become subject to plagues and pains and death Deuteronomy. 28
21, 22, 27, 35, 48. Gen 3. 19.
.

Q. What else?
A. In name ignominy and reproach, both alive and after death Deuteronomy. 28. 20,
37. Pro. 10. 7.
, and calamities in men's wives, children and friends Deuteronomy. 28 30, 41.


Q. What other outward miseries are there?
A. In the outward estate poverty and losses Deuteronomy. 28. 16, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40.
, and their very blessings to be turned into Curses mal. 2. 2. Psalm. 69. 22.
,

Q. What are the spiritual miseries?
A. The loss of Gods Image and all comfortable communion with him Romans 3. 23.
Ephesians. 4. 18. Isa. 59 2.
, with bondage to the devil Ephesians. 2. 2. 2 Cor 4. 4. 2 Timothy 2. 26.
, and a necessity of sinning math. 12. 33, 34, 35. Ioh. 9. 35. Romans 6. 16, 18,
19, 20.
.

Q. What else are the spiritual miseries?
A. When men are given up unto more sin Psalm. 81. 12. Romans 1. 24, 29, 28,
as unto hardness of heart exodus 9. 12.
, blindness of mind Isa. 6. 9, 10.
and strong delusions 2 These. 2. 11.
,

Q What is the eternal misery?
A. Damnation and destruction in another world, 2 These. 1. 9. Job. 5. 29.

Q. Wherein does that consist?
A. In being deprived of all good, and in the contrary sense and feeling of
evil.

Q. What good shall the wicked be then deprived of?
A. They shall then be deprived of the favorable presence of God math. 25. 41.
2 These. 1. 9.
, of the joys of heaven Luke 13. 28. Rev. 21. 27. and 22. 15.
, of the society of the Saints Luke 13. 28. Psalm. 1. 5.
, and all comfort of the Creature, Luke 16. 24, 25.
,

Q. And what evil shall they then have the feeling of?
A. They shall feel unspeakeable torment both in soul and body, Mar. 9. 43,
44, 45. Luke 16. 23, 24.

Q. What will be the effect thereof?
A. It will cause weeping and gnashing of teeth Math. 13. 42. Luke 13. 28.
, the former through grief and dolor, and both of them through indignation
and despair

Q. If they must be deprived of heaven, and of the presence of God and of his
Saints, what place and company shall they be in?
A. They shall be in hell as in a prison 1 Pet. 3. 19.
, or deep pit Isa. 30. 33.
, or lake that burns with fire and brimstone Rev. 11. 8.
, and their company shall be no other but the devil and his Angels Math. 25.
41.
.

Q. This punishment of the damned is in it self most dreadful and terrible,
but how long shall it continue?
A. The thing were something less grievous, if this misery would ever have an
end; but this is the aggravation of it that it must be everlasting, 2 These. 1.
9. Matthew. 25. 41. 46. Matthew. 9. 43, 44.

CHAP. 12. Of man's deliverance.
Q. HAving spoken of the state of man by creation, and his estate of
corruption, let us now come to the third estate, the state of grace in this
life; and first tell me whether there be any ability in man to deliver himself
from his sinful and miserable estate?
A. None at all; because man being dead in trespasses and sins, has no more
ability to recover himself to spiritual life, then he that is bodily dead to
recover himself to bodily life. Ephesians. 2. 1. and 4. 18.

Q. How else may this inability of man appear?
A. Man of himself is without strength Romans 5. 6.
to any thing that is good; and moreover, if he had power unto it, yet he has
no will to seek after God Isa. 65. 1. Romans 3. 11.
, but to depart further and further from him Genesis 3. 8.
yea to express all enmity against him Romans 8. 7.


Q. What may be a further reason to show that man cannot deliver himself?
A. Man being a creature, is but finite; and the Majesty and Justice of God
which by sin is offended and wronged, is infinite.

Q. What do you infer from thence?
A. Because there can be nothing in a finite sinning nature to satisfy an
infinite offended Majesty; but such a nature must be ever in satisfying, and
never have satisfied; therefore it was not possible that man should deliver
himself from his sinful and miserable estate.

Q If man could not deliver himself, might be not be delivered by some other
creature?
A. There is no man that can give a ransom to redeem another, so much as from
bodily death Psalm. 49. 7.
and much less from spiritual and eternal death.

Q. But if one man could not redeem another, what do you say of other
creatures?
A. Other creatures are none of them of the same nature with man, and are all
of them but finite, even the Angels themselves; and therefore none of them can
make satisfaction to the infinite Majesty of God.

Q. If infinite justice must needs he satisfied, and neither man nor other
creature are able to do this; how then was there any possibility that man
should ever be delivered from this wretched estate?
A. The mercy of God is so infinite that he might be willing that man should be
delivered, and his wisdom such that he could find out some way and means of
deliverance; and his power such that he was able to accomplish the way which
his wisdom should devise; and therefore there was a possibility that man should
be delivered.

Q. But whether is there any way of deliverance already found out, and man
actually recovered?
A. Yes, the Lord has wrought redemption, and raised up an horn of salvation
for his people, Psalm. 111. 9. Luke 1. 69.

Q. Is God himself then the Author of man's deliverance?
A. Man's misery being sin against God, and punishment from God, therefore God
only must be the author of his deliverance, if he ever be delivered.

Q. What moved God to work man's deliverance?
A. Not because he had any need of man e, for he could have been absolute and
alsufficient of himself, if all men had perished everlastingly, as he was
before man had any being. Job 22. 3. and 35. 7. Romans 11. 25.


Q. Did God procure man's deliverance, because man did so deserve?
A. Man deserved it not, but the contrary, because he fell wilfully from that
happy estate wherein he was created, whenas he might have continued happy if he
would: therefore it had been no unrighteous thing if God had left him in that
misery whereinto he had brought himself, Pro. 1. 31.

Q. Did the Lord work the deliverance of man, because man did importunately
seek and sue unto him for the same?
A. Man did not seek and sue unto God at all, but fled from him, Gen 3. 8. Romans
3. 11. And if he had sought unto God for help, God was not bound to afford it;
and how much less when he sought it not?

Q. If God did not work the deliverance of man because himself had need of
it, or because man did desire it, what then was the cause that moved him to it?
A. Only his free grace, mercy, and love, John 3. 16. Ephesians. 2. 4, 5. Titus 3.
4, 5.

Q. What is the true way and means of deliverance?
A. Only the Lord Jesus Christ, Genes 3. 15. Acts 4. 12. 1 John 5. 12.

CHAP. 13. Of the person of Christ, and his divine and humane nature?
Q. WHat things are to be known and believed concerning Christ?
A. His Person, his Office, his Actions, the benefits that come by him, and the
means how we are made partakers of him and all his benefits.

Q. What is his person?
A. It is God and man united together in one person.

Q. How may it be proved that Christ is God?
A. By sundry places of Scripture, wherein he is expressly so called, Isa. 9. 6.
John 1. 1. Romans 9. 5. Phil. 2. 6. 1 John 5. 2^.

Q. How else?
A. Because Eternity Isa. 9. 6. Pro. 8. 22. John 8. 58. and 17. 5. Col. 1. 15.
Rev. 1. 8.
Omnipotency Rev. 1. 8. John 3. 31.
Omniscience John 21. 7. and 2. 24, 25. Rev. 2. 23. Mat. 9. 4.
and Omnipresence John 3. 13. Mat. 28. 20. Ephesians. 3. 17.
which are properties peculiar to God, are all of them ascribed unto Christ.

Q. How else may the Godhead of Christ be proved?
A. Because the creation of the world 1 John 1. 3. 10. Col. 1. 16.
the forgiveness of sins Mat. 6. 9.
the working of miracles Luke 8. 31. and 4. 36. Mat. 10 1.
which are works that can be done by none but God, are all of them ascribed to
him as the author of them; and because he is made a lawful object of divine
worship Heb. 1. 6. John 14. 1.


Q. Why was it requisite that Christ our Savior should be God?
A. That he might bear the weight of Gods wrath without sinking under the same
Exodus 27. 1.
that he might overcome death Acts 2. 24.
and his sufferings might be of sufficient worth and value to satisfy the
infinite justice of God Acts 20. 28.


Q. Is Christ also truly partaker of the nature of man?
A. Yes, for he is frequently called man, and the son of man 1 Timothy 2. 5.
Mat. 8. 20.
and said to be made flesh John 1. 14.
and partaker of flesh and blood Heb. 2. 14. Luke 24. 39.


Q. Why was it requisite that he should be man?
A. That he might suffer death for us Heb. 2. 14.
sanctisie our nature Heb. 2. 11.
and that we might have access with boldness unto God Heb. 4 15, 16.


Q. But since he was God from everlasting, how came be to be man also?
A. When the fullness of time was come Gal. 4. 4.
he became man, not after the ordinary and usual way of generation by man and
woman together, but he was conceived by the holy Ghost in the womb of a Virgin,
without a father Mat. 1. 20. Luke 1. 34, 55. Heb. 7. 3.


Q. Since there are two natures in Christ, the Divine and humane, whether is
Christ then two persons?
A. By no means, but one only, 1 Cor. 8. 6. 1 Timothy 2. 5.

Q. But is not Christ a person in respect of his Godhead?
A. Yes, the second person in the blessed Trinity.

Q. Is not another man who has the whole nature of man in him, both body and
soul, a perfect person?
A. Yes, it is even so.

Q. Why then is not the humane nature in Christ a distinct person?
A. Because it never had subsisting and being of it self, but in the person of
the Son of God being assumed unto it from the first moment of its being, Heb.
2. 16.

Q. If both the humane and divine nature be in Christ, and yet Christ but one
person; is then the Godhead become the manhood, and the manhood the Godhead?
A. Not so; this Union of two natures in one person does not confound the two
natures, nor destroy the properties of either; but these still remain
unconfounded and distinct in that one person.

CHAP. 14. Of the Office of Christ to be a Mediator.
Q. HAving spoken of the person of Christ, tell in the next place what is
Christ's Office?
A. His Office in the general is to be a Mediator between God and man, to
work reconciliation betwixt them. 1 Timothy 25. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.

Q. What need was there of such a Mediator?
A. Very much need, because by the sin of man there was now grown enmity
between them, God being offended with man, and man being enemy to God. Romans 5.
9, 10. Col. 2. 21.

Q. Is Christ the only Mediator? or are there not others that may be mediators
also?
A. Properly there is no other mediator between God and man but Christ only, 1 Timothy 2. 5. John 14. 6.

Q. Who gave Christ a Commission or calling to the Office of a mediator?
A. As no man can lawfully intrude himself into any office without a lawful
calling, no more did Christ intrude himself into the office of a Mediator, but
was lawfully called and authorized thereunto by the father, Isa 42. 1, 6. John
6. 29. and 10. 36. Heb. 5. 4, 5.

Q. How was he furnished with gifts and abilities for discharge of this office?
A. As God never calls any to any office, but he gives them gifts requisite
thereto: so Christ was furnished with all wisdom and knowledge, and other gifts
of the spirit, that might fully fit him for his office of Mediator, Col. 2. 3.
Isa. 11. 2. and 61. 1. and Heb. 1. 9. John 3. 34.

Q. Whether is Christ Mediator according to his humane nature, or according to
his divine?
A. The office of mediation belongs to whole Christ, as he is God and man,
and not in respect of either nature alone.

Q. How may that appear?
A. A Mediator should be a fit and middle person to deal between two that are
at variance: but if our mediator be considered as God only, he should then be
too high to treat with man, and had he been man only he should have been too
low for God.

Q. What may be a further reason thereof?
A. If the acts of his mediation do proceed from him, being considered only
as God, they then cannot be applicatory unto us; and if they proceed from him
only as man, they then cannot be of sufficient value to be satisfactory unto
God.

Q. Do you then think that in the execution of his office of mediator both the
natures do jointly concur?
A. It is even so indeed; God-man, whose Christ is our mediator.

Q. How long has Christ had this office?
A. In respect of Gods decree he was appointed to it from eternity 1 Pet. 1.
20. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
in respect of virtue and efficacy he was mediator from the beginning of the
world when need was Genesis 315. Rev. 13. 8. Heb. 138.


Q. But when was he manifested in the flesh?
A. In respect of his manifestation in the flesh, he was given in the fullness
of time in these latter days, 1 Pet. 1. 20. Gal. 4. 4. 1 Timothy 2. 6.

Q. What is the effect and benefit of his mediatorship?
A. Hereby God and man that were at enmity are reconciled together again, and
made one, Col. 1. 20. Ephesians. 1. 10. and 2. 14, 15.

CHAP. 15. Of the covenant between God and man, the covenant of work, and the
covenant of grace, and the difference between them.
Q. HOw does Christ as Mediator reconcile God and man again?
A. By making a new Covenant and agreement betwixt them, which is called the
covenant of grace?

Q. Is the covenant of grace made with respect to Christ?
A. Yea, had it not been for Christ's sake, and through his mediation, God would
never have made such covenant with man.

Q. How may that be proved?
A. This covenant is said to be confirmed in Christ Isai. 3. 17.
and Christ is said to be the Mediator of the covenant Heb. 8. 6. and 9. 15.
and 12. 24.
the Angel of the covenant Mal. 3. 1.
and sometimes the Covenant it self Gal. 42. 6. and 49. 8.


Q What is this covenant of grace.
A. That wherein God for Christ his sake promises forgiveness of sins, and
everlasting happiness to them that believe on Christ.

Q Is there not mention in Scripture of some other covenant of God to man,
besides this covenant of grace in Christ?
A. Yes, there is that general covenant with mankind, that the word should not
be drowned any more with water, and that the succession of day and night, and
other seasons, should be maintained as long as the earth shall endure. Genesis 9.
11. and 8. 22.

Q These Covenants are only concerning external and earthly lessings; but is
there not some covenant concerning everlasting happiness, besides that
covenant of grace in Christ?
A. Yes, that which is usually called the covenant of works, Gal. 4. 24, 25.
Romans 10. 5.

Q What is that covenant of works?
A. That whereby God promises all life and happiness, upon condition of
perfect obedience to the law in a man's own person, with a threatening of
everlasting death and cursednesse for the least transgression, Romans ^0. 5. Gal.
3. 10. Genesis 2, 17.

Q Wherein do these two covenants differ?
A. The covenant of works being made with man in innocence may be called a
covenant of amity or friendship between God and man being friends; but the
other is a covenant of gracious reconciliation, when sin had brought in
enmity betwixt them, 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.

Q. What is another difference?
A. The one belongs to Adam, and all his posterity; the other belongs only to
the elect, or at the most only to such as have the Gospel preached to them,
Ephesians. 2. 12.

Q Is there not some difference in regard of the blessings promised to either
of them?
A. Yes for the one promises life upon condition of perfect obedience; but if
sin be once committed, it knows of no forgiveness, nor recovery Genesis 2. 17.
but the other promises forgiveness of sins Ier. 31. 34.
and renovation of our natures Ezekiel 36, 26, 27.
and to write the Law in our hearts Ier. 31, 33
.

Q How do they differ in regard of the conditions of them?
A. The one promises nothing but upon condition of fulfilling the law in our
own persons Romans 10. 5.
, which to man since the fall is utterly impossible Romans 8 3.
; but the covenant of grace promises life upon condition of believing in
another, the Lord Jesus Christ Acts 16 31.


Q. What are the effects of either of these covenants?
A. The one now works nothing but the discovery of sin Romans 3. 20.
, and bondage Gal. 4. 24
, and wrath Romans 4 15.
, requiring many things, but not giving any power to perform Romans 8 3.
, but the other works in us what it requires of us, being the ministration
of the spirit, and righteousness and life 2 Cor. 3. 6, 8, 9.
; and the power of God to salvation Romans 1. 16.


Q. What is the continuance of either of them?
A. The one is broken by the sin of man Ier. 31. 32.
, and abrogated to them that are in Christ Gal. 5. 18. Romans 6. 14.
but the other shall never be removed nor disanulled to them that have once
truly believed in him Isa. 54. 10. Ier. 32. 40.


Q. Was the covenant of grace revealed and dispensed in the times before
Christ's Incarnation, or only since his coming in the flesh?
A. There has been the same covenant of grace for substance, in all times and
ages of the Church, since the fall of man till this day, Genesis 3. 15. and 15. 5,
6. John 8. 56. Acts 15, 11. Heb. 13. 8.

Q. But has there not been some difference between the administration of the
covenant of grace in former times, and in these days.
A. Yes, there has been difference in regard of the manner of administration,
and therefore it is that they are called two Covenants, or Testaments, the Old
and the New Ier. 31. 31. Heb. 8 8, 13:
when for substance it is but the same.

Q. Wherein stands that different manner of administration?
A. Then it was more burden some in regard of the multitude of Ceremonies and
sacrifices, now it is more easy; Then it was more dark, in regard of Types
and shadows, now apparent and clear.

Q. What may be the further difference?
A. Now there is more power and efficacy of the Spirit, and the graces of it,
in the hearts of Gods people genreally, then was then: and whereas then it was
only to be one people, now it is to all Nations.

CHAP. 16. How Christ is the Prophet, Priest, and King unto his people, and in
particular of his Prophetical Office.
Q. YOu have showed that the Office of Christ in general is to be a Mediator,
to reconcile God and man together by means of the new covenant, or covenant of
grace; tell me now what are the special parts of his Mediatorship?
A. He is a Prophet, a Priest, and King.

Q. How may it be proved that Christ has this threefold Office of Prophet,
Priest, and King?
A. First, by the condition of his people, lying under a threefold misery of
ignorance, estrangement from God, and inability to recover themselves, and
return unto God again,

Q. How does this prove it.
A. The first of these miseries is helped by Christ's Prophetical office, the
second by his Priestly, and the third by his Kingly.

Q. How else may this threefold office of Christ's be proved?
A. By the order and manner of bestowing salvation upon his people, which must
first be revealed and made known, then purchased and procured, and lastly
effectually applied.

Q. And how does this prove it?
A. The first of these is done by Christ's Prophetical office, the second by
his Priestly, and the third by his Kingly.

Q. What may be a further proof of this three fold Office of Christ?
A. The practice of Christ, who first lived as a Prophet teaching the will of
God secondly as a Priest he offered himself on the Cross; and then as a King
he applies unto his people all the benefits of his passion.

Q. Come we now to the particulars, and tell me how it may be proved that
Christ is a Prophet to his people?
A. Because he is expressly so called Deuteronomy. 18. 18 Acts 3. 22, 23.
, as also by other titles importing the same thing;

Q. What are those other titles?
A. He is called Counselor Isai 9 6.
, Messenger Mal. 3. 1.
, Doctor or Master Mat. 23. 10.
, Apostle Heb. 3. 1.
, Speaker Heh. 12. 25.
, the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls 1 Pet. 2. 25.
, the faithful and true witness Rev. 1. 5. and 3 14.


Q What is the work of Christ as a Prophet?
A. To reveal and make known to his people the counsel and will of God, Deuteronomy.
18. 18. John 1. 18. and 4. 25. and 15 15. Matthew. 11. 27.

Q How does he this?
A. Outwardly by such means as he has appointed, and inwardly by the teaching
and illumination of his holy Spirit.

Q. What are the outward means?
A. They are diverse and sundry, according as it pleased him Heb 1. 1.
; but chiefly they are the holy Scriptures John 5. 39 Col. 3 16.
, and the ministry of men appointed to speak in his name Ephesians. 4. 1^, 12. Luke
10. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 20.


Q. What is the teaching of the holy Spirit?
A. It is that inward work of the holy Ghost upon the soul, whereby the
outward teaching is made efficacious and powerful for opening the
understanding and humbling the heart to embrace the truth and will of God, John
16. 13. and 14. 26. 1 John 2. 27

Q. When has Christ performed his office and function of a Prophet unto his
people?
A. Both when he was upon earth in his own person Isai 42. 1, 2 and 61. 1, 2.
Mat. 4. 25. and 9. 35.
, and also in all times and ages of the Church, both before his incarnation 1
Pet. 1. 11. and 3. 19.
, and since his Assention into heaven Mat. 28. 19, 20.


Q. How much of the will of God does this Prophet make known unto his people?
A. All that is requisite for our Salvation; John 15 15. and 4. 25. and 16. 13.
and Deuteronomy. 18. 18.

Q. What then is to be thought of all Doctrines, Traditions, Revelations and
Ordinances which he has not appointed?
A. They are all to be rejected and accursed John 8. 20. Gal. 1. 8, 9. 1 John
4. 1. 2 John 9. 10.
, as being injurious to the perfection and fullness of the Prophetical office
of Christ:

CHAP. 17. Of the Priesthood of Christ.
Q. IS Christ also a Priest?
A. Yes, and is frequently so called, Psalm. 110. 4. Heb. 2. 17. and 3. 1. and
4. 14, 15. and 5. 5, 6, 10. and 8. 1. and 9. 11.

Q Was he a Priest after the order of Aaron?
A. No, but after the order of Melchizedek, Psa. 110. 4 Heb. 7. 11, 21.

Q. How may that appear?
A. Aaron was of the Tribe of Levi, but Christ was of the Tribe of Judah Heb.
7. 13, 14.
; and whereas Aaron had father and mother, Christ as he was man was without a
father, and as God without mother Heb. 7. 3.


Q. How else?
A. Aaron and his successors being sinners, had need to offer sacrifice first
for their own sins, and then for the peoples: but Christ being altogether
without sin, did offer sacrifice only for the people. Heb. 5. 3. and 9. 7.
and 7. 26, 27.

Q. Is there not some difference between the Priesthood of Aaron and Christ's
Priesthood, in respect of the manner of entrance in the same and continuance
therein?
A. Yes, for Aaron and his successors were ordained without an oath; but Christ
with an oath Heb. 7. 21.
. And whereas the Priests of the law died and had successors, Christ has an
unchangeable Priesthood, continuing Priest for ever Heb. 7. 23, 24, 25.


Q. How do these priesthoods differ in respect of the sacrifices offered
thereby?
A. The one offered the bodies and blood of beasts; but Christ offered up
himself, and so was both Priest and Sacrifice, Heb. 9. 12, 14, 26.

Q. Is there not some difference in regard of the number of their Sacrifices?
A. The Sacrifices of the Law were many, because of their imperfections, but
Christ has offered up himself once for all, Heb. 7. 27. and 9. 25, 26. and
10. 12, 14.

Q. What are the works performed by him as a Priest?
A. Oblation or offering a Sacrifice Heb. 8. 3.
, and making request or intercession for his people Heb. 7. 25.


Q. What was the Sacrifice which he offered?
A. Himself as he is man Ephesians. 5 2. Heb. 9. 26.
, his humane soul Isai 53. 10, 12.
, and body Heb. 10. 10.


Q. What kind of Sacrifice was this?
A. It was bloody, or by blood Heb. 9. 12. 22.
, it was spotless Heb. 9. 14.
, and perfect Heb. 9. 26. and 10. 10, 12, 14
, and most pleasing unto God Ephesians. 5. 2.


Q. What Altar did he offer this Sacrifice upon?
A. The Altar must need be heavenly, as the Priest and Sacrifice were; and the
use of an Altar being to sanctify the gift, and therefore greater then it Mat.
23. 19.
; and therefore it was not the cross of wood, but the Godhead of Christ, which
was the Altar on which he sacrificed himself John 17 19. Heb 9 14.


Q. Whether is Christ the only Priest unto God in these days, or are there not
others who are Priests also?
A. All Christians are called Priests to offer up unto God the spiritual
Sacrifice of prayer and thanksgiving, and the like 1 Pet. 2. 5. Rev 1. 6.
; but to be a Priest to offer up a Sacrifice propitiatory is proper and
peculiar unto Christ only Heb. 7. 28.


Q. What acts does Christ perform in making intercession for his people?
A. He appears in the presence of God for them Heb 9 24.
, presenting before God the virtue and value of his death and bloodshedding
Heb. 12. 24. and 9. 12.
, with some expression of his will before God for their good Romans 18 34. John
17. 24.


Q. In what manner does he make this intercession?
A. Not with tears and words, and prostrating of his body, as he did on earth,
but in such a manner as is suitable to his state of glory.

Q. What are the benefits of this intercession of Christ?
A. Forgiveness of sins daily continued and applied 1 John 2. 1, 2.
, with continuance in Gods favor John 17. 11. Luke 22. 32.
, and acceptance of our imperfect services 1 Pet. 2. 5. Exodus 28. 38. Rev. 8. 3
.

Q. What are the benefits of this intercession?
A. Hereby believers are defended and secured against the accusations of all
their enemies Romans 8. 33, 34. Zecb 3 1, 2.
, with certainty of salvation in Heaven Heb. 7. 25. John 17. 24.
.

CHAP. 18. Of the Kingly office of Christ.
Q. Has Christ also the office of a King?
A. Yes, for he is often expressly so called Psalm. 2. 6. Ier. 23. 5. Zech. 9. 9.
Luke 1. 32, 33. John 1. 49.
, and has the ornaments of a King;

Q. What are those ornaments?
A. To sit upon a Throne Rev. 2. 21: Heb. 1. 8.
, to wear a Crown upon his head Heb. 2 9. Can. 3. 11. Revel. 19. 12.
, and to have a Scepter in his hand Psalm. 45. 6. and Psalm. 110. 2.


Q. How is he King of his people? as God only, or as man also?
A. Not as God only, but as Mediator, God and man in one person.

Q. How is that proved?
A. Because he that was born and given to us has the government upon his
shoulders Isa. 9. 6.
, and he that was crucisied is made Lord and Christ Acts 2. 36.
; now to be born, and given, and crucified, cannot be said of God only,

Q. How else may it appear that Christ is King not as God only, but as man
also?
A. Because the time will come when he shall deliver up the Kingdom to the
father 1 Cor. 15 24, 28.
but as God he shall reign with the father unto all eternity.

Q. Is any work of Christ as King anywhere expressly ascribed unto him as man?
A. Yea, authority to execute judgment as a Kingly work; and this belongs
unto Christ as man, John 5. 27.

Q. Over whom is Christ a King?
A. Over all creatures in General Heb. 2. 8. Phil. 2 10, 11.
, over the visible Church in special Psalm. 2. 6. Zech. 9. 9.
, and over the elect in a most special manner above all other John 17. 2, 6,
12. Ephesians. 1. 22.


Q How is he King over all creatures?
A. In sustaining and disposing of them all by his providence, as may be for
his glory, and the good of the elect, Heb. 1. 3. Col. 1. 16. Pro. 8. 15, 16.
Isa. 43. 14, 15.

Q. And how is he King of the visible Church?
A. In that he gathers men into it Psalm. 110. 1, 2, 3. Isai 43. 5, 6.
, appoints Ordinances and Officers unto it 1 Cor. 12. 4. Ephesians. 4. 11. Mat. 28.
20.
, and prescribes laws Iam. 4. 12. Isai 33. 22.
for the manner of carrying on all things therein;

Q How does Christ all these things in the Church?
A. He does them all by his word, which is therefore called the word of the
Kingdom, Mat. 13. 19.

Q. And how is Christ King of the Elect?
A. Not only by his providence, as over all creatures: nor only by his Word
and Ordinances, as to the visible Church, but also by the special working of
the grace of his holy Spirit in their hearts, Ezekiel. 36 26. Ephesians. 1 22. Col. 1 18.

Q. Has not the Kingly office of Christ some that are enemies unto it?
A. Yes, sin and the world, the devil and death.

Q. What are the acts of Christ's Kingly office in respect of those his
enemies, and the enemies of his Church and elect people?
A. To bridle Romans 6. 14. 2 Kings 19. 28. Job 1. 12. and 2. 6.
and subdue Psa. 110. 1, 5, 6. Heb. 2 14. 1 Cos. 15. 25, 26.
them all.

Q. What are the properties of Christ's Kingdom?
A. It is lawful Psa. 2. 6. Mat. 28. 18. Luke 1 32.
, spiritual Romans 14. 17. John 18 36. Luke 17. 20.
, powerful Rev. 1. 5. and 19. 16.
, righteous Psa. 45. 6, 7. Rev. 19. 11.
, large Psa. 2. 8. and 72. 8, 9, 10, 11.
, and everlasting Psa. 45. 6. Dan. 7. 14. Luke 1. 33.


CHAP. 19. Of Christ his humiliation.
Q. HAving spoken of the person and Offices of Christ, how are we in the next
place to consider of his actions?
A. In a twofold estate: his state of humiliation, and his state of exaltation.

Q What are the general acts of his humiliation?
A. Laying aside the full manifestation of his divine Majesty for a time Phil.
2 7. John 17. 5.
, and assuming unto him the nature of man Heb. 2. 14, 16. John 1 14. Phil. 2. 7.


Q. What else?
A. It was a great act of his humiliation, that he became subject to the law
Gal. 4 4.
, and not only a man, but in the meanest condition of men Phil. 2 7. Isai 53.
2, 3. Psalm. 22. 6.
.

Q. What may be evidences that he was a man of a very mean condition and state?
A. His poor birth, his afflicted and poor life, his shameful and accursed
death, with the things that follow afterward, do evidently show the same.

Q. What was his poor birth?
A. He was born of a poor Virgin for his mother who was espoused to a Carpenter
for her husband; and when he was born was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid
in a manger, because there was no room for his poor mother in the Inn, Luke 2.
7.

Q. What else was the testimony of his poor birth?
A. When he was presented to the Lord in the temple with an offering, the
offering was but a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons, which was an
offering appointed at the birth of children of the poorest sort of people. Luke
2. 24. Levit. 12. 8.

Q. What was his poor and afflicted life?
A. His fleeing into Egypt from the rage of Herod Mat. 2. 14.
, his poverty in outward estate Mat. 8. 20. Luke 8. 3.
, and his subjection to his parents Luke 2. 51.
as any other child.

Q. What else were testimonies of his afflicted life?
A. His temptations from the devil Mat. 4. 1. Luke 4. 13.
, his wearysome journeys from place to place Acts 10. 38. John 4. 6.
, and his manifold persecutions from the hands and tongues John 8. 48. 52. 59.
Luke 4. 28. 29.
of wicked men,

Q. What was his shameful, painful and accursed death?
A. It was his crucifying or death upon the Cross 1 Phil. 2: 8.
, which was a death accursed by the Law Gal: 3. 13.


Q. Wherein was the shame of that death?
A. It was shameful in that he was Crucified in the midst betwixt two thieves
Mat. 27. 38.
, and Barabbas a Murderer counted more worthy then he Mat: 27. 21.


Q. What else was the shame and pain of that death?
A. He was Crowned with thorns, and otherwise derided by the people and
priests, his hands and feet were nailed to the Cross, and his side was
pierced with a Spear to the effusion of water and blood, Math. 27. 29. 30. 31.
John 19. 34.

Q. What else was there in his death?
A: That which was the greatest of all was, that he endured a grievous agony
with his fathers wrath, Mat. 26, 37. 38. and 27. 46.

Q What followed after his death?
A. He was buried in the grave Math. 27. 60.
, and continued under the power and dominion of death for a time Acts 2. 27.
,

Q. What was the end of all this Humilation of Christ?
Q. That he might make satisfaction to the justice and honor of God, which had
been wronged by our sins Romans 3. 25. 1 Timothy 2. 5. 6. 1 Job. 2. 1. 2.
, and to procure for us reconciliation with God and eternal life Romans 5. 9. 10.
,

Q. How came Christ to be liable to make satisfaction for our sins?
A. Because he voluntarily became our Surety, and so was to pay the debt that
we were in unto God, Heb. 7. 22. Psalm, 40. 7.

CHAP. 20. Of the exaltation of Christ, and his Resurrection from the dead.
Q. HAving considered of Christ's Humiliation, how are we in the next place to
consider of his exaltation?
A. The exaltation of Christ is to be considered both in respect of his Godhead
and his manhood, and in the several degrees thereof.

Q. What is his exaltation in respect of his Godhead?
A. It is nothing else but the manifestation of that divine power and glory of
his, which had been so much concealed in all the time of his humiliation, John
175. Romans 1. 4:

Q And what is his exaltation in respect of his Manhood?
A. It consists partly in laying aside all those infirmities which it had been
subject unto in the time of Humiliation by hunger, thirst, weariness and the
like, which are all of them removed and done away, 1 Cor. 15. 43.

Q. Wherein else does this exaltation consist?
A. In that the humane nature of Christ was filled with all the glorious
excellencies that a creature is capable of, and this both in respect of his
soul Heb. 12. 2.
, and in respect of his body Phil. 3. 21.
,

Q. Does the body of Christ by means of his exultation or Glorification
become infinite, or Omnipresent or in many places at once?
A. As the soul of Christ being Glorified does still retain the nature of a
soul: so his body does still retain the essential properties of a body
Math 28. 6. Luke 20. 39.
, and therefore is not infinite nor omnipresent, for that were to destroy its
essential properties,

Q. What are the degrees of Christ's exaltation?
A. His resurrection from the dead, his ascension into heaven, and his sitting
at the right hand of God.

Q. What mean you by his resurrection from the dead?
A. I mean that his body which was dead was quickened again 1 Pet. 3. 18. Rom:
14. 9.
, by the uniting together of his soul and body again, which in death had been
separated: and also that being quickened he came forth again out of the grave
Mat: 28. 6. John 20. 6. 7.
.

Q. What certainty is there of this resurrection of Christ?
A. The scripture says that Christ is risen indeed Luke 24. 34.
, and his resurrection has been witnessed by many clear and pregnant
Testimonies,

Q. What are those testimonies?
A. The blessed Angels did witness that Christ was risen from the dead Math:
28. 5, 6. Mark: 16. 6. 7. Luke 24. 4, 5, 6.
; so also did the watchmen which were set to have kept him from rising Math.
28. 11.
, and likewise certain godly women Math. 28. 9. 10. Luke 24. 9. 10.
, to whom he showed himself alive after his Resurrection.

Q. What further Testmonies was there of Christ's resurrection?
A. The Apostles who were witnesses appoined of God for this end Act. 10. 41.
, do frequently testify the same Act. 2. 24. 32. and 3. 15. and 4. 10. 33.
and 5. 30. 31. 32. and 10. 40. 1 Cor. 15. 4, 5, 6, 15.
.

Q. Did not Christ also declare his own Resurrection by showing himself upon
earth after he was risen from the dead, before he ascended into Heaven?
A. He showed himself alive by appearing to many within the space of those
forty days between his Resurrection and ascension Acts 1. 3.

Q. What are some of those apparitions of Christ in those days?
A. He appeared to Mary Magdalen Mark 16. 9.
: and to other Godly Women Math: 28. 9. 10.
, to two disciples as they were going to Emmaus Luke 24. 13.
, and to all the disciples together except Thomas Ioh. 2c. 19.
.

Q. To whom else?
A. To the disciples at another time and to Thomas being with them Ioh. 20 26.
, to seven of them at the sea of Tiberias Ioh. 21. 1. 2.
, to the Eleven a in Mountain of Galilee Mat. 28. 16.
, and upon the mount of Olives Acts 1. 12.
, and to above five hundred brethren at once 1 Cor. 15. 6.
.

Q. You have sufficiently showed the certainty of Christ's resurrection; tell
likewise the time of it, when it was that he arose.
A. He rose again the third day after he was put to death, 1 Cor 15. 4.

Q. By what power did he rise again?
A. By the power of the father Act. 2. 24. Ephesians. 1. 19. 20.
, and his own almighty power Ioh. 2. 19. and 10. 18.
.

Q. What were the ends of his Resurrection?
A. He rose again to show the dignity of his person Romans 1. 4.
, to fulfill the scriptures Luke 24. 46. Psa. 16. 10. and 110. 7. Isa. 53. 10.
11. 12.
, and to show that there was sufficiency of merit and satisfaction in his
death Romans 4. 25. 1 Cor. 15 17.
.

Q. Open this last a little more plainly.
A. When a surety apprehended and Iaid in prison has fully discharged the
debt, it is meet that then he should be released, and when he is released, it
appears thereby that the debt is fully paid: so when Christ had fully
satisfied for our sins, it was meet he should be released from death, and
being so released it appears thereby that satisfaction for our sins was
fully made.

Q. What other ends were there of the Resurrection of Christ?
A. He rose that he might have Lordship and Dominion over quick and dead Romans
14. 9. 10. Phil. 2. 8, 9. 10.
, which he had duly purchased by his suffering.

Q. Could Christ have performed the office whereto he was appointed, if he had
not risen from the dead?
A. That may be another end of his Resurrection, namely that he might perform
the office of an eternal Priest, and Prophet and King unto his People, which
he could not have done if he had still remained under the power and Dominion of
Death.

Q. What are the benefits of Christ's Resurrection?
Hereby believers may be assured of their Justification from all their sins
Romans 4. 25. 1 Cor. 15. 17. 1 Pet. 3. 21.
, of their spiritual rising to newness of life 1 Pet. 1. 3. Romans 6. 4. Ephesians.
2. 5. 6. Col. 2. 12. and 31.
, and of their Resurrection to glory at their last day 1 Cor. 15. 20, 21, 22.
Romans 8. 11. 2 Cor. 4 14.
.

CHAP. 21. Of Christ's Ascension into Heaven.
Q WHen Christ was risen from the dead, did he still continue upon earth?
A. No, but after a time he left this world, and ascended into heaven John 16
28.

Q What was the place from whence he did ascend?
A. In general from this world, and in special from the mount of Olives near
unto Jerusalem Acts 1. 12.

Q What was the place to which he did ascend?
A. The third heaven, far above this earth, and all these inferior and
visible heavens. Mark 16. 19. Luke 24. 51. Act. 1. 11. Ioh. 14. 1. 2. Ephesians. 4.
10.

Q. Was this ascension of Christ a true and real mutation and change of place,
or only a change of his Estate?
A. Though Christ in respect of his Godhead be everywhere present Ioh. 3. 13.
, and in respect of the power and comfort of his spirit be present with all his
saints upon earth Mat. 18. 20. and 28. 20. and Rev. 2. 1.
; yet his ascension into heaven was such a true and real change of place, that
in respect of his bodily presence he is now no more upon earth, but in heaven
Ioh. 16 28. Mat. 26. 11. Act. 3. 21.
,

Q. What was the efficient cause of Christ ascension?
A. The power of the father, in respect whereof he is said to be received or
taken up Mark. 16. 19. Act. 1. 2. 9. 11.
; and his own Almighty power, in respect of which he is said to ascend, or go
up Ephesians. 4. 10.
.

Q. When was the time of this ascension?
A. Forty days after his Resurrection from the dead Act. 1. 3.

Q. Why did he ascend no sooner?
A. Because he would first sufficiently confirm the faith of the disciples
concerning his resurrection, and fully instruct them in the things pertaining
to the kingdom of God. Acts 1. 3.

Q. Why did he stay upon earth no Longer?
A. To show that it was not an earthly life, which he now affected or minded.

Q. Who were witnesses of his Ascension?
A. The disciples who were with him at that time upon the mount of Olives, and
certain Angel which then appeared. Acts 1. 9. 10. 11.

Q. For what end did Christ ascend into heaven?
A. That he might fulfill the scripture Luk 24. 44. Psalm. 68. 18.
, and fully perform his office Heb. 6. 20. and 7. 26. and 8. 4.
, and take possession of the glory that was due unto him Luke 24. 26.
.

Q. What else were the ends and fruits of his ascension?
A. The leading of Captivity Captive Psa. 68. 18.
, the giving of gifts unto men Ephesians. 4. 8. 11.
, the pouring out of his spirit upon his people John 14. 16, 17. and 16. 7.
Acts 2. 33.
, and preparing a place for them John 14. 2. 3.
.

CHAP. 22. Of Christ's sitting at the right hand of God, and his return to the
last judgment.
Q: BEsides the Resurrection and ascension of Christ, what further degree is
there of his exaltation?
A. His sitting at the right hand of God Psalm. 110. 1. Mark. 16. 19. Ephesians. 1.
20. Col. 3. 1. Heb. 1. 3, 13. and 8, 1. and 10. 12, 13.

Q. What are we to understand by Christ's sitting at the right hand of God?
A. That fullness of excellent majesty and glorious Dominion whereto he is now
advanced, far above the most glorious Angels and every other creature, Ephesians:
1. 20, 21, 22. Heb. 1. 13.

Q. But divine dominion and sovereignty over all Creatures belonging to the
father and to the holy Ghost, why is this peculiarly ascribed unto Christ?
A. Not in respect of right but the actual and immediate exercise thereof; for
the former belong ing to all the divine persons, this latter is now peculiarly
committed unto Christ: Ioh. 5. 22. 27. Act 10. 42. and 17. 31.

Q. Who gave Christ this great authority thus to sit at the right hand of God?
A. He did not come unto it by any unjust usurpation, but it was given unto him
by God. Ephesians. 1. 20. Phil. 2. 10. John 5. 22. 27. and 17. 2.

Q. And why did God give this great advancement unto Christ?
A. Because the son did voluntarily humble himself to the greatest degree of
obedience and humiliation; therefore the father gave unto him this exaltation
and advancement, as a reward and recompense of that his humiliation, Phil. 2.
10. 11. Isa. 5. 3. 12.

Q. Does Christ sit at the right hand of God in respect of his divine nature
only or in regard of his manhood also?
A. This dignity belongs to Christ as God and man in one person, and not in
respect of one of his natures alone.

Q. How may that appear?
A. Because it is given to him immediately upon his Ascension into heaven 1
Pet. 3. 22.
, and is to be exercised by him both as David's Lord Psa. 110 1.
, and also as he is the son of man Ioh. 5. 27.
.

Q. How long shall this sitting of Christ at Gods right hand continue?
A. Until all his enemies be made his footstool Psa. 110. 1. 1. Cor. 15. 25?

Q. Shall it never cease and have an end?
A. If we speak of his reigning and ruling in a way and manner peculiar and
appropriate to his person, so we may safely say that when all his enemies are
put under his feet, then shall be the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom
to the father, and himself be subject to him, 1 Cor. 15. 24, 25, 28.

Q. What shall be the last act of this glorious power and authority of Christ,
and so the last degree of his exaltation?
A. His return to Judgment at the last day, when he shall come a second time
into this world with unspeakable majesty and glory, to judge the Quick and
dead 2 Timothy: 4. 1. Act. 10. 42. and 17, 31. and Mat. 25. 31. and 26. 64. and 2
These. 1. 7, 8, 9.

CHAP. 23. Of faith and union with Christ.
Q. YOu have spoken of the person, Offices and actions of Christ; you are now
to show the benefits that come by Christ, and how we are made partakers of
Christ and of his benefits?
A. We are made partakers of Christ and all his benefits by faith alone, John
1. 12. and 3. 16, 18, 36. and 20. 31. Ephesians. 3. 17. and Act. 16. 31.

Q. What mean you by faith?
A. That grace of the spirit whereby we receive Christ, which is wrought in our
hearts in our effectual calling?

Q How is faith wrought in effectual callings?
A. Effectual calling consists of two parts, the offer of Christ to the soul,
and the soul excepting of that offer or the call of God when he calls the
soul to come to Christ, and the answer of the soul unto that call Ier. 3.
22. Ioh. 6. 44, 45. and 10. 16. Isa. 55. 5.
: now this latter is nothing else but faith:

Q. How is faith wrought in us?
A. Not by any power of our own freewill John 6. 44.
, or merely by moral persuasion Act. 13. 41.
; for we are dead in sins and treepasses Ephesians: 2: 1:
.

Q. How then is it wrought?
A. By the almighty power of the spirit of God as the author of it Acts 16, 14.
Phil. 1. 29. 2 Cor. 4, 13. Romans 15. 13.
; and by the word as the instrument thereof Romans 10. 14, 17. Act. 15. 7.
,

Q. How does the word work faith?
A. The Law prepares for it Gal. 3. 24. Romans 10. 4.
, by convincing the soul of sin Romans 3. 20. and 7, 9, 10.
, and terrifying for the same Romans 4. 15: Exodus 20. 18, 19.
, through the work of the spirit of bondage Romans 8. 15.
:

Q. And what does the Gospel?
A. It presents the excellency and worth of Christ as an only and alsufficient
savior Ioh. 3. 16. Act. 13, 38. 39. 1 Timothy 1. 15.
; but withal convincing the soul of its great sin in not believing in
Christ Ioh. 16. 9.
, of its utter insufficiency to come to him Ioh. 6. 44.
, and its great unworthiness Luke 3. 4, 5. and 15, 17, 18, 19.
to have any part or portion in him.

Q. What follows hereupon?
A. Hereby the soul feeling it self to be utterly lost is further and more
kindly broken and humbled, Luke 19. 10. Isa. 61, 1, 2, 3. Math. 11. 20. Zac:
12. 10.

Q What else is done by the Gospel in the working of faith?
A. It sweetly encourages poor lost souls to come to Jesus Christ Mat: 11.
28. Ioh: 6. 37. Isa. 55. 1. 2. ^2 Cor: 5. 20.
, and enableth them so to do, rolling and resting themselves upon him John 6.
44, 45 Ier. 3. 22. John 13. 15. Romans 1. 16.
, by the help of the spirit of grace Zac. 12. 10.
, which is ministered thereby Gal. 3. 2. 2 Cor. 3. 8.
,

Q It seems then you make Christ the object of faith?
A. Yea; not only the whole truth of God Act. 24. 14.
, but specially Christ Jesus as he is set forth in the promises of the gospel,
is the object of saving faith Ioh. 3. 16. Act. 16. 31.
,

Q. Wherein does the nature of this faith consist?
A. Not only in knowledge of the revealed will of God Romans 10. 8, 14; 15.
; and in assent to the truth thereof Act. 24. 14.
; for so much may be found in devils Iam. 2. 19. Mark. 1. 24.
.

Q. What is there more then this in saving faith?
A. There is also a coming unto Jesus Christ Ioh. 6. 35. 44, 45, 65.
, with affiance Ephesians. 1. 12. 2 Timothy 1. 12. Isa. 50. 10.
, and reliance upon him Cant. 8. 5.
,

Q. What is the subject in whom this faith is wrought?
A. This faith is not wrought in any reprobate but only in the elect Romans 8.
30. Act. 13. 48. Ioh. 6, 37. and 10. 26.
; and not only in the understanding, or only in the will but in the whole
heart Rom: 10. 10. Act. 8, 37.
.

Q. And what an heart is it in whom this faith is wrought?
A. Only the heart of such an one as is now a poor, lost and brokenhearted
sinner: Math. 9. 12, and 11, 28. Luke 19. 10. and 3. 4, 5, 6.

Q. Why say you so?
A. Because till the heart be thus prepared, men will never come to Christ John
5. 40. Rom: 10. 3. Ier. 2. 31, 36. Luke 15. 16.
, nor can they truly believe on him John 5 44.
,

Q. What think you then of those who profess themselves to be true
believers, and yet were never in any measure thus prepared and humbled?
A. The case of such professors is very dangerous.

Q. Why say you so?
A. Because the fallow ground of their hearts being never broken up, they do
but sow among thorns Ier. 4. 3. 4.
, and so the stoninesse of their hearts not being removed by any sound and
thorough work of contrition and humiliation, therefore though they may for a
time receive the word with joy, and believe for a season, yet they are like to
be but temporary believers, and in time of temptation fall away Matthew. 1. 3. 5,
6, 20, 21. Luke 8. 6, 13.
,

Q. You have showed the cause, and the object, the nature and subject of faith;
tell me now what are the principal effects of faith?
A. Hereby we have union with Christ himself John 12. Ephesians. 3. 17.
, and so communion with him in all the benefits which he has purchased for the
Elect Romans 8. 32. 1 Cor. 3 22.
.

Q. What understand you by union with Christ?
A. That spiritual conjunction 1 Cor 6. 17.
between Christ and the believer whereby the believer has possesion of Christ
as his own 1 Ioh. 5. 12. Cant. 2. 16.
, dwelling in Christ Romans 16. 7. 2 Cor: 5. 17.
, and Christ in him Ephesians. 3. 17. Ioh. 6. 56:
, and is made one spirit with him 1 Cor. 6. 17. Ioh. 17. 21.
.

Q. By what comparisons or similitudes is this union expressed in Scripture?
A. It is expressed by that union that is between the husband and wife Ephesians. 5.
23.
, the vine and the branches Ioh. 15. 4. 5.
, and the head and the members Col. 2. 19. Ephesians. 4. 16. 1 Cor. 12. 12.
.

Q. What benefit comes to believers by means of this their union with Christ?
A. Being one with Christ, therefore Christ will be sure to take all their
Injuries and afflictions as if they were his own Act. 9. 4. 5. Math. 25. 40.
45.
, will free them from condemnation Romans 8. 1.
, and afford unto them communion with him in all his benefits 1 Cor. 3. 22. 23.
,

Q. What are those Benefits of Christ wherein believers have communion with him
by virtue of this their union?
A. Some of the principal are Justification Romans 3. 24. Acts 13. 39.
, Adoption John 1. 12. Gal. 3. 26.
, and Sanctification 1 Cor. 1. 30. and 6. 11. Ephesians: 5. 26.
, besides which if God give us Christ, he will with him freely give us all
things also Rom: 8: 32.
.

CHAP. 24. Of Justification and of Adoption.
Q LEt us come to the first of these benefits whih is our justification; and
first tell me what is the meaning of the word to justify?
A. It does not signify to make an unjust man just by changing his qualities;
for then it were all one with sanctification from which it is distinct 1 Cor 6.
1. 1.

Q. What then does it signify?
A. To Justify is frequently opposed to condenme Prove. 17. 15. Dent. 25. 1.
Mat. 12. 37. Romans 8. 33.
, and therefore it does properly signify to acquit from blame and punishment

Q. What is the cause of our justification.
A. The impulsive cause that moves God to justify a sinner is nothing else
but his free grace: Romans 3 24. Tit 3. 7.

Q. What is that for which God does justify?
A. God does not justify us without righteousness; for then how should God be
just Exodus 34. 7. Romans 2. 2. Genesis 18. 25. Prove 17. 15.
? but he justifies us by and for a righteousness which is most exact and
perfect.

Q. What is that perfect righteousness?
A. Not our own righteousness in obedience to the Law Romans 3. 2c. Gal. 3. 11.
and 2. 16. Psalm. 143. 2. Phil. 3. 9.
, for that is most imperfect Isai 64. 6. Psalm. 130. 3.


Q. What righteousness is it then?
A. That perfect righteousness whereby we are justified is that righteousness
which was wrought by Christ, and inherent in his person, Isai 45. 24, 25. Ier.
23. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 30. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Romans 5. 18, 19.

Q. How comes the righteousness of Christ to be ours, that we may be justified
thereby?
A. God does graciously impute it to us Romans 4. 6.
, and faith is the instrument for the receiving of it Romans 3. 28. and 4. 5. and
Gal. 2. 16.
, that so by it we may be justified;

Q. Open this a little further, how faith is considered when we are said to be
justified by faith?
A. Faith is not considered in justification properly, as if the very act of
believing were the matter of our righteousness; neither does it justify as a
work or virtue in us by any merit of it self.

Q. Why may not faith be considered in our justification as a work or virtue in
us?
A. Because all works of ours are excluded from being any cause or matter of
our justification Romans 3. 28. Gal. 2 16. Phil. 39.
; and therefore if faith were so considered, it must then be excluded also;

Q. How then is faith considered when we are said to be justified by faith?
A. Only relatively in respect of the object of it, which is Jesus Christ and
his righteousness.

Q. Faith being not considered in our justification properly as a work or
virtue in us, it must needs then be considered relatively in respect of Christ
the object of it; but how may the truth of this yet further appear?
A. As the Scripture says we are justified by faith, so it also says Christ
is our righteousness Ier. 23. 6.
, and that we are justified by Christ Acts 13 39. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
.

Q. What else may be said for the further clearing of this truth?
A. Sometimes this phrase, to be justified by faith, is expounded in the words
immediately following, to be nothing else but to be justified by Christ, Gal.
2. 16. 17.

Q. What are the parts of justification?
A. Justification is only one benefit of God vouchsafed to believers; but
there are two parts thereof inseparably conjoined, namely, forgiveness of
sins through the sufferings of Christ, and accounting a man just and
righteous through the righteousness of Christ imputed to him.

Q. What is the object of justification, the persons whom God does justify?
A. Only the Elect Romans 8. 30. Isai 45. 25.
, being by nature and in themselves sinners and ungodly Romans 5. 4, 5. and 5. 10.
, but called by grace to be true believers in Christ Romans 8. 30 Gal. 2. 16.
Romans 3. 30.
.

Q. What is Adoption?
A. An act of Gods free grace 1 John 31.
, whereby the Elect Ephesians. 1. 5.
being in themselves aliens and strangers Ephesians. 2. 19.
from God, are upon their believing in Christ 2 Cor. 6. 17, 18. John 1. 12.
Gal. 3. 26.
admitted for Christ's sake John 1. 12. Gal. 4. 4, 5.
, on whom they do believe, into the household of God, and to the dignity and
privilege of his children Ephesians. 2 12. 2 Cor. 6. 18.
.

Q What are the benefits of this adoption?
A. By means hereof believers are brethren to Christ Jesus Romans 8. 29. Heb. 2.
11, 12. John 20. 17.
, have title to the heavenly inheritance Rom 8. 17.
and have liberty and boldness to make their requests to God Gal 4. 6. Romans 8.
15.
, as to a most gracious and loving father, with great assurance to be heard
Matthew. 7. 9, 10, 11.
.

CHAP. 25. Of Sanctification, and the difference between it and Justification;
and of four other benefits of Christ to believers.
Q. SAnctification being another of those benefits that come by Christ, and our
union with Christ, tell me first of all what Sanctification is?
A. It is a true and real change 1 Cor. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 5. 17.
, wrought by the Spirit of God 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
, in the Elect Isai 4. 5. Ephesians. 1. 4.
, now believing on Christ Acts 15. 9. and 26. 18.
: whereby the whole man 1 These. 5. 23.
is changed and altered from the turpitude and filthiness of sin 2 Cor. 7.
1. Ephesians. 4. 22, 24. Romans 6. 3, 4, 11.
, to the purity of the Image of God.

Q. What difference is there between the former benefit* to wit Justification,
and this of Sanctification?
A. The material cause of the one is the righteousness of Christ without us,
imputed to us Ier. 236. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Romans 46
: but the material cause of the other is a body of divine graces and qualities
infused into the soul, created in us 2 Pet. 14. Gal. 5. 22.
.

Q. How do they differ in respect of their formal causes?
A. The formal cause of justification is the pronouncing of the sentence of
absolution, and accepting a man's person for righteous: the formal cause of
Sanctification is the restoring o Gods Image into the soul, by putting off the
old man, and putting on the new, Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24

Q. How else do they differ?
A. Justification makes no real change in the soul, as when the Judge acquits
a man, but makes him never a whit the more honest then before; but
Sanctification makes a great change in the soul from sin and corruption unto
purity and holiness, Romans 6. 17. 1 Timothy 1. 13. 1 Cor. 6. 11.

Q. What may be a fourth difference?
A. Justification is perfect at the first, as one individual act; but
Sanctification is a graduall work, imperfect at the first, and growing by
degrees.

Q. Why do you say that Justification is perfect at the first?
A. Not in respect of the sense and feeling, and assurance of it, for these may
increase and grow daily, and are therefore daily to be prayed for, Mat. 6. 12.
Luke 17. 5.

Q. How then is justification perfect at the first?
A. In respect of the matter whereby we are justified, which is the imputed
righteousness of Christ, which is so perfect that a man can never have more
all the days of his life, though he should live as long as ever any did.

Q. Is not Sanctification also perfect at the first?
A. Far from it; for the honest men upon earth have been sensible of such
imperfection Romans 7. 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 23. Phil. 3. 12, 13. Isai 6. 5.
in their Sanctification, that they durst not stand to be justified before God
thereby Psalm. 130. 3. and 143. 2. Job 9. 2, 3, 14, 15, 20, 21.
.

Q. What proceeds from this imperfection of Sanctification?
A. A continual combat between corruption and grace in the sanctified soul,
Gal. 5. 17. Romans 7.

Q. And what else?
A. A continual exercise of repentance, and of fleeing to the grace of God in
Christ Jesus, Romans 7. 24, 25.

Q. Justification, Adoption, and Sanctification are excellent benefits that
come to believers through Christ; tell me what other benefits do accompany or
flow from these?
A. In this life there does accompany or flow from them assurance of Gods love,
lively hope, and expectation of glory, peace of conscience, and joy in the holy
Ghost, Romans 5. 1, 2, 5. and 14. 17. Tit. 2. 13.

Q. If these things be vouchsafed to believers in this life, what shall they
have in the life to come?
A. Unspeakable glory and happiness in the immediate fruition of communion
with God and Christ unto all eternity, Col. 3. 4. 1 John 3. 2. Heb. 12. 23. 1
Cor. 15. 28.

Q But may not a true believer lose his faith, and so lose all these benefits
that come by faith in this life, and fall short of eternal glory in the life
to come?
A. If he should finally lose his faith, it would be so indeed; but God that of
his grace has wrought this faith in him, will preserve and perfect the same
until the day of Christ, Phil. 1. 6. 1 Cor. 1. 8.

Q. Do you mean then that a true believer can never totally nor finally fall
away, but shall persevere in grace unto the end?
A. Yea, I mean so indeed; this perseverance of believers in the state of grace
being plainly and plenteously taught in the holy Scriptures, 1 Pet. 1. 5. Luke
22. 31, 32. John 17. 20, 21. and 10. 28. Mat. 16. 18. Ier. 3^. 40.

CHAP. 26. Of the necessity of faith, its imperfection at the first, and the
means whereby it may be increased: Of hearing the word, and of Baptism and the
Lords Supper.
Q. YOu have showed many excellent benefits that come by faith; but whether is
faith of such necessity that these things cannot be without it?
A. Such is the necessity of this grace of faith, that in respect of the usual
way of Gods dispensation, there is no hope nor possibility that a man should
escape wrath or attain happiness in this or in another world without faith,
John 3. 18 36. Mark 16. 16. Heb. 11. 6.

Q. Faith then is very profitable and necessary; but whether is it perfect at
the first, or grows by degrees?
A. The best faith is imperfect in this life 1 Cor. 13. 9, 12. 2 These. 1. 3.
with 1 These. 3. 10.
, and is usually little at the first Mat. 8. 26. and 12. 20.
, increasing and growing by degrees unto more perfection Romans 1. 17. 2 These. 1.
3. Job 17. 9.
.

Q. What are the ordinary and usual means for increasing of faith?
A. Hearing the word 1 Pet. 2. 2. Ephesians. 4 12. Pro. 1. 5. and 9. 9.
, Communion of Saints Psa. 92. 13 and 65. 4. 1 These. 5. 11.
, receiving of Sacraments Romans 4. 11. 1 Cor. 10 16.
, prayer Mark 9. 24. Luke 17. 5.
, reading Acts 17. 11, 12.
, meditation Psa. 119. 99.
and conference.

Q. When must we hear the word?
A. The usual and ordinary time is on the Lords day Acts 13. 14, 15, 16, 44.
and 20. 7. and Acts 15. 21. and Luke 4. 16.
, and other times also 2 Timothy 4. 2. Pre. 8. 34. Luke 10. 39, 40, 41, 42.
are not to be neglected, when God gives such opportunity.

Q What rules must be observed before we come to hear the word that we may
get profit thereby?
A. We must lay aside our sins 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Iam. 1. 21.
, seriously consider the weightinesse of the work we go about Eccl. 5. 1, 2.
, resolve to obey whatsoever shall be showed to be the will of God Deuteronomy. 5. 27,
28, 29. Ier. 42. 5, 6.
, and pray to him that he would teach us to profit Isay 48. 17. Acts 16. 14.
.

Q. What rules must be observed in hearing?
A. Reverent attention Nehem. 8. 3. Luke 4. 20. Acts 10. 33.
, with spiritual affections Mat. 13. 20. Luke 24. 32.
, giving credit to the truth Heb. 4. 2. 1 These. 1. 5.
, and applying the word unto our selves 2 Cor. 7. 1. Heb. 13. 5, 6. Psalm. 40. 7.
.

Q What must we observe after we have heard?
A. We must meditate of the same afterward Deuteronomy. 11. 18. Luke 2. 19. 51. Psalm
119. 97.
, confer of it with others Deuteronomy. 6. 7. Luke 2. 15. and 24. 32.
, pray to God for a blessing 1 Chro. 29. 18. 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7.
, and set upon the practice of what is required Iam. 1. 22, 23, 24, 25. Mat. 7.
24, 26. Ezekiel. 33. 31, 32.
.

and 26. 26, etc.

Q. What is the outward sign or part in Baptism?
A. Water Acts 8. 36. and 10. 47.
, and washing therewith Ephesians. 5. 26

, with sanctification in the mortifying of corruption, and quickening the soul
to newness* of life Tit. 3. 5. Ephesians. 5. 26. Romans 3. 4.
.

CHAP. 27. Of prayer, and some other means of increasing faith.
Q. WHat is the general nature of prayer?
A. Not only a wish or desire after this, or that; for a man may have so much
and never pray, Iam. 4. 2.

Q. What is it then?
A. Prayer is an opening of the desire of the heart before God Psa. 25. 1. 1 Samuel 1. 13
, whether it be by ffighes and groans Romans 8. 26, 27.
, or by words Hos. 14. 2. Psa. 5. 1.
, and other means John 17. 1. Lam. 3. 43. Ps. 6. 8 and 142. 2.
.

Q To whom must we pray?
A. To him that knows the heart 1 Kings 8. 39.
, and is almighty, and so able to help Heb. 5. 7. Genesis 17. 1.
, to him that is to be worshipped Mat. 4. 10
, and believed in Romans 10. 14.
, which is none but God.

Q. Whether must we pray to God directly and immediately, or through a Mediator?
A. Only through the mediation of Jesus Christ, John 146. and 16. 23. 1 Timothy
2. 5. Heb. 7. 25.

Q. What are the parts of prayer?
A. Petition and Thanksgiving, Phil. 4. 6. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17, 11.

Q. What is Petition?
A. A prayer wherein we ask the preventing or removing of things hurtful, and
the bestowing of things needful, Mat 7. 7, 8, 9, 10.

Q What is Thanksgiving?
A. A prayer wherein we desire that honor and glory may be given to God for
what we have received Psa. 50. 15.
, or do believe we shall receive hereafter 2 Samuel 7. 18, 19.
.

Q. Whether is not confession of our sins and miseries, and vows and promises
unto God, parts of prayer?
A. They may be called adjuncts of prayer, because they are to be expressed or
understood in every prayer.

Q. How may that appear?
A. By this, because to come to God for mercy without an acknowledgement of our
unworthiness and misery, and to desire him to perform what he requires of us,
is little better then a mocking of God.

Q. Are there any for whom we must not pray?
A. Yes; we must not pray for the dead, because we cannot do it of faith, as
having neither precept nor example, nor any good warrant for it in the world,
Romans 14. 23.

Q. Why else may we not pray for the dead?
A. Because such prayers cannot avail at all, but are altogether vain, 1 Pet.
3. 19. Heb. 9. 27.

Q. For whom else must we not pray?
A. We must not pray for the salvation of all men living universally, for that
is contrary to the revealed will of God Mat. 7. 13, 14.
; nor for any in particular that have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost 1
John 5. 16.
.

Q. For whom then must we pray?
A. For all other sorts of men now living 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2.
, both our selves and others Mat. 6. 9. Iam. 5. 16.
, whether they be friends or enemies Mat. 5. 44. Luke 23. 34. Acts 7. 60.
, and for some that shall live hereafter John 17. 20.
.

Q. Is there any rule of direction according to which we ought to frame our
prayers?
A. Yes, the whole will of God revealed for this purpose in the word 1 John 5.
14.
, and that pattern of prayer given by Christ unto his Disciples Mat. 6. 9.
.

Q. Seeing God knows all our wants before we pray, and has determined with
himself what he will do for us, wherefore then should we pray?
A. Not to inform him, as if he were ignorant of our estates, for he
understands our thoughts afar off Psalm. 139. 2.
nor to change his mind, for his purpose is unchangeable Iam. 1. 17. Psalm. 33
11.
.

Q. Why then?
A. We are therefore to pray, because God has appointed prayer to be the way
and means Ezekiel. 36. 37. 2 Samuel 7. 27.
whereby he will accomplish that which he has purposed to do for us.

Q. How must we pray that we may be accepted?
A. The persons praying must be righteous John 9: 31.
humble Psalm. 10. 17.
and upright Pro. 15. 8. and Psalm. 66. 18.
and the matter of prayer must be something lawful and promised Mat. 20. 22,
23.
.

Q. And what must be the manner of praying, and the end aimed at therein?
A. The manner must be in sense and feeling of our wants Isai 41. 17.
; with faith Iam. 1. 6, 7. Mat. 21. 22.
, fervency Iam. 5. 16.
, and perseverance Luke 18. 12. and
; and the end must not be that we may consume it upon our lusts, but for the
glory of God Iam. 4. 3.
.

Q. What other means are there for the increasing of faith?
A. Diligent reading of the holy Scriptures John 5. 39. Acts 17. 11.
, and serious meditation therein Psalm. 1. 2. and 119. 97.
, with frequent and holy conference with others Deuteronomy. 6. 7. Mal. 3. 16. Luke
24. 32.


CHAP. 28. Of the Church Catholic or Mystical, and the Difference between it
and particular instituted Churches.
Q. WHo is the subject of Redemption, or of all that deliverance obtained by
Christ?
A. Not the blessed Angels, because having never fallen they needed no
Redeemer, nor all the race of mankind, for Christ would not pray for the world,
John 17. 9.

Q. Who then were redeemed by Christ?
A. He gave himself for none others but only for his Church, Ephesians. 5. 25. Acts
20. 28. John 10. 15. and 11. 52.

Q. What is meant by the Church in the holy Scriptures?
A. It is usually taken in Scripture, either for the Catholic Church Col. 1.
18. Ephesians. 1. 22, 23. Heb. 12. 23.
which is called the Church mystical, or else it is taken for the Church
instituted, or particular Churches 1 Cor. 11. 16. and 14. 23, 33. and 7. 17.
Rev. 1. 4. and 2. 23.
.

Q. What is the difference between the catholic, universal and mystical
Church, and the instituted or particular churches?
A. They differ in their number; for the catholic Church is but one Church,
one body Ephesians. 1. 22, 23. and 4. 4.
but of the other sort in the days of the new Testament there are many
Churches Romans 16. 4. 1 Cor. 14. 33. and 7. 17. Rev. 1. 4. and 2. 23:
.

Q Wherein do they differ in respect of the matter?
A. The Catholic Church has none in it but Saints, and all true believers are
in it e: but particular Churches have some times many wolves within Mat. 13.
25, 27. Jude. 4. Act. 20. 29, 30. Rev. 2. 14, 15, 20.
, and many sheep without Isa. 56. 3. Ioh. 10. 16.
, though it ought not so to be: Ephesians. 5. 23, 25, 26, 27. Heb. 12. 23.

Q. What is a third defference between them?
A. The form which constitutes the Catholic Church is their union which
Christ by faith Ephesians. 1. 10. 2 Pet. 1. 1.
but the form of the other is the bond of an holy covenant Deuteronomy. 29. 10, 11,
12, 13. Ezekiel 20. 37. Ier. 50. 4, 5.
, to walk together in all the ways of Christ.

Q. Is there not some difference between them in regard of place?
A. Yes, for some parts and members of the Catholic Church are now in heaven,
and the rest shall all come thither in Gods appointed time Ephesians. 1. 10. and 3.
15. Col. 1. 20.
; but the members of particular or instituted Churches are all of them upon the
earth for the present, and some of them must never come in heaven Mat. 22. 14.
.

Q. What may be a fifth difference?
A. Whereas particular churches are visible to themselves and others also,
especially in times of pear Mat. 18. 17. Isa. 2. 2, 3. Rev. 11. 19.
, the Catholic church is properly a Church invisible.

Q How is that proved, that the Catholic Church is invisible?
A. Because some parts thereof are now in heaven: and those that are on earth
never were nor will be all together that they might be seen.

Q. What may be a further proof hereof?
A. Their union whith Christ which is the form of that Church, is known only
unto God.

Q Name a sixth difference?
A. The Catholic Church and all the members of it continue for ever Psalm. 125.
1 Ioh. 10. 28. and 1 Ioh. 2. 19.
; but particular churches! by persecutions and corruptions may come to be
utterly dissolved and extinct Rev. 2. 5. Romans 11. 22.
.

Q. What is a last difference between them?
A. The ordinary ministry appointed by christ is for the instituted and
particular churches, but not for the church catholic as such, because that
church has no Pastor nor Bishop but Christ.

Q. How may this appear that ministers are not ministers of the universal
Church, but only of some particular congregation?
A. The church to whom the ministry belong is to choose her own ministers Act
1. 23. and 14. 23. and 6. 3, 5.
but the unversall church never comes together to make any such choice:

Q. How else may this appear?
A. There is no part of the church to which the ministry belongs, but it
stands in need of ministers Ephesians. 4. 12, 13.
. but a good part of the catholic Church is glorious in heaven with Christ,
and therefore has no such need

Q. What may be a third ground hereof?
A. The flock of God over which the Holy ghost: does make men overseers, is
such as may be attended and watched over; even the whole flock and ministers
thereof Acts 20. 28. 1 Peter 5. 2, 3.
:

Q. And why may not the same be said of the Catholic Church?
A. Because that Church is so large that it is not possible for any man to
attend it or watch over it.

Q. Is there any evil in it for one man to be a Bishop or minister to all
Christians, where ever they be disposed of, and not only to one congregation?
A. Besides that such a man must needs neglect the greatest part of his charge,
it is a great part of the usurpation of the Bishop of Rome, for which he is
truly called Antichrist, that he will take upon him to be universal Bishop 1
These. 2. 4. Rev. 13. 16, 17.
over all the Christians in the world

Q Who is the head of the catholic church?
A. Only Jesus Christ Ephesians. 1. 22. and 4. 15, 16. and 5. 23. Col. 1. 18.
, as giving influence of life, sense and motion to the same, as the head does
unto the body:

Q Who are the members of that church?
A. Only they and all they that are effectually called to be true believers in
Christ: Rev. 17. 14. John 15. 19.

Q. What are the parts of the Catholic church?
A. According to the degrees of communion which they have with Christ, so that
church may be distinguished into that which is militant and that which is
triumphant.

Q. What is the church militant?
A. It is that part of the catholic Church which is warring and fighting here
on earth against spiritual enemies, the devil, the world and the flesh. Ephesians.
6. 12. Phil. 1. 30. and 2 Cor. 10. 4. 1 Timothy 1. 18.

Q. And what is the Church Triumphant?
A. It is that part of the Catholic church which are now in heaven, gloriously
triumphing over all those enemies which in this world they did conflict and
combat withal. Ephesians. 4. 13. Heb. 12. 23. Ephesians. 5. 27.

CHAP. 29. Of the instituted Church, or particular churches.
Q. WHat is the matter of particular or visible churches?
A. By the appointment of Christ all churches ought to consist only of true
believers Isay 52. 1. and 60. 21. Joel 3. 17. Rev. 21. 27. and 22. 15. Ephesians. 1.
1. Phil. 1. 1.
and all that are true believers ought to join themselves unto some church Mat.
28. 20. and 6. 33. Cant. 1. 7, 8. Isay 2. 2, 3. Zech. 8. 23. Acts 2. 41, 42,
and, 9. 26.
.

Q. If the matter of particular churches for the quality of it ought to be true
believers in Christ, what ought to be the quantity thereof?
Q No more in number in the days of the new Testament, but only so many as
may ordinarily meet together in one congregation, Acts 2. 46. and 5. 12. and 3.
2. and 14. 27. and 15. 25. 1 Cor. 5. 4. and 11. 17, 18. and 14. 23.

Q. Is any thing else needful to the being of a visible church but only the
matter above mentioned?
A. Timber and stones are not an house until they be compacted and joined
together; and as the humane soul and body are not man, unless they be united;
so believers are not a visible church, without some visible bond and union.

Q. And what is that bond that does unite them?
A. An holy agreement and covenant Deuteronomy. 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. Ezekiel. 20. 37. Ier.
50. 4, 5. zech. 11. 10, 14.
, with God and one another, to walk together in such duties of worship to God
and edification of one another as the Gospel of Christ requires of all
Churches and the members thereof:

Q. How many kinds of Churches are there?
A. The visible Church (if we speak of that which is truly so called) is one
and the same in essence, from the beginning of the world to the end thereof;
namely a company of people united together in the profession of the true
religion.

Q. But may not the true church be some way distinguished?
A Yes; for there is the church of the old Testament, and the churches of the
new: there are pure churches and churches that are corrupt; and besides these
that are true, there are also some that are false Churches.

Q. What is the Church of the old Testament?
A A company of people united together in the profession of such a Religion, or
faith, whereby men believed on Christ then to come.

Q. What is a Church of the new Testement?
A. A company of people united together in the profession of such a religion or
faith whereby men believe on Christ already come.

Q What are pure churches and churches that are corrupt?
A. A pure Church is such a church whose matter form, doctrine, worship, and
ministry is accordding to the appointment of Christ in the word.

Q. And what is a corrupt Church?
A. Such an one as in the things last mentioned or in some of them does swerve
from the appointment of Christ, yet still holding the foundation of salvation.

Q. How if their swerving be such as overthrows the foundation?
A. Then they cease to be a true church, and become either no church, or at the
best a false church.

Q. What is a false church?
A. One that is so exceedingly corrupt in regard of their constitution,
doctrine, worship, ministry, that if men believe and walk according
thereunto, they cannot be saved.

Q. And may not thus much befall a true church?
A. No; a true Church is either pure in these things, or if corrupt, yet not so
corrupt as to overthrow salvation.

CHAP. 30. Of the power or liberty of churches, and of church officers.
Q. WHat is the power or liberty of particular Churches?
A. It is not civil or worldly, for Christ's kingdom is not of this world John
18. 36.
; neither is it independent and supreme, for that belongs only to Christ
Matthew. 28. 18. Iam. 4. 12.
; but their power is Spiritual and ministerial.

Q. And wherein have they such power?
A. They have such power from Christ to exercise all the Ordinances of true
Religion, and to assemble together for the exercise thereof; and in particular
to choose Officers to themselves, and to practice Discipline or censures.

Q. Whether have Churches absolute power from Christ to assemble together for
the exercise of true Religion, or only so far forth as the Princes of the
earth shall give them leave?
A. Princes ought not to hinder these things, but to be nursing fathers to the
Church Ezra 6. 8, 11, 12* Isai 49. 23.
; and it is a great blessing of God when they are such Ezra 7. 27.
.

Q. But if Princes be not such, what ought the Church to do in such case?
A. They must not neglect to observe the commandments of God, for lack of the
commandment of man Mat. 28. 20. Acts 1. 15. and 21. 42. and 5. 12. and 6. 1, 2.
, because Jesus Christ who gives them commandment for these things, is the
King of Kings, and the Prince of the Kings of the earth Rev. 17. 14. and 1. 5.
.

Q. To whom belongs the power of choosing Officers to the Church?
A. The Church is to choose her own Officers, Acts 1. 23. and 6. 3, 5. and 14.
23.

Q. How may that be further cleared?
A. Either the Church must choose her own Officers, or else men may intrude
themselves; or Officers must be called immediately of God, or be appointed by
some other men: none of which may be affirmed.

Q. Why may not men intrude themselves?
A. No man must take this honor to himself to be an Officer in the Church, but
he that is called of God, as was Aaron, Heb. 5. 4.

Q. And why may not a man be called of God immediately?
A. Such kind of callings are not to be expected in these days, as being
particular to Apostles and other extraordinary Officers, Gal. 1. 1.

Q. But why may no other men appoint Officers to the Church?
A. Other men that are not of the Church have no such authority given them as
to appoint Offices to the Church.

Q. If men must not be Officers without a calling, and immediate callings be
ceased, and other men may not appoint Church Officers, it remains then that
the Church is to choose her own Officers: but unto what Functions must the
Church choose Officers?
A. Only to such Functions as are appointed by Christ in his word Mat. 21. 25.
and are of ordinary and perpetual use in the Church; for otherwise they
cannot expect that God will be with them in the choice, or bless the officers
unto them.

Q. What are the Officers appointed by Christ for ordinary and perpetual use
in the Church?
A. They are Bishops and Deacons Phil. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 3. 1, 8.
, which Bishops are also called Elders 1 Timothy 5. 17. Acts 20. 17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.
1, 2, 3.
more particularly, they are Pastors, Teachers Ephesians. 4. 11.
, ruling Elders 1 Timothy 5. 17.
, Deacons 1 Timothy 3. 8.
, and Widows 1 Timothy 5. 3, 9.
.

Q. What are Pastors?
A. They are Elders of the Chuch, who are to quicken the hearts of the people
unto all faith and obedience, and to reprove and comfort where there is need,
by attending upon Exhortation Romans 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12 8.
, with a word of wisdom.

Q. What are Teachers?
A. They are Elders of the Church who are to instruct the people in the good
knowledge of the Lord, and to refute error Tit. 1. 9.
by attending upon teaching sound doctrine with a word of knowledge Romans 12 7.
1 Cor. 12. 8.
.

Q. What are ruling Elders?
A. They are Elders of the Church, who though they do not labor in the word
and doctrine 1 Timothy 5. 17.
, yet they are to guide the Church in comeliness and order, and peaceably
attending upon ruling with diligence Mat. 26. 5. and 27. 1. Luke 22. 66. 1 Cor.
12. 28. Romans 12. 8. 1 Timothy 5. 17.
.

Q. What are Deacons?
A. They are Officers of the Church, who are to retain, preserve, and
distribute Acts 4. 35. and 6. 2, 3. 2 Chronicles. 26. 20. and 2 Chronicles. 31. 14. Neh.
11. 16.
the outward Treasures of the Church, for the relief of the poor, and other
outward affairs of the Church, in simplicity and faithfulness Romans 12. 8.
Neh. 13. 13.
.

Q. What are widows and their works?
A. They are godly and ancient women, left desolate and destitute of outward
succor, who are to attend the sick, and such like offices as are more suitable
to be performed by women then by men, 1 Timothy 5. 9, 10. Romans 16. 1.

Q. What persons must the Church choose for these Offices?
A. Such members of the Church Ezekiel. 33. 2. Acts 6. 3.
, as by sufficient experience, time, and trial 1 Timothy 3. 10. and 5. 22,
, are known to be fitted with gifts 1 Timothy 3. 2, etc. Titus 1. 5, 6, etc. 1
Kings 12. 31. and 13. 33.
and graces from God for the places that the Church would put them in.

Q. How must Officers be put into their places?
A. All of them by solemn prayer unto God, and with imposition of hands upon
Elders and Deacons, and in the ordaining of Elders with fasting also. Acts 6.
6. 1 Timothy 4. 14. and 5. 22. Heb. 6. 2. Acts 14. 26.

CHAP. 31. Of Church Discipline or Censures.
Q. WHat is Church Discipline?
A. A personal application of the will of God by censures, for the preventing
and removing of scandals.

Q. What are the parts of it?
A. Binding and loosing Mat. 16. 19 and 18. 8.
, which may be also called retaining and remitting of sins John 20. 23.
; and the former is either Admonition 1 Thessalonians. 5 14. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 15.
or Excommunication Mat. 18. 17. 1 Cor. 15. 5.
.

Q. What persons are subject to Church Censures?
A. All and only they that are member of the Church, Mat. 18. 15. 1 Cor. 5.
12. Psa. 149. 4.

Q. In what way, and by what steps and degrees must an offending brother be
dealt withal?
A. If the matter be private, I must first reprove him privately; if this do
not win him, I must then take one or two more, Matthew. 18. 15. 16.

Q. How if this also prevail not?
A. Then the matter must be told unto the Church, and the Church must
publicly admonish him; and if he do not hear the Church, he is to be
excommunicated, Mat. 18. 17.

Q. In what manner must admonition or reproof, whether private or public, be
administered?
A. Sometimes with meekness Gal. 6. 1.
, and sometimes with severity and sharpness 1 Cor 4. 21. 2 Cor. 13. 2. Gal. 3.
1.
, according to the condition of the person sinning, the sin committed, and
the manner of doing Jude 22. 23. Number. 12. 9, 10, 14.
.

Q. How else?
A. Always with due solemnity, as an ordinance of God Mat. 18. 15, etc.
, in the Name of Christ, and so that the winning Lev. 19. 17. Gal. 6. 1. Mat.
18. 15, 16.
of the party must be the thing that must be aimed at.

Q. What is Excommunication?
A. A putting away, or cutting off from the communion and fellowship of the
Church, 1 Cor. 5. 2, 13. Gal. 5. 12. Mat. 18. 17.

Q. For what sins must men be excommunicated?
A. For heinous and flagitious k offenses being publicly known, and for other
offenses persisted in with obstinacy after due admonition Mal. 18. 17.
. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 4, 5.

Q. For what end should men be excommunicated?
A. For the healing of the offender 1 Cor. 5. 5. 1 Timothy 1. 20.
, and for the preserving others from sin Deuteronomy. 17. 13. 1 Timothy 5. 20. 1 Cor.
5. 6, 7.
, and for the glory of the Name of God which is blasphemed because of the sin
of Church Members 2 Samuel 12. 14. Romans 2. 24.


Q. How should a man behave himself toward them that are excommunicated?
A. He must avoid all Church Communion with them Matthew. 18. 17.
, and all voluntary civil fellowship 1 Cor. 5. 11. 2 These. 3. 14.
, that may argue approbation or familiarity: But not such duties as men are
bound unto in natural or civil respects r John 18. 36.
.

Q. When must a man under censure be loosed and forgiven?
A. When he gives such signs of repentance as may satisfy rational charity
that the sin is truly subdued and mortified, Luke 17. 3, 4. 1 Cor. 5. 5. 2
Cor. 2. 6, 7, 8.

CHAP. 32. Of the life that beievers ought to live in the world, and of the Law
of God.
Q. WHat ought to be the life of them that are in Christ?
A. A course of holy obedience, and service to God all the days of their life,
Luke 1. 74, 75. 1 Pet. 1. 14, 15, 16, 17. Tit. 3. 8. Ephesians. 2. 10.

Q. What is the general rule of obedience?
A. Not the commandments of men Hos. 5. 11. Col. 2. 22.
, nor that which is good in our own eyes Deuteronomy. 12. 8.
, but that will of God which is therefore revealed unto us that we might do it
Mat. 6. 10. and 26. 39, 42. Ephesians. 6. 6, 7. Deuteronomy. 29. 29. Micah 6. 8.


Q. Whether may not unbelievers perform duties of obedience?
A. They may perform many things which are good for the matter of them Isai
58. 2. Mat. 6. 1, 2, 5. and 23. 2, 4, 5.
, but not so as to please God in any thing they do Heb. 11. 6. Mat. 7. 18.
John 15. 5.
.

Q. If they cannot please God in any thing they do, had they not best then to
neglect goods duties altogether?
A. Not so: for they are nowhere exempted from the commandment.

Q. Are believers able to perform obedience to God?
A. They are able by the power of Christ that strengthens them, to do the will
of God in some measure of truth, as being now alive from the dead, and created
in Christ Jesus to good works, Phil. 4 13. Ephesians. 2. 10. Romans 6. 11.

Q. But can they do this in such perfection as the Law of God requires?
A. No, in no wise Exodus 28. 38. Neb. 13. 22. Isai 64. 6.
, and the reason is because they know but in part 1 Gor. 13. 9, 12.
, and have flesh dwelling in them, and lusting against the Spirit Gal. 5. 17.
Romans 7. 14. 21, 23.
.

Q. Should they not then omit good duties altogether, seeing they cannot
perform them in that perfection which the Law requires?
A. Not so, but do them in uprightness of heart, as God shall enable them
Mat. 5. 16. Col. 1. 10.
, because God of his mercy through Christ has promised to pardon their
infirmities and sins, and to accept their sincere, though weak endeavors
Mal. 3. 17. 2 Cor. 8. 12. Number. 23. 21.
.

Q. What is the special rule according to which the life of a christian ought
to be framed?
A. The life of a christian ought to be framed according to the morrall Law of
God, Romans 13. 8, 9. Ephesians 6 2, 3 Iam 2 8.

Q. How may that be further cleared?
A. Because christians are not set at liberty to sin Romans 6. 1, 15.
, and no man knows what is sin but by the Law Romans 7. 7. and 3 20. 1 John
3. 4.
.

Q. How else?
A. Because in the new covenant God does not promise to take away the Law, but
to write it in our hearts Ier. 31 33. Ezekiel. 26. 37.
.

Q. What rules are to be observed for our better understanding the
commandments of the Law?
A. Every commandment of the Law is spiritual. reaching not only to the
outward man, but also to the heart, soul, and conscience, Romans 7. 14. Mat. 5.
22, 28.

Q. What is another rule?
A. Under the negative part the affirmative is comprehended, and under the
affirmative the negative, Mark 3. 4. Psalm. 34. 14.

Q. What may be a third rule for the same purpose?
A. Under one vice forbidden, all of the same kind are forbidden also; with all
the causes, occasions, and signs thereof. And under one duty are commanded all
of the same kind, with all the means and helps thereof.

Q. What may be a fourth rule?
A. God requires not only that we keep the Law our selves, but that as much as
is in us we cause others to keep it also.

Q. How many are the commandments of the Law?
A. In respect of the general heads they are ten Deuteronomy. 4. 13. and 10. 4.
; but all may be referred to two kinds: duties to God in the four first
Commandments, and duties to our neighbor in the six latter.

Q. What is the main scope of the first commandment, Thou shall have no other
Gods before me?
A. Here is required all that natural worship of God, whether the same be
inward or outward, which is such as if there were no Law prescribed, yet if we
well know his nature, we would undoubtedly perform it to him.

Q. Name some principal duties that are here required, with the contrary vices
forbidden?
A. Here is required faith in God 2 Chro. 20. 20. Psalm. 27. 1. 3. and 37. 3. 5.
, love to his Majesty Deuteronomy. 6 5. Mat. 10. 37.
, and hope in him Lam. 3. 23, 26. Ier. 17. 13. Psalm. 78. 7.
, hearing his voice Ier 13. 15. Isay 58. 2. Acts 16. 14.
, calling upon him by prayer Psalm. 50. 15. and 32. 6. and 65. 2. Phil. 4. 6.
, and such like.

Q. And what are the evils forbidden in this first commandment?
A. Here is forbidden Atheism Psalm. 14. 1. Titus 1. 16.
, Ignorance of God Psa. 79. 6. Ier. 10. 25. John 8. 19.
, unbelief Isay 7. 9. Heb. 10. 38. Ier. 17. 5, 6.
, despair Genesis 4. 13. Mat. 27. 3, 4. 5.
, pride Acts 12. 23. Dan. 4. 29. 30. and 5. 20.
, hatered Romans 1. 30. Psalm. 139. 21.
, and contempt of God Exodus 5. 2. Psalm. 10. 13.
, and all inordinate setting of our hearts upon any creature Ier. 17. 5. Math.
10. 37. Ephesians. 5. 5. Phil. 3. 19.
,

Q What is the maine scope of the second commandment?
A. The second commandment enjoyneth all that worship of God which is by
divine Institution and ordinance Mat. 28. 20. Deuteronomy. 12. 32.

Q What are some of the particulars?
A. The public and solemn preaching and hearing of his word Deuteronomy. 33. 10.
Acts 15. 21. Luke 4. 15, 16.
, and prayer 1 Timothy 2. 1, 2. Acts. 3. 1. and 16. 13. Luke 1. 10.
