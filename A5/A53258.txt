THE Old CAVALIER.
To an Excellent New TUNE.
Licensed according to Order.

^

I.
HE that is a clear
Cavalier,
will not repine;
Though his Treasure grow, so very low,
he cannot get Wine:
Fortune is a Lass,
She will embrace,
and destroy;
Freeborn Loyalty, will ever be,
Sing Vive le Roy:
Virtue is her own Reward,
and Fortune is a Whore;
There Is none but Knaves and Rogues regard
and does her power implore:
He that is a Trusty Roger,
and will serve his King;
If that he be a Ragged Soldier,
he will skip and sing:
But they that Fight for love.
Does in way of Honor move;
While they that make sport of us
'Faith we'll flatter them,
And will scatter them,
When that Loyalty
Waits on Royalty;
They that wait peacably,
May be successfully
Crowned with Crowns at last.
II.
Firmly let us then
Be Honest Men,
and stick to Fate;
We shall live to see, true Loyalty,
valued at a high rate:
He that bears a Sword,
Or a Word,
against the Throne,
Or profanely prate, to wrong the State,
has no Title to his own.
What though the painted Plumes and Players
are the prosperous Men;
Yet we'll attend our own Affairs,
when we come to it again:
Treachety may be faced with light,
or Leather lined with Fur;
A Cuckold may preferment get,
it is Fortune de la Gur.
But what is that to us,
Since we are all Honest Men?
We'll Conquer and come again,
Beat up the Drum again:
Hey! for Cavaliers,
Ho, for Cavaliers,
J^y for Cavaliers,
Pray for Cavaliers:
Dub a dubb, dub a dub,
Have at old Beelzebub,
Presbyter stinks for fear:
Fanatics they shall down,
And every Rebel Clown,
We'll Rally and to it again,
Give them the Rout again:
When they come again,
Charge them home again,
Fly like Light about,
Face to the Right about,
Tan tara rara Tan,
This is the Life of an
honest Old CAVALIER.
