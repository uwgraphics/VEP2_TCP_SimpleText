Monmouth Degraded Or James Scot, the little King in LYME A SONG
To the Tune of Hark, hark, the Thundering Cannons roar, etc.
I.
COme Beat Alarm, Sound a Charge,
As well without as in the Verge,
Let every Sword and Soul be large,
To make our Monarch Shine Boys:
Let Us leave off Whores and Drunken Souls,
And windy words over briming Bowls;
Let English Hearts exceed the Poles,
Against Perkin, King in Lyme Boys.
II.
Such a Fop-King was never before
Is Landed on our Western shore,
Which our black Saints do all adore,
Inspired by Tub-Divine Boys:
Let us assume the Souls of Mars,
And March in Order, Foot and Horse,
Pull down the Standard at the Cross,
Of Perkin King in Lyme Boys.
III.
Pretended Son unto a King,
Subject of Delights in Sin,
The most ungrateful Wretch of Men,
Dishonor to the Shrine Boys;
Of Charles and James, the undoubted Right
Of Englands Crown and Honors Bright,
While he can find us work, let us Fight,
Against Perkin, King in Lyme Boys.
IV.
The Sainted Sisters now looks Blew,
Their Cants all False if God be True,
Their Teaching Stallions dare not do,
No more but Squeeze and Whine Boys;
Exhorting all the Clowns to Fight
Against their God, King, Church and Right,
Takes Care, for all their Wives at Night,
For Perkin, King in Lyme Boys.
V.
Poor Perkin now, he is no more,
But James Scot, as he was before;
No Honor left but Soul to soar,
Till quite expired with time Boys
But first he will call his Parliament,
By Ferguson and Gray's Consent,
Trenchard and all the Boars in's Tent,
Fit for the King in Lyme Boys.
VI.
Against these mock Kings, each draw his Sword
In Blood we'll print them on Record,
Traitors against their Sovereign Lord,
Let Us always Fight and join Boys,
Now they are Blocked up by Sea and Land,
By Treason they must fall or stand,
We only wait the Kings Command,
To Burn the Rogues in Lyme Boys.
VII.
But now we hear they are sallied forth,
Front and Flank 'em, South and North,
Nobles of brave Englands Worth,
Let your bright Honors shine Boys*
Let Guns and Cannons Roar and Ring,
The Music of a Warlike King,
And all the Gods just Conquest bring,
Against the Rogues in Lyme Boys.
