A New Presbiterian Ballad to the Old Tune of The clean contrary way.
I.
Alas poor Whiggs, our Senat's gone,
Our Glory's now a setting:
The Popish Plot's laid at our door,
A Bastard of our getting:
Our bloody Cheats, and Shifts and Tricks,
And all our Devilish Play
Will be disclosed and we proved Saints
The clean contrary way.
II.
Discoverers will Discovered be,
As paultry Purjur'd stuff,
And we the Hellish Plotters, that
Prepared such Hell-hound-Proof:
We had the face to guild their Vice,
And them like Saints display,
And wheedled them to swear the Truth
The clean contrary way.
III.
We made their piteous Nonsense good,
And Contradictions true,
And relisht their unlikely Tales,
So blundring like blind Hugh.
What car,d we, if they damned themselves?
So we obtained the day,
And meritorious make our work
The clean contrary way.
IV.
When men did scruple to believe
Things, so absurd to Reason,
We scorned Reasons Balance, and
We still cried, Treason, Treason:
When the Informers halted had
Our hubbubs bore the sway,
Affrighting folks into their Wits,
The clean contrary way.
V.
^ch Toolls we raked for Evidence,
Like those, that search in Ditches,
and darksome holes for poisonous Toads,
(...) hungry sucking Leeches:
(...) for more guile,
(...) guiltless betray:
(...) whi^ ^'l reap a sweet reward
The clean contrary way:
VI.
We made the Papists Traitors all,
That none the Snare might escape,
And all the Royal Protestants
We would bring in the Trap:
They must be Romanizers too,
What ever they do or say
And Zealous wishers to the Pope
The clean contrary way.
VII.
The Realms Religion, that is by Law
In its Establishment,
We made as if afraid to lose,
Though from it we dissent;
The Church of England in the dust
That Level we would lay
To show our selves true Protestants
The clean contrary way.
VIII.
The long-black-rebel-Parliament
We stood to vindicate,
We blossomed new in the good Old Cause
Of Commonwealth and State;
Yet Monmouths Duke cried up the while
And used him like a Toy
A future Monarch he is designed,
The clean contrary way.
IX.
'Twas such, as we, for Charles the first,
With many a Protestation
His Glory did so much pretend,
His Weal and Preservation;
But drew the Sword against his Friends,
And forced them all away,
And him forlorn they did preserve,
The clean contrary way.
X.
It Was such, as we, the second Charles
Did scornfully disown,
Called him the common Enemy
Debarred him from his Throne:
Who now, but we, cry out of Plots,
And for his safety pray,
And stand up stout in his defense
The clean contrary way.
XI.
It Was such, as we, in Scotland late
Twice actually Rebel'd,
And (Maugre all the Mercy here)
Our English venom swelled:
We to Oblivions Act so kind
Unkind Oblivion pay
Like cherisht Vipers yielding thanks
The clean contrary way:
XII.
Yet we assumed the confidence
Tho conscious of what is past,
To busy our Petitions bold,
So frequent and so fast:
Instead of Blessed, we Blasted are,
Alack and well aday!
And we henceforth shall trusted be
The clean contrary way.
London printed in the Year 1681.
