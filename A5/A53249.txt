and Wardens of every Hundred and Corporation, and of every officer within every
Parish; and that a true account be given by the several persons before named
upon a good penalty by Fine and imprisonment as shall be thought meet.

That it please your Majesty to consider the Cry of the poor in the streets,
which comes through Idleness and for want of work, and neglect and want of
Maintenance for them and their poor children; by all which means aforesaid
being prepared, there is neither blind nor lame, nor aged nor idle person, but
may be put on work and employed, and your Majesty's subjects provided for, and
your Majesty's Navies and Armies furnished both with provisions for themselves
and with faithful subjects, soldiers and seamen.

That it will be more ease for your Majesty's subjects to maintain the poor at
work then to maintain them in idleness, and the avoidance of the poor
attending at Assizes and Sessions, for there are more poor people und one
thereby, then peace preserved. And by work it is more for the glory of God, the
honor and safety of your Majesty's royal person and Kingdoms, for it is
observed that through gaming and idleness comes nothing but swearing,
imbesling estates, blaspheming, destruction of young Gentlemen, Apprentices and
others, and all manner of Rebellion, Robbery, Murder,, Luxuriousness, poverty
both to people and kingdoms, and all manner of vices and sins let in thereby.

To prevent all pilphering, sheep stealing, robbing of Henroosts, and breaking
up of houses, and such like fellows.

That an Act be made that in every Parish there be kept one or more
Bloud-hounds that will draw dry-foot at the charge of the Parish.

It is also observed, in reading of some ancient Authors, as The Dial of
Princes, and other Books, where there were grave Sages that caused Laws to
avoid Idleness, and that caused all people to be set on work, that the
Emperors and other States and Kingdoms were able to defend themselves, and
the Kings and People blessed: but when Idleness crept in, and work laid aside,
all mannet of sins sprang amongst them, and Rebellion followed, and what comes
of Rebellion and Idleness I humbly submit.

Your Majesty's most Faithful, and Obedient poor Subject, WILLIAM OKEHAM.

FINIS.
