A PARTICULAR NARRATIVE Of the Burning in the Port of Tripoli, Four Men of War,
belonging to those Corsairs, By Sir John Narbrough, Admiral of His Majesty's
Fleet in the Mediterranean, etc.
FRiday, the 14th of January, 1675/6. I being before Tripoli in Barbary, with
His Majesty's Ships under my Command, namely these, Harwich, Henrietta,
Portsmouth, the Anne, Christopher and Holmes Fireships, and two Merchant Ships,
Guiney and Martin, attending on me for Convoy to Scanderoone.

I hoped to have made an honorable and lasting Peace; but the Dey, and
Government of Tripoli refusing to make restitution for the Injuries done to His
Majesty, and His Subjects; I seeing four of the Tripoli Ships of War of
considerable force in the Port of Tripoli, preparing to go out to Cruise, I
then having the Fireships with me to supply me with Fireworks, I fitted a
Fire-boat accordingly out of them; Commanding that all the Boats of my
Squadron, being 12 in number, should be manned, armed, and fitted with
Fireworks: Also I ordered a considerable Officer to be Commander in every
Boat, and my Lieutenant Cloudisley Shouell to be Commander in chief of them
all, I being resolved, by God's permission, that Night to attack the Enemies
Ships in their Port, gave directions requisite for such a design. About 12 of
the Clock in the Night, my Boats resolvedly entered the Port, seized the
Guard-Boat, boarded the Ships, fired them, and utterly destroyed them all; some
Turks and Moors slain, the rest fled to save themselves. These four Ships lay
under the Deys Castle walls, which was all that were in the Port, excepting a
Tunis Merchant Ship, which I ordered should not be meddled with, so escaped
firing. This Action was performed in less than an hours time, without
sustaining the least damage on our part, more than the expense of some
Ammunition, Fireworks, and Fire-boat, which effectually were bestowed as
designed, to the great astonishment of the Turks that endeavored to impede our
design, by plying several great and innumerable small shot at our Boats and
Men, which were within Pistol-shot of the Deys own Castle and Palace. Such was
the wonderful mercy of Almighty God toward us, That not one Man of ours was
killed, wounded, or touched, nor a Boat any ways disabled, but all returned in
safety, bringing the Guard-boat, two Moors, and the Turkish Colors of the four
Ships in triumph along with them to my Ship. Our Men employed in the Boats in
this particular Action, were 157, they all behaving themselves as becomes
Englishmen. And for a present Reward of their good Service, I caused the next
day 1956 pieces of Eight to be distributed among them, as will appear by the
following List.

From on Board His Majesty's Ship Harwich, at Maltha, Febr. 18. 1675/6. John
Narbrough.

The 26th of January, I fired about One hundred shot into the City of Tripoli
amongst the Inhabitants; the first and third of February I took and destroyed
five Corn-boats, on the Coast, to the Eastward of Tripoli twenty Leagues, and
Landed, and Burned a Stack of Wood and Timber, which was for Building their new
Ships, and some small Masts and Yards, and some Bags of Bread brought off, and
two Guns spiked up, which could not be got off, it beginning to blow, and
likely to be bad weather, so I was constrained to leave them, and to repair on
Board, and leave the Coast. The 10th instant, the Portsmouth took a Samberkeene
in her Ballast, 30 Leagues to the Eastward of Tripoli, she belonging to that
Government; the Moors got all on shore, the Samberkeene she brought unto Maltha.

John Narbrough.
