CHRISTIAN READER,
I Have here only briefly given thee this Meditation as an addition or step
forward, in the love of God to mankind to see his special love to Believers,
and how they may walk in it, which thou and I attaining, our grows to the
harvest, and perfection in the harvest will be certain, which being my desire;

I Rest Thy well-willer in and for Jesus Christ THO. MOORE.

A MEDITATION Of Ioh. 15.9.10. and occationly from 1. to 10.
Ioh. 15.9. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you, continue yea in
my love.

Ioh. 15.10 If yea kyepe my commandments, yea shall abide in my love, even as I
have kept my Fathers commandments, and abide in his love.


THE coherence of these words with the former show them to be a farther
encouragement exoitation, and direction to Christ's disciples for abiding in
Christ, and that he by his word, and Spirit may abide in them, for he had
before been instructing, admonishing and encouraging them to abide in him, and
he in them.

Verse. 1.5. I am (says Christ) the Vine, the True Vine, a vine was known to
them, to be one of the trees of Gods Creation, and provision for man such a one
as brought forth such fruit, as did testify the goodness of God to man, Zack.
8.12. such a one as in the promise, or giving of which was employed, plenty,
peace, and safet ye, Deuteronomy. 8.7.8 9. Ier. 31.4.5.8. I. King. 4.25. Such as the
fruit thereof did cheer both God, and man because being filled with his
goodness, they offered of it to God, and drank thereof in their sacrifices,
with thanks to God, which he accepted, and confidence in God, in which they
were refreshed. Psalm. 116.11. to 19.

Now that Jesus Christ is the Vine, the True Vine, is for such as they noe hard
saying to understand, according to the letter, which is the sense the words
import; seeing the Scripture menciones two men or two Adams, the first man, who
is the first Adam; and the second man, who is the last Adam. 1. Cor. 15.45.47.
And suitably two creationes; the first Creation, Genesis 1. and 2. And a new
creation, Rev. 21.5. The first Adam, being natural, and earthye, and so the
old creation, that is supported for him, 1. Cor. 15.46. Psalm. 75.3. The second,
or last man being spiritual, and heavenly, and so the new creation completed
in, and through him. 1 Cor. 15.46. Isa. 65.18.19. So as when in Scripture, we
read of vine, fig tree, door, etc. as it speaks off, and is aplyableto the
first man with the first creation for him, and things pertaineing thereto, we
may understand it suitably, whether naturally, or metaphorically, yet ever as
the words in that sentence, and buysinesse import, which is the litteral sense;
or as it speaks of the second man with the new creation completed in, and
through him, and things pertaining thereto, we may understand it spiritually,
whether in more general, or more peculiar sense; yet ever as the words in that
sentence, and buysinesse import, which is also the litteral sense; and so
according to the letter, or words written in this buysinesse. I am the vine;
being spoken by, and of Jesus Christ the spiritual man, and the things of him;
it shows plainly, that verily.

I. He is the vine; the tree of life. Rev, 2.7. and 22.1.14. The green
Olive Tree in the house of God. Psalm. 52.8. Their green fir tree, from whom
their fruit is found. Hos. 14.8. And so the vine as here, Verse. 1.5.

II. He is the vine, or fruitful tree of Gods provision, and preparation for
man; for the good of man, 1. Pet. 1.2. Isa. 42.1. 1. Ioh. 4.14. In, and through
whom is testified, the goodness, and love of God to mankind. Isa. 55.1.4. Ioh.
3.16.17. And his peculiar love to his chosen. Romans 8.32. Joh. 9.3.6.

III. He is the vine, whose fruit cheareth both God, and man; he has in man's
nature, and stead so dyed for man's sins, and risen for man's justification,
and offered up himself such a perfect, and acceptable sacrifice to God for man;
that in him mercy, and truth are met. Psalm. 85.10. And it is as i^ all had
dyed. 2. Cor. 5.14. And with him, yea, in him God is well-pleased, Mat. 3.17.
and 17.5. And through him light and mercy is extended to men, filling them with
good, Joh. 1.4.5.9. Act. 14.17. So as in beholding, and receiving his love hee^
through testified; they may give thanks to God, and be comforted in God, Psalm.
107.21.22.42.43.

IV. He is the vine, in which is all fullness of liveing, and quickening sap,
that effecteth-life, and fruitfulness, it pleases the Father that in him
should all fullness dwell, Col. 1.19. All fullness of grace, and truth, Ioh.
1.14. Grace is powered into his lips, Psalm. 45.2. He is immeasureably anointed,
and filled with the Spirit. Psalm. 45. Isa. 42. and 61.1. In him are hid all the
treasures of wisdom, and understanding, in him dwells all the fullness of the
Godhead bodily, Coll. 2.3.9.

V. He is the vine, in promising of whom God promises, and in giving of whom
God gives, and in receiving of whom believers receive, plenty of durable
riches. Pro. 3.13.18. Wisdom, righteousness, etc. 1. Cor. 1.30. Enheritance,
Ephesians. 1.11. Kindred, Mar. 3.35. Pleasures, Psalm. 16. Utt. Also peace, even peace
with God, in conscience, with brethren, and toward men; peace passing
understanding, that will keep the heart, and mind in Christ, and joy in the Holy
Ghost, Romans 5.1.2.5. and 14.17. Phill 4.4.5. And safety for suport
preservation, and eternal salvation, Joh. 10.28.29.

VI. He is the vine, in and through whom al spiritual, and quickening sap,
and power of the devine nature flows, that brings forth good grapes, or
fruits that are acceptable, that will either satisfy or be gathered of his
Father, and him, Psalm 52.8. Hose. 14.5.8. 1. Pet. 2.5.9. 1. Joh. 5.12. Joh.
3.6. Cant. 4.1.14. and 5.1.

Thus is Jesus Christ the vine endeed, and not only allegorically, and
metaphorically, but minding the buysinesse spiritually, he is so truly, and
really, and other natural, and earthy, yea or metaphorical vines, are so
called in respect of that which they resemble, and show forth of some small
goodness of his in whom the true good is; verse. 1 I am (says he) the True
Vine) And this may be understood, in oposition too, or respect of others that
are so called, or in soom sort are vines.

I. The natural vines, the trees so called, that bring forth such fruits as
aforesaid, truth these vines, are vines endeed, as Creatures that have their
being, support, fruitfulness, and operation of their fruits from God through
Christ. Ioh. 1.4.11. Psalm. 75.3. Coll. 1.17. Without whose word, or
forth-putting of his blessing, those vines languish, and bring forth noe
fruit, or bringing forth fruits, yet cannot nourish, nor are accompanied with
those blessings of plenty peace, and safety. Deuteronomy. 28.30.40. Hab. 3.17. Ames.
4.9. Hag. 1.6. and 16.17. So as these are but servants, isntrumental, and
decayeing vines.

But Jesus Christ: even opposed to these is the True Vine, even that which
endures for ever, he in whom God dwells, and through whom God does all, so
as by his word of blessing men live, and the whole old, and decayeing creation
is supported for its time. Deuteronomy. 8.3. In him we live move, and have our being,
what ever fruit we eat, or drink. Act. 17.28. He is our life, and the
length of our days. Deuteronomy. 30.20. That so even that life that we live in the
flesh, and that part of it also that respects the body, and natural life,
we might live it by faith of, and dependence on him, that has loved us, and
given himself for us. Gall. 2.20. Who is the true, dureing, and fruitful
vine, the true vine eminently.

II. Adam, the first Adam; as the public man, and root out of which all men
come, metaphorrically may be called a vine, being a figure of him to come, Rom:
5.14. And all his children branches, and their works, or fruits grapes, this
in some sort may appear from that Rev. 14.18. And then Adam so considered is
appoluted and ecayed vine, in whom all sinned, and fiell under condemnation,
and death. Romans 5.12.18. And so all men that are the branches of him, as they
come out of him at polluted, and desiled. Romans 5.19. Ephesians. 2.1, And so bring
forth evil grapes, or fruits, the motiones of sin, working in their members,
and bringing forth fruit to death. Romans 5.21. and 7.5. So that Adam is but a
wild vine, and as we come from him, and abide in him; we can neither suck in
life, not bring forth any good grapes, or fruits: 1 Cor. 2.14. Ioh. 3.66.

But Jesus Christ the second man, the last Adam, the Lord; the quickening
spirit; he is the true vine, in that he as the public man has for men, and
in man's nature, in his own person by death, resurrection, and sacrifice taken
away sin, Ioh. 3.5. Wrought righteousness, and received eternal life in the man,
and for men, Romans 3.24. and 5.18. 1. Ioh. 5.11. So as all that come into him,
shall receive righteousness and eternal life, 1. Ioh. 5.12. That will enlive,
and renew them, and bring forth good fruits, Romans 5, 19. 2. Cor. 5.17. and 3.8.

III. The union, confederacy, and fellowship of the men of the world for
atayneing, keeping and increasing greatness, riches, fame, etc. looking
thereby, and relyeing on their pollicyes, and waves to obtain so as their
lives shall be more comfortable; this metaphorrically may be called a vine, and
they that are brought into this union, and fellowship, branches, and their
works, grapes, but this is as the vine of Sodom, their grapes gall, their wine
poison, Deuteronomy. 32.32.33. Whence such warning not to consent, or join with them
in their consideracy, Pro. 1.10. to 19. Isa. 8.11.12.

But Jesus Christ is the True Vine, In union, and fellowship with whom all that
come into that union, receive that which bring forth good fruits, his loves
better then wine; 1. Ioh. 1.3.4. Caut. 1.2.3.12.13.

IV. The state of the common wealth, and church of Israel, as it was appointed,
and ordered by God, and furnished with the word, and orracles with Priests,
prophets, kings; with temple, sabboths, sacrifices, was a right noble vine, and
fit to bring forth good grapes, yet really in all the outward, but as
apertaining to the flesh, and tipically, in siguring out the true; Ier. 2.21.
Psalm. 80.8.14.

But Jesus Christ is the True Vine; in whom the truth of all tiped is found:
he the word, Ioh. 1.1.14. The King, Priest Prophet, Heb. 3. and 7. The temple
of God, Coll. 2.9. The rest, Heb. 4. The sin-offering the meat offering, etc.
Ioh. 1.16.17. and 14.6.

V. The convocation of the feyned, and professed children of God in their laws,
precepts; doctrine, and fellowships, ar called metaphorrically, a vine; and
their scocieties vinyards; and their doings grapes, but all vain, empty and
bitter, Cant. 1.6. Mat. 15.1.9. Isa. 66.5. A burden to all the true borne
seed, Gall. 4.28.

But Jesus Christ is the True Vine, In union with whom, and in whose teachings,
and opperationes: real comforts ar met with, Ioh. 16.27. and 14.21.23. and
15.1.10.

VI. The members of Christ in their several scocieties, in union with Christ,
and one another are vines, Cant. 2.15. and 6.11. and 7.12.

But Christ is the True Vine; He in whom they have their being, and from whom
their growth, and name of vine; he of, and in himself in his own person is,
the vine, they neither in, nor of themselves are so, but as they are in, and
one with him; whence the particular persons, scarce so called, but the
societies, as they are one together in him; who is the green tree, from whom
their fruit is found Cant. 4.15. Psalm. 52.8. Hose. 14.8.

So that if we would have the preparation for life, God has made receive the
testimony of love he has given, and receive his promises with which comes
plenty, peace, and safety, drink of the wine that cheareth both God, and man,
have the spirit of life, and be fruitful in it; Abide in Christ: he is the
vine in which all this is, if we would be freed from being snared with outward
mercies from perrishing in the polutiones, and witherings of Adam; or by the
polutiones of the world, or documents of men: if we would not rest in shadows,
nor be puffed up by grace received; if we would enjoy the blessing in mercies,
and the life that is for ever, and so receive saving comforts, and
refreshings; Abide in Christ: and know, that he, even he, and he only, is
verily, the True Vine, again; our savior having instructed them concerning
himself does likewise instruct them concerning themselves, in respect of their
condition in him, and in respect of him, and that he is; He the Vine; And to
them he says, Verse. 5. Yea are the Branches; he spoke too, and of his
disciples, that had received his word, were cleansed by it, and so in him;
Verse. 3.4, In which saying to his disciples, are two things very observable.

First that all men are not in Christ; al men are not branches in this True
Vine: Men are children of God, and so branches in this vine by faith in
Christ, Gall. 3.26. But all men have not faith, 2 These. 3.2. Some without
Christ, Ephesians. 2.12. Some writ in the earth, united in heart to earthy things.
Jer. 17.5.6.13. Rev. 13.18; Some still verily natural as they are of Adam, 2.
Cor. 2.14; Some of the worldly combination, all which lie yet in wickedness,
1. Ioh. 2.15. and 5.19. Yea and many in professed church assemblies, that yet are not in Christ, Cant. 1.6. Rev. 3.9. Yea it is very probable, that in
comparrison of others, they are but few that are branches in Christ, Isa. 53.1.
Mat. 7.14. Luke 12.30.32. True it is, Jesus Christ took the nature of mankind,
of al men, all that come of Adam, Act. 17.24. Ioh. 1.14. Romans 8.3. And in that
nature has dyed, and risen, and is glorified, and filled with life, and Spirit
for men, Romans 5.24. Ephesians. 4.8. Psalm. 68.18. But this nature of Adam or man,
Christ took of man, Heb. 2.14. Gall. 4.4. Not we of him this frail nature,
but he of us took this, whence he is called; the son of man, of Adam. Ioh.
5.14. Luke 9.56. and 3.38. And though in himself he has restored, and
glorified this nature for us, yet our coming in to him to partake with him is
by the Spirit, or power of the devine nature that is in him, 2. Cor. 5.17. 1.
Cor. 1.30.

And so al men by nature, and first birth be Adams sons, and as the Gentiles in
oposition to the Jews were of the wild Olive tree, so al men coming from
Adam, and remaining in their natural state, oposed to Christ, and those born of
him be of the corrupt, and pohited vine, dead in trespasses, and sius. Ephesians.
2.1.2.3. Yea even the Jews themselves, though branches of the true-olive: and
tipicall vine; yet in respect of spiritual one nesse in, and with Christ, they
by first birth are not branches in him, but children of the flesh, dead in
sins, Romans 8.9. And need a new birth to bring them into Christ, that they may
be branches in him. Ioh. 3.3.5.

So that noe man by his first birth is a branch in this vine nor any, but such
as are in some sort born again; so that though Christ has for all men taken
their nature, and restored it, yet al men are not in him, and so receive not
that restoration.

Secondly, we have to note, that; these spoken too, now were, but always had
not been branches in this True Vine; They were by nature dead in sins and
trespastes once, Ephesians. 2.1.2.3.4.5. Sometime of the world. Ioh. 7.5: out of
which they were since chosen, Ioh. 15, 16, 19. So that in this, that they were
now branches in this vine; we have four things considerable; I. How they came
to be branches in Christ the true-vine. II. In what sense they are said to be
in him. III. What degrees are considerable about being in Christ, as branches
in the vine. IV. What is intimated by their being in Christ, as branches in
the vine, and all this as Scripture shows, speakeing of such things, apeares
to be: That

I. Their becoming to be branches in this vine was not by, and according to
nature, and natural means; for Jesus Christ is a spiritual man, the Lord from
heaven heavenly, and so in that not like the first Adam, who was a natural
man, and had his posterity in his loins, to come forth of him by a natural
generation, 1 Cor. 15, 45, 47. Genesis 5, 2, 3, 4. But as the Lord Christ is a
spiritual man, so his seed is a spiritual seed, not naturally springing forth
from him, but supernaturally, and spiritually by a new birth from above:
brought in to him, Ioh. 3, 3, 5. and 6, 44, 45. So as none are branches in
Christ, but such as were branches of the first, and fallen Adam first, Pro. 8,
31, 32. Ioh. 1, 4. Whence that thinks for some, Romans 6, 17. So as for coming
to be branches in Christ, there must be a setting forth of Christ, to the
natural branches of Adam to be believed in. Romans 3.24, 25, 26. And therein a
taking out of the old Adam, and ingrasting into Christ the new; like that,
Romans 11, 17. And this is essected as the new birth, (being the same with it)
by water, and Spirit, Ioh. 3, 5. Isa. 44, 3, 4, 5. Ezekiel. 36, 24, 27. 1 Ioh. 5,
6.

I. By water; (which spiritually understood is) the free love of God in the
gift of his son, and commended through his son, as set forth, and declared in
the Gospel or word of grace; with such presence of spirit as makes it
discernable, Deuteronomy. 32, 1.2.3.4. Ioh. 3.5.14.15.16. 1. Ioh. 5.6.7.8. Which
shows how Christ was broken, and opened for us, Isa. 53; What God has done,
and prepared for us in him, 2. Cor. 5.19; And so evidenceth the love of God to
call, and draw us to him, Romans 5.8.10. Tit. 3.4.5. Ioh. 4.10; And so are they
begot to him by the word, Verse. 4. Iam. 1.18.

II. By the holy spirit of Christ or power of the devine nature, entering the
word into the heart, so giving light, and glorifying Christ to the heart, and
Gods love through him, 2. Cor. 3.3. Psalm. 119.130. Ioh. 15.26. and 16.14.15. 2.
Cor. 4.6. So as he thereby breaks of all old Adam like confidences, and in some
measure enables to believe in Christ, and so brings into him, enableing them to
receive the testimony, Phil. 3.3.7.8.9. Act 11.20.21. 1 Thessalonians. 1.5.2. These.
1.10; So as they begin to rely on God in Christ. Romans 4.22, 25. And to love
Christ and his 1. Pet. 1.8.21.22.23; And so come in to him to attend on him for
teaching, and life, Ioh. 6.67.68.69. In which teaching of his by his spirit,
they are united in heart; or spirit to him, and renewed, Tit. 3.5.6.7. 2. Cor.
3.17.18.

And so were these borne again, and brought into Christ and made branches in
him, Mat. 16, 16. Ioh. 14.14.17. and 15.14.16.19.

II. The sense in which they are said to be branches in him is likewise
spiritual, suitable to the spiritual man, and so not to be understood of a
carnal union, or in being, but of a spiritual union and in being in Christ,
the joyneing is by spirit, and union spiritual one spirit, 1 Cor. 6 17; And so
as he is in the believers spiritually and by spirit, and spiritual
opperationes, viz.

I. By his gracious word, by spirit put into their heart, Psalm. 119.130. Isa.
59.21. Ioh. 17.6.8. 2. Cor. 3.3. and 5.19.

II By that spiritual evidence, and testimony of himself, and his, and his
fathers love given into their heart, which he has enabled them to receive, and
hold, 1. Ioh. 5.10. 2. Tim. 1 12. Romans 8 15.16

III By his spirit, or spiritual disposition, and mind, infused to them, and
created in them; as indweller, and liveing principle, with its motiones Ezekiel.
36.26. Romans 8.9. 1. Cor. 2.16. 2. Cor 3.3. 1. Ioh. 3.24. Gall. 5.18.22.23. And
thus is Christ in them spiritually; and so, and in the same sense are they in
him, that is spiritually. And so.

I. By faith, or the spirit of faith, in receite of the testimonye coming in
to him, closeing with him, and relyeing on him by believeing in him, 2. Cor.
4.10.13. Gall. 3.26 29. Ioh. 1.12.13; And so in him by faith.

II. By love springing from his love shead abroad in their heart by the holy
spirit, by which they love him, and God in him; and him at the right hand of
God, and him in his spiritual presence in his people, Romans 5.5. 1. Ioh. 4 19
20.21. and 5 1. 1. Pet. 1.8 22, And so they cleave to him, and are in him By
love, desires, delight, and well-pleasednesse in him, Call. 3.1.2.11. 1 Cor.
16.22. Ioh. 14.21.23 and 16.27. Psalm. 73.25.

III. By a sweet, and hearty submission to be under his teachings, and in
fellowship with him, and his people, Psalm. 73.24. Ioh. 6.68.69. Gall. 2.20.

And thus were they in Christ by faith, and love, and delight in him, and
submission to his teachings, in spiritual fellowship with him, and his people
in his ordinances, Pro. 8.34.35. Psalm. 27.1.4.5; And thus were they branches in
this spiritual, and True Vine.

IV. The degrees considerable about being in Christ: as branches in the vine
are threefold, I. Preparing, and drawing to him, II. Establishing, and firmeing
in him, III. Farther rootednesse in known, and grown establishment and
fruitfulness.

I. In Some sense, or degree, or preparation, and drawing to a nighnesse with
Christ into the outward court of his temple, and under his shadow, and
teachings, into fellowship with his people, in his ordinances; to bear his
name, and so into the way in which waiteing they shall be fastened in him, as
that Psalm. 78.5.8. and Hose. 1, 1, 3.4; And this is when in the heavenly call,
or in the declaration of the Gospel, so much light; and power of the spirit
goes forth, that they are brought to diserne, and believe the truth of the
report, Gall. 3 1; So far as to admire the excellencies of Christ, and his
doctrine, Gall 4.14; To desire after him, Ioh 6.34 To yield to be his
disciples, to attend among his people in his ordinances and to make profession
of his name; so far those of whom Paul was yet afraid, Gall 4.11; Yea so far
those, 1. Ioh. 2.19. Yea so far Judas, and Simon Magus, Act. 8.13.

But yet these are not so prevailed with by the grace extended, as to yield up
so far to its opperationes, as to deny themselves, and let al their own
interests go for Christ; and so to be drawn out from the love and fellowship
of the world; in the estimate of, reliance one, and desire of retaining the
repute, and advantages of humane wisdom righteousness, honor, riches, etc.
and to have all their delighs and satisfying in Christ, who is not yet formed
in them, nor they yet come to keep sabbath in him; Gall. 4.9.19. Heb 4.1.4;
These also are of those that are called, but not yet chosen, and so though
with such chosen ones, as, 1. Pet 2.9; Yet not of them, 1. Ioh. 2.19. Though
while they abide, they are reckoned brethren, and together with the rest
branches in the vine, and in abiding, there is hope fullness, that they in due
season, shall be ingrated, and firmed; Gall, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 5.4.10. Yet
of these their be two sorts one sort, that are humbled, and gained through the
grace believed, to take heed to the word, as to a light shineing in a dark
place, 2, Pet. 1, 19. And in waiteing to yield themselves to obey the doctrine,
and grace of Christ and of these little fear, but great hope, Heb. 3, 7, 14.
2, Ioh, 9. The other sort such as do secretly allow themselves to satisfy
some pardominat lust, of coveteousnes, pride, etc. and as Judas and Simon
Magus, and of such, though while abideing, some hope they may be prevailed with
yet its but small and doubtful, and the fear great, 1, Ioh, 2.19. Whence that
destinction, Iud, 22, 23, And that exortation to one of these latter, Act, 8,
22, 23.

II. There is a farther degree, when through the grace believed in the heavenly
call, they are pervailed with, to suffer the loss of all for Christ and by the
power of the grace believed, enablied to take satisfying in Christ and heartily
to rest on god in Christ for eternal life, and all that apertaines thertoo,
and so given up to be the Lords, Act, 26, 18, Rom, 4, 23, 25. And heerin
receiveing in believeing remission of sins, and the spirit of adoption, to
inhabit, comfort, and lead them, Rom, 5, 1, 5. and 8, 2, 14, 15. They are so
knit to Christ, and to his chosen ones, that their delight is in him, and
fellowship with him; and them; so as they cannot depart from him, Ioh, 6, 68,
69, Ioh, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 2, 19, 20. Psalm, 16, 1, 2, etc. And thus are they by
grace chosen out of the world; the state, love, and fellowship of the world,
into Christ and love, and fellowship with him, and his, Ioh, 15, 16, 19, 1,
Pet, 2, 9. And so though weakness be found in them, and they may yet be
wanting in the fullness of joye, in respect of clear knowledge and usefulness
of their establishment, yet are they not of the world but in a stable
condition, and such as shall never be forsaken, Heb, 8, Ier, 31; And thus were
these spoken too branches in the vine, in Christ the True Vine.

III. Yet is there a farther degree of rootednesse, and growth in oneness in
this vine, such as was prayed for these that were already one in him, Ioh, 17,
20, 21; Which is in a more abundant, and bright discovery of the excellencies
of Christ in the hope of his call and glorious riches of his inheritance in the
saints, and the power of the resurrection, giveing more full testimony, and
knowledge of establishment and so full assurance, more conforming to Christ,
Ephesians. 1.14.17.20. Romans 8.16.17.32.33. etc. Which these also had after Christ his
assencion, and giveing of the Holy Ghost, 2. Cor. 3.18. and 4.6.

To those of the first degree is hopefulnesse in abiding; and the greatness of
the danger mentioned in unfruitfulnesse, and departure to those of the second
degree safety, though not always the knowledge, comfort, and usefulness of
it, and to loss of much may they come by unfruitfulnesse, and want of
constancy in abideing, in drincking in, and yiedling to the opperationes off
his grace.

To those off the third degree is assurance, and knowledge, and usefulness of
their safety, with more growth in rootednesse, and fruitfulness; Now this
saying in this place, Yea are the branches: is so ordered, that though it be
immediately, and directly spoken to those (at that time) of the second degree,
yet it has its usefulness to both the other, as is hinted in this already
said of them.

IV. That which is intimated, and set forth in their being affirmed to be in
him, and he in them; He the vine, they the Branches; and so branches in him,
is more then I can reach in my understanding, much less can I express it, but
according to what I am helped to understand, I will briefly mention as
according to Scripture I may.

I. Their union, that they are one in and with Christ, and as this in other
simillies is shown; as that of a marriage, in which is, a donation by God of
Christ to the heart, and of the heart to Christ an acceptance, consent, and
covenant between Christ and the heart, and a fellowship for fruit, in which
they become one Spirit, Romans 7.4.5. 1. Cor. 6.17. And that of a building, a
temple, or house, he the foundation; the believers together builded on him,
his temple or house, for an habitation of God, through the Spirit, 1. Pet.
2.4.5. 2. Cor. 6.16. In which is one-nesse, Ephesians. 2.19.22. And, that of a body
he the head, and the believers the members, united to him; al filled with, and
knit together, and led by one Spirit of life in him the head immeasureably, in
them according to the measure of his dispensation, flowing from him into, and
through each member, by which they grow up in him, and are compact together,
and so among them one Spirit, and one body, Ephesians. 4.15.16.4. and 5.30. And so
of a green olive tree, etc. And thus here of the true vine, and the branches;
which are but one tree, and so they were and all unfeyned believers are one in,
and with Christ by a devine faith, begot by a deviue testimony in their heart,
fastening in Christ, and by the operation of his devine love in their heart,
springing up spiritual, and devine love, closeing with, and cleaveing to him,
and by the operation of his inspired word of life, which they having received,
are by it subdued to his teachings, leading into fellowship with him, and such
union, and one-nesse have they as is before shown, in which they are one
Spirit with the Lord one body of the Lord, one Temple or house for the Lord to
dwell in; one tree or vine-tree, he the root, and main Body they the bows,
and branches, and so not only in him, but still entering into farther union,
and growth, for farther fruitfulness, Heb. 4.3. Not only in confidence in him,
love to him, and receite of teaching from him: but both in all this, and through
this into farther, one-nesse with him, and so with God the Father in, and
through him: into

I. One-nesse with God in his great desighne, of glorifying Jesus Christ; and
shewning forth all his goodness in, and through him; the great design;
purpose, and business of almighty God, is, has been, and will be, to glorify
himself, in glorifying his Son, that himself may be glorified in, and through
his Son; Ioh. 12.28. Pro. 8.22.31. Ioh. 5.20.23. The maine design of Christ is
the same, in all the glory he receives from the Father, Ioh. 17.1.6. and 7.18.
And the believers abiding in him, grow into union with him in this desighne, to
glorefy Christ that God may be glorified in, and by him, Phill 1.20.

II. One-nesse with God in spiritual habitation; in delightful love, and
well-pleasednesse, his delightful love, and wellpleasednesse being in his son,
and through him in all those made one with, and sons in his son, Mat. 3.17. and
17.5. Pro. 8.31. Psalm. 132.13.17. and 148.14. and 149.4; And so their delight,
and well-pleasednesse in Christ, and through him in all that by grace ar made
one in him, Phill. 3.3.8.9.10. and 4.4. Psalm. 73.25, and 16.2.

III. One-nesse with God in his will and love of compassion toward them that
are yet ignorant, and through ignorance unbeleeving; willing their
preservation, and repentance, waiteing with patience for them, and useing
means toward them, that they might repent, and come to life, 1. Tim. 2.4.
Psalm. 145.8.9.2. Pet. 3.9. Mat. 5.44.45. Tit. 3.2. Act. 26.18.

IIII. One-nesse with Christ in yiedling the flesh, or old man to be crucified;
to have the new revived, and so to live in the Spirit to God, Romans 6.3.6. Ephesians.
4.21.24. 1. Pet. 3.18. and 4.1.2.

And so one-nesse with Christ in all his interests, and privillidges next
mensioned.

II. These sayings you in me; I in you; I the Vine; yea the Branches (as also
the other simmilies of one-nesse between husband, and wife in marriage
foundation, and building in a temple, or house, head, and members in a body)
do set forth their interest and right to participation, and spiritual
participation in a first fruits now, and fullness in the harvest of all the
interests; privillidges, and riches of Jesus Christ, Ioh. 1.12. 1. Cor. 3.22.23.

So that verily His Father is their Father, Ioh. 20.17. " Psalm. 89.26. Romans
8.15. His Spirit is their Spirit, to dwell in, and comfort, and lead them,
Gall. 4.6.7. His Brethren their Brethron, Ioh. 20.17. Mat. 23.8. His Promises
their Promises That God has made stable in him for them, 2. Cor. 1.20.21. 2.
Pet. 1.4. And not only, his death is their death, and his resurrection their
resurrection; but his wisdom, righteousness, holiness, redemption, and life,
is their wisdom, righteousness, holiness, redemption and life, 1. Cor. ^.30.
Ioh. 14.19. Romans 8.2. Yea his people is their people, his inheritance, their
inheritance, Gall 3.29. Romans 8.17. And so his kingdom, and glory, their
kingdom, and glory, Luke 12.32. and 22.29. Coll. 3.4. Yea in a word, his
servants for attendance and service, be their servants for attendance, and
service. Heb. 1.6.7.14. Yea not only such, but his servants for use, and
advantage, besides their will are so, their servants also, 1. Cor. 3.22. So are
they interessed in all the privillidges of this True Vine, in the glorious
husbandman the living sap, the vineyard, and the fruits.

III. This sayeing you in me; I in you, I the Vine, yea the Branches does set
forth a great deal of honor, that God does put upon them according to that.
Ioh. 12.26. and 5.23. with 1. Sam. 2.30 In that as he does all things by
Christ, and shows forth his righteousness through Christ who is the
righteousness of God, in whom God dwells, and through whom the devine nature
shows forth its virtues, and opperationes Ioh. 1. Heb. 1. Ioh. 5.1. Tim. 3.16.
So now, as Christ is the fuitefull vine, even so the grapes, his virtues
shall be brought forth through them, 1. Pet. 2.9. He not only clothes them
with his son for their righteousness, Phill. 3.8.9. But also makes them the
righteousness of God in him, 2. Cor. 5.21. So as even his devine power in
Christ for convencement, alureing to Christ, comforting, edifying by Spirit,
shall be effected in their ministration by word, and conversation, Ioh.
16.7.15.1. Cor. 3.5.2 Cor. 13.1.2.3.1. These. 1.8. Yea his love, and mercies
shall apeare through their love and mercy, 2. Cor. 5.14.19.20. Yea his
righteousness shall apeare through them, and they shall be his witnesses,
Psalm. 92.15. Isa. 43.10.12. So now in a measure, and after in fullness will he
be seen, and admired in them, etc. A great honor. 2. These. 1.10. Psalm. 149.4.9.

IV. This their being Branches in Christ does father import, that al their
life, comfort, and fruitfulness, depends not on the first Adam, themselves
or any wisdom, strength industry, or creature at all, but him, and on him
only, so that being, and abiding in him, they receive life from him, who is
full of power love, and faithfulness and none can overturn him, In whom all
fullness dwells, and flows. Ioh. 1.14.16. Coll 1.19. Ioh. 11.25.26. and 14.19.

And as he instructed them about himself, and themselves so he instructed them
likewise about his father, the great Almighty God, the father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and in him the father of all that by faith are one him, Verse. 1. (As he
says.)

And my father is the Husbandman; which holds forth.

I. That he has made, and prepared this vine, as his own peculiar, the wine
whereof himself will drink, and with the same refresh his choice friends, Cant,
5.1. Psalm. 36.8.9. He found the ransom. Ioh. 33.24. He gave his son. Ioh.
3.16.1. Ioh. 4.14. He made him flesh. Ioh. 1.14. He made him to be sin, and
curse for us, 2. Cor. 5 21. Gall 3.13. He raised him from the dead; and made
him wisdom, and righteousness for us, Romans 4.25.1. Cor. 1.30. He has
accepted his sacrifice, and taken well-pleasednesse in him. Heb. 10.1.10. Mat.
3.17. and 17.5. He has filled him with spirit, and eternal life for men, and
so has made him a quickening spirit, Psalm. 68.18. Isa. 61.1.1. Ioh. 5.10.11 1.
Cor. 15.45. And so has set him forth for a propitiation, Romans 3.25. A
witness, leader and commander, Isa. 55 4. The medium of dispensing spirit,
Isai. 42 1.2. And coming into him, and of fruitfulness, Ioh. 10 9. So is he
the vine; the True Vine, which God has made, and prepared. II. That from the
beginning he by spirit, in such means, as he used has been drawing in some
to his son, and these are his chosen, his vineyard, in whom his word is put,
and so he in them, that from them he may be declared to others, Pro. 9.1.
Isa. 5. and 28.16. III. He still uses means through Christ, to make him
known, and so to open him, and call, and draw into him, and ingraft in him,
this being peculiarly in some sense the fathers work, Ioh. 1.13. Mat. 16.16.
Ioh. 17 6.7.8. and 6.44.45. and 3.14.15. Romans 5.8, 10.2. Tim. 1.9. And this he
does by his gospel, Romans 1.16. And that both in his servants ministration
thereof, Ioh. 17.20 23. Romans 10.14 15.17.1. Cor. 3.5. And also by his spirit
opperating therein, and therewith, Act. 11.21.2. Cor. 13.3. Whence that Act.
26.18. IV. That when God has made known his son by the Gospel; and vouchsafed
the ministration of it by his servants, with some motiones of his spirit
calling to Christ, and so into his vineyard, he (According to his nighdrawing
in the means, and drawing them nigh to Christ and his) looks that they should
bring forth fruits, Isa. 5.4. Luke 13.6. Even fruits of repontance, Mat. 3.
Faith, love, joy, peace etc. Gall 5.22.23. And glorifying him, that others
thereby might come to praise him, Mat. 5.16. V. When he has used such means,
and striven with them and waited for them his time, and some bring forth noe
fruit, that is suitable to the means, and for him, He takes them away,
either by taking gospel, and church state from them, Mat. 21.42.43. and
23.37.38.2. Chron. 36, 16 17. Isa. 5.5.6. Or by taking away his spiritual
opperationes from them, and so reprobating them, Ier. 6.16.31. Ezekiel. 24 13.
Mat. 3.1. Ioh. 2.19. Heb. 2.1.4. and 10.29.30. V I. Those which by the means,
and spirit therein do bring forth fruit he, purges that they may bring forth
more fruit.
I. He purges, and cleanses, by the grace, the promise^ the spirit given all
opperating, to reprove sin, Ioh. 16.8.9.10. To deny ungodliness, etc. Tit.
2.11.12. To cleanse from al (...) thinesse of flesh, and spirit, 2. Cor. 7.1,
And so is withering, a^^ crucifying the flesh, with the affectiones, and lusts
thereof Isa, 40.6.7. Gall. 5.24.

II. He purges by afflictiones, and correctiones (as often as need is) to
take down pride, break them of their enterprises, return them from their
strayings, and hasten them to himself, that they may being judged in the world,
not be condemned with the world, but partake of his righteousness 1. Pet. 1.6.
Ioh. 33.16.24. Heb. 12.6.11.1. Cor. 11.32. Isa. 27.8.9.

III. He purges them, in nurturing with the cross o^ Christ enabling them, to
suffer shame, loss, hard-ship, etc. for the name of Christ by whom the world
is made as a crucified thing to them, and they become as crucified to it which
freed from many snares, Gall. 6.14.2. Tim. 3.11.12.

And all this purging is, yt they may partake of the virtue of (...)
resurrection of Christ, and bring forth more fruit, Romans 6.4.5.6.

VII. He accepts, and treasureth up those fruits that are brought forth by
the opperationes of his spirit, in, and through those that abide in Christ and
make them useful, 1. Pet. 2.3.4.5.9. Cant. 5.1.

VIII. He owneth, knows, keeps, and approves, this vine, and vineyard,
and branches with the fruits thereof, Mat. 3.17. Psalm. 16.2. Tim. 2.19. Cant.
6.2.3. and 7.12. He has not only a right over them, to dispose of them, for so
all are his, Psalm. 119.91. The earth is the lords, and the fullness thereof, the
world, and they that dwell therein, Psalm. 24.1. Yea the whole field is his, Mat.
13.24. But these are his garden, Isa. 51.3. His vineyard, Psalm. 80.15. His
pleasant portion. Ier. 12.10. His peculiar, above all the field: his treasure.
Deuteronomy. 7.6. Psalm. 135.4. His enheritance, Deuteronomy. 9.26.29. And his jewels. Matt.
3.17. So that they are owned as his choice portion, with special love, care,
and portection.

And thus has he instructed his disciples, and us in them about, his father,
himself, and themselves, which as it might be a motive to deter all from
harmeing them, and to alure men to come, and suffer themselves by the doctrine
of Christ to be drawn forth of the field into this vineyard, and so into
Christ and a strong motive, to those that are in Christ, and have of his word,
and spirit in them, to abide, and walk in him, in the faith, and love of him
and submission to his teachings, and to have his word, and spirit, with al its
opperationes abiding in them; seeing they are in such a vine; and have such a
Husband man.

Again: As our Savior had been instructing his disciples, so he had been
admonishing them in warning them of the danger of unfruitfulnesse, and not
abiding in him, namely: I. That while they abide in the belief of him, and his
word enlightened to their heart: and in fellowship with his, and his word
abides in their heart, there is a possibillity of bringing forth fruit to God,
Psalm. 78.5.6.7.8. Act. 28.27. Heb. 4.12. And in suffering its opperationes, and
yielding up thertoo assurance of bringing forth fruit, Romans 12.1. 2. Goll.
3.16. Isa. 48.18. As here, Verse. 2.4.5.6. II. That not abiding in him, and his
word, but suffering it either to be stolen away, or not to have its
opperation, and rooting in the heart it is unpossible to bring forth fruit, that
will abide, or be accepted, Mat. 13.19.20.21. As here, Verse. 5.6. III. That
those to whom he is made known, and his word come, and they brought to the
vineyard, and bring forth noe fruit, God takes away in withdrawing his light,
and spirit from them, and so closes their eyes, and gives them up to
hardness, Ioh. 12.38.39.40.2. These. 2.10. And casts them forth, even from
the heart, and spiritual fellowship of his living people, Ier. 14.11. 1. Ioh.
5.11. and 2.19. and manifests them, 2. Tim. 3.9. Psalm. 12.5. IV. That when
they are taken away, and cast forth, they wither, and ar soon withered; their
moisture, light, zeal, and courage, and bewty is gone, Psalm. 125, 5.8. Ezekiel.
19.10.13. Iud. 12. As here. Verse. 6. V. That when they are withered, men
gather them, while they retained his word, and till the light sweetness, and
savor of it was dried up they could not be so easily drawn by Satan, or
lusts, or men, to other doctrine, or to idolatry, or oppression, persecution,
or the like but being withered, they are driven with every wind, and men gather
them to any superstition, oppression, etc. they turn into Egypt, or the world
again, and their sin grows ripe, and they become of the seed of the Serpent,
the worst of men, Iam. 1.14.15. In^. 4.5.12. Mat. 5.13. As here, Verse. 6. VI.
Men thus throw them into the fire, and they fall under the wrath of God, and
his angels shall bind them in bundles, and they shall be thrown into
everlasting fire, Pro. 7.7.27. Mat. 13.30.41.42. As here, Verse. 6.


A fair, and whole some warning, with might terrify any that receive gospel
from remaining as highway, or stony, or thorny ground, or harboring such a
secret evil disposition, as ludas, and Simon Magus did or from dispising the
word, and quenching the spirit, and it is a wholesome admonition to al
believers to shun all degrees of withdrawing and backssliding from faith, love,
or any opperationes of the grace and spirit of Christ, and now farther our
savior with this admonition joins, and gives to his disciples for quickening
up their spirits, a sweet, and foreceible exhortation, and encouragement, to
abide in him, and that he; and his word may abide in them, and this from
manifold sure grounds; and strong motives, that will meet in one, Viz.

I. The experience they had already found of the goodness of him, in, and by
the word he had spoken to them. Verse. 3. He had spoken, and given to them, the
word gospel or glad tidings of peace, remission of sins, and everlasting life,
which the father has prepared in him, which word, of gospel the father gave
him to spoke, Mar. 1.14.15. Ioh. 12.49.50. and 17.6.7. In which word, or
gospel is declared; The peace, or atonement, Christ by death, resurrection,
and sacrifice has wrought, and the fullness of grace, and truth i^ him; and
the greatness of Gods love in giving him, and h^^ readiness to accept all
that believe on him, Luke 24.46.4^. Ioh. 1.4.9.12.14.16. and 3.16.17. And the
father sending forth spirit in this declaration, did so enlighten their hearts,
an^ prevail with them that he therein brought them to believe Mat. 16.16. In
which repentance was wrought in them, an^ they received remission of sins, and
life, and so were turned from darkness to light, begotten to Christ made
clean, and righteous in him, and so sanctified to God, and had interest i^ the
things of Christ, Act. 11.18. and 10.43. Romans 5.1.5.8.10.11. Tit. 3.4.5.6. Ioh.
3.5. In which they expetimented his word to be the words of eternal life, Ioh.
6.68.69.

So that as in him, through that he has done in himself, life was prepared
for men, even so through him by his word and spirit bringing the word to their
heart, they had received of the life in him, and so experimented the goodness
of him in his word, and to them and such as they this must needs be a strong,
and forceible motive, to abide in the faith, and love of him, and to have his
word abiding, and opperating in them, Psalm. 119.93.1. Pet. 1.21.22.23. and
2.2.3. Whence that, 2. Pet. 1.9.

II. The power effecacy, and fruitfulness of the same grace, that will operate
and show forth it self in fruitfulness in those that abide in him, and have
his word abiding in them, Verse. 5. So that such as abide in mindfulnesse of his
word, and so in their belief, estimate, love of, and submission to him, and
his teachings, and so suffer his word to abide in them in its opperationes, it
will be profitable, and fruitful in them, and make them fruitful also, Heb.
4.12. Isa. 55.3.10.12. I. It will free them, not only from that casting of,
withering, and burning foremencioned, Ioh. 11.25.26. But also from those
outgoings, falls, snares heart condemnationes, and sore correctiones that others
by inconstancy, and forgetfulness of him fall into, Romans 8.1.2. Isa. 4.2.
Psalm. 119.9.92. 1. Cor. 15.1.4.

II. It will bring forth plenty of fruits in them, of love, joy, peace,
patience, meekness, heavenly desires, and motiones that will spring forth to
spiritual, prayers, confession, conversation, etc. Coll. 3.16. Ioh. 7.38.39.

III. It will lead too, and bring forth blessed fruits in their word, and
conversation for convincing unbelievers, aluring the convinced to Christ and
edifying believers, Isa. 61.3.7. 2. Pet. 1.7.8. 2. Cor. 13.18. And this also is
a strong and forceible motive to abide in Christ, and that his word may abide
in us.

III. The abundant love of the Father to Christ his Son, so that all that are
brought to, and abides in this his Son, and have him in his Word and Spirit
abiding in them, he loves them as he loves his Son, with the same delightful
love. Ioh. 12.26. and 14.23. and 17.23. And gives them eternal life, Ioh.
3.35.36. And whatsoever they ask of him; they abiding in Christ, and his words
in them; it shall be done to them, verse 7. Chapter 16.23.24.27. Which also is a
strong motive to abide in him, and that his words may abide in us. Pfall.
66.18.19.20.

IV. The assured comfortable issue of all, namely: That in his word abiding in
them, and they abiding in him, and so bringing forth fruits, their mayn
desighne, and buysinesse, even that in which they are one with God and Christ,
shall be accomplised, to the satisfying, and joying of their hearts, that is,
God shall be glorified, and so they shall be disciples, and followers of
Christ, like him endeed, verse 8. Phill. 1.20. Which is a sweet prevayling
motive; And how much more all these in one, the fore-experiments, and present
operation of his grace, the Fathers love, and answer of prayers, and glorifying
himself in their fruitfulness, is it a strong motive, to exort, and encourage
to abide in Christ, and to have his word abiding in us.

And our savior having thus already instructed admonished, and encouraged his
disciples, proceeds in the, 9. and 10. Verses. To a father encouragement
direction and instruction of them to this Abiding that their joy might be full.
From which practice of our savior might be observed.

I. That the work of the ministration of the Gospel is a continual work to be
followed, not only for bringing in men still to Christ, but even also for
building up, and encouraging those that are in Christ while they are in these
clay tabernacles, so was the ministration of the Gospel by Jesus Christ from
the beginning of it, from the baptism of John, till the day that he left the
world, Act. 1.21.22. Ioh. 16.28. and 17.4.12.13. And so was the ministration of
his servant till the time of their departure, 2. Tim. 4.6.7.8. 2. Pet. 1.13.14.
And such is the ministration of his servants still to be a continued work, and
that not only that they may continue being the salt of the earth, and the light
of the world, and by their light shining to win in men to glorify God, Mat.
5.13.16. But olso for such as God has blessed their ministration unto, and
made them instruments by which ye spirit has brought them to Christ enabled
them to believe on him, and writ his mind in their heart, they are not then to
cease their ministration toward them, but then to follow one, and more
abundantly to care for watch over, pray for, instruct, admonish, and encourage
them for their father building up, and preservation in the faith, and
provocation to love, and good works, 2. Cor. 3.2. to 17. and 11.2.3. Iud. 1.5.
Act. 20.28.

II. That those, who are through grace brought into believe, and so made clean
by the word of Christ applied to them, and so in Christ and he in them it is
meet, needful, profitable, and safe for them, to be still attending the
ministration of Christ in the Gospel, and to be further instructed,
admonished; exhorted, and encouraged, and that again, and again, while they
are in these clay tabernacles, 1. Cor. 13.10.12. Yea though they be sinceere,
and fruitful, Phil. 1.7. and 2.1.13. and 3.1.2.10. And know, and are
established in the present truth, 2. Pet. 1.12.13. Yea though their faith,
love, and hope be steadfast, and opperative, and their election of God so
testified as may be known. 1 Thessalonians. 1.3.5. and 3.2. Yet still the ministration
of the Gospel is meet, needful, and safe even for them, because of
oppositiones in flesh, and weakness, (and wants that yet may yet be found in
the usefulness) of their faith, and love, and orderly walking, 1 Thessalonians.
3.2.3.10.

And good ends, and reasons for both these points are given in the scripture it
self, as to instance briefly a few.

I. To stit up, and keep mindful, and waking the hearts of the believers, 2.
Pet. 1.13. and 3.1. That so they may not suffer that lose in opportunities
which forgetfulness, and sleepiness endangers too, Cant. 5.2.3.6.

II. To prevent, and save from seducements by false doctrine, which enstrange
from God, and Christ, 1. Cor. 15. to the end. 2. Cor. 11.1.2.3.11. 1. Ioh. 2.19.

III. To prevent, and save from the intisements, and deceitfulness of sinful,
and worldly lusts that withdraw from God, Heb. 3.1.12.13. 1. Ioh. 2.16.

IV. To edify in faith, love, and hope, 1 Thessalonians. 5.11. Iud. 20.21.22.

V. To provoke to fruitfulness in love, and good works, Tit. 3.8. Heb. 10.24.

VI. To help forward to fullness of joye, and comfort that may abide and hold
in times of tribulation, 1. Ioh. 1.4. 1 Thessalonians. 3.2.3.

So that in the truth of these two observationes, in Christ, practice, and
teaching it appears, that it comes not from the spirit of Christ for any
dispensour of the Gospel, to think, that when any are by their ministration
brought to Christ that they may then leave their care over them, and cease
their ministration toward them, all the scriptures of the Apostles show the
contrary. Nor is it from the spirit of Christ for any that in believing know
themselves in Christ, and he in them to conceit, they now need no more to
attend the ministration of the Gospel, the whole scripture shows the
contrary, and this might also be an exhortation to us, both to the use of, and
attendance to the continual ministration of the Gospel, 2. Tim. 4.2. Heb.
13.7.8, etc. Now in the 9. and 10. Verses: For the better, and more full
understanding of that which is therein held forth to us, it is meet first to
consider some circumstances about the words, and then that which is set forth
in the words themselves.

First: For the Circumstances, these three are considerable.

I. Who it is, that assirmeth so great Love. II. To; and off whom so great
love is affirmed. III. To what end the saying is recorded.

I. For the first, whose affirmation this is of so great, and peculiar love; It
is evident from the chapters before, and verse. 1. of this chapter, that it is
the affirmation of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God. Romans 1.4. Joh. 11.27.
And the Savior of the world. Ioh. 4.42. 1. Ioh. 4.14. And head, and husband of
his Church. Ephesians. 5.25.32. Who is the truth it self, Ioh. 14.6. All whose words
are truth, and nothing false, or wreathed in them, Pro. 8.7, 8. He of whom the
Father has born testimony. Mat. 3.17. Ioh. 5.37. He of, and to whom the Holy
Spirit of truth, has bo ne, and does bear testimony, Ioh. 15.26. 1. Ioh. 5.6.
He whose lips are full of grace, Psalm. 45.2. And in whose mouth was never any
guile found, 1. Pet. 2.22. So that of the truth, and verity of this
affirmation, how great soever it were great sin to doubt at all, and needful
it is, that we be firm in belief of this greatness, power love, and truth
of our savior his one-nesse with God, and his oneness with us, his love to
mankind, and his peculiar love to the church, that so we may firmly believe
the truth of this affirmation of so great love, etc. Ioh. 3.31.32.33. and 11.25.

II. For the second, who they are to, and of whom so great, and peculiar love
is affirmed, and invitation, and direction for abiding therein given it is
evident to be the disciples of Christ: Ioh. 13. And though they were the eleven
Apostles, Judas Iscariot being gone out, and their could be no more at that
time, because it would have been above a competent number for eating the
passover together, yet this affirmation was to them, as they were his
disciples, and did believe on him, and love him, and so concerned all that did
believe on him, and love him, as well as it did themselves that were present to
hear, and this appears by the terms, and titles, by which they were called,
as, His own which were in the world, Chapter 13.1. Which also were al given, and
brought to him by the heavenly call, Ioh. 6.39.44.45. and 17.2.8. And
disciples, Chapter 13.5.22.35. As all were that did believe on him, and love him,
Mat. 5.1.13.14.15.16. And little children, chap. 13.33. appliable to all that
believe on him, and love him, Ioh. 14.1. 1. Ioh. 2.12.13. And it appears
likewise by the new commandment given them, chap. 13.34. Which is given to all
that unfeinedly believe on him, 1. Ioh. 3.23.24. and 4.21. And it also appears
by the promise of the spirit to them, Ioh. 14.16.17. Which promise belongs also
to all that believe on him, Ioh. 7.38.39. Act. 2.38.39. And it appears also by
the metaphor, and expressiones used in this 15. chap. In which all that it said
of being Branches in him, Verse. 2.4.5. Of being clean through the redemption,
and propitiation in him, by his preaching the Gospel spiritually applied to
them, Verse. 3. Of abiding in him, Verse. 4. Of impossibillity of bringing forth
any spiritual, and acceptable fruit, without abiding in him, Verse. 4.5. Of
the withering of such as abide not in him Verse. 6. Of the acceptance, and
answering the prayers of such as abide in him, Verse. 7. Of the glorifying God
by bringing forth much fruit by those that abide in him and his wordin them,
Verse. 2.7.8. Every of which, and all of them applyable to every believer, Hose.
14.5.8. And nothing in all that is spoken which is so peculiar to the Apostles,
But that it appertains also to all believers, yea, and to the Apostles
themselves, rather as they were believers, then as they were Apostles, like
that, Mat. 16.16.17.18. So that the affirmation of this so great love, is to,
and of his disciples, that did believe on him and love him, in whom we have
for our better understanding, and use-fulnesse two things to be noted, one that
they were endeed, believers in, and lovers of him, the other, that at that
time, they were but babes, and cumbered with many infirmities.

I. They were such as by the spirit of grace enlightening the Gospel, or word
of grace to their haat, were brought to believe in Jesus Christ and in that
believing to love him, and so were also beloved of the Father. Mat. 16.16.17.
Ioh. 16.27. They were not such as did challenge an interest in him, and his
grace from any changes, or righteous works or frames of their own, like the
old Pharisees, Luk 18.9, 11. Or new followers of them that by such changes; and
works trusted in themselves that they were Christ's, 2. Cor. 10.7.12.18. Nor
were they such as were brought to believe only through an ignorant admiration,
and good persuasion of Christ occasioned by some reports, and sight of some
great, rare, and wonderful works done by Christ as Nichodemus before he was
borne again, Ioh. 3.2.3.5. Nor were they such as were brought to believe his
doctrine, and admire him only through the beholding some excellency in his
doctrine, and the heavenly, powerful, and majesticall manner of his teaching,
as those who were yet far from being borne again, Ioh. 7.46. and 8.30. Nor
gained only to some fleeting desires after good from him, as those, Ioh.
6.28.34. Who yet took offense at his doctrine, but they were such as were
brought to this their believing.

I. By a spiritual illumination, revelation, or secret spiritual evidence and
testimony given by God, through the Gospel to their hearts, evidencing to them
and enlightening them in the great love of God in the gift of his son, and in
the fullness of grace and truth in Jesus Christ and that he is endeed the
Christ the son of the living God, the savior of the world, who has made the
atonement, and in whom is life, in which discovery, and evidence, their hearts
were drawn to him, and enabled to believe on him, and love him, Ioh.
1.14.15.16. and 14 1. 1. Ioh. 4.14. Mat. 16.16.17. Isa. 55.4.5. Romans 5.1.11. 1.
Pet. 1.21.22.

II. By a spiritual communication, and infusion of grace by Christ into their
heart, Romans 5.5. Tit. 2.4.5.6.7. Christ revealing his father, and his fathers
love to them and so giving in his fathers words, or the Gospel he received to
minister into their hearts, in receite whereof they experimented love, and found
life even eternal life, and were thereby knit both in love, and considence to
him, Ioh. 17.6.8. and 1.16. and 6.68.69. 1. Pet. 1.21.22. and 2.3.4.5. Thus
through the Gospel with spiritual illumination, and communication of grace,
they did both believe in Jesus Christ, and love him unfeinedly: And such they
were.

II. They were such as (notwithstanding this their faith in Christ, and love of
him) were yet but babes, and subject to like infirmities, as we now are, and
that not only so far as those, who were farther grown, then these yet were.
Act. 14.14.15. Iam. 5.17. But as then weaker, and more liable to be foiled
with infirmities, and passiones in some measure; then such grown men were.

I. They were as yet to that time of this affimation, but babes, and weak in
the knowledge of heavenly mysteries, not yet able to understand parables,
though they were not of the most misterious parables, Mat. 15.16.17. Nor yet
apt to understand the sayings of their own master, and teacher, Mar. 16.6, 9.
Nor yet able to bear the sayings that Jesus Christ had to make known to them,
Joh. 16.12. Nor did yet understand the scriptures that spoke of the sufferings,
resurrection, and Kingdom of Christ, Luke 24.25.26.27.

II. They were as yet when this love was affirmed to them; but babes, and
weak, in respect of the rule, and opperation of grace, and their content
taking therein, and being formed to the likensse of Christ thereby, being at
some time ready to dislike, and take offense, at their masters plain speaking
of his cross, and sufferings, and to fault him, Mat. 16.21.23. Mar. 8.3.32.
Some times ready to wish vengeance on such as dealt discourteously with their
master, and them, Luke 9.53.56. One some occasion ready to envy one another,
Mat. 20.20.24.25. Sometimes to envy such as wrought miracles in the name of
Christ, and did not follow them and to forbid them, Mar. 9.38.39. Sometimes to
he striving, and reasoning who should be the greatest among them, Mat. 18.1.3.
Mar. 9.33.34.

III. They were as yet but babes, and weak for spiritual strength for
standing, and walking, either in approving things most excellent, or giving
excellent testimonies of love when tried, being sometimes ready to misjudge of,
and take offense at the excellent works, and fruits of love, both in lesus
Christ their Lord, and master, Mar. 3.20.21. Ioh. 13.8. And in such as greatly
loved him, Mat 26.8.16. And at one time of trial not able to watch with him one
hour. Mat. 26.37.40.41. And again in trial ready to withdraw though not from
their faith, and love; yet from the walking in, acknowledgement, and testifying
of their faith and love, Mat. 26.56.70. These, and such like infirmities were
they yet acumbred with which when they were better grown, they were more freed
from, Act. 4.8.12. and 5.29.41. Though in some trials, liable to be overtaken
with some infirmities still, Gall 2.11.12.

So that they were believers, and as yet but wake believers such as were yet
subject to many infirmities, and yet notwithstanding those infirmities, were
unfeyned believers, and lovers of Christ to whom our savior did affirm so
great love, with invitation, and direction to continue in that his love.

For the third, to what end, and for what use this affirmation, invitation,
charge, direction with promise of such peculiat love is written and lift upon
record to be read, preached, heard, meditated, and this appears to be.

I. More General, and common for all that come to hear, or read the same,
that in hearing, and reading they might believe the truth of this so great, and
peculiar love of Christ to those that are come into him, and believe on him,
and love him, that in belief thereof they might desire after him, and come in,
and submit to him, and receive his gracious words, that they also might
there-through be brought to believe on him, and love him, that so they might
come to partake of this peculiar love, Ioh. 11.42. and 17.21.22.23. and 20.31.
As Jesus Christ set forth the privilledges of his disciples, in the hearing of
the multitude, Mat. 5.3.8. That the multitude hearing the same might be alured
to become his disciples, that so they might also come to partake of such
privileges.

II. More special, and peculiar, for such as by the spirit of grace are
enabled through the Gospel in the knowledge of the propitiation made by Christ
and the eternal life that is in him, and the love of God in the gift of his
son, to believe the truth, and goodness of the report of the Gospel so as
there through they are convinced, and emptied of their former delight, and
considences, and alured, and overcome to submit, and come into Christ, Romans
6.17. Isa. 55.4.5. Ioh. 6.44.45. And in believing receive from God through
Christ: remission of sins, peace in conscience, and access to God. Act. 10.43.
Romans 5.1.2. Ephesians. 2.17.18. So as heerby they are enabled to believe, both the
redemption, and reconciliation wrought in and by Christ with God, which is in
him, and he is, and that reconciliation that by his spirit he works in men
to God, and the eternal life that is in him to bestow, and in this believing
to depend on him for the same, and in that dependence, to love both him, and
their brethren, Romans 5.6.7.8.11. and 4.22.25. 1. Pet. 1.8.21.22.23. These
though yet accumbred with such like infirmities, as these disciples were, are
yet true believers in, end lovers of Christ and built upon him, and in the same
condition, and so loved, even as they were, as is evident by comparing our
saviors profession to Peter, and Peter's aplication of the same to all unfeyned
believers, and lovers of Christ, Mat. 16.16.17.18. With 1. Pet. 2.3.4.5.9. And
our saviors promise to all so believing in, and loving of him, Ioh. 14.21.23.
And this affirmation, charge, and direction is recorded for their learning,
that through patience, and comfort of the scriptures, they may have hope, Romans
15.4. And so not only know; they are beloved, but even so beloved of Jesus
Christ, even as the Apostle writ to those that believed, and knew they had
life, that they might farther know this eternal life, and their having of it,
and so believe more, and more, and have their joy full, 1. Ioh. 5.10.11.12.13.
and 1.4. with Ioh. 15.11.

Object. It seems as if believers now could not have like assurance of such
peculiar love, and so such consolation in it, as the e had to whom Christ spoke
it, because they had it from Christ his own mouth, which none now can have
because he is in heaven.

Ans. This is a great mistake and wrong conception, confuted by our savior
himself, who before he lift the world did testify, that he would send another
advocate, and comforter, even the Holy Spirit of truth in his stead, and place
to be with the believers for ever, and that his Spirit should bring his words
to their remembrance, and teach them al things. Ioh. 14.16.17.18.21.23.26. Yea
so as it should be noe damage to them, that he left the world, and went to
his Father, but more gainful to them, then if he had not gone in bodily
presence from them. Joh. 16.7.8.15. And this Holy Spirit gives to believers a
twofold knowledge of this peculiar love, though not both always at once; and
this he does.

I. By making a man a believer, glorifying Christ so in his heart, as he not
only brings him to believe the propitiation made by him, but in believing that
love, and goodness to depend on God in Christ, for farther saving, and for
that eternal life that is in him, 1. Pet. 1.21. Romans 3.24, 25. and 4.23; 25.
and 5.8, 9, 11. And therein effects love, and a Christ-like disposition, 2,
Cor. 3.3. In which believing, he gives them interest in Christ, and in all that
is Christ, 1, Cor. 1.30. and 3.22, 23. And such in their believing veiw of this
affimation, and invitation, may know themselves so beloved, and envited of
Christ, and have the same assurance, and consolation thereof that these had to
whom Christ spoke. If not something more then they had till after his assencion,
that they received the promise of the more abundant portion of the Holy Ghost
compare, Romans 15.4.5. 1, Joh. 5.10.13. with Joh. 16.7, 15. and 30.31.

II. By a more peculiar witnessing such love as this into their believing heart.
Romans 8.15, 16, 17. By a supernatural illumination, and inspiration of his
gracious word, and promise into the heart, in which he cleares up, and sheads
abroad, even this peculiar love more abundantly therein, Ioh. 14.26. Romans 5.5.
Tit. 3.5, 6. By which Spirit Christ does manifest his presence with them, and
acquaint them with the things of the Father, and himself, which gives more
abundant consolation to the believers, as it did to these, when they received
the same, Joh. 14.21, 23. and 16, 13, 14, 15.7. Act. 2. Cant. 1.2.

And to this end was this recorded, that believers might know certainly their
interest in this peculiar love, and have the consolation of it, and wait
therein for the more full, and peculiar testimony thereof; and so great their
consolation thereby.

From these three things thus observed. (Viz.) That it is Jesus Christ, that
has affirmed so great love, etc. And that it was affirmed to believers, and
that it is recorded for believers, that they may know how they are beloved.

I. All that read, and hear the same should be stirred up, to obey, and
embrace the Gospel of Christ, in which not only deliverance from sin and death
is declared, and tendered, but also for such as do believe; such peculiar
love, and eternal life, to be farther found in Christ, and the greater grace
it tenders, the greater the sin, and the more woeful the condition of all that
do slight, and disobey the call thereof. Act. 8.38.39.41. Hose. 11, 7. Heb.
2.3. and 12.25. 2, These. 1, 8. Oh that men would believe, and turn.

II. Believers have good cause to praise, and glorify God for recording the
affirmationes of, and invitationes to such grace in the Gospel. Rev. 22.16,
17. And also, to give the more ernest heed to this great love, and to the
invitation, and direction for continuance therein; seeing it is from Christ to
them: Heb. 2.1, 4. And according to this threefold consideration view the words
themselves, now in the words themselves are three things considerable.

I. Our Savior serious affirmation of his love, and the manner of it to his
disciples, As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you.

II. His gracious exortation, invitation, or charge, Continue ye in my love.

III. His sweet, and safe direction how to continue in his love, including a
promise in it; If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even
as I have kept my Fathers commands, and abide in his love.

I. The first thing to be vewed in our Savior serious affirmation.

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. In which are two thingss
observable; One that our Savior loves his disciples, that believe on him, and
love him; and this put down inclusively, as a thing so known to them, that it
needed no affirmation; The other: that our Savior so loves them, as the
Father loves him, so that here are two things affirmed. I. Christ his love to
believers. II. The peculiarity, and manner of his love to them, whence spring
two observation to veiw.

Obs. 1. That Jesus Christ has loved, and does love all, that in the Heavenly
call are brought in to believe on him, and love him; and that with such an
apearing, and manifested love, that they may know he loves them, whence the
affirmation is here about the kind, and manner of his love, and not simply of
his love, as knowing they did not question that; For that is so abundantly
testified, that unless they close their eyes, and harden their hearts, they
cannot but know, and believe that he loves them, and that he loves them much.

I. In that he took our very nature upon him, and was made flesh yea for our
sakes took such flesh, and blood, as we have, subject to weakness, pains,
and death, and so not only being God, became man, but being in the form of
God, equal with his father in glory, and majesty, he our case requiring it,
became not only man, but in fashion as a man, in form of a servant in the
likeness of sinful flesh, as a worm, and no man, a reproach of men and
despised of the people for our sakes, and was not this great love, Ioh. 1.14.
Heb. 2.14. Phill. 2.7.8.9. Romans 8.3. Psalm. 22.6.

II. In that he also in this mean shape in our nature, and stead, became
under the law for us, and so in the same bond with us, and took upon him our
dept, and had all our sins imputed to him, and was made sin for us, and so
though he was innocent, yet he bare the imputation, and the shame, and ignominy
of all our sins, and who can deny but this great love, Romans 3.19. Gall. 4.4.
Isa. 53.6.12. 2. Cor. 5.19.21. Psalm. 40.11. Heb. 12.2.

III. In that he also bare the strokes, suffered the punishment, and curse and
died the death that was due to us, and so rose again acquit of all our sins,
and a victorer over curse, and death, and presented himself to his father, as
the ransom, and propitiation for our sins, and heerin appears great, and true
love endeed, Isa. 53.4.5.7.8. 1. Pet. 2.24. and 3.18. 1. Tim. 2.6. Gall. 1.20.

IV. In that he has left his Gospel, and received spirit to send forth to
make known this grace, that men might come in, and receive it and procure
mercy, and patience, waighting, and leading to repentance that we might
repent, and believe, and so partake of this grace, and this is love endeed,
Romans 10.18. Psalm. 68.18. Romans 2.4.

V. In that he has done all this for us freely, while we not only did not
deserve it, but were even sinners, ungodly, and his enemies, yet so great his
love, that far less then this is hardly to be found among friends, and no
greater can be required in us to a friend, then he showed to us, when we were
enemies to him, Oh love without comparison, 1. Pet. 3.18. Isa. 53.2.3.4. Ioh.
15.13. Romans 5.6.7.8.10. Coll. 1.20.21.

In all which the believer may see love abundantly manifested to him, and this
known, and believed there needed no such particular affirmation that he loved
them, for they see, and believed it in his becoming the propitiation for their
sins, so as there is no cause to doubt of his love, 1. Ioh. 3.16. and 4.10.16.
Gal. 2.20.

Object. Jesus Christ has so loved all men, as to take their nature, bear
their sins, and die their death, and give himself a ransom for them and become
the propitiation for their sins, and procures patience and mercy, with some,
light, at some time, to lead them to repentance, 1. Tim. 2.5.6. 1. Ioh. 2.2.
Ioh. 1.9. Therefore all men may know themselves so loved of Christ as well as
believers.

Ans. The proposition is True, but the inference false, for though it be True
that he has so loved all men, Ioh. 3.16.17. And has been witnessing this his
love to them in some measure, Act. 14.17. More clearly where the sound of the
Gospel comes. 2. Cor. 4.13.14. Yet all men have not faith, 2 Thessalonians. 3.2. The
men of the world, harkening to the enchantments, and delusiones of Satan,
believe not the goodness of God, no not where the Gospel comes, and so have
wrong thoughts of God, and either regard him not at all, but go one in serving
their lusts, Psalm. 14.1.2. and 50.21. and 10. Or else if they think of his
wrath, they suppose to apase him by some other satisfaction, and
righteousness, Romans 9.30.31. and 10.1.2.3. And so they lie in wickedness, 1.
Joh. 5.19. And so though love of compassion be toward them (as it is to all
not given over to Satan) yet they not believing, it is not manifest to them,
and so they lying in unbelief they are under wrath, and condemnation because
of their unbelief, Ioh. 3.18.36. And therefore cannot in their unbelief know
themselves so beloved of Christ.

But such as through grace believe they have seen, and known, and believed
this love of Christ in all the before-said five respects, whence its rightly
said to be manifested to them and through this knowledge, and faith, they come
to receive, and have a taste of his first loving them, 1. Ioh. 4.10.16.19. and
5.20. And are therthrough brought to depend on him, and love him, and desue to
be conformed to him, Romans 5.5.11. Tit. 3.4.7. 1. Pet. 2.3.9. And thus, though
such love has showed it self in Christ for all men, yet it is not so
manifested to, nor known, and believed of such, as lie in unbelieve, and so
they have it not, but the believers know this great love in believing, and so
have it, and yet this is not all, but it is farther evidenced to them.

VI. In that when God by his Spirit did through the Gospel evidence Christ,
and this his love, and the fullness of grace, and truth in him to them, and so
made him to appear so glorious to them, that it made all other excellencies as
dross to them, and drew their desires after him, and so caused them to come
in, and submit to him, and desire to be found in him, and enjoye him, Isa.
55.5. Ioh. 1.14.17. and 6.44.45. Phill. 3.7.8.9. Though then they were found in
their own blood and filth, so as they could not endure the stinch of their
own filth, nor the sight of their own blackness, and bloudinesse, Ezekiel.
16.1.9. Isa. 64.6. Yet then did not he cast them away, but washed them with his
blood, spoke peace to their heart, Ioh. 6.37.45. Rev. 1.5. Heb. 12.24. And
though they wore found some thing stubborn, untoward, and gainsaying, yet did
not he faint, nor give over, but overcame their evil with goodness, and
followed on his entertaiment, and wooing of them, till he acquainted them with
his fathers words, and love, and united them to himself in faith, and love,
Isa. 42.2.8. Ioh. 17.6.7.8. And though happily some even brethren, might
through their weakness murmur at the receite of such prodigals and
black-mores, to advance them to such nighnesse with himself, as the elder
brother, at the youngers entertainment with his father, and Aaron, and Eminam,
at Moses marrying an Ethiopian and the believing jews, at such familiarity
with believing Gentiles, Luke 15.28. Numb. 12.1.2. Act. 11.2.3. Yet he
disdained them not, nor was ashamed of them, but as one that saw, and would not
see their deformity, heredily, and kindly entertained them, and set his love
upon them, and spoke comfortably to their hearts; Oh love endeed never to be
forgotten, Isa. 42.19.20.21. Psalm. 113.6.7.8.

VII. In that he has accepted their faith, and love, and prayers, and returned
them some discernable experiments of his goodness, in suports, in troubles,
some deliverances out of temptationes, graunts of many requests, some access,
and approach to himself, some room in his house, and in the hearts of his; with
many refreshings in his courts, and some hope of future happiness; All fruits
of love, Romans 3.26. and 5.2.5. and 7.24.25. Psalm. 16.2. and 92.12. Isa. 56.5.7.

VIII. In that they have his word for it, even written also for their
consolation, that they may know that he loves, and is not ashamed to be known
to love them, Prove. 8.17. Ioh. 14.21.23.

IX. Yea they have had some hints, and evidences of the Holy Spirit given into
their heart, of his love to them, and the Spirit is truth, and the comforter, 1.
Ioh. 3.24. and 4.19. and 5.5.6. Romans 8.15.16.

X. By all the former they come to see him to be their great high priest
interceading in heaven for them, Heb. 7. and 9.

So that it is many ways evident, he loves them, and they knowing, and
believing his love, in redeeming them with his own blood, when they were his
enemies, and receiving them, and washing them when they were in their blood,
and such Ethiopians, affording them so many favoures and some vissits of his
Spirit since, as from all these they have discerned such love of his, as has
caused them to believe in him, and love him so having attained to believe in
him, and love him, they cannot deny, but they know that he has loved them, and
that he loves them much, yea so as if they do not close their eyes by some
fleshly reasonings, and suffer themselves to be withdrawn from the remembrance
of his love thus manifested, it will draw them into admiration, and
acknowledgement of this his love, and inflame them with more love to him, and
desires after him, and frame them to be like him in loving their brother and
he also will return manifestationes of more love to them, of which will be
spoken in the next observation, Cant. 1.2.3.4. and 2.3.5.1. Ioh. 4.16.19. Ioh.
14.21.23.

And this being a sure, and undeniable truth, that Jesus Christ has thus
verily, and manifestly loved those that believe in him, and love him, yea
through his love manifested, did make them believers in him, and lovers of him,
yea so as they might have the knowledge of his love to them, and their love
thereby inflamed to him.

I. Informs us: That such as do unfeynedly believe in Jesus Christ and love
him, they have an inward principle of life, and love with in them that as it
was begotten, so it is quickened, sed, and moved by a fountain of life, and
love in Christ to them, 2. Cor. 3.3. Coll. 3.10.11. Psalm. 16.7.8. Hose. 14.5.8.
Ioh. 15.1.2.5.2. Cor. 5.14.15.17. Psalm. 36.8.9. Which is ready to mind them of
Christ and his love, and so to move, guide, and lead them, as to deny all
fleshly lusts, and services; so to all services of love to, and for Christ,
Ezekiel. 36.26. Ier. 31.34. Romans 8.14. Gall. 5.17.22. Tit. 2.11.12, etc. Yea, and
this also upon all occasiones that in their way are offered to them, as on the
sight, and veiw of mortal men, to remember the love of God to mankind, whom he
created, and for whom provided a savior, Act. 17.26. Tit. 3.4. Heb. 2.14. And
the low estate that Jesus Christ abased himself unto for our sakes, in becoming
man, subject to humane infirmities, Phil. 2.6.7.8. And how he died for, and
gave himself a ransom for all men, Heb. 2.9. 1. Tim. 2.6. And on sight of the
evils, and follies committed by men, to remember the shame and ignominy that
Christ took on him, in being made sin for us, and the curse he suffered, being
numbered with transgressors, and put to death on the tree for us, 2. Cor.
5.19.21. Gall. 3.13. 1. Pet. 2.24. And the propitiation that he by his blood
has made for our sins, and the sins of the whole world, 2. Cor. 5.14. 1. Ioh.
2.2. And the great misery, and wickedness, the worldlieth in because they do
not know, believe, and come into Christ for this grace, Jonas. 2.8. Ioh.
3.18.36. 1. Ioh. 5.19. And the great love of God to themselves (that were even
such) in bringing them out of such, darkness, disobedience, and misery and
acquainting them with, and making them partakers of so great grace, 1. Pet.
2.9.10. Tit. 3.3.4.5. And giving them such hope to hold forth to those that are
yet in darkness, and in no worse case then themselves were once in, yea having
showed them mercy for that end, 1. Tim. 1.12.15.16.17, and 2.1.6. And in sight
of believers, and the grace appearing through them to remember the
faithfulness of God, in performing his promise of bringing into Christ, Isa.
55.4.5. and 53.11. And the faithfulness of Christ in sending forth Spirit
through the Gospel, Mat. 28.20. Ioh. 16.7.8.15. And the virtue of his blood by
his Spirit applied too, and sprinkled on the consciences of men, Heb. 9.14,
and 12, 24. 1 Pet. 1.2, 3, 21, 22. And the relationes, union, and fellowship
they are brought into, and the hope given them through Christ, Ephesians. 4.4, 7, 12,
16, and 2, 17, 22. And still are they more minded of all these things, as they
experiment the fraily of humane nature, the opposition of flessily lusts, or
the opperation of grace in themselves, 2 Cor. 4.7, 13. Gall. 5, 17. 1 Ioh. 1.7,
9, and 2.1, 2. And still are they more minded of these things, in reading, and
hearing the things of Christ set forth in the Gospel, 2 Pet. 1, 12, and 3, 1,
2.

And as this inward principle of life, and love does lead, and apt them by all
these means to such minding of these things so in the minding of them, it
self, is opperative, and springs forth in motiones of love, joye, peace,
confidence, goodness, and desires, to confess, and to pray to God, and to
praise him, to mourn for, and pity, and compassionate men, to rejoice for,
receive, and edify brethren, to show mercy, and walk in truth, and
righteousness, and blamelessely toward all, Ephesians. 4.20, 24. Coll. 3.1, 12.
Gall. 5.22, 23. Phill. 2.1, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 These. 5.11, 14, 23. And so
to hasten to the coming of Christ, waiting for him to perfect and fit them for
it, Tit. 2.11, 12, 14. 2 Timothy 4.8. 2 Pet. 3.11.

And because they know the love of Jesus Christ their life to be so great to
them, they esteem highly of his word, and Spirit, and the ordinances which in
his word he has appointed them, and wherein they may testify submission to him,
and considence in, and love to him, Psalm. 119.138, 139, 140. and 143.10. and
84. to the end. And so wait through the Spirit to receive all help, (for all
things needful to perfect them) from him through his word and Spirit, and in
fellowship with him, and his chosen ones in use of his apointments. Isa.
26.7.12. Gall. 5.5.6. 1, Ioh. 1.3, 4. Psalm. 100.4, 5. And therefore will not
turn aside for helpfulnesse to dead images, or devices, and traditiones of
men, knowing that in so doing they should sit loose from him their head, and
dishonor him, as wanting love, or Spirit, and procure to themselves blasting,
and witherdnesse in their life, and love, and darkenings in perceiption of his
love, which is their life. Psalm. 115.1, 14. Coll. 2.6, 8. 9, 10, 16, 23. 1,
Ioh. 5.20.21. Psalm. 30.5, 12. Gall. 6.8.

II. This manifested love of Christ, does Admonish those that believe in
Christ, and love him.

I. In all conditiones, and how-ever things apeare to sense; yet to acknowledge
him to have loved us, and to be loving, and gracious to us, to be good, and to
do good, and praise him for his kindness, and wonderful works, waiting on
him for his goodness to be shown us in due time, Psalm. 73.1. and 145. to the
end. Phill. 4.4.7. Psalm. 107. to the end. 1 These. 5.18. Lam. 3.26, 31. Let hoe
affliction cause us to murmur against him, or be jealous of his love, for that
is great; we have cause to be jealous of our own love, and he might say to us,
wherein have you loved me, and we might be silent; but yet he accepts and
remembers, the small fruits of his Spirit in us, and forgets not the love of
our espousealls; though it were but the fruits of his own first discovered
love. Cant. 5.1. Jer. 2.2. Heb. 6.10. 1 Ioh. 4.19; And shall we for a little
hideing, and silence of his, or a few afflictions from him call in question al
his love, and in beholding the fullness of others say to him, wherein have thou
loved us: far be it from us; he can not but behold it as an evil in us, that
he has so loved us, as to take our nature, bear out sins, suffer our curse,
and give himself a ransom for us, and become the propitiation for our sins,
and all this for us, while we were his enemies, and yet we to say wherein have
thou loved us. If thou say, he has so loved al men; yet I pray the consider:
he has not so made it known to al men, and sweetened the knowledge thereof to
their hearts, as he has done to thee, they are thy Brethren, created by the
same God, purchased by the same Lord, and of as good nature, parts, and other
natural qualificationes, and performances, as thou, and no worse, then thou
were, yet he suffers them to lie in darkness, and to rest upon such mountains
of worldly, riches, friends, fleshly wisdom, or self wrought righteousness,
as he has blasted, and will bring down, and as will fail them; But he has
discovered to the, the mountain of Israel, and brought thee out of darkness
into light, and gained thee to himself, with the knowledge of his love so
manifested, that himself might be thy mountain, thy peace, thy
righteousness, thy life, and has often made thee taste his goodness; and is
now but confirming thee to him, in his cross, and death, that thou may
partake of his resurrection, and life, and will thou so forget all his
goodness as to say wherein have thou loved me. Oh do not so, let us not so
ill-requite him, as for any thing to be offended in him. Mall. 1.1, 6. Romans 6
3, 5. 2 Cor. 4.10, 11. Phill. 3.10, 14.

II. To learn of Christ to love others, as we have been, and are loved of
Christ Jesus, to love such as are yet enemies to us, and know not Christ with
the love of compassiones, as Christ did us when we were enemies to him, and
without partaking of their sins, or delightful fellowship with them in their
ways, to use meekness patience, and long-suffering to them, and pray for
them, and seek to overcome their evil with goodness, Mat. 5.44, 45. Romans
12.17, 21. Tit. 3.2.3, 4. 1 Pet. 2.22, 23, 24. To love believers, with love of
delight exercising bowels of mercies to them, bearing their infirmities, and
burdens, having fellowship with them, continuing in Brotherly love. Coll.
3.12, 16. Romans 14 and 15. 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. Heb. 10. and 13, 1. But this with
other uses do more fully flow from the next observation joined to this.

III. This love of Jesus Christ so manifested may be a ground of exortation to
us, to mind, and heed well this his love, that we may be more abundantly firmed
in the belief heeroff, it being the ground of our believing, and that which
believed does facillitate our belief of that more abundant love, that
follows to be spoken of. Romans 5.1, 5, 10, 11. and 8.31, 36. Gall. 2.20. And
while there remains doubtfulnesse in this, there can be no stabillity in the
belief of that which follows now to be spoken of in the next observation.
Joh. 3.12. and 6.61, 62, 63.

II. Obse. That Jesus Christ loves those that believe in him, and love him,
even as the Father has loved him; In which observation, there is something
closely intimated, namely: That the love of Jesus Christ, and so of God the
Father in, and through him, to such as believe in Jesus Christ, and love him,
is a special, and peculiar love; above all that love in which he loves any
other of the sous of men, Deuteronomy. 7.6.7. Truth it is, he loves all the sons of
men (till they become of the seed of the Serpent) with the love of compassion,
and willingness to have them come in to him. Psalm. 145.8, 9. Pro. 8.4, 5, 31.
Joh. 3.16, 17. 1 Timothy 1.15. Yea even while they are sinners, and know him not,
and while he is angry with them for not believing on him. Romans 5.6, 8, 10. 1 John 2.2. and 4, 10. Joh. 3.18.36. And this their not knowing, and not
believing this his love, and goodness, is that which holds them in
impenitency, and under sin, and in wickedness still. Psalm. 9 10. Romans 2.4.5.
Joh. 16.8, 11. 1 John 5.19, 20. 2 Thessalonians. 2.8. But such clear and powerful
discovery of his love, and goodness, as does cause the heart, so to know,
believe, and acknowledge the same, that one is overcome thereby to believe on
him, and love him, is a special, and peculiar in his love, not only love, and
grace with general effects, but a special favor, and special gift of grace.
Mat. 16.16.17.18. 1 Pet. 1.21. 1 John 4.16, 19. and 5.20 Tit. 2.11, 12. and
3.3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 2, 8. Above that which apertaines to al men. 2 Thessalonians. 3.2. And
this peculiar love is here closely intimated, of which is already spoken in
the former observation.

And something in this observation is fully, and plainly expressed, namely such
a peculiar love, as is not peculiar only in respect of the manifestation, and
discovery thereof as before mentioned, but it is peculiar also in it self,
such as never was, is, or shall be to any but them, and such as they are. Psalm.
132.13.14.15. and 148.14. and 149.4. Deuteronomy. 33.26.29. And so it is peculiar,
both in the love it self, and also in the manifestation of it. Ioh.
14.17.21.22.23. and 16.27. The fruits whereof come through his advocation,
joined with his propitiation, which advocation is peculiar for them that
believe in him, and love him, Ioh. 17.9, 10, 20, 27. 1 Ioh. 2.1. And this
peculiar love, with such peculiar manifestation is significantly called the
favor to his people, the good of his chosen, and the enjoyment of it, the
gladness of his nation, Psalm. 106.4, 5. And this is a peculiar love, above all
the love he bears to any other of the sons of men in which also he makes them
a peculiar people to himself, 2 Pet. 2, 9. And of this love is the observation
now in hand, which cannot be better expressed then in the words of our savior
himself, which also is the proof thereof.

As the Father hach loved me, so have I loved you. In which for our better
understanding, and usefulness, there are three things contained to be viewed,
and heeded of us.

I. The first intimated, as denied by none, viz. the Father has loved Jesus
Christ his son. II. The second to be inquired into in other his sayings, which
gives light to that affirmed, viz. how the Father has loved Jesus Christ his
son. III. The third express, viz. the affirmation it self, as the Father has
loved me, so have I loved you.
I. For the first that the Father has loved Jesus Christ his son, and so
loves him, is expressly affirmed, Ioh. 5, 20. The Father loves the Son, but an
explication is to many more needful in this, then a proof, least the
conceptiones of some be too scant in this matter, in which we are not to
consider Jesus Christ only as the second person of the three, and so the son in
respect of the devine nature, without consideration of the flesh, that once was
to be, and now is taken, and so of the love only in which the three persons in
one God, delight in each other, and so God has all fullness of delight in
himself, but we are to consider the second person, the son of God (as once he
was to take, and now has taken flesh, and so) as he was found in our nature
and stood as the public person in the room of all, and became the
propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and the Advocate for believers,
the king, priest, and prophet, and the head, and Husband of the church, as he
was vile, and despised in the account of men, and yet a lover of men, and so
approved of the father, and so has the father loved him, as he is such a one,
Pro. 8.22, 23, 30. Mat. 12.18. Mat. 3.17, and 17, 5. Yea he loved him in his
laying down his life; and making the propitiation, Ioh. 10, 17. Phill. 2, 7,
11. As also in his ministration, Mat. 17, 5. And in receipt, and approbation of
those given him in the heavenly call, Isa. 42.1, 2, 8. Ioh. 16, 27. And Jesus
Christ thus considered as he took our nature, and wrought for us, the father
has loved him, Isa. 53, 1, 2, 6, 11.12.

II. For the second thing how the father has loved Jesus Christ his son, and
our savior, it is beyond conception, and expression of mortals though some
what thereof may be conceived, and expressed, as the scripture declares, Ephesians.
3.18.19. And so according to the measure of light given we may consider it two
ways.

I. Negatively; Not with a worldly, and humane love, such as is in the men of
the world, and as the men of the world testify their love, who desire for, and
wish unto, and to their abillity confer upon those whom they most love, most of
the honors, riches, authority, power, liberty pleasures, and good report among
men, that is in this world and the things thereof, Hest. 6.6, 9. Dan. 6.1, 2,
3. Genesis 41.39.44. Of this love is not heere-ment, but of the love heere-ment,
it may be said as of the peace Christ gives, it is not such us the world has,
and gives nor so given, Ioh. 14.27. For in these things the father did not set
forth his love to lesus Christ his son, and our savior, but abased him in all
such things, for worldly honors he was not sild with, but abused in the
meandness, and contemptiblenesse of his birth in respect of parentage, and
place, Luke 2.4, 7. In his exile after his birth into a strange country, Mat.
12, 13, 15. In the place of his longest abode, and bringing up, not in the
famous city of Jerusalem, but in Galilee, out of which they used to say, there
arises no prophet, Ioh. 7.52. In the manner of his life before his
ministration, a carpenter, Mark. 6.3. In the places of his ministration, not
always in the temple, and Sinagogues, or houses of the rulers, and Pharisees,
but often in other houses, and in the houses of the Publicanes, and in the
wilderness, and on the mountains, and by the seaside and in sishers ships,
Mat. 9, 10, and 5, and 15, 32, 33. In his disciples and attendants on his
ministration, unlettered, fishermen, a Publican, a Canaanite, etc. Mat. 4.18,
and 9, 9, and 10, 1, 10. And his hearers, and followers a despised people, Ioh.
7.48, 49. As for worldly riches, he was not furnished, but in that respect
very pore, Mat: 8.20, and 17, 27. As for humane, and outward authority,
offices, and power from and among men, he had none, Mar. 11, 28. Luke 12.13,
14. Ioh. 18, 36. As for humane repute, and good report among men of most
credit, and esteem in the world and their followers; he was by them defamed,
reproached, and slandered, and that many ways, they defamed him by his
parentage, and kindred, this the carpenters son, etc. Mat. 13, 55, 56, 57. And
by his trade he had used before his ministration, Mar. 6.3. This the carpenter,
and by his not having been trained up at scooles whence has this man these
things, etc. Mat. 13, 54, 57. Mar. 6, 2, 3. And by his want of outward, and
pompous authority among men this fellow, Ioh. 9.29. And not only defamed, but
also slandered him for his conversation with men, to be a gluttonous person,
and a wine bibber, and a friend of Publicanes, and sinners, Mat. 11.19. For his
readiness to do good, and to show mercy at all seasones, a breaker of the
Sabbaths, Ioh. 5, 16, and 9, 16. For his zeal, to have a devil, and his
miracles to be done by the devil, Ioh. 7, 20, and 8, 48. Mat. 9.34, and 12,
24. For his doctrine to be a deceiver, Mat. 27.63. Ioh. 7.12. And for his holy
and plain confession of the truth, to be a blasphemer of God Ioh. 10.36. Mat.
26, 65. And an adversary to Caesar, Ioh. 19, 12. And as for liberty and
pleasures among men, he was often conspired against, continually persecuted,
and at last buffetted, nailed on the cross between two thieves, and there
derided and scoffed at, and so died, Mat. 12, 14, and 26, and 27. In a word, he
was so far from being glorious, or great in the world, that in such respects,
he was as a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people,
without form or beauty, rejected of men; etc. Psalm. 22.6.7. So that the love
wherewith the Father loved Jesus Christ was not a worldly love, nor testified
by filling him with worldly things, the abundance whereof, he very often gives
to his enemies, sometimes, as rewards for some services he has done by them
though they knew him not, Ezekiel. 29.18.19. Sometimes, in judgment to their
farther snaring, and hardening, and overthrow, Psalm. 73.18, and 92, 6, 7. So as
this love is not worldly, but heavenly, and though heavenly yet.

Not only a love of compassion, which may be toward such as one is angry with,
and counts sinners for their evils, and is constrained to afflict them, though
with bowels of compassion yearning over them, so as in returning, they may be
saved, and in rebelling given up, Hose. 11.4.9. Luke 19, 41, 42. For so God
loved the world, Ioh. 3.16, 17, 18, 19. But his love to his son was a greater
love then this, Coll. 1.18, 19, and Heb. 1. to the end. Yet though it were a
greater, and more peculiar love.

It was not from the first appearance, to the accomplishment of full perfection
in the glorious harvest a constant appearing, and brightly shining love,
admitting no clouds, darknesses, nor eclipses; but such love it was, as had its
degrees of appearing, and some intermixtures of clouds, and darkness, in
respect of the visible appearance, and a great eclipse on the cross, before
all clouds were passed, and the fullness of the glorious appearance, and
enjoyment came into its perfection. Luke 2. to the end. Mat. 3.17, and 4, to
the end. and 17, 5, and 26, 8, 42, and 27, 46.

II. Affirmatively, the Father has loved his son, our savior Jesus Christ
with a devine, heavenly, pure, Fatherly; and Spiritual love beyond all our
conceptiones, only we may veiw it in the properties of it.

I. It is a most free, and righteous love, it is a free love, which with out
any fore-desert did fasten upon the man Christ Jesus, and chose him into union
of person with the son of God, and so to be one, and his only son, and also to
be the savior of the world, and also to be the mediator, and the high priest
prophet, and King, and head, and husband of the church, and that all fullness
should dwell in him, and that in all things he might have the pre-eminence,
Psalm. 89.19.20.27, 28. Isa. 42, 1, and 49, 6, 7, 8. Heb. 1, 2, 8, and 7. Coll.
1.19. And all this freely, because it so pleased him, and such his love, yet it
is also a righteously love, slowing upon him accepting, and preferring him, in,
and for, and according to all that he has done in the work of redemption for
men, and that he does in spiritual application to, and in, and advocation for,
and government of his called, and chosen ones, Isa. 53.11. Romans 14, 9, 12. Ioh.
10.17. Heb. 2, 9. Phill. 2.8, 9, 10. Psalm. 20, 3, 4, 5, and 45, 6, 7, 8.

II. It is a most well-pleased, delightful, and satisfying love, taking up all
well-pleased in the beloved, and affording all well-pleasednesse, to the
beloved, the Father having so set all his delight in his son that he delights
in him, and in all that is in his son, and in nothing out of his son, that he
takes all fullness of content, and well-pleasednesse in his son, and in that
which his son has done, in his ministration, sufferings, sacrifice, and
victory, and in that which his son does, by his spiritual opperationes, and
communicationes of privilledges, and in all that are in his son, and presented
by him, so as in that his well-pleasednesse he affords well-pleasednesse to his
son, and to all that are in, and one with his son, Pro. 8, 22, 23, 30. Isa.
42.1. Mat. 12, 18, and 3, 17, and 17, 5. Heb. 10, 7, 12, 13, 14. Psalm. 20, 3,
6. Ioh. 16, 27. Gall. 3.16, 29, 1 Cor. 1, 30.

III. It is a most abundant, and flowing love, resting not till the beloved be
partaker of, and silled with all his own things, and with union, and
fellowship with himself, so has the Father loved Jesus Christ as he has him
ever with him, an I before him, as the seal on his heart, and the seal upon
his ^^me, in all his counsels, and works preferring him, and showing him all
that he does, yea so as he does it by him, and makes him the door thereof,
Pro. 8, 30. Cant. 8, 6. Ioh. 1.1.2.3.8. and 5.21.25, 26. Yea so as he is one
in, and with the Son, and the Son one in, and with him. Ioh. 10.30. and 14.10,
11. and 17, 21. Yea so as he consereth on his Son, and makes him partaker,
and owner of al his own things; his devine nature, his Holy Spirit, his
attributes of wisdom, power, goodness, etc. His special people, and all the
works of his hands, so as: all that is the Fathers is the Sons, Ioh. 16.15. and
17, 6.10. Heb. 1.2.3.

IV. It is a most glorious, honorable, and honoring love; the Father has so
loved his Son Jesus Christ our Savior that he has honored, or glorified him
with his own self, with infinite glory, yea, and with such apearing honor
also, Ioh. 17.1.5. That he will not be known, or acknowledged, loved or honored
in any thing by any man, by any way, or means, but in, and by his son, and as
the man knows acknowledges, loves, and honors his Son Christ, Ioh 5.23.
and 14.6, 7. 1 Ioh. 2.23. Whom he will have honored as himself, yea he has
honored his Son, by giving an honorable testimony of him, Psalm. 89.20.21.28.
Ioh. 1.33. Mat. 3.17. and 17.5. Heb. 1. to the end. And sending forth the Holy
Ghost to bear testimony of him. Ioh. 14.26.15, 26. 1 Ioh. 5.6. Yea he has
glorisied, and honored him, by exalting him at his right hand; Giving all
authority unto him, and making him the Lord, and judge of all. Heb. 2.9. and
8.1. Mat. 28.18. Jeh. 5.27. Yea he has giver him the Kingdom, and the
enheritance, and made him the King, and he shall rayn for evermore, Psalm. 45.
to the end. Heb. 1. to the end. Yea he so prefers his son in honor, that he
honors all those that in the day of grace do honor him, Ioh. 14, 21, 23,
and 16, 27. And will repay those that persist in hating him, Psalm. 68.

V. It is an eternal, and everlasting love, he loved him from all eternity,
and to eternity, he is the prime elect, Isa. 42, 1. He loved him before he
took flesh, and when he took flesh, yea always while he was here on earth,
in all his temptationes, poverties, sufferings, ministration death, and resm
rection, and now at his right hand, and so for ever, Pro. 8, 22, 30. Luke 1.30,
32. Ioh. 5, 20, 27. Psalm. 2.6, and 16, 6, 7, etc.

And with such devine, Fatherly love, so free, righteous, delightful
satisfying, abundant flowing, hononrable, and honoring, and everlasting love,
has the Father ever loved the son (though it was not in all times so visible)
when he was here on earth) and ever does, and will thus love him, and thus we
have some small discovery of that which in the excellency, and perfection
thereof, is beyond all our conception, much more beyond our expression, his
love being infeint, and in comprehensible, passing knowledge.

III. For the third thing, viz. the affirmation it self, as the Father has
loved me, so have I loved you, this is the profession, and explanation of his
great love with the peculiar manner of his loving, as the Father has loved
him, viz.

I. Not with a humane, and worldly love, to be testified after the manner of
the world, in advancing them, and freeing them from sufferings, in such glory,
fame, good report, honor, riches, authority friend-ship, liberty among men, as
is in, and of this world, wherein they shall be falsely accused, hated,
persecuted, and have many tribulationes, as he had, but in him they shall have
peace, and comfort, as he had in his Father, Mat. 10, 17, 25. Ioh. 14, 27, and
15, 18, 21, and 16, 32, 33.

II. Nor only with a love of compassion, and extention of some fruits thereof,
for so he has loved all men, Psalm. 136, 26, and 145, 8, 9. And so he loved
them, when they were his enemies, Romans 5, 7, 10. Nor yet only with such a
peculiarity in this loving, as to make them to know, and enjoy the comfort of
this his compassionate love, in the giving himself, a ransom for them, and the
peace, the patience, the bownty, the supports, and supplies there through
vouchsafed them in all their needs, and trials so as they may experiment his
love, and tender mercy in the same, Psalm. 116, 1.2.8. Romans 5, 2, 4, 1 Cor. 3,
10, Wherein he tenders them in some sort because of their weakness, more then
himself on earth was, Psalm. 22, 6, 7. And though this love of compassion made
known and enjoyed be sweet, gracious, and opperative love, yet this love is
higher and more peculiar, Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Yet

III. Not such a love, or so loving as admits no cloud, darkenings, or eclipses
from the knowledge, or perception of the beloved, after the first appearance,
till the harvest, or fullness of enjoyment, but such as between the first
appearance, and the full coming in of the harvest may admit some clouds,
hidings, and eclipses for a season, 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. Heb. 12, 6, 7. Isa. 8.17,
18. Cant. 3.1, 4, and 5, 8, 21.

But with such a devine, spiritual, and peculiar love, as in which his Father
loves him, his son, he loves those that believe on him, and love him.

I. With a most free, and righteous love, he has loved, and does love them
most freely, not for any worth, or desert, or any excellency found in them, or
those from whom they received their first birth, for they were so far from
having any thing deserving love, that they were full of such filth, as deserved
hatred, yea such as could not be taken of without his dieing for them, which
he did even while they were his enemies, Ezekiel. 16, 1, 9. Romans 5, 8, 10. And
notwithstanding, he still found them sinful, and rebellious to the day of his
call, 1 Timothy 1, 12, 13, 14, 15. Coll. 1.13, 21, 22. Yea even when he set his
eye on them to take them to himself, and for his own, he found them in their
filth, and blood, and in oneness, and fellowship with the world, and yet did
he freely set his love on them and by his Spirit washed them from their sins
in his own blood, and graciously chose them out of the world, Ezekiel. 16, 6.
Rec. 1, 5. Ioh. 15, 16, 19. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 6.

So that his love is altogether free; and as it is free, so it is righteous he
having offered the sacrifice, and presented his blood to his Father, so as
mercy and truth are met and by view of his blood purged their consciences, and
presenting them in himself to the Father, who counts them righteous it him, he
loving them with a righteous love, Psalm. 85.10.11, Heb. 9.12, 14. And also:

He in this freeness of his love having given his promise; he is righteous
to perform, he is also so righteous in loveing, that he will treasure up, and
not forget, but both make prosperous, and also recompense every fruit, and
work of his own Spirit in them, and that according as his grace, prevails in
them, and leads them, to yield up themselves, and their members therein, and
thereto, in the services, and sufferings of love for him, and their brethren,
and this also he does freely, and for his own sake. Cant. 5.1. Heb. 6.10. 2
Cor. 9.6. Gall. 6.8. Mat. 10, 41, 42. Psalm. 19.11. 1 Cor. 2.9.

II. With a most delightful, and well-pleased love, he has set his delight
and takes pleasure in them, Psalm. 16.3. and 33, 18. and 149.4. And is
well-pleased with them, as they are in him, and have him living in them, Ioh.
15.1.9. Gall. 2, 20. And so with all that which by his Spirit he works in
them, and which through that Spirit, he causes them to do, in prayers,
praises, and services of love. Jer. 9, 24. Prove. 15.8. Yea so delightful is he
in this his love, and so well-pleased, that he has set his desire, and placed
his rest for an habitation in, and with them, Cant. 4.9, 10. Psalm. 132, 13, 14.
Yea so as he affords them satisfying, and well-pleasednesse in this his
well-pleasednesse with them. Psalm. 23. and 30, 3, 4, 5. and 116.1.2, 10.

III. With a most abundant, and flowing love, his love so flowing on them, that
he has them ever before him, and his gracious eye upon them, Psalm, 34, 15. So
that he sets them as the seal upon his heart, and as the seal on his arm.
Cant. 8.6. And has graven them upon the palms of his hands, Isa. 49, 16; So
that he works al their works in them, and does all his works for them, and
causes all to work together for good to them, Isa. 26, 12. Psalm. 138, 8, Romans
8, 28, Yea so as in due season, he imparteth all his counsels, and makes them
to know his mind, and all his works, Ioh. 15, 15, 16. 1 Ioh. 2.20, 27. Yea even
so that all his sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, his victory,
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption is become theires, as
if they had done all. Ioh. 14.12. 1 Cor. 1.30. 2 Cor. 5, 14. Yea he conferreth
on them, and makes them owners, and partakers of all that is his; even of his
devine nature, in union, interest, usefulness, and comformity; and so of all
things pertaining to life, and godliness, 2 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4. Yea so that his
Father, himself, his Spirit, his covenant, his privilidges, his inheritance,
his people are all theirs; And this so operative, that they and all that is
theirs, is gained to be, and made his, 1 Cor. 3.22.

IV. With a most honorable, and honoring love, the Lord Jesus so loving those
that believe on him, and love him, that, he will not accept to be loved,
received, and acknowledged of any, that do not in, with, and for him in a
measure, love receive, and acknowledge them; but counts all that is done to
them, as done to himself, whether in love, or hatred, and will not otherwise
reckon of it, but in some measure will have them in, and for him loved as
himself, Mat. 18, 5, 6. and 45, 40, 44. Luk 10.16, Act. 9.4, 5. 1 Ioh. 4, 17,
21. He puts his name upon them, and his Spirit in them, and so bears
testimony, in, to, and through them, 2 Cron. 7, 14, 16. Isa. 59.21. Romans 8.16.
Heb. 11, 3. Rev. 2, 17. He gives to them the Kingdom, and enheritance, the
Father has given him, Luke 22, 29. Heb. 12, 28; and he will have them to
rain with himself, and make them rule over the nations, and judge the world,
Rev. 2.26, 27. 1 Cor. 6.2. Yea he blesses, and honors with blessings, such
as bless, love, esteem them. Genesis 12, 3. Psalm. 15.1.4. And this so operative,
that they so honor him.

V. With an everlasting love, he has loved them from eternity, in the root
and nature, Pro. 8.30, 31. And does so love them to eternity in root and
branches, as they can never drop out of this love of his, Ier. 31, 3. Ioh. 13,
1. He loved them before they were, 2 Timothy 1.9. And when they were his enemies,
Romans 5, 6.10. And when he called them, Tit. 3, 4.7. And he loves them, even
when he speaks hardly to them, and chastises them, Ier. 31.20. Heb. 12.6. And
when they are in tribulationes, and sufferings for his sake, Psalm. 116.15. And
when they bring forth the fruits of his Spirit, and approach to him, Cant.
4.9, 15. Yea he will love them for ever, and it shall shine forth upon them,
without any darkness, or interuption, when they shall be with him, and see his
glory seeing as they are seen, and being made like him, and so rejoicing in
his love for ever, and ever, Ioh. 17, 24. 1 Ioh. 3.1.2. Rev. 21. and 22. And
this so opperative, as it unites them in love to him for ever, and thus as the
father has loved his son Jesus Christ, so has, and does Jesus Christ love
those that believe on him, and love him, only in this we are to heed this
caution, to keep us sober in the belief of so great love, viz. That as Jesus
Christ made the propitiation himself for us in, and by himself without us, so
he, and he only is the fountain and cause in and through himself, of all
this love, and fruits thereof to us so that in this respect he has no
partners, 1 Ioh. 2.2. Psalm. 36.9. Hose. 14, 8. And for the communication of
this his delightful love, and fruits thereof, he does it according to his
Fathers mind, who in all things will have his son Jesus to have the
pre-eminence, his portion with out bounds, or measure, immeasurable, but to
every one that believes on him, a measure, according to the measure of Christ,
Coll. 1, 19. Ioh. 3, 33. Ephesians. 1.7. And this observed, we may safely affirm,
and verily believe, that as God the Father has loved all men with a love of
compassion, so has Jesus Christ so also loved them that he has given himself
a ransom for all men, to be testified in due time, Ioh. 3.16, 17. 1 Ioh. 4,
14. 1 Timothy 2.6. Even so as the Father has loved, and loves his son Jesus
Christ with a higher degree of love, and a more peculiar love, then he loved
the world for whose redemption he sent him forth, Ioh. 5, 20. Romans 14, 9, 12.
Even so the Lord Jesus Christ has loved, and does love all those, that by his
grace and Spirit are in the heavenly call brought into believe in him, and love
him, even with the same devine, Spiritual, free, righteous delightful,
well-pleased, abundant, flowing, honorable, honoring, and everlasting love,
in which the Father has loved, and loves him, himself, having assirmed it.

And to make a little use of this point, before we enter on the next.

Use. I.
This may be an Information to us, both of the greatness of the love of God,
and Jesus Christ our Lord, to all that believe in Jesus Christ, and love him,
and also of the happy, and blessed condition of such believers.

I. For the love of God to these his people, we may better express it by
admiration, then description, For how great is his goodness which he has
laid up for them that fear him, and wrought for them that trust in him before
the sons of men, Psalm. 31.19. That neither know, or love him, or them, it was
love endeed, and that great also, to ransom, and redeem them with his own
blood, from that great misery into which they were fallen, and then to make
known this love to them, and therthrough to extend the choice fruits of his
compassionate love to them as before, but as if all this were but a little in
the account of so gracious a God to do for them, his love stays not in this,
but flows farther in loving them, as he loves his son to make them like his
son, and sons in his son, who loves them also as the Father loves him, so
that in this love, God makes them his sons, his treasure, and delight, and he
is become their God and Father, their refuge, rock-portion, guide, and
protector, and has intressed them in, and made them, owners of all his own
things, and will bring them to rain together with Jesus Christ his son, and
preserve them till he bring them to that inheritance with Jesus Christ and make
them like him, to be ever with him, Oh consider, and behold what manner of love
is this, Ioh. 17, 23, 2 Cor. 6, 18. Psalm. 18, 1.2. Romans 8, 32. 1 Cor. 3.22. 1
Pet. 1.3, 4, 5, 1 Ioh. 3.1.2.

II. For the happiness of the condition of such as believe in Jesus Christ and
love him, enough is said, where such love is assured to them, and in such love
to have forgiveness of all their sins, acceptance of their persons, and
access to the throne of grace, Act. 10, 43. Romans 3, 1, 2. To have the Lord for
their portion, wisdom, rightcousnesse, sanctisication, and redemption,
treasure and riches, Psalm. 16.5. 1 Cor. 1.30. To have him for their Father, and
captain, to acquaint them with the mysteries of God, to fight their battles,
answer their enemies, subdue their lusts, tread down Satan under their feet,
Isa. 55, 4, and 42, 1, 8. Mich. 7, 18. Romans 16, 20. To sanctify them
throughout, and preserve them to his Kingdom, 1 These. 5, 24. 1 Pet. 1, 4, 5.
To be blessed with all Spiritual blessings, and complete in him, Ephesians. 1.3.
Coll. 2.9. To have him loving them, as the Father has loved him, and so
estating them in all his own things so as they who because of the excellency
of his loving kindness do put their trust under the shadow of his wings, shall
be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of his house, and he will make them
drink of the river of his pleasures, and fill them with fullness of joy in his
presence, and pleasures at his right hand for evermore, Psalm. 36, 7, 8, and 16,
11. So that we may well say of them happy art thou Oh Israel, who is like unto
thee Oh people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword
of thine excellency, and thy enemies shall be found liars unto thee, and thou
shall dwell in safety alone, Deuteronomy. 33.29.28. Psalm. 31.20. Mich. 7.9.10.

Use. II:
This may also be a motive to press forward, and alure all men, to look to
Jesus Christ and come in, and submit to him, in repenting, and forsaking their
sins, with all their former delights, and hopes, and believing the Gospel in
its report of the great love of God in giving his son to die for their sins,
and rise for their Justification, and suffering this tidings to prevail to the
breaking of their hearts in sight of, and sorrow for their sins against so
gracious a God, and so loving a savior and for which the Lord Jesus suffered
so much, and to cause them to renounce, reliance on any wisdom, strength,
righteousness, or works of their own endavourings, seeing nothing less, then
the bloud-shading of Jesus Christ could make peace for them, nor any thing but
the Spiritual application of that blood can effect peace in them, Mar. 1.15.
Act. 2.37. Zach. 12, 10. Phill. 3, 3, 4, 7, 8. Gall. 2, 21. 1 Pet. 1.2.
Therefore to look, and submit to Jesus Christ and to wait for Spirit, and
teaching from him, and not to rest but be attending the Gospel, and yielding
to all the Gospel requires, till he by his Spirit, applying the virtue of his
death, and resurrection to them, do overcome them to believe, and so effect
peace, and newness in their heart, Isa. 42, 1, 8, and 45, 21, 23. Ioh. 8.30,
31, 36. Tit. 3.4.5. And the rather and the more are they to be vehement for
this and press heertoo, because in the attainement of this, so great and
peculiar love is to be met with all, Ioh. 1.12, and 3, 16. and 7, 37.39.
Therefore, whatever thou be, that have not yet attained, let the hearsay of
this great, and peculiar love to such as believe in him, and love him now
prevail with thee, and persuade thee to open thy ear, and attend with thy
heart to the Gospel, and suffer it to prevail with thee to bring thee to
repentance, and faith in Jesus Christ, and to the love of him: Oh consider.

Metives: I.
Jesus Christ has loved thee, his compassiones have been great toward thee,
he gave himself a ransom for thee, and died a grievous and ignominions death
for thy sins, and rose for thy justification, and is become thy Lord, to whom
thou owe thy self, thy life, and all that thou have, and he has power to
absolve thee, and power to judge, and condemn thee, and yet waits for thee,
and stands ready to send forth Spirit to thee, to make known his grace in thy
heart, and bring thee into him, 1 Timothy 2, 6. Heb. 2.9. Romans 14.9.10, 11, 12. 1
Cor. 6.20. Psalm. 68.18. And shall not all this goodness melt, and break thy
heart in pieces for thy sins, for which his blood was shead, and for thy long
enstrangment from, and often rebelliones against him that has so loved thee, and
died for thee, and to renounce reliance on thy own wisdom righteousness,
and strength to fall down before him, and turn to him, and seek for life,
and Spirit from him, and the rather seeing he might justly condemn thee, and
yet in his so great love, and compassion still calls thee, saying, seek me,
and live; Oh turn thee, horn thee, that iniquity may not be thy destruction,
Ezekiel. 33.11, and 18, 30, 31. Isa. 55, 6.7. Pro. 8.31.35.

II. If thou obey this his heavenly call; so as thou be overcome thereby to
deny thy self, and renounce thy own former lusts, and hopes, and to believe
his love, and goodness; so as thou depend on him for life, and love him, thou
shall not only receive remission of sins, and a new heart, with peace therein,
and access in grace, which yet is better then all the things of this world.
Romans 4.23.25. and 5.1.2. Act. 10.43. Psalm. 32.1.2. But thou shall therewith
also partake of the same peculiar love of Jesus Christ, in which himself is
beloved, and shall not this alure, and move thee to seek him. Ioh. 7.37.38.39.
and 14.21.23.

III. And the more to move, and encourage thee to this repentance and faith in
him, he has caused this his special love, that he bears to those that
believe on him, and love him, to be written, and spoken off. That thou may
know, what love thou shall partake off in believing in him, and loving him.
Ioh. 20.31. Romans 15.4. Ioh. 1.7. and 5.34. 1. Ioh. 1.3. And for a pattern, and
farther encouragement to thee, he has all ready communicated of his special
love to such, as before they believed, were as great sinners, and as far off as
thou, to encourage thee to repent, and believe, that thou might partake of
the same love also, 1 Timothy 1.15, 16. And will not this prevail with thee.

IV. And to remove all stumble, because thou caust not come to Jesus Christ,
unless God by his Spirit draw thee, this also he has declared, that at one
time, or other, he will be tendering to thee, yea, and its not to be doubted,
when by his servants he is teaching the Gospel to thee. Pro. 8.31.32.35. Ioh.
1.4, 5, 9. Mat. 28.20. But thy imbessellity ought rather to stir thee up to
pray him to draw thee, then to stumble, and discourage thee from turning in to
him, Cant. 1.4. And I pray thee answer in thy heart this question; the Gospel
having been preached to thee, have thou not at one time, or other felt, or
discerned some spiritual motiones abont the death of Christ, for sinners hinted
into thy heart with suck light as has given thee to see much sinfulness, and
misery in thy self, and much mercy, and hope in Christ, and this with such
force, as it has struck at thy heart, and stirred, and moved with in thee, to
incline thee to repentance of thy sins, and to believe in Christ how say
thou, did thou never meet with his Spirit thus moving to have drawn thee to
Christ, yea does he not now stir when these things are put to thy remembrance,
sure in these seasons he is calling thee, and striving with thee, to draw
thee, he is taking the yoke from of thy jaws, and laying meat before thee,
wherefore, though thou be blind, and deaf, and lame, yet now look, and hear
and rise, and do not refuse, or withdraw from his Spirits opperationes, for he
has power to bring thee in, and if thou do turn in at his reproves, and
turnings, he will power forth Spirit on thee, and make known his gracious words
unto thee, Ier. 2, 5, 6, 30. Mich. 2, 7. Rev. 3.20. Genesis 6.3. Hos. 11.3.4. Mat.
23.37. Isa. 42.18. Pro. 1.23. 2 Cor. 6.1.2.

It is thy refusal, and withdrawing in these seasons, that endangers thee to
the great condemnation; Oh therefore turn not from him that first speaks from
heaven, deprive not thy self of such precious mercy, and life, Ioh. 3.19. 1
Cor. 2.3. and 12.25. But if others will by following lying vanities forsake
their own mercies, and in such seasons, for worldly causes hang back, and
loose their own souls Iona. 2.8. Mat. 16.24.25. Yet thou that art pinched
with, and troubled for thy sins, and afraid of wrath, and death, and have
assayed many ways in workings of thy own, to find peace, and life, and not
attamed, but art weary, and heavy laden; Oh let the tidings of this grace, and
love of Christ and all these motives therefrom prevail with thee, to let go
all thy other hopes, and desires, and repent, and believe the Gospel,
acknowledge the grace of Christ, and submit and harken to him, and yield to his
gracious call, and opperationes, who calls thee by name, and he will give the
rest, and life, Mat. 11, 27, 28. Isa. 55.1, 3, and 61, 1, 2, 3. Psalm. 34.8.
Taste, and see, he is gracious.

Use. III.
This also may be an admonition to all men believers, and others to beware of
udging of Gods hatred, or love toward any man, or of the miserableness, or
happiness of any man's Spiritual, and eternal condition, by a man's having, or
wanting, being rich, or pore in the honor riches, friendship, power, or good
report among men, seeing this love of God that makes happy, is not like that of
the world nor so testified, and known all things of that nature coming alike
to all good, and bad, Eccless. 9.1, 2, 3. Such as are very dear to God, may in
all these outward things be very pore, Iam. 2.5. As Job, and such may be very
rich as David, Solomon, etc. And such as live in ignorance, unbelief, and
impenitencie, may be very pore, and such may be very rich, Iam. 5.1.6. Ier.
5.4.5. And so may men given up of God be also very pore, Iud. 1.6.7. And such
also may be very rich in these outward things, Ier. 12.1.2. Job. 21.22. So that
by these things, love or hatred cannot be known, only correctiones, by
afflictiones, meeting with a man, to prevent his sinning, or humbling, and
turning from sin, are found most often on those God most loves, Heb. 12.7.
Hose. 4.14. Wherefore to judge a man's self, or others simply by such outward
poverty, or riches, fullness, or want, prosperity, or adversity is very
unsafe, and the way to justify the wicked, and condemn the generation of the
just, Psalm. 73.1.15. And therefore to be shunned of us, Ioh. 7.24. Yet does not
this hinder, but that the receite of such outward favors as they, are fruits
of Gods tender compassiones, and his love, and faith-fulnesse to his redeemed
ones procured, and sanctified, through the blood, and grace of Christ, and the
receiver in beholding that grace made more humble in himself, and enlarged
thereby to give thanks to God and show forth his love to brethren, and
compassiones to men more abundantly, are testimonies of favor from God, and of
grace in the receivers, Psalm. 145.8, 9, and 136.24, 25; and 111.5. and 75, 3. 1 Timothy 4.4, 5. 2 Samuel 7, 18, 19. 2 Cor. 9.8.15. And also correctiones for
offenses received, as from the hand of a gracious God, and as sanctified
through the blood of Christ, in which the receiver is humbled to the
acknowledgement of his own sinfulness, and Gods righteousness, and so more
submitted to the teachings of grace, corruption more mortified, and he more
conformed to Christ, are arguments of favor to the receiver, Pro. 3.11, 12.
Heb. 12.5.11. Iam. 1.12.

Whereas when a man prospers in outward things, growing proud, and persisting
in evil more abundantly thereby, It is an argument of displeasure from God, and
wickedness in man. Psalm. 73.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18. and 92.6, 7. And so likewise is
it; for men to be followed with judgments, and therein to grow hard, and
desperate in persisting in evil ways, Exodus 7. etc. Isa. 26.10, 11. Though
still, outward prosperity, or adversity be of themselves neither prooses of
love, nor of hatred in God.

Use. IV.
This likewise may be, both an admonition, and motive to such as are babes,
and yet but weak in the says of Christ, who through some spiritual
discoveries of the grace of Christ in the Gospel, have been helped in some
measure to deny, and go out of themselves, and to receive the Gospel, so as
in some measure they believe in Christ, and love him, and yet are but weak,
and liable to many insirmities; as the disciples at the time of this love
affirmed were; To you I say, seeing this is recorded, and spoken for your
sakes, that you may know what portion you have in Christ Jesus, and with what
love you are beloved of him, as is before shown.

Oh: be warned, and moved to look for this love, Oh do not sit down, and rest
in this that you have seen his love to man-ward, and experimented his
compassiones to you, and found some peace in your consciences, in receipt of
remission of sins, and some access to the throne of grace, though this be
sweet, and precious, but wait through the Spirit in dependence on him, and in
this considence, seek ernestly, in supplication, and use of his appointed
means, in attending to the Gospel, to have your faith established in his
peculiar love of delight, and well-pleasednesse, Romans 5.1, 5. Heb. 6. 1. Gall.
5.5. Psalm. 105.1, 8, and 106, 4, 5. Ephesians. 1.17.20. And give all diligence, by
excercising, and walking in faith, and love, and yielding too, and bringing
forth the fruits of the Spirit, and waiting at his posts, that you may have
this special love of Christ more cleared, and assured to you, 2 Pet. 1.5, 11.
Heb. 6.11. Isa. 55.1.5. Pro. 8.34.35. And to that end, suffer not your heart by
any means to fall back to the love of the world, and the things thereof, 1
Ioh. 2.15.16. Neither desire to be loved of Jesus Christ as the world loves
her friends, Ioh. 14.27, and 15, 19, 20. Nor to be adorned, and filled with
such praise honor, riches, friends power, and good report as the Lord often
fills his enemies withal, and they that have their portion in this life
glory in, Job. 21. Psalm. 17.14. And if the Lord do give you a fullness in such
outward things, beware you, do not set your heart upon them, nor glory of them
or be delighted with them, Psalm. 62.10. Job. 31.24.25. Least they turn to be a
snare to you, and so damp your delight in good, and entangle, and unfit you for
the service of the Lord, and so deprive you of better riches, Deuteronomy. 8.10.20. 1 Timothy 6.9.10.11. But in jealousy of your selves, and in considence in him, pray
him to be merciful to you, in fitting you for all he gives you, and to bless
his mercies to you, in framing your heart by his grace to the acknowledgment of
his goodness, and faithfulness, in good use making of all the things he
gives into your stewardship, and that the light of his countenance may shine
upon you, Pro. 30.7.8.9. Psalm. 67.1.2. That you may take occasion more
abundantly thereby, to hold forth the word of life, Phill. 2.16. To show
compassion, and do good to all men, and be ready for every good work, Tit.
3.2.8. Gall. 6.10. To testify love in the services thereof, more abundantly to
the household of faith in fathering the ministration of the Gospel, relief of
the needy bowels of the saints, use of hospitallitie, and so to be rich in good
works, Gall. 6.6.9.10. Philem. 7. Heb. 13.1.2. 1 Timothy 6.18. And so shall all
your outward fullness be no hinderance, but profitable to you, and others,
Ecclez.. 7.11. Again if the Lord deprive you of such fullness, and keep you
low, and exercise you with tribulation in that respect so as you are poor,
and destitute of same, riches, friends, liberty, etc. among men, be not
offended, neither murmur at his dealing with you, seeing you are deprived of
nothing, but what Jesus Christ was deprived of in this life, he was the chief
beloved, yet he was more emptied, and afflicted here then you are, yea have
not resisted against sin, holding forth the faith to the blood, it is enough
for the disciple, to have as good use here as his master, but you are not yet
brought so low, Job. 2.10. Mich. 7.9. Heb. 12.3.4. Joh. 13.16, and 15, 19, 20.
Do not murmur therefore, but in patience possess your souls, Luke 21.19. Yea,
and the rather, seeing the want of these outward things and afflictions about
them, is no argument of want, or hinderance of having the most peculiar love,
Pro. 3.12. Isa. 43.1, 2, 3. Yea, when they are occasioned by the profession of
the Gospel, and suffered for the Gospel sake, they are great testimonies of
peculiar love, Act. 9.15.16. Rev. 7.14. Mat. 5.11.12. Wherefore let neither
fullness, nor emptiness withdraw thee, but let they heart be one, and thy
desires toward such love, as in which Christ Jesus is beloved, and seek to be
settled and stablished therem, seeing it appertains to thee.

Use. V.
This likewise may be an exhortation to all that believe in Jesus Christ and
love him, rightly to prize, and estimate this peculiar love of Christ to them;
So as:

I. To rejoice in the Lord evermore, and let the portion you have received of
him, and that you have in him be well-pleasing to you, and seek, and receive,
and take up all your satisfying, content, and glorious, rejoicing therein
Phill. 4.4. Romans 5.11. Psalm. 16.5, 6.

If you have fullness of outward things, and be so kept, and carried in the
use thereof, that the world cannot, but commend you, and that many are
beholding to you; yet do not you rejoice in this, Job. 31.35. Hose. 14.3.
Psalm. 20.7. But rejoice in the Lord that he is your portion, and has forgiven
you your sins, accepted you to favor, and is become your wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; and has given you his promise,
that he will be with you, your strength, guide, and salvation, Ier. 9.23.24.
1 Cor. 1.30.

If the Lord has enlarged you with many vissits, and useful spiritual gifts,
and great success therein, that much is done by you, and you therein preferred
before many others, yet in this rejoice not, that you are so enlarged, and
preferred before others, but rejoice in the Lord, that is become your portion,
and has writ your names in Heaven, and set his delight on you, 1 Cor. 4.6, 7.
Luke 10.20.

If the Lord exercise you with wants in outward things, and many tribulationes,
yet be not discouraged, but rejoice in the Lord that he is your portion, and
that you have in him all fulness of spiritual blessings, and treasure that
cannot be wasted, and that he has set his love on you, and gives you all
things pertaining to life, and Godliness, and will cause all things to work
for the best to you, and after a little trial possess you with the crown of
life, let the belief hereof cause you to endure, as seeing him, who is
invisible, and suffer not temporary asslictiones, to hinder your rejoicing in
him, Lam. 3.19.24, Psalm. 119.55, 57. Ephesians. 1.3. 2 Pet. 1.3, 4. 2 Timothy 4.8. Heb.
11.26.27. Psalm. 66.6. Who will in due season fill you with joy.

If the Lord try you with some darkness, hidings of his face though that be
the forest of all trials; yet let not your heart sinck into discouragement, nor
count it a strange thing, as if it could not stand with peculiar love, or might
not befall beloved sons, but in the depth of humilliation, and abasing of your
selves; yet rejoice in the Lord that is yours, and has appeared to you, and
because he loved you with everlasting love, has drawn you with loving
kindness, and though he hide his face from you both still, even now love you,
and is your light and protexion, in him is noe change; and in due season, he
will return again to you, and bring you forth to the light, and you shall see
his righteousness, Ier. 31.3.20. Lam. 3.31. Mich. 7.7, 8, 9, 10. Therefore
rejoice in him.

If diverse temptationes assaults you, rejoice not in sight of many outward, and
sencible helps, and props, but rejoice in the Lord, and in the power of his
might, Ephesians. 6.10. etc. In a word: when you a proach his courts, and use his
ordinances; yea, and at all times rejoice in the Lord, because of this his
great, and peculiar love, and loveninesse. Cant. 1.4. Psalm. 27.4.

II. To be meek, and patient in all the trials, we meet withal for the
profession of the Gospel, and for walking in faith, and love, and the services
thereof, and to be constant therein, notwithstanding all trials we must
meet with for the same seeing he loves us with such special, and peculiar
love, Heb. 10.36. Rev. 2.10. and 12.11. And that also seeing. It is agreeable to
the having of his choice love to go through many sufferings in the services of
love, Act. 9.15, 16. It is from the hand of our well-beloved, that loves us so
dearly, who is the Lord of all, and all are his servants. Eccles. 3.14. Psalm.
119.89, 90, 92. It is the appointed way to pass through, before we can come to
enjoy the harvest, and fullness of his peculiar love, and choice fruits
thereof, Act. 14.22; And that in due season as we suffer with him, we shall
rain with him, 2 Timothy 2.12.

III. To love one another as Jesus Christ has loved us, even so freely,
delightfully, flowingly, etc. And to walk in such love, and fellowship
together, etc. Ephesians. 5.1.2. To all which by this love of Christ we may be
exorted, but the special use, in which we may come to see, and ataine to all
set forth, in these uses is that which follows in the next point.

The Second thing to be veiwed is, Our Saviors gracious invitation, or
charge. Viz. Continue yea in my love.

This sentence by the whole drift, and scope of our Saviors instruction in the
simily from Verse. 1. to this 9 Verse. apeares to be meant in as large a sense as
Verse. 4. Abide in me, and I in you, and as Verse. 7. If ye abide in me, and my
words in you: Soc as the sense appears to be twofold.

First, Continue yea in my love, That is, Depend and rest upon it, and rest
your selves satisfied with it, and turn not aside from this my love, to seek,
or desire any other loves beside mine, Psalm. 36.7, 8. and 73.23, 26. and 23.
and 27. 1. Isa. 28.12, 16. and 30.15.16.

Secondly: Continue yea in my love, That is, let it be ever with you, in you,
and before you, and have its perfect working in you in all its operationes, and
do not smoother it, or shrinck from it in any of its workings, and motiones,
Rev. 3.3. Jam. 1^ 25. 1 Thessalonians. 5.19.

So that the meaning of the words apeare to be as much, as if our Savior had
said in more words to his disciples, and to us in them.

I. Continue yea in my love, take up all your satisfying, and well-pleasednesse
therein, Psalm. 16.5, 6, 7, and 18, 1, 2, 3. Phill. 3.3, 7, 8, 9. Drink in all
your delight, and resreshing therefrom, Joh. 7.37, 38, 39. Psalm. 36.7, 8, 9.
Cant. 1.2, 3, and 5, 1. And take up all your consolation, and glorying in this
my love, Jer. 9.23, 24. 1 Cor. 1.30.31.

II. Continue ye in my love, walk in it, and yield up your selves to go forth
in all the opperationes of it, doing all you do in the remembrance, belief,
of, and confidence in this my love, and in submission too and walking in the
same, Coll. 3.16, 17, and 2, 6. Gall. 2.20. Romans 6.17, and 12, 1.2. Phil.
2.2.6. So that to take the sense, both in a brief sum, and in an amplified
explication it comes both into the same sense, As.

I. To take it in a brief sum, it appears to have this sense, continue yea
in my love, (that is as much as to say) so cleave to me, and demane your selves
to mee-ward, in accepting of, and yielding to my love, in taking all your
satisfying in it, and yielding all your service to it, that you neither turn
aside, and wind out your selves from it nor cause me to hide, or withdraw it
from you, suitable to this are such prayers, and exhortations, as. Coll. 1.9,
10, 11, and 3, 9, 10, 16 Ephesians. 3, 16, 19, and 4, 1, 7, 22, 24. Ephesians. 5.2.

For such as so continue in his love, that by his love, they be enflamed with,
and led out in the love of him, shall partake of more abundant testimonies of
love from him, Pro. 8.27. Jeh. 14.21, 23. But such as withdraw from resting,
and delighting in his love, and yielding up in love to the requirings, and
opperationes thereof, he will not flow in upon them, with appearance, and
testimonies of his delightful love, but rather hide the same from them, Heb.
10.38. Therefore for our profit he said, continue yea in my love, viz. in
resting in, and yielding to my love.

II. To take the sense in an amplified explication in some particular branches,
to continue in this love of Christ contains in it these particulars.

I. To remember his love with all the fruits thereof, so as we never forget,
nor be unmindfull of the same, but keep it in our mind and heart, as it has
been by the word of grace, and his Spirit therein made known to us, Cant.
1.4. Psalm. 103.1. 5: As to say.

His redeeming us by his blood, even when we were his enemies, Romans 5.5.6, 10.
1 Cor. 15.1.4.

His accepting, and receiving us, when in the heavenly call we were presented
to him, though we were then in our blood, he washing, and speaking peace to
us, and in us, even by his blood that was before shead for us, Ezekiel. 16.4.6, 9.
Rev. 5.5.

His becoming all things for us, and to us, even wisdom, righteousness
sanctification, and redemption, Father, Brother, Prince, teacher, etc. 1 Cor.
1.30. Jsa. 9.6.

His often supporting, relieving, and visitting us, and assuring his gracious
presence with us, and giving us some experiment thereof in his gracious
opperations, Psalm. 34.4, and 116, 1, 10. Isa. 43.1, 2, 3. Romans 5.2.3.4.

His making us sons, and therein partakers of all his son like privilledges,
and therein filling us with peace, and assurance of raining, and so the first
fruits of eternal life, and the hope of the inheritance, and Kingdom, Joh.
1.12. 1 Ioh. 3.1.2. Rev. 1.6, and 5, 10. Romans 5.2.3.

His making an everlasting, and free covenant with us, engaging himself to us
for all these high privilledges, 2 Samuel 23.5. 1 Cron. 16, 15, 18. Psalm.
105.8.9.10. Of which himself is ever mindful.

And of all these things to be mindful, is one step of continuing in his love.

II. To abide in and keep fast, and constantly at all times, that judgment
esteem, and prizing of his love, and the fruits thereof, and the goodness
and equity of all it requires, and works, which was begotten, and quickened
up in us, upon the first discovery, and communication of his love to us by his
Spirit in, and through the word of grace, in which we were enabled to belief,
and this is another step of continuance in his love, Pro. 31.21, 22, and 4, 20,
21. Rev. 3.3. Ier. 2.1.5. Deuteronomy. 32.15.18.

III. To abide in, and hold fast our considence in his love, and goodness
which by his grace he has begotten, trusting perfectly to his grace, and this
is to stand, and stay in his love, Heb. 3.6.14, and 10, 35. 1 Pet. 1.13.

IV. To account this love of his, with the fruits thereof riches enough
without desire, or regard of any other love, or fruit to enrich us, and this
is to take up our content, and lie down in his love, Psalm. 73.23. Phil. 3.7.9.

V. To suffer this love of his thus remembered, esteemed, trusted to with
content taking therein, to have its perfect work in, and with us, 1 Ioh.
4.10.11.12.17.18.21. In making the world, with all the glory riches, and
goodlinesse thereof, as contemptible to us, as it will, Phill. 3.7.8. Jsa.
40.7.8.

In mortifying all the affections, and lusts of the flesh, and lusts after any
thing besides this love of Christ, and the fruits thereof, Coll. 3.1.4. Gall.
5, 23.

In carrying us forth to the acknowledgment of our own nothingnesse, and
confession of the great love of God, and seeking the enjoyment of it more and
more, abundantly, Psalm. 103. Romans 1, 16. Cant. 1.2.3.4.

In enflaming our desires, and commanding all our powers for all services of
love, through all labors and sufferings laid before us, Romans 12.12. Phill.
2.1.2.6. Rev. 12.11. 2 Cor. 5.14. And this is to yield up too, and to eat, and
drink in, and digest his love, Ioh. 4.32.34.

VI. To exercise our selves, and walk in this love of his, with this
remembrance, and estimate of, and considence in, and yielding to the opperation
of this his love, and to do all we have to do in performances, or sufferings,
in, and through this remembrance, belief, and acknowledgment of the love of
Christ, which is to walk in his love, 1 Cor. 13; 1, 13, and 16, 14.

VII. To rejoice evermore in the Lord, and in this his love, and to give him
thanks, waighting for the enjoyment of the fullness thereof, Phill. 4.4. 1 Thessalonians. 5.18. 1 John 3.1. 2 And thus also we shall be clothed with his love.

All these particulars joined together are encluded in continuing in his love;
so that the sense, whether briefly propounded, or largly set forth with
explication meet in one; to continue in his love, in performance of which
abideing in his love: what freedom from sin in respect of accusation, or
tirannicall commands: what freedom from the bondage of the law, and from
terrors, and fears of wrath, and death: What enjoyment of peace, and joye:
What heavenly operationes in purifying the heart, and silling with childlike
love desires, and sweet content: What experiments of strength, and goodness is
found, none know, but those that experiment it. Romans 5.1, 5. 1 Cor. 2.14.

But al they that continue thus in his love, do both know, and experiment it
such, and so good, that is better then life, 1 Ioh. 3.1, 2, 3. Psalm. 63.1, 2,
3. And they have their experiments for the proof, and can set their scale to
the same, witnessing him to be true, Romans 8.1, 2. Ioh. 7.37.38.39. and 3.33.

And from this gracious charge, and invitation of our Savior to his disciples,
to continue in his love, arise two observationes clearly,

Obs. I.
The insinit love, and good will of Jesus Christ, to those that believe in him,
and love him, farther showing it self in this, that he is not content only to
love them; and so peculiarly to love them: yea, and to make known such love to
them also, but that he would have them also always to continue, and abide in
this his peculiar love, and receive al refreshing, and satisfying in it, and to
be ever with him, and before him, eateing, and drincking loves in his presence,
Psalm. 36.8. and 65.4. Cant. 5.1. A favor greater then that of David, to
Mephibosheth, 2 Samuel 9.7. Even as much as that desired by the church, Cant. 8;
6. Well may his love be said to pass knowledge for height, breadth, depth,
length, Ephesians. 3.18, 19.

Obs. II.
The infinite obligation, in which believers are to Jesus Christ, and soc their
duty, and way, that is safe, and seemly for them, and well-pleasing to him;
namely: To continue and abide in this his love; Always to remember, and prize
it; to rest on, and yield too it, to dwell, and walk in it, as is
before-shewne, Ephesians 5.1, 2. and 4.1, 7, 20, 24. Psalm. 23. to the end. To which
his great love obliges, and his charge, from both which there are good
grounds, and strong motives of much usefulness to us, as to instance a little;
It serves

I. To reprove such believers, and professors of the Gospel of much
faultiness, and ingratitude, as having made some beginnings in the Spirit, and
in receite of some spiritual light in the Gospel, helping them to believe,
have experimented, not only peace in conscience, in belief of the atonement
made by Christ, but also in dependence on Christ, have met with some
discoveries, insights, and taste of his peculiar love, and loveliness, and the
sweet movings, and operationes thereof, 2 Cor. 3; 3, 18. Heb. 10. Gall. 3.1, 2.
and 4, 15. Who notwithstanding are again withdrawn and turned aside, either
to delight themselves with, or to heap up to themselves, or adorn themselves
with, or seek satisfying in the glory, riches, and things of this world, 2 Timothy 4, 10. Or to please themselves, or others in any idollatrous, or
superstitious service, or to perfect themselves, in becoming under the bondage
of the law to help themselves, with fleshly observances, and performances, to
make up their assurance, or faith, Gall. 3.1, 13. and 5.1, 5, 6. and 4. Yea, or
that have in any sort left their first love met, with in Jesus Christ. Rev.
2.4.5. To which, what need more be said then, Behold and remember this his so
great love, And what heart will it not wound, to think, that it should be so
bewitched, after the taste thereof, to commit so great folly, to prefer vanity;
to charge the all mighty with iniquity, to requite him so evil, that is so
gracious, Oh great solly, Gall. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. Ier. 2.5, 6, 13, 41, 46. Deuteronomy.
32.2.6, 7.

II. To admonish all that have believed in Jesus Christ, and loved him to
acknowledge the cause of all their weakness, and in temptationes readiness to
start aside for gain, or fear; all their murmurings discontents; all their
follies through envy, wrath, or any worldly, or fleshly lusts, to proceed from
a forgetfulness of this great love of Jesus Christ, and of God in him, and
want of resting thereon, and yiedling up to, and walking in the motiones
thereof, which would have preserved them. Iam. 1.12. Deuteronomy. 32.4.5.6.15.

III. To exort us to love the Lord Jesus, Psalm. 31.23. And to set forth the
praises of his love, Psalm. 145. to the end. And to continue, and abide in his
love, accepting it, and yiedling to it, as is before shown, the directiones
whereto follows.

The third thing to be veiwed is: the sweet, and safe direction, our Savior
gives his disciples, how to continue in his love, in which direction, a
gracious promise is encluded; If ye keep my commandments, yea shall abide in
my love, even as I have kept my Fathers commandments, and abide in his love.
FOR our better understanding of this direction, and promise, First, we have
two things to be enquired into, Viz. I. What were the Fathers commandments
concerning Jesus Christ, which he kept.

II. How, or in what manner Jesus Christ kept his Fathers commandments
secondly, we have two things expressed to be veiwed, and believed of us, Viz.
I. That Jesus Christ did keep his Fathers commandments, II. That in keeping
them he did abide in his Fathers love.

Thirdly we have our saviors assirmation, containing both.

I. The direction how, and II. The promise of continuing in his love.

First: For the things to be enquired into that we may know them, the first is
what were the Fathers commandments concerning Jesus Christ, and in the
scripture they appear to be, these two commandments.

I. That he should save all men, by giving himself a ransom, and offering up
himself a sacrifice for them, to make propitiation for their sins, so as to
make them saveable, and to open the door for a special and eternal salvation,
for all those that submit to him, and believe on him, 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6. Heb.
10.7. And this command encludes in it his taking the nature of mankind, subject
to humane infirmities, Romans 6.3. His being made under the law for them that
were under the law, Gall. 4.4.5. His bearing the sins of the world, Ioh. 1.29.
2 Cor. 5.19. His dying the death for every man, 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 2.9 His
rising again acquit of all the sins imputed to him, and a victorer over all
the curse, and death imposed on him, and over all the enemies he conflicted
with, 1 Cor. 15.4. 1 Pet. 3.22. And so by the eternal Spirit offering himself
with out spot to God, sealing the new Testament with his precious blood, and
with the virtue thereof entered the holy of holies, to make reconciliation for
the sins of the people, and appears in heaven before God for them, Heb.
9.11.12.14, 15, 16, 17, 23.24. All this is in the first commandment.

II. That he should bring all men to the knowledge of the truth, and so
enlighten, and convince them, that the Lord may dwell among them, and how ever,
that they may be brought to acknowledge Jesus the Lord to the glory of God, 1 Timothy 2.4.6. Romans 14.9.11.12. And more especially such as are in the day of
grace submitted to the acknowledgment of the truth, to guide them into all
truth, and to unite, and conform them to himself, making them meet for, and
in due season partakers of the inheritance with himself, Ioh. 16.13, 14, 15.
Isa. 55.4, 5, 2 Cor. 3.3, 18. Coll. 1.12.13. 1 Pet. 2.3.9. And this commandment
contains in it, His declaration of the Gospel, His communication of Spirit,
His enliving the dead, His opening the eyes of the blind, and the ears of the
deaf, his bringing the prisoners out of prison; his comforting, clothing, and
bewtifying them with grace, and glory, Isa. 61.1.2, 3. Luke 4.18, 21. Isa.
42.1, 8, and 49, 6, 9. And that these two commandments, the one to work, and
accomplish in himself, as the public person in the room, and place, a perfect
salvation for mankind with God by giving himself a ransom for them, and so
purchasing them into his own dispose as their Lord, and so making them
saveable, Romans 14.9.10.11.12. The other to offer the knowledge, and tenders of
this grace to them, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth, Ioh. 1.9.
And that such as are submitted to the acknowledgment of the truth in the day of
grace, and abide therein, he to confer upon them, and work in them eternal
salvation, Ioh. 8.31.36. That these be the commandments of the Father
concerning Jesus Christ our Lord is evident.

I. By the express, and plain affirmation of the scriptures, speaking of the
mind, and will of God, concerning the Man Jesus Christ the mediator between
God, and men what God wills concerning him, that he would have done by him;
It says of the first, God will have all men to be saved, And of the second,
And come to the knowledge of the truth; And speaking of the answerable
performance by Christ it says of the first, he gave himself a ransom for
all, and of the second, a testimony, or to be testified in due time, 1 Timothy
2.4.5.6. Both which are expressly said in other places also, to be his will to
be done by Christ, and which he came and undertook to doc, and having sinished
the one part, that respects the one commandment, and been performing, and
still is performing the other part of his will which respects the other
commandment, Psalm. 40.7, 8, 9, 10 Heb. 10.7, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16. Isa. 61.1.2.3.

II. By the plain testimony, and confession of Jesus Christ himself, who as he
was abased, and died for our sins, and rose for our justification, and so
offered himself as the ransom to God, and became the propitiation for the sins
of the world so he comprehends his humilation death, and resurrection, under
the first part of the will of his Father, and calls it his commandment,
saying I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again,
this commandment have I received of my Father, Ioh. 10.18. And of this part of
Gods will its most probable he spoke, Ioh. 6.38.39. I came down from heaven not
to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me, and this is the
Fathers will, which has sent me, that of all that he has given me I should
loose none, but should raise it up again at the last day, Agreeable to that is
said els-where. As in Adam all die so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Cor.
15.22. Agreeable to that which he after says, The bread which I will give, is
my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world, Ioh. 6.51. And this to
be heere-ment appears. I. In that this said, Verse. 38.39. Is made the ground
of his faithfulness, and power, for that he said before, Verse. 37. and after,
Verse. 40. II. In that the phrase is altered, Here is said, has given (as
intimating to purchase) but in Verse. 37. It is said, gives (as intimating by
the heavenly call) III. And in that the other part of his will is expressed as
distinct, and in other terms, Verse. 40. And to manifest his love, and
obedience to his Father in this command, in laying down his life, and offering
himself as the sacrifice for the sin of the world, Ioh. 1.29. That the world
might know it, when he was in the house, where those that sought to apprehend
him could not have come to take him, he said that the world may know, that I
love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do, arise,
let us go hence, Joh. 14.31. And thus have we the first commandment given to
Christ, set forth by his own testimony.

And for the other commandments; he says expressly, This is the will of him
that sent me, that every one that sees the Son, and believes on him, may
have everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day, Ioh. 6.40.
(intimating, To glory for all shall rise,) and speaking of the Gospel, and the
ministration thereof, through which he sends forth Spirit to enlighten, and
convince; and to bring the convinced to believe, and the believer to partake of
eternal life, in which respect the Gospel is a light, and a judge. Ioh.
12.46, 47, 48, 49.50.

He said, I have not spoken of my self, but the Father which sent me, he
gave me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak, and I know
that his commandment is life everlasting, whatsoever I spoke therefore, even as
the Father said unto me, so I speak, and so he says; The Lord God has
given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to minister a word
in due season, to him that is weary, Isa. 50.4.

In respect of these commands put on Christ, and undertaken to be performed by
him, he is in general called, The Savior of the world. Ioh. 4.42. And Gods
salvation to the ends of the earth, Isa. 49.6. And in special the Savior of
his Body, his people, Ephesians. 5.23. Mat. 1.21. And hence also he is said to be
created for the glory of God; and bidden by God, to bring forth the blind
people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears, Isa. 42.6, 7. and 43.7.8.
And because he undertook, and went on in these commandments, by the will,
and apointment of the Father, he is said to enter in the performance of both
by the door, Ioh. 10.1, 2, 3.17, 18. So that by our Saviors own testimony it
apeares, what the Fathers commands concerning him were.

III. It farther apeares by the furniture, wherewith he was fitted to keep
these commands, and so to perform both parts of his Fathers will, in effecting
salvation for the world, and eternal salvation in his peculiar people; the
Scriptures Assirming.

I. That for the first, He was sent into the world to be the Savior of the
world, 1 Ioh. 4.14. Ioh. 3.17. 1 Timothy 1.15. And had a body given him, that was
sit to suffer, Psalm. 40. Heb. 10.7. And was made under the law, Gall. 4.4.5.
That so he might bear the sins of men, and suffer, and offer up himself
in sacrifice for them, 2 Cor. 5.19, 21.

II. That for the second, he was exalted at Gods right hand, and imeasurably
silled with the Holy Ghost, to send forth in the Gospel, to make known the
salvation wrought by his death, and in his own body, and to aply the virtue of
his blood, and so to give repentance, and remission of sins, and so to heal,
and save, Isa. 50.4, 10, and 61, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 42, 1, 8. Psalm. 68.18, 20.
Act. 2.31, 33, and 5, 31, 32. By which furniture, it appears, what the
commands to him were.

IV. It is yet farther manifest in that these commands appear to be peculiar
too, and for Jesus Christ our Lord, who is the Lord from heaven, a quickening
Spirit, 1 Cor. 15.45.47. These commands being such as not only are but ever
were, beyond the power of all creatures, or any mere man to perform, Job.
28.1.23. The law which God at first put in man's heart, and to which by the grace
of creation he was bound with all the commands encluded in that law for loving
God with all the heart, soul, and strength, and ones neighbor as himself, were
suitable, and fit for a living soul, as the first Adam was made, and might
have been kept by him, if he had abode in his integrity, and so sin might
have been kept from entering into the world, Eccles. 7.29. 1 Cor. 15.45. But to
take away transgression (when it is come into the world) and to do it by
dying, and rising again, and so to ransom, and work a redemption with God for
transgressors, this is, and always was beyond the power of any mere man to
do, Psalm. 49.7.8. And so likewise to enlive these ransomed ones lying dead in
trespasses, and sins and to enlighten them, and give in the Holy Spirit to
renew, and save them, and fill them with eternal life is beyond the power of
all creatures, or any mere man, though converted, Ioh. 1.13, and 3, 3, 5, 6,
and 6, 44, 45. 2 Cor. 3.4.5.6.

These things are peculiar to him that is the son of God, God man, the savior,
and their is none besides, Heb. 1. and 2. to the end. Tit. 2.10. Isa. 45.21.
Who had a body given him to suffer, and was manifested in this world to take
away transgressions, Heb. 10. 1 John 3.5. And was exalted at his Fathers right
hand, and filled with Spirit, to enlighten his ransomed, to preach the Gospel
to the poor, to heal the broken hearted, and bring his people to life, and
glory, sa. 42.1, 8, and 50, 61, 1, 4. Whence God in putting these commands
upon his own son Jesus Christ, and on him only, is said to have laid help
upon one that is mighty, Psalm. 89.19.

V. The state, and condition we were in whom he came to save, does also
evidence, these foremencioned, to be the commandments, that were given to
Christ by him, that sent him forth to be our savior, our needs requiring the
same, that he should fulsill these commandments, for though his being righteous
in fulfilling the law, to which by the grace of creation we were all bound,
was both needful, and profitable for us, in that thereby, no need of any part
of his ransom, or sacrifice for himself, but all for us, Heb. 7.26.27. Yet
could not all that righteousness of his have made satisfaction for our sins,
and overcome our death, and procured life for us, it he had not done this for
us, by dying for our sins, and rising for our justification, and so fulfilled
that commandment, Mat. 26.39. Gall. 2.21. Romans 4.25. Ioh. 10.18. Neither by all
that his personal righteousness, joined with the fulfilling of this command
if he had not been filled with Spirit to send forth, and should not by that
Spirit in the Gospel be fulfilling the other command, in teaching and renewing
us, applying that salvation wrought to us, and working salvation in us, could
we be eternally saved, Isa. 42.1.8, and 61, 1, 4, and 54 3.11. Ioh. 6.44, 45,
and 15, 1, 8. And thus it appears, what the Fathers commandments concerning
Christ are.

II. The second thing to be enquired is, How, or in what manner Jesus Christ
kept his Fathers commandments, and that the Scripture shows.

I. That he kept and performed the same in, and through an union with his
Father in mind, will, and purpose, and so in love to his Father, and to his
chosen, and to mankind. Ioh. 10.27.30. Heb. 10.7, 9, 10. Psalm. 40.7.8. Ioh.
4.34. And so from the law writ in his heart, with delight to do his will.

II. That he so kept, and performed them in the midst of a gainsaying people,
and against many temptationes from the devil, and from the world, both Jews,
and Gentiles, and notwithstanding many illrequitealls from his called ones,
Isa. 53.1, 2, 3, 4. and 65.2. Mat. 4.1.12. Heb. 12.3.

III. He so kept, and performed them constantly, goeing through, and enduring
all the labor, pain, and suffering set before him; till he entered his rest
where he abides faithful, Isa. 50.5, 6. and 53.7. Heb. 12.2. and 4.10.16.
Phill. 27.11.

IV. He kept, and performed them by the very power of the devine nature, in and
by the stirring, and motion of the Holy Ghost, Luke 4.1, 14. Heb. 9.14. Romans
1.4. and 6.4, Isa. 11.1, 2.

And thus, and in this manner did Jesus keep his Fathers commands; Secondly,
For the things expressed, they are fully, and plainly affirmed, which should
be to us proof sufficient; yet for better usefulness, we may veiw them,
that we may the more profitably believe them.

I. The first of them is that Jesus Christ has kept his Fathers commands, not
only those that apertained to his own person, as he had taken our nature, and
had a soul, and body like us, and was made under the law for us, which law he
also perfectly kept, and fulfilled, and so in that respect was altogether
without sin, and perfectly righteous, Which is greatly for our benefit, 2 Cor.
5.21. 1 Pet. 2.22. and 3.18. Heb. 7.26.27. But also as that here specially
meant, and which we are here especially to heed, he has kept those commands
which the Father gave him, in respect of his office and mediatorship, for which
he so fitted him, and which were so peculiar to him, and needful for us, that
he should perform, 1 Timothy 2.4, 5, 6. Heb. 10.7.19. In respect whereof; he is
also the just one, and faithful and perfectly righteous in fulfilling them, 1
Ioh. 2.1.2. and 1.9. And that he has kept these commands, is evident.

I. By the plain affirmation of Scripture.

In respect of the first command, that he gave himself a ransom for all men,
by the grace of God tasted death for every man, 1 Timothy 2.6. Heb. 2.9. He
humbled himself, and became obedient to the death even the death of the cross,
Phill. 2.8. Died for our sins, and was buried, and rose again the third day
according to the scriptures, 1 Cor. 15, 3.4. In respect of the other command, a
testimony in due time, 1 Timothy 2.6. He is the true light, which lights every
man that comes into the world, Ioh. 1.9. He taught in their sinagogues, etc.
Luke 4.14, 15, 22. He taught, and advocated for his disciples, and gave his
Fathers words to them, and sent, and sends forth Spirit from his Fathers
right hand, Act. 2.33. Ephesians. 4.7, 8, 12. And was, and is faithful to him that
appointed him, as a son over his own house, to edify preserve consolate, and
glorify them Heb. 3.1, 6. Isa. 61.1.4.

II. By his own testimony, both by words, and deeds, by word, he said, I will
give my flesh for the life of the world, I lay down my life that I might take
it again, this commandment have I received, etc. The Father gave me a
commandment, what I should fay, and what I should speak therefore even as the
Father said unto me, so I speak, I have (says he to his Father) sinished
the work which thou gave me to do, I have manifested thy name unto the men
whom thou gave me, Ioh. 6.51, and 10.17, and 12, 49.50, and 17, 4, 6. By
deed, lie went out of the house, and over the brook, and into the garden, and
offered himself to those that came to apprehended him, and died, and rose, and
ascended, and sent forth of the Holy Ghost, etc. Ioh. 14.31, and 18, 1, 4, etc.
Act. 1, and 2.

III. By the testimony of his Father that Jesus is his son, in and with whom
he is well-pleased, bidding all, to look to him, and hear him, and assures,
that he is full of Spirit, and will not fail in whatever appertains to him
to do, Mat. 3.17, and 17, 5. Isa. 42.1.8.

IV. By the evidence, and witness of the Holy Ghost, of whom it is said, the
Spirit of truth which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me,
Ioh. 15.26. And so is the Holy Ghost a witness of these things, whom God has
given to them that obey him, Act. 5.32. God also bearing witness, with signs,
and wonders, and diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his
own will, Heb. 2.4. Yea the Holy Ghost will so evidence the righteousness of
Christ in his perfect keeping of these commands, that he will reprove the world
of sin, because they believed not on Christ (that had ransomed them and
received Spirit, and sent forth light to bring them to believe) And he will
enable such as are turned in his reproves to believe on Christ, 1 Pet.
1.21.22. And will farther glorify Christ in the hearts of believers, and guide
them into all truth, Ioh. 16.13.15. That they may know him in respect of his
faithfulness in these commands, to be all wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification and redemption for, and to them, an all life, and good in them,
1 Cor. 1.30. Coll. 1.27, and 2, 3, 9, 10, and 3.11.

V. By the experiments of those that are taught of God, who in the knowledge,
and belief of this grace met with in Christ, his keeping these commands for
us, have seen, and experimented, that through his obedience and faithfulness
in the first command, having offered himself in sacrifice, for the sin of the
world; It is that the earth is preferved, that life is reprived, that Gods
patience, and long-suffering is extended, and that mercies, and bownty are
daily renewed, and the foundation of repentance, laid, and the door of hope,
and life opened to them, Psalm. 75.3. Act. 17.28. Romans 1.16. With. 2.4. Lam.
3.22.23. 2 Timothy 1.10. 1 Timothy 4.10.

And that through his faithfulness in the other command, making known and
aplying by his Spirit the virtue of his blood to them, and working by his
Spirit in them it is, that they believe in him, and love him; that they enjoy
remission of sins, peace with God, joye in the Holy Ghost, knowledge of their
sonship, support in trials, refreshing in ordinances, fellowship with God, and
brethren, hope of glory, etc. Romans 4.24, 25. and 5.1, 11. Phill. 1.29. 1 Pet.
1.21.22. Romans 14.17, 18. 1 Ioh. 1.1, 2.3, 4, 7. Psalm. 36.8. and 65.4. So that
from their experments, they can set too their seal that he is true, Ioh. 3,
32.33. Romans 8.1, 2, 3, 4.

VI. By the witness of all those faithful ministers of the word, that have
this gracious testimony inspired to their heart, who bear record of this Gospel
that declares, this which Christ has done, and is at his Fathers right hand
ready to do, knowing they declare no fable, and that where this is faithfully
declared, they are witnesses, and in such witness bearing, Christ sends forth
the Holy Ghost, to enlighten, and bear witness to others that they may
believe, 2 Cor. 5.18.19. Act. 5.31, 32, and 10, 44. 1 Pet. 1.12. Mat. 28.20. 1
Ioh. 1.4.6.

So that it clearly, and many ways appears that Jesus Christ has kept his
Fathers commandments, this being encluded in that great mystery, 1 Timothy 3.16.

II. The second thing expressed is, that Jesus Christ in keeping his Fathers
commandments did abide in his Fathers love, So that.

I. In keeping these commandments, even while he was made low, and under law
for our sakes, and did humble himself to be made pore, and to die for us, yea
in all his sufferings he went through, whose love soever he lost, and of
whatsoever he was deprived, and whosoever hated, and persecuted him, yet in all
his Fathers love, and well-pleasednesse was with him, his delight was in him,
his presence with him, and his purpose of glorifying him firm, unmovable, and
inseparable, yea even when the shines and appearances of his love, and
delightful fellowship were withdrawn, and hidden from him, and he for our
sakes so far left, as to feel the punishment of our sins, which he suffered,
yet even then did the Father love him, yea, and also therefore love him, Heb.
29. Phill. 2.6, 7, 9, 10. Ioh. 16.32. end 10.17.

And in his ministration of the Gospel, and communication of Spirit, and all
the opperationes thereof in the hearts of his people, the Father is well-pleased
with him, and as he has accepted his sacrifice, and ransom for the sons of
men, so he accepts all his Spiritual offerings, and opperationes in the
hearts of believers, acquainting them with, and drawing, and presenting them
before his Father, Isa. 42.1.2.8. Psalm. 20.3. Ioh. 17.1, 8, and 5, 19, 37. In
all loving him.

II. In keeping these his Fathers commandments, he himself took delight in,
and was well-pleased, in, and with his Fathers love, not desiring other loves,
favor, riches, pomp, or Kingdom, nor being troubled for being deprived of
them, or any of them, having all his satisfying, and content in the love, and
well-pleasednesse of his Father, always being well-pleased with him, Ioh.
4.32, 34, and 5, 43, 44, and 10.30. Psalm. 40.8. Ioh. 14.31, and 16, 32.

III. In all trials that befell him on earth in keeping these commandments,
this his Fathers love, and well-pleasednesse with him, and his delight, and
satisfying therein found, had its perfect working with him carrying him through
all labors, and sufferings, so as he neither drew back from any part of the
first command, Heb. 12.2. Isa. 50.5.6.7. Nor did nor will fail in the other
command to fulfill all righteousness, Isa. 42.1.2.8.

IV. In all this his so keeping these commands, through all he met on earth, he
retained the belief, and held fast the confidence he had in his Fathers love,
with assurance of being upheld, and in due season to see the travel of his
soul, and to be glorified, with the glory he had with his Father before the
world was, Isa. 50.5, 6, 7, and 53, 8, 11. Ioh. 17.1.2.3. And now being
glorified at his Fathers right hand, remains there Advocating for, and
sending forth Spirit to his people, waiting till all his enemies be made his
footstool, when he will take his great power, and reign, being the
well-beloved of his Father, Psalm. 110. 1 Ioh. 2.1.2. Ephesians. 4.7.12. Rev. 11.17.
Thus has Jesus Christ kept these his Fathers great commandments, and abode in
his love, which might be of much use to us.

I. To inform us of the great love of Christ to us, that has undertaken, and
performed these so great, needful, and fit commands to be done by him for us,
and of the great love of God in the gift of his son, to fulfill such
commandments for us, and so loving, and accepting him in the keeping of them,
Gall. 2.20. 1 Ioh. 4.9, 10, and 3, 16. Romans 8.32, and 5, 6, 11. 2 Cor. 3.18,
and 4.6.

And of the full, and perfect salvation, that is to be found in Jesus Christ,
that great salvation he has wrought in his own body for men, and that
healthful, and eternal salvation, which by his Spirit applying the former,
he works in those that believe on him, and love him, 1 Ioh. 4.14. 1 Pet.
2.24. Heb. 5.8, 9, and 7, 24, 25.

II. To exort us, to look to him, and to that he has done, and that which
apertaines to him to do; to believe both, and to accept, and receive the one,
and to depend one, and submit to him for and in the other, Isa. 42.1.8 and
45.22.23. and 55.1.6. Romans 4.24, 25. and 5.1.6, 11. and 6. to the end. And soc
to love him, and it love to receive, and highly prize this his direction, and
promise to follow, and walk in the one, and to depend one, and wait for the
other.

And so we come to the third thing in this point, which is that here also
affirmed by our Savior, (that) As he has kept his Fathers commands, and abode
in his love, so if we keep his commandments, we shall abide in his love, In
which are contained two things clearly set forth. Viz. FIrst: A sweet, and
healthful direction, how to continue in his love; namely, I. In keeping his
commandments II. In keeping them, as he kept his Fathers commandments.

Secondly, A comfortable promise, that so keeping his commands, they shall
abide in his love.

First the healthful direction, has three things in it to be opened and
understood for our better use-fulnesse.

I. The commands of Jesus Christ to believers heere-ment, what they are.

II. The keeping of them, of which he here speaks what that is.

III. The manner of keeping, as he kept his Fathers commands what that is.

I. For the first of these: to know rightly, what the commandments of Jesus
Christ to believers heere-ment are, livers things may be considered.

Consider I.
That there be commandments of divorts sorts, mentioned in the Scripture, as
to instance the chief of them, There are:

I. Such commands as by the grace of creation by Christ, and by the grace of
redemption, wrought in, and by Christ, in his own body, and the common frultes
thereof; all men are bound with all their powers, and in, and by that strength
that at any time has been given into their natural powers by God, to perform
to the utmost, in performance of which, if noe failing be found, they shall
have life, but the least failing therein, if but once, in any part of any one
command, does always leave a man in, and of himself under sin and death, the
wages thereof, and by these commandments, are all men found under the guilt of
sin, and under the power of curse, and death, even al those that sight
against, and run cross to these commands, and al those also, who do their
utmost to make themselves righteous in, and by the keeping of them, Romans
2.12.14. and 3.10, 20. and 6.23. and 10.5. Gall. 3.10. Ieb. 9.22, 30, 33. And
the trespasses which these commandments do charge mankind withal, and which
through the fall they were necessitated to commit, and left without devine
power to help themselves were all laid on Jesus Christ, who mas manifested to
take them away, and to make propitiation for the sins of the world, Isa. 53.2,
6. 2 Cor. 5.19.21. 1 Ioh. 3, 4, 5. and 2.2. Ioh. 1.29. And under this law of
commandments was Jesus Christ made for those that were under it, Gall. 4.4. And
he himself, and he only did altogether, and always fulfille it, so as it
could charge him with no sin of his own commission, but only with our sins
against it, in that he was made under that law for us, so as al his whole
suffering, and sacrifice was for us, 1 Pet. 2.22.24. and 3 18. 2 Cor. 5.21. And
to this law has he perfectly satisfied, in respect of himself in fulfiling
it, and in respect of us, in suffering for all it can charge us with, that so
through his death for us, we might be dead to it, 2 Cor. 5.14. Romans 6.10 11.
and 7.4. And by his death, and resurrection spiritually evidenced, and aplieil
to us, be in bolieving freed from the bondage of it, Gall. 4.4, 5. and
3.25.26. and 5.1. So that such commands in respect of such a bond is not here
meant.

II. Such commands, as are beyond all the reach, an^ power that is, or ever was
in any creatures: and these are To make satisfaction for sins entered, and to
take them out of the way; and to abollish death, and to procure favor, and
life again with God for mankind: And also, by Spirit, to make known this
salvation wrought, and to communicate the same to such as embracing this
knowledge, do there through believe, and so to enlive, and sanctify them
therewith, and therein, working salvation in them, and communicating eternal
life to them, which commandments are before shown what they are; and how they
belong only to Jesus Christ our Lord the mediator between God, and men, who is
found faithful, and perfect in performance thereof; and by fullfilling the
one, has wrought salvation with God for men, and in full filling the other
offers salvation to men, and communicates eternal Salvation to those that
believe in him, as is before declared, nor is there any creature in, and by
whom the fulfilling these commands can be found, that being peculiar to Jesus
Christ our Lord, Ioh. 28.1, 23. Psalm. 40.6, 10. and 49.7.8. Isa. 49.6, 9. and
50.2, 9. Heb. 10.1, 10. So that these commands are not here meant.

III. Such commandments as are given by Jesus Christ, the fulfiller of these
former commandments unto those, who by his Spirit through the Gospel are
drawn to believe on him, into whose heart by the same Spirit, he puts those
commandments, Heb. 8.2, 6, 10. Ier. 31.33. Which commandments are not such, or
so given, as to bind us to work our righteousness, in and by our own
observances, and performances by our own strength, or such as we had once in
Adam, or by his devine providence have in our natural powers, as the former
law did, under which by nature we were, and under which he was made for us;
such commandments so given, are to usward being fallen, heavy, and
burdensome, neither can we have life in our observance of that law, but his
commandments be not grievous, but easy, sweet, and affording-light and life
in the observance. Romans 8.2.3.4. Phill. 3.3, 9. Gall. 2.21. and 3.5, 10, 25.
and 4. and 5.18. Ioh. 1.14.16.17. Romans 3.27. Matt. 11.27.28. 1 Ioh. 5.3. Gall.
6.8.

Nor are these commandments of Jesus Christ to his disciples, such, or so
given, as those which have already been shown to be put upon Jesus Christ
himself, and poculiar to him, Psalm. 40.6. Jsa. 50. to the end, 1 Cor. 1.12.2.
Cor. 3.3, 17, 18. But they are such commandments, and so given, as that they
come from Jesus Christ our savior, in the declaration of the salvation,
wrought in, and by his own person with God for men, in fulfilling the first
commandment he received of his Father, and the salvation, which by Spirit
applying the former, he works in men to God, in fulfilling the other
commandment he received of the Father when he helps any to believe, in which
believing, he puts these commandments into their heart, Ioh. 6.38, 40, and
17, 6, 8. 2 Cor. 3.3.17, 18. Ier. 31.33. Heb. 8.6.10. Which commandments are
to believe on him, and to love one another, which by this first consideration
appears to be the commandments of Christ to his disciples, and those
heere-ment, 1 Pet. 1.2.8.18.19, 20, 21, 22.

Consider. II.
That the commandments of Christ to his disciples, are such, commands as are,
I. Contained, and expressed in the Gospel, II. Put with the Gospel by the
Spirit of Christ into the heart of believers. III. And do naturally, and aptly
spring up in the belief of the Gospel.

I. The commands of Christ to his disciples are contained, and expressed in the
Gospel, the Gospel fully declaring the mind of Christ not only in declaration
of that good he has wrought for us and that which he is able, and ready to
work in us, and to confer on us, but that also which he requires of us, that
we may receive him, and be followers of him, Mar. 1.14.15. Act. 13.38, 40, and
20, 27, 35, and 26, 18. 2 Cor. 5.19.20. Whence the Gospel also is called the
commandment, 2 Ioh. 4.5. 1 Ioh. 2.7. 2 Pet. 2.21. Romans 16.26. And the law of
Christ the law of faith, the law of righteousness, the law of the Spirit of
life, and the law of liberty, Gall. 6.2. Romans 3.27, and 9, 31, 32, and 8.2.
Iam. 1.12. And the so receiving the Gospel, as thore through to believe on
Jesus Christ, and love our brother, and yield to and walk in that faith, and
love, is called obedience, of the doctrine of faith, of Christ, Romans 6.17, and
16, 19, 26. Heb. 2.5.9. And all not so receiving the Gospel where it comes,
are said not to obey the Gospel the word, the truth, 2 Thessalonians. 1.8. 1 Pet.
4.17, and 3, 1. Gall. 3.1. The Gospel of Christ is a full, and perfect
doctrine, and stands need of no other law for precepts to direct, and lead
such as come into Christ having in it self, not only general, but particular
precepts, even for every branch of all that which the grace of God requires of
believers, as to give some instances precepts for repentance, Mat. 3.2. Mar.
1.15. Act. 17.30. For submission to Christ and receiving his reproof, and
forsaking all we have for his sake, Iam. 4.6.7. Pro. 1.23. Mat. 16.24, 25, 26.
For believing whatever his Gospel reports, Ioh. 12.36. Mar. 1.15. For
approbation of, and resting on him, Pro. 4.8. Isa. 30.7.15. For hearing, and
attending to the sayings of Christ, Pro. 8.10. Mat. 17.5. For looking to Jesus
Christ for beginning, and finishing in us all that belongs to life, and
godliness, Isa. 45.22. Heb. 12 2. For loving the Lord, Psalm. 31.23. And
therein, and so for child like affectiones to God, Mall. 1.6. For brotherly
affectiones to believers, 1 Pet. 4.8. For compassion and meekness to such as
are ignorant, and out of the way, Mat. 5.44. As likewise, for being
feare-lesse, and strong in the way, Isa. 8.12.13. and 41.14. 1 Cor. 16.13. For
being patient, Iam. 5.7. For being sinceere, Tit. 2.7. For being fervent in
Spirit serving the Lord, Romans 12.11. And so always, and in all, to have God,
and Jesus Christ only for our God, and Lord, 1 Cor. 8.6. 1 Ioh. 5.20.21. To
worship him in Spirit, and truth, Ioh. 4.24 To seek to glorify his name in all
things, 1 Cor. 10.31. To delight in keeping sabbath with him, Isa. 58.13.14.
Heb, 4.10.11. And with his, Heb. 10.25. To veeld our neighbor that
pre-eminence and respect God has given him, in our love, care, and service,
and so to honor our parents, and not to hurt (but preserve) the life chestity,
wealth, and good name of any one, in desire word, and deed, 1 Timothy 1.6. Ephesians.
5.20, 30, and 6. Coll. 3.5.10. 1 Thessalonians. 5.15. And many such like precepts, and
more over precepts, for to delight ones self in God, and rejoice in Christ
Jesus, Psalm. 37.4. Phill. 4.4. To pray, and give thanks in the name of Christ
Jesus, Joh. 16.24.26. 1 These. 5.17.19. To love one another, even as Christ
Jesus has loved us, and to walk in that love, Ephesians. 5.1.2. 1 John 4.11. And so
to bear each others infirmities, and burdens seeking each others good, and
preferring them in love before our selves, Rim. 15.1.3. Gall. 6.2. Phill.
2.4.5. Romans 12.10. To hold forth the word of life by an Holy confession, and
unblameable conversation before all men, Mat. 10.28. Phill. 2.16. To edefy one
another in our Holy faith and to preserve in, and stir up each other to love,
and good works, 1 These. 5.11.14. Ind. 20.21. Heb. 10.24. To yield up all our
members to God, to fulfill all these sayings, and motiones of his Spirit, Romans
12.1.2. Phill. 2.1.2.6. Gall. 5.24. 1 These. 5.19. To bear the reproach of
Christ with patience, and faithfulness to the death, Heb. 13.13. Rev. 2.10.
And to wait for the coming of Christ, etc. 2 Pet. 3.12. All these, and such
like precepts, leading us to yield up our selves, as servants to Christ and in,
and for him to his people, doing all things to Christ that are contained, and
expressed in the Gospel, Coll. 3.17.23. And yet also so expressed, as in the
Gospel appears.

I. That these particular precepts, are not in respect of the obligation, such,
or so given, as the law of works enjoyneth, that is, to fulfill them by our
wisdom, and in our own strength, Romans 8.3. and 10.5. Or to make our selves
righteous before God, in and by the keeping of them, Gall. 2.21. Romans 10.3. Or
to get Christ and his righteousness, or life, or the enheritance by our
keeping of them, Romans 9.16.31.32. Gall. 3.18.21. Romans 11.6. and 4.1.2. But in
the declaration of the salvation so wrought by Christ, and the righteousness,
and life to be found in him, to show what is suitable walking therein, and
thertoo, and what his mind is concerning such as believe, for working in them,
and leading of them, that so believing him our righteousness, we might look
to him and depend on him to work all this in us, and for us, so leading us in
his strength to perform them all, Tit. 2.11.14. 1 These. 4.1.2.3. 1 Ioh. 3.16.
and 4, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 These. 5.23.24. Isa. 26.12. Psalm. 138.8.

II. That the way to perform these particular precepts is not by a first
setting our eyes on them, and so striving to do them, because we ought to do
them, and that we may so do that we ought to do, 1 Samuel 2.9. Josh. 24.19.
Den. 5.29. Zach. 4.6.7. Pro. 3.6.7. But first to look to that which Jesus
Christ has done, and suffered for us, and that he has promised to us, that
there-through, believing in him we may love him, and one another, and so walk
in that faith, and love, wherein all contained in those particular precepts,
will be effected in us, his Spirit leading us to the same, 1 Cor. 15.1, 2, 3,
4. Joh. 7.38.39. 2 Cor. 3.17.18. Romans 8.2.14. Gall. 5.16.18. So that faith, and
love appear by this to be the commandments heere-ment, being so contained,
and expressed in the Gospel yea as the sum of all the pattern of whole some
words therein, 2 Timothy 1.13. Yet is not this expression enough, unless we take
in the next, namely that the commandments of Christ to his disciples as they
are contained, and expressed in the Gospel. So.

II. They are put with the Gospel by the Spirit into the hearts of believers,
Ier. 31.33. Heb. 8.10. First it is to be noted, that when God calls men to
Christ by the Gospel, and does by his Spirit enlighten their hearts, in the
knowledge of his insinit grace in Christ so as he in glorifying Christ, and
the word of his grace to them causes them to admire, and glorify Christ, and
the word of grace, and so draws them to Christ, that they run to him, and he
meets, and receives them, then does Jesus Christ not only manifest by Spirit
with supper natural light, and Spiritual evidence, and demonstration his
love, and his Fathers love, and gracious mind, and so the truth and goodness
o^ his Gospel, or word of grace, but also by a Spiritual it spiration
enfusion, and devine power does enter his grace, and gracious word into their
heart, so as he causes them to understand, believe, and love it, and so to
receive it, that it takes place, and seats it self in their heart, Act. 2.3.
Isa. 55.5.6. Joh. 6.37.45. Mat. 16.16, 17. Heb. 10.32. Act. 13.48. Joh. 1.11,
12, 13, and 17, 2, ^ 1 Cor. 2.4.5, 14, 15, 16. 2 Cor. 3.3, 18, and 4, 6. Psa.
36.9, and 119, 130. Whence this word is called also, the ingrafted word able to
save, Iam. 1.21. And said to be p^^^ in them, 2 Cor. 5.19. And received of
them, 1 These. 2.13. And to be in them, Joh. 15. Now when Jesus Christ do^^
thus put his word into a believing heart, he does also thereby effect, and give
a new heart and in that new heart does Jesus Christ put, or write his
commandments, 2 Cor. 3.3. Heb. 8.6.10. Causing, and enabling them in, and
through their belief, and receite of the word of grace, and so of that which
Christ has done for them, when they were his enemies, and has in the heavenly
call done in them, and is now able, and ready to do for them, being called to
believe, and depend on him for saving them by his life, and communicating
eternal life to them, Romans 5.1.10. 1 Ioh. 2.24.25. 1 Pet. 1.21. And so to
work in them, and for them, all that which in the precepts of the Gospel is
required of them, Jsa. 26.12. Psalm. 138.8, 1 Cor. 1.8.9. 1 Thessalonians. 5.24. And to
confer on them all that which in the promises of the Gospel is set before
them, Romans 4.20, 24. 1 Timothy 1.12. And this faith, or believing, and dependence
on him, for all this is the first and great commandment, put by Christ into
the heart of the believer, Phill. 1.29. 1 Pet. 1.21. And in this belief in
Jesus is contained, and by his Spirit given, and effected, and in the believing
heart in some measure experimented, the springing up of all before-said. Viz.

Repentance, in change of the mind, estimate, and thoughts of God an himself,
of sin, and of righteousness, with grief for his misconceiptiones, and
miscarriages, and a turning the heart to Christ, and to God in Christ, being
the first step in believing in Christ, Luke 24.47. Act. 5.31. With 10.43. and
26.18, 20. Mat. 21.32. and 9.3.

Submission to Christ in receiving his reproof, and letting all go that he
reproves, and discovers vile, and vain, and yiedling to him for life, and
guidance, Romans 10.3, 10. Phill. 3.3, 7, 8. Ephesians. 5.24. 2 Cor. 10.4.5.

Believing Jesus to be the Christ, and the truth of Gods report concerning
Christ, and his love in giving him, and his promises to him, and all believing
in him, Ioh. 4.10, 12. and 8, 24. and 20.31.

Inward a probation of Jesus Christ, and that discovered in him, and done, and
to be done by him, with rest, and quietness of heart therein, as in that which
is enough. Phill. 3.3.8. and Psalm. 16.6.7.

Harkening to Christ in attending to his sayings, and waiting for, and yiedling
to his teachings. Psalm. 85, 8. and 119.33.

Looking to him for the beginning, and finishing of all that belongs to life,
and Godliness, Isa. 8.16.17. Mich. 7.7.

Inward, and hearty love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to God in him. Isa. 6.4.
With 1 Cor. 2.9. 1 Pet. 1.8.

Which love springing from the love of God, shead abroad in the heart, does
incline the heart with childlike affectiones to God, 1 Ioh. 4.14. Ier. 3.19.
Psalm. 116. 1. And with unfeined delight in, and love of brethren. 1 Pet. 1.22.
And love of compassion, and mercy to men, 2 Cor. 5.14. And so has Christ put
in the heart of the believer, the love of our brother, 1 Ioh. 4.21. Which is his
second commandment, and like the first, in that as the first receives; so
this works forth all righteousness; So as

I. This faith, and love does quallify the heart, faith, working by love, Gall.
5.6. And so make the heart of the believer sit for all inclinationes labors,
and services of love, in that it makes it, strong to endure and go through all
the sufferings of it, Cant. 8.6.7. Patient to endure that which is to be
undergone, and for gone for it, 1 Cor. 13.4.8.

Sinceere, in seeking none of a man's own ends, but only the beloved, and so
preserves from stumbling, Phill. 1.9.10.11. Fervent to accomplish that wherein
it may testify love to the beloved, Psalm. 116.12. Constant in all things that
love leads too, orthrough, 1 Ioh. 2.10. Yea, and likewise, II. This love,
through, or by which faith works, does move, and spring up freely in the
heart, inclinationes, and motiones to as much, as the law of works, of it were
in its force could compel, or enjoyne too, as, to have God for our God for
ever, Zach. 13.9. To worship him in Spirit, and truth, Psalm. 95.6. To glorify
his great name, Phill. 1.20. To delight in keeping sabbath with him, and his,
Psalm. 27.1.4. To give our neighbor that pre-eminence God has given him, in
our service, and care, and so to seek to preserve his life, dignity chastity,
estate, and name, and to fly the lust of having any thing from him that is his,
Romans 12.10, and 13, 8, 9, 10. Yea farther.

III. This love flowing in this faith, does move, and lead to things higher,
and more excellent then the law could have led too as namely.

To long after, and delight, and have all our well-pleasednesse in Jesus Christ
in whom God has his, and so to be beholding his glory, and drinking in of the
fullness that is in him, Psalm. 73.25, 26, and 84, 1, 2, and 27, 1, 4. Cant. 1,
2, 3, and 2, 3, 5. To love our brethren as Christ has loved us, 1 Ioh. 3.16.
and 5.1. And in this faith, and love, to glorify Christ and the word of his
grace, Phill. 1.17, 20, 21, 27. To edify our brethren in faith, and love, 1
Cor. 8.1. and 13, to the end. To hold forth the word of life, Ephesians. 6.19. And
all in faithfulness without loving our lives unto death, Rev. 12.11.17. Yea,
and to say farther.

IIII. This love (by which faith works) stirs, and works effectually in
these motions for fulfilling the same, in yielding up ones self to the Lord as
his, and all the members as his servants, to walk in, and according to this
love, Psalm. 119.125, and 106, 9, 10, 19. And this also in love of, longing, and
waiting for the appearing, and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Timothy 4.8.
Rev. 22.17.20.

And thus in scripture it appears that all particular precepts are found, and
performed in believing in Christ, and loving one another, and so how Christ
has put with the Gospel his commands in the heart of believers, and though the
degree, or measure heerof be different, and in some very small, yet in some
degree, or other may every believer that has attained to walk in faith, and
love seal this truth by experience, Ioh. 7.37, 38, 39, and 3.33. Romans 8.1, 2.
1 Ioh. 2.8. And yet that there be no mistake the next expression is to be added.

III. That the commandments of Christ to his disciples are such, as do
naturally and aptly spring up in the belief of the Gospel, Ioh. 6.28, 29, 40,
47, and 5, 37, 38. Ephesians. 1.19. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13. The Gospel declares Jesus Christ
to be the son of God, and savior of the world, the head, husband, high priest,
Prophet and King of his church, Act, 2. 37. and 8, 37, and 9, 22. Ioh. 4.42.
Ephesians. 5.25. Heb. 5. and 7. Romans 1.3.4. And that he has come in the flesh and
died for our sins, and rose for our justification, and so wrought
reconciliation, and salvation for mankind with God, Romans 4.25. 1 Cor. 15.3.4. 2
Cor. 5.19 1. Tim. 2.4.6. And that he is exalted at Gods right hand, and filled
with grace, power, authority, and Spirit, to offer salvation to men, Act. 5.31,
32. 2 Cor. 5.20. And to work it in such as believe, Ioh. 1.12.16. And to
condemn such as refuse, and rebel against him, Romans 14.9.11. And in this
declaration the Gospel also declares the intence love of God to mankind in
the gift of his son, to be the savior of the world, that whosoever believes
in him might not perish, but have everlasting life, 1 Ioh. 4.14. Ioh. 3.16.17.
The well-pleasednesse God has taken in, and with his son, and that he has
done is, and does, Mat. 3.17, and 17.5. The propitiation he is for the sins of
the world, and the advocation he makes for believers, Ioh. 1.29. 1 Ioh. 2.1.2.
Heb. 9.24. The peculiar love of God to Christ, and to all those that believe in
Christ, Ioh. 5.20. Psalm. 33.13.19. And what Christ is to, and for them, and
what he will work in them, and bestow on them, 1 Cor. 1.30. Ioh. 1.12, 16, and
6, 27. And all this is in the Gospel, and by the ministers thereof, and by the
Spirit set forth as the foundation, and ground of the heavenly call, enviting
to Christ, Isa. 55.1.6. And whosoever is by the Holy Spirit enlightened to
understand, and enabled to believe all this, with his heart, being convinced and
drawn, thereby to Christ, Joh. 3.37, 42, and 6, 44, 45. Pro. 1.23. Isa.
61.1.2.3. The Spirit does farther enter the heart sheading abroad this so great,
and rich love of God therein, so as there does from this grace naturally, and
aptly spring up, in the thus believing heart from this grace believed. A belief
and dependence on Jesus Christ for eternal life, and all that appertains
thereto, Romans 5.1, 5, 6, 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 2.24.25. And also, an unfeyned love of
our brother, 2 Cor. 5.14. 1 Ioh. 4.21. 1 Pet. 1.22. From both which commands
writ in the heart aptly springs up all contained in the particular precepts of
the Gospel, as is before shown, Ioh. 4.13, and 7, 38, 39. And walking in this
faith, and love, in minding the precepts, and veiw of the opportunities, the
motiones, to go according to the mind of Christ will aptly spring up, so as one
may go one serving in newness of Spirit, and not in oldnesse of letter, Pro.
6.20, 21, 22, 23. Ioh. 3.16, 17. Romans 12.2, and 7, 6, 25, and 8, 1, 2. So that
from this whole consideration that the commands of Christ to his disciples, are
such commands as are contained, and expressed in the Gospel, and put with the
Gospel by Christ into the heart of the believer, and do naturally, and aptly
spring up, in the believe of the Gospel, it appears, that believing in Jesus
Christ and loving our brother are the commands of Christ here meant.

Consider III.
The commandments of Ghrist to his disciples, are such as are suitable to the
commendements himself has performed for them, Pro. 3.1.13. Heb. 3.8.9. 1 Cor.
6.20. Now he in fulfilling the commandments he received of the Father for
us, having taken away our sins, and dyed our death, and so purchased us, and
wrought salvation for us; and by his Gospel, and Spirit sent forth having made
known this salvation to us, and in aplying it evidenced himself, to be our
righteousness, and life, and ready, and able eternally to save us. 2 Timothy
1.10. 1 Ioh. 3.5. Heb. 5.9.

Suitable heerto it is; that we abhoring our sins, and denying our selves,
our wisdom, righteousness, strength, with all that is ours, and all fleshly
delights, and considences, to accept of him for all, and so to believe in,
trust too, and depend on him for all grace, righteousness, life, and safety, 1
Cor. 1.30, 31. Phil. 3.3.4.7, 8, 9.10. 1 Pet. 1.13.14. Gall, 1.20. And he
having so loved us, suitable it is, that we should so love one another, 1 Ioh.
3.16. Ephesians. 5.2. So that in this consideration, it also apeares That believing
in Jesus Christ, and loving our Brother, are the commandments of Christ here
meant.

Consider IV.
The commandments of Christ to his disciples, are such commandments as he
has given into their hearts, and cannot, nor are otherwise required to be
kept, then as they are in the heart; whence believers confess, that they have
received the command from him, 1 Ioh. 4.21. And he is said to write them in
their hearts. Heb. 8.10. And the commandment is true in him, and in them. 1
Ioh. 2.8. The law without was engraven in tables of stone, and writ in leaves;
but the Epistle of Christ, is writ by his Spirit in the heart, 2 Cor. 3.3.7. The
law without leaves under sinno, and death, but Christ's law within affords life,
2 Cor. 3.6.7.8, 9, 10. Whence Christ says, he that has my command ments, and
keeps them; he it is that loves me, Ioh. 14.21. In which consideration it
apeareth that faith, and love, (Which all Christ's disciples have, Coll. 1, 4.
and are to keep and walk in, Heb. 3.14.) Are the commandments here meant.

And yet that this may be moore evident, some proofs heerof may be considered.

Proof I.
These two commandments of faith, and love, as they are contained in the
Gospel, and spring from the Gospel believed, so they contain the whole sum
of the pattern, or form of healthful, and sound words, which the Gospel
requires of us, 2 Timothy 1.14. And of all that which the Gospel believed,
springs up in the heart, 1 Ioh. 5.13. Ioh. 20.31. 1 Ioh. 3.1.3. and 4, 19, 21.
Whence the commandment is called, the word of the Gospel it self believed, 1
Ioh. 2, 7. And the Gospel is called the commandment, which in heart believed,
that which is said before of Christ, his keeping his Fathers commandments, is
by believers found true in him, and that which is said in consideration the
second, of faith, and love springing up in the heart, the believers find true in
them, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines, 1 Ioh.
2.8. And so in respect of the Gospel put in the heart, it is called, the old
command, and that which was at first heard, and received from Christ, and which
quickens, and in respect of its Spiritual entrance, receipte, and abiding,
and the faith, and love springing up therefrom, it is called the new
commandment, being always green, and flourishing, so that the believer may
thereby bring out of the good treasury of his heart, things new, and old, Mat.
13.52. Which according to all the considerationes, proves faith, and love to
be the commandments here meant.

Proof. II.
These two commandments of faith, and love are the commendements which God
gives unto, and puts in the heart of his children, Ier. 31.33. Phill. 2.29
Ephesians. 2.8.10. They are the commandments of God the Father when he calls, and
uniteth men to his son Jesus Christ causing them to belief on the name of his
son Jesus Christ, and to love one another as his son has given commandment, 1
Ioh. 3.23, and 4, 21. And they are the commandments expressly given by Jesus
Christ to all his disciples, when he makes known his Father to them, to
believe on him for eternal life, Ioh. 12.36, and 14, 1. And to love one an
other as he has loved us, Ioh. 13.34, and 15, 12. And these are also the very
commandments which the Holy Ghost puts into the hearts of believers, 1 Pet.
1.21.22. 1 Ioh. 3.21.24. So that these two commandments of faith, and love,
are evident to be the commandments here meant.

Proof. III.
All laboring to attain, and fulfill in performance, any or all other
particular preceipts of law, or Gospel, which flows not from, and is not
acted through this believing in the name of Jesus and love of the brethren,
whatsoever endeavors, and services they be, and how, and to what end soever
otherwise done, whether.

To please God, and get boldness with him, or to get therethrough the
righteousness of God, and so Christ and faith in him, and love to brethren, or
to assure themselves by such seize, and observances of a peculiar
interest in Christ, even all whatsoever so done to comfort themselves
therewith, all of it I say, as the scripture shows.

I. It is but a serving of God according to the oldnesse of the letter and so
leaves the doors thereof under sin, and curse and the fear of both, Romans 7.6,
25, and 8, 2, 7. Gall. 3.10. Tit. 1.9.10.15. Ioh. 3.5.6.

II. The doers thereof, do therein, and thereby deprive themselves of, and hold
themselves out from enjoyment of Christ and unfeyned faith in him, and love of
brethren, Romans 9, 32. and 10.3.4.1. Sam. 2, 9. Zach. 4.6. Psalm. 107.11.12.
Ecclez. 15.16. and 16.15.

III. They deceive themselves, and are deceived in all that, which by such
observances, and ataynments they judge themselves by, to be in Christ, and to
have peculiar interest in him, and unfeyned faith, and love; so measuring
themselves by themselves, and trusting to their own hearts for their testimony,
which is folly, 2 Cor. 10.7.12.18. and 11.3.4, 13. Luke 18.11.12. Ier. 17.5,
10. Pro. 28.26.

Whereas; Those that in the belief of the Gospel are emptyed of themselves,
and all relyance on any righteousness, wisdom, or strength of their own, or
that is humane, and through the belief of the grace reported in the Gospel,
brought to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, for being saved by his life, and
through that believing to love the Brethren; shall in abiding in his faith, and
love, and walking therein, find the motiones to all that is contained in
particular precepts, in fit seasons stirring in them, Ioh. 7.37.38. Hose 14.8.
Gall. 5.22.23. Romans 8.2, 14. 2 Cor. 5.14. As is before shown in the second
consideration, and so yiedling up theretoo, and walking therein.

I. They serve God acceptably, and in newness of Spirit, Romans 12; 1, 2, 3, and
7.6.

II. They are ceasing from their own works, and so accepting, and entering into
his rest, Heb. 4, 3, 11. 2 Pet. 1, 5, 11.

III. They yield forth, a justification, and testimony of the truth, and
livelynesse of their faith in Christ, and love of brethren, Iam. 2, to the end.
In which believers are not under the law, but under grace, and so walk after
the Spirit, and keep the ommandements of Christ in Faith, and love, which are
the commandments here meant. Gall. 5.6, 16, 18, 23.

Proof IV.
Walking in this faith, and love put in the heart, is before shown in all the
former considerationes, to lead to the right fulfilling of all righteous
affectiones, and services required both in the law, and the Gospel, so as
whosoever has these commandments in his heart, and keeps, and walks in
them, both receives all good from God, and yields forth all exceptable
service to him and to brethren, Ioh. 14.21.23. Romans 5.1.5, and 12, 1, 3, and
13, 8, 9, 10. So at this also evidenceth these to be the commandments here
meant.

Proof. V.
Those that through belief of the grace reported in the Gospel do believe in
the name of Christ, and in that belief love their brethren and so walk in
this faith, and love, have their faith imputed to them for righteousness, and
their love accepted, as that which shall be visited with more loves, and
through both experiments of grace met with, Romans 4.22, 25, and 5, 1, 5, and 8,
1, 2. 2 Cor. 3, 3.18, Ioh. 14.21.23. And by the testimony of God, and Christ
himself, they do righteousness, and fulfill the law, and al righteousness, 1
Ioh. 2.29, and 3, 7, 9. Romans 13.8, 9, 10.

I. They fulfill the end of the law, in accepting Christ for righteousness,
and loving their brother, Romans 10.3, 4. Mat. 22.39, 40.

II. They obey the Gospel, and word, and doctrine of God, and Jesus Christ our
Lord, Romans 6.17.18. 2 Thessalonians. 1.8.10.

III. They honor obey, and follow God, Ephesians. 5.1.2. Even the Father and the
son, Ioh. 5.23, 37, 46, and 14, 23, and 16, 27. And the Holy Ghost that comes
from the Father, and the son, and witnesses of Christ and teaches, Ioh.
14.26, and 15, 26. 1 Ioh. 5.6, 12. Romans 8.14.

IV. They have eternal life, 1 Ioh. 5.11, 12. Gall. 6.8. And so keep the
commandments that they find them not grievous, but delightful, 1 Ioh. 2.3,
10. So that it every way appears, that faith, and love put in the heart are
the commands meant.

II. For the second thing in this point, what it is to keep his commandments,
it may be answered briefly in two words namely first to keep, or retain them
in the very heart, in the mind, will, and affectiones, Pro. 3.1, and 4.21. And

Secondly, to observe them in the life, in giving up all the members as
servants to walk according thereunto, Pro. 4.25, 26, 27. Romans 12.1, 2. 1 Cor.
6.20. But to give a more full, and ample answer, it might be said the keeping
his commandments. is.

I. To retain, and hold fast, the Gospel, or word of grace, that he has
enlightened our hearts with, and so put in our hearts that he has begotten
faith, and love in our hearts thereby let this word dwell in our hearts, in the
belief, and apprehention of the goodness of the report, and of all the
reproves, requirings, and promises of it, let it be kept in the love desire,
estimate, wherein it was first received, and there through Christ in it, exalt
it, and tie it about thy heart, and bow the neck too it, and this will watch for
us, teach, lead, and counsel, and be a light to us, Rev. 3.3. Coll. 3.16. Pro.
4.8, 9, and 6, 20, 21, 22, 23. Joh. 15, 5.7.

II. To hold fast, and nourish in our hearts, that confidence in Christ for
life, sanctification, preservation, and guidance, and protextion, through all
sufferings, and services of love to the enheritance, Gall. 5; 5, 6. Heb. 3.6,
14, and 10, 35. And that love member like to brethren, and compassionate to the
sons of men, which in putting in his gracious word he by his Spirit
discovering his grace begot in our heart, Heb. 13; 1 Ioh. 3; 18, and 4, 10, 12.

III. To suffer the word of grace, and the faith, and love begot thereby to
have its perfect work in us; to putt no stoppage by carnal reasonnings too
it; but yield up all our members theretoo, and to all the motiones of the
Spirit that spring therefrom, and there-through, and according theretoo, Romans
12.1, 2, 3. Phill. 2.1, 2. Iam. 1, 4. To the denying of all fleshly
affectiones, and lusts, and the obeying all the fruits of the Spirit, Gall.
5.16, 17, 18, 22, 25. 1 Thessalonians. 5.19.

IV. To do all we have to do in all the sufferings, and services of love in
the remembrance of, and according to the word of grace, and in, and with the
exercise of the faith, and love begot thereby, Psalm 1, 2. Heb. 11, and 12. 1,
2. 1 Ioh. 4. to the end. And so as is before amplyfied in opening what it is to
continue in his love, that, and this meeting in one.

V. Seeing it was peculiar to Christ, that in all his walking in this world,
he never sinned, yea if we consider his humane nature, he had no sin if we
consider his life, he did no sin, if we look on the law of nature or works,
under which we were borne, and under which he became for us, he kept, and
fulfilled it all to the full, if we look on those commands, and that work the
Father gave him to do in respect of us, he fully finished it, yea one may say,
if we look on the commands of faith, and love he left for us to walk in,
he also has given us example, and gone before us, and walked without failing
in both and if besides his nature personal conversation, and example, and
besides his propitiation, we look on his ministration of the Gospel, and
care for the continuance thereof after his departure, lo he was perfectly
faithful, and so without sin, and this the scripture sets forth as his
peculiar, he knew no sin, he did no sin, etc. Ioh. 8; 46. Heb. 7; 26. Ioh.
17.4. Isa. 50; and 53. Heb. 2; 13. Ioh, 13; 1. Mat. 4; and 10. Ioh. 17; 2 Cor.
5.21. 1 Pet. 2; 22, 3, 18. And that every one of us, yea the best of all his
servants, while here on earth offend in many things, Iam. 3.2. Having sin
still in nature, Job. 14; 4, and 15, 14. And also in his life, Romans 7; 15. Gall
5; 17. Against the law of works, Romans 3.19, 20. Yea, and the Gospel, and so
even against the law of grace. In strists about the work peculiar to Christ,
seeking in endavours to make peace, and give satisfaction by performances, or
to do in ones own strength, to make up duty, and conscience good, Romans 9; 32,
and 10, 3; and 7; 15; 24; 25. and 8; 7, 8. Gall. 2, and 3.

Or else in short-comming of that which through grace given we might in the
faith, and love mentioned, or walking therein, to the denial of the flesh, and
yielding up to the Spirit in all things, Romans 7; 15, 25. Gall. 5; 17. Yea it
may be in failing in particular service, or ministration, yea so certain it
is, that all of us do in some things offend, that who ever says, either that
he has no sin, or that he has not sinned there is no truth in him, and he
casts the lie on God, Ioh. 1.8; 10. Neither can any regenerate man avoid this
by saying, personally in themselves they have no sin, or of themselves, they do
no sin, but only, as they are one with their brethren, and reckon themselves
after them so they are sinners, and do sin, while any of their brethren have
sin, and are found to sin, for in such a sense even so might Jesus Christ
himself have said, Isa. 53; 2. Cor. 5; 21. 1 Pet. 2; 24. And so may he still be
said to suffer affliction, Act. 9; 4. Coll. 1; 24. Isa. 61; 9. And to want of
his fullness, and perfection, Ephesians. 1; 23, and 4, 13. And yet is this his
peculiar, that he knew no sin, nor did sin, being Holy, harmless, undefiled
separate from sinners, which could not be, if any could be said to be without
sin in this life in such a sense besides himself.

Therefore, there is yet one thing more to be put in, in our keeping his
commandments, namely, that as any sin is yet found, either in our nature, or
life, either against law of works, or law of grace, in failing either in faith,
or love, or walking therein, and yielding to the Spirit there. through
according to grace received.

So we in the acknowledgement of this his grace, do speedily confess our
sins, and seek remission, and healing of him, and so in confidence of his
goodness, and love of brethren. go one still in his way before him, 1 Samuel 12;
20, 22. Pro. 28; 13, 14. 1 Ioh. 1; 7, 9.

And in these five particulars is comprehended the keeping of his commands that
appertains to us.

III. For the third thing in this point the manner of keeping his
commandments, even as he kept his Fathers commandments what this also is.
Viz.

I. That all be done in an one-nesse, and a greement of mind, and will, with
the mind, and will of Christ, and God in Christ and so from the motion of the
Spirit, and law writ in the heart, 1 Cor. 2; 16, 2. Cor. 3; 3, 17, 18.

II. Faithfully, in the midst of his house, and among the sons of men, even a
perverse people, and in the midst of temptationes, from the world, the flesh,
and the devil, Psalm. 101. Phill. 1, 27, 30, and 2, 15, 16, 17.

III. Constantly, at all times, and in all things with patience through all
labors, and sufferings, till the season of entering his rest be fully given,
Act. 14; 22. 2 Timothy 2; 3, and 3, 11, 12. Mat. 10. Which will be but a first
fruits here, Heb. 4; 3, 11. And perfectly at their departure hence, Rev. 14;
13. And gloriously at his coming again, for which they look, and long,
Phill. 3; 20, 21. 2 Cor. 5; 1, 6. 2 Timothy 4; 8. Rev. 22; 17, 20.

IV. Holding, and excercising faith, and love through all these, 2 Cor. 5; 1,
14, 19, etc. For thus it is in all these respects before shown, that Christ
kept his Fathers commandments.

And thus it is shown, what the commandments and the keeping of them with the
manner thereof is: Which may be

Use I.
A discovery of the mistake, or scant conceiptiones of the truth, of such as in
this place by commandments understand noe farther thing, but the precepts of
ten-words, engraven in tables of stone, and delivered by Moses to the people,
to be first kept by Christ by his Fathers command, and to be now kept by
believers by Christ's command, which being a law without us, and enjoinning to
do, and live, will leave us all under sin, and death, it being impossible
for us to have life, and enjoy the righteousness of the law that way, because
we cannot perform the righteousness that apertayneth to us, according to that
law, Romans 3; 10; 20. Gall. 3; 10. Romans 8; 3; 4; Phill. 3; 3; 9. And though it
were perfectly performed by Jesus Christ, yet if there had not been greater
commandments that he received of the Father, and performed for us, our faith
were but vain, and we had been in our sins, and so in danger of wrath
still, Ioh. 10; 18; and 12.31. Heb. 9; 22; 26. 1 Cor. 15; 14; 17, 18; Romans 3,
25. The ignorance whereof causes many to establish a righteousness of their
own by setting upon the law, and so submit not to Christ, who is the end of
the law for righteousness, Romans 10.3; 4; In whom nothing avayleth, but faith
which works by love, Gall. 5; 6; All which may be clearly, and fully seen, in
that which is all-ready said about this buy sinesse.

Use II.
And this also may be an information of the cause of so much darkness, and
so many great, and smarting afflictiones, that many believers in this life do
fall into, namely, because they keep not the commandments, which Christ has
put in their hearts, which are the same the Father by his Spirit, through Christ
has given unto them, which had they attended too, their peace had been as a
river, and their righteousness as the waves of the Sea, Psalm. 89; 30; 31; 32.
Isa. 48; 18.

So that the cause of such smarting afflictiones on them, is not because they
were unable to keep the law of works, or came short thereof, through a
necessity by that weakness, Psalm. 103; 10; and 143; 2; Nor yet because they
were unable to walk suitable, and answerable to the Gospel, or law of grace,
or fell short thereof, through a necessity by that weakness, Psalm. 130; 3, 4.
For God requires in this no more then he has sown, Luke 19.21.22. But in,
and according to the Gospel, accepts of believers the will for the deed, and
requires noe more, but according to what they have, and accepts that even so
of them, Mat. 10.40; 42; 2 Cor. 8; 11; 12. But the cause of such affliction is

I. Because they have not abiden, and walked in faith, and love, So as by the
grace made known, and received, they in remembering his gracious word, and
exercising faith, and love, and yerlding to the Spirit therein, in denying
fleshly affectiones, and lusts, and soweing to the fruits and motiones of the
Spirit might have done, Psalm. 78; 5, 11, 41, 42, and 81, 6, 12, and 106, 12,
15. Gall. 5; and 6, 8.

II. And because moreover, when through forgetfulness, and temptationes they
are found so to have sinned, and turned aside, they do not speedily own the
same, and in acknowledgement of the grace of Christ, and their own
ill-requiteals, turn to him, confessing their sins, and judging themselves,
and seeking remission, and healing from God through Christ, and so not judging
themselves, they are even therefore judged of the Lord in this world, that they
may not be condemned with the world, 1 Ioh. 1; 7, 9, and 2, 1. Ier. 6; 15. 2
Cor. 12; 20, 21. 1 Cor. 11; 31, 32. And these two causes, meeting in one are
the very cause of all smarting correctiones, which are not usually laid on any,
til both these meet, unless in the first, there be will fullness, and
presumption, and then it contains both in one, as in David's case, 2 Samuel 12.
Psalm. 19; 12, 13, and 32, 3, 4, and 33. And yet on hearty confession, and
turning, much release then also, and yet in all this I limmit not the Holy one,
but show what he has declared to be his usual way, as for Jobs trial, it
was an unusual thing, and so such a probation, as God never excerciseth his
with, but when he minds to give a double blessing in the issue, see Job first
and last, all which agree well with the promise here, and all that is said
before as the ground of this.

Use. III.
And this also may be a hint of helpfulnesse for discerning, and differenting
the motiones of the Spirit of bondage, from the motiones of the Spirit of
grace, and adoption.

I. The Spirit of bondage has its law, and force in, and from the law of
works, and so affords no hope, but according to a man's conformity too; and
observance of the law of works, under which a man was first borne, and so
dictates to a man, and moves with, this I ought, and that I ought to do,
according to that law, and leaves a man to his own understanding and strength,
to strive after it, without any inward living principle from any devine power,
springing up the motion, and free, and living motion, streaming, with
inclination thereto, but only a humane motion, leaving, in all that is done, to
the trial, censure, and accusation of the law, Romans 2; 14, 15, and 3, 20, and
7, 1, 6, 23, 24, 25, and 8, 1, 2, 15. Gall. 3.10, and 5, 18.

II. The Spirit of grace, and adoption, has the Gospel, or royal law of grace,
and liberty for its law, where-through it excerciseth its force, Gall. 4.21,
31. Iam. 1; 25. Romans 8; 2, 15. And so though the believers looking about them
may say, this we ought, and that we ought to belief, and do according to the
Gospel, 1 Ioh. 4; 10, 11. Yet the Spirit of grace dictates, and moves, with a
certain devine power in the new man, and so springs up the motion from a
living principle with in through the belief of the grace in Christ, and the
love of Christ and brethren, streaming with a living; and stirring motion, and
inclination to that is good, and well-pleasing in the sight of God, Ephesians. 4; 21,
24. Coll. 3; 10, 12. Gall. 2; 20. 2 Cor. 5; 6, 11, 14, 20. Romans 12; 1, 2. So
preserving, and guiding the believer, that it leaves him not under law, Gall.
5; 16, 18, 22. As may be scene in all that is so largely said about this
business before.

Use. IV.
And this may also be an instruction, how to keep the commandments of Jesus
Christ namely, to tie them about the heart, and the neck, to delight in, and
observe them, by remembrance, and keeping in heart the word of grace believed,
and received, and by holding fast confidence in Christ, and continuing in
brotherly love, and walking in faith, and love and doing al there-through, and
yielding up theretoo, in one mindedness with Christ from the law within
constantly, and acknowledging all failings found with confession, and seeking
remission, and healing, and so giving up all the powers to walk with God, as is
more fully opened before twice in this discourse, Pro. 6; 20. Coll. 3; 16. Heb.
10; 35, and 13. 1 Coll. 2; 6. Phill. 2; 1, 2, 3, 6. Romans 12. to the end.

Use. V.
And this may be an exhortation, and motive, to stir us up to give up our
selves, as those that are alive to God, with all readiness, diligence, and
resolutenesse, through the belief of the grace of Christ, to keep these his
commandments always, seeing as has been shown, and the words bear forth.

I. It is the mind, and will of Christ that has so loved us, and performed
such commandments for us, in which he has bought us, and is become ours, and
we his, 1 Cor. 6.20. Gall. 2.20.

II. He has gone before us, and calls us after him, and given us to know
his voice, and is present with us by his word, and Spirit, Joh. 10; 3, 4. Mat.
28, 20.

III. He has opened this pathe, and given us these commandments for our own
benefit, that we may abide in his love, and have our joy full, Pro. 9; 12.
Ioh. 16.11.

IV. His commandments are not grievous, but joyous, and all the paths thereof
are paths of pleasantness, and peace, and life to such as find them, 1 Ioh.
5.3. Pro. 3.16, 17, and 4, 20.22.

I. The law, being a law of liberty, and grace, and of the Spirit of life
seated in the heart, and so teaching, and leading the believer with peace and
freedom, 2 Cor. 3; 3, 17. Romans 8.2.

II. The walking being, in an exercise of faith that receives, and drinks in
all good from God, and an exercise of love, that is strong, opperative and
delightful, Ioh. 7; 37, 38, 39. Cant. 8.6, 7, 8.

Well may they be said to be ways of pleasantness, and peace, and an highway
and a way of Holiness, which though no unclean person, nor unbeliever can
pass over, yet it is for these way farring ones believers, and they though
fools shall not err therein, Isa. 35, 8. Oh who would not gladly walk in it.

V. The gracious promise of so great happiness heertoo, might be added but
that is a thing that comes next to be opened by it self, Psalm. 19; 10, 11.
Secondly for the next point in this last branch, and so the last thing to be
viewed in this affirmation of our savior, it is his comfortable promise to his
disciples, that so keeping his commandments, they shall abide in his love,
etc. A gracious, comfortable, and large promise, which that we may the better
understand it there are four things to be heeded about it.

I. What that is to which the promise is made to believers.

II. On what, or whom the performance of the promise depends.

III. Who, and what a one he is that has so promised.

IV. What the promise it self is, and what it contains.

I. For the first: that to, and according to which the promise is made is the
keeping of Christ his commandments in truth, and uprightness, according to
the grace given, and which we have received of him, for so are his words, If
yea keep my commandments, yea shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my
Fathers commandments, and abide in his love, These words even as appear to
point out the assurance, and the example and the similitude, to which our
keeping must be comformed, but not tying our keeping to that degree of
perfection that was in his keeping there is a perfection of truth, and parts,
which as it was in his keeping, so it is required in ours, and that is set
down before, and this is the similitude, and likeness pointed out in the
words. Even as

But as for persection of degree, that was peculiar to him, and his keeping the
commandments, as is a little before shown, and this not so imposed here.

Besides: He has appointed means for those to whom this promise is made;
both to grow one to more fruitfulness, and toward perfection, Ioh. 15; 1, 8.
And helps, to get recovery in failings, to rise again, and proceed to the
enjoyment of this promise, which he would not have done, if the promise had
been only to perfection of degree in the keeping of his commandments, 1 Ioh.
1; 3, 4, 7, 9, and 2, 1, 2.

More-over, he spakes not this to fear them, or put them to a maze as it would
have been, if he had tied his promise to the perfection of degree in the
keeping his commands, but he expressly says, he spoke this that his joy might
be in them, and that their joy might be full. Ioh. 15.11. And else where it is
said, if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to what a man
has, and this both in the endeavors, and fruits, 2 Cor. 9; 12. Mat. 10; 40,
41, 42.

So that it is the truth, and manner of keeping according to grace received,
too, and according to which the promise is made, so that the weakest believer
so giving himself to walk in faith, and love as a foresaid, may have this
consolation, and look for this promise, Gall. 5.5.

II. For the second, upon whom the performance of this consolation, and promise
depends, and that is on himself, and the faithfulness, and power of him that
has promised, yea shall abide in my love, 1 Thessalonians. 5.24. Who has engaged
himself to preserve them, and work all their works for them, and give life to
them, Ioh. 6; 40, and 14, 19. Isa. 26.12. Psalm. 138.8. So as they may depend on
him, both to enable them to keep his commandments, and also to make good this
promise to them, and be disappointed in neither, 1 Pet. 2.6. And this is very
comfortable to the weakost believers, walking in faith, and love.

III. For the third thing, who, and what a one he is, that has so promised,
that is Jesus Christ the Son of God, Chap. 14.9. and 15, 1. I have loved you,
and yea shall abide in my love; This is he, who is the mighty God, and the
truth it self; that is one in the Father, and the Father in him, who so loved
us, that he came down from Heaven, and took our nature, and bare our sins, and
curse, and offered himself in sacrifice to God to work redemption, and
salvation for us, Tit. 2.13, 14. Ioh. 14; 6, 10. 1 Pet. 2.24. and 3; 18. 1 Timothy
2.6. And ascended to heaven, and received Spirit to apeare in Heaven for us,
and sent forth Spirit to us to work salvation in us, Heb. 9; 24. Psalm. 68.18,
21. Ephesians. 4; 7, 16. Unto whom the Father has given all power, and authority,
Heb. 8; 1. Who is full of love to us, and faithfulness for us, Heb. 3.1.6. So
as we may sasely depend on him for this promise.

IV. For the fourth thing; What the promise it self is, and what it contains;
the promise it self is, Yea shall abide in my love; if yea keep my
commandments, yea shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fathers
commands, and abide in his love. So that the causing us to abide in his love,
is the promise: And it contaynes three things clearly.

I. The having us in his peculiar love, not only to love us, but to love us
with peculiar, and choice love, surely, forbearing to smite us, and to cease
from all his wrath toward such unworthy ones, as we were, Great favor, and
our demeanor well considerd; reason might say, as much as were meet for us to
ask of him, Psalm. 85, 3, 4, 5. But to show forth his compassionate love in the
redemption wrought for mankind, and there-through to bring in to receive
romission of sins, what abundant grace and favor is this, Act. 10.43. Romans
3.25. Tit. 3; 4, 5. But to love us with such peculiar, and delightful love, as
the Father loves him, this is more abundant, but to have us so in that choice
love of his, as to compass us with it, that we should be in his bosom, and as
the seal in his heart, in all his choice, delight, will, and purposes, and as
the seal on his arm, in all his choice workings, and all for good to us; Oh
what heart can desire more, or be able to desire so much, Can. 8.6, 7, 9. It
exeedes the desires of the heart; And yet is this contained in this promise.

II. The abiding in this love, surely one days enjoyment of this love were
better then a thousand days enjoyment of all the loves, and contentments this
world can afford, yea the deprivation of all these loves and contents a
thousand days might befully satisfied for with one days enjoyment of this his
peculiar love, Psalm. 84; 6, 10. Yea surely a sight, and taste heerof will take,
and ravish with sweetness the soul that sees, and tastes this peculiar
love, 2 Samuel 7.18, 19, 20. Cant. 1; 2, 3. But to dwell, and abide, and have
ones habitation in it, who can express it, Psalm. 91; 1, 2, etc. Or be able
with the eye of his heart unless much streng-thened by the Holy Ghost to veiw
it, yea even then also it will be veiwed incomprehensible, Ephesians. 1; 17, 20, and
3, 14, 19.

And yet is this the love contained in this promise.

III. The flowing and increasing of this love upon us, and the increasing of
strength in us to veiw, and enjoy it more, and more, till we come to the
harvest and fullness of it, Psalm. 84; 7, 11, 12. If the first fruits be so
sweere, what is the harvest, if a glimpse overcame Peter, that it made him
forget, wife children, friends, and all earthy contents, and himself, for all
other loves, and farther favors, that he would have chosen to have dwelt in
that, Mat. 17; 3, 4. If a taste so sweet and satisfying; Oh what is it then to
be often visited with it, and the manifestationes of it, and to be clothed, and
filled with it to cate, and drink it, and to feed, and be feed, and feasted
with it yea glorified in, and with it for ever, Ioh. 14; 21, 23. 1 Ioh. 3; 2.
And yet all this is contained in this promise, Yea shall abide in my love, as I
abide in my Fathers love; And so my Father loves you, as he loves me, and I
love, as my Father loves me, my delight, and joy in you, and your joy full.

Oh how comfortable, sweet, large, and sure is this promise, and how
graciously ordered for our consolation, if it had been made to the perfection
of degree, in our keeping of his commandments, we might have feared our never
enjoyment, but being to the truth, and manner of keeping, for which grace is
already given us, and he will never be wanting, it is exceeding comfortable for
us.

If the performance of this promise had depended on our strength, and
faithfulness, we might have been in continual doubt of failing, and missing
it, but he having provided help for our weakness, and put the performance upon
his own power, truth, and faithfulness, there is no cause of doubt in him.

If according to his work in old time, he had only sent this promise to us by
some of his servants, it ought to have been believed, but yet in some
temptation, we might happily have doubted, and said in have al men are liars,
but coming forth of his own mouth, who can doubt the truth of it, if it had
been but of his general, and compassionate love, we might have feared want of
fullness, or our dropping out of it, but being of his peculiar love, and such,
and so everlasting love, what more safe, or what can be more desired, the
promise is theresore very precious, and comfortable.

Use.
And this may be a double exortation, and motive to us all that believe in
Christ.

I. To behold with what manner of love God, and Christ has loved us, Oh how
free is his love, there being nothing in us, nor in those of whom we came,
nothing done by us, or to be expected that we could after do to him, but for
his own sake, and in his own good pleasure he so freely loved us, Deuteronomy. 9,
4, 5. Oh how costly to him is this love, he paid the price for us, and bought
us with his precious blood, Gall. 2; 20. Oh how admirable, and unparallelled is
this love; he did this for us when we were his enemies, Romans 5; 8, 10. Oh how
strong, and unfayling, he overcame us when we were rebels to him, Tit. 3-3,
4. Oh how honorable, fatherly, brotherly, to make us sons of God, and brethren
to Christ, and estate us in all his own things, yea how abundant, and glorious,
and everlasting, having assured us of more then we are able to understand, but
only thus far, that when he appears, we shall see him as he is, and he
like him, yea how comfortable, that he now makes this known to us, and assures
our abiding in it, to the harvest, and then to be glorified in it, 1 Ioh. 3.1,
2. Oh let us consider, attend too, admire this his so great love to us, and
listen, and yield to his discoveryes, when called; that we may assend to the
Heavens in our Spirits, and there delight our selves in his loves, and being
refreshed therewith, Cant. 4.6.8. Coll. 3.1.2. Let our affectiones be set
thereon, as our riches, and treasure, and from thence again, let us reflect on
his promise, and see how his love is testified for those that trust in him, and
love him, and their brethren, and that walk in that faith, and love, Psalm.
125. Pro. 8.17, 21. 1 Ioh. 4.7.10. Till our hearts be overcome therewith, and
we constraynod to say: Oh how great is thy goodness which thou have laid up
for them that fear thee; which thou have for them that trust in thee before
the sons of men, Psalm. 31; 19.20. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has
entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that
love him; but God has revealed them to us by his Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. And
behold how good, and how pleasant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together
in unity, Psalm. 133. That so we may even long for his coming again, in which
all shall be fully enjoyed by us.

II. To love his commandments, and be dilligent in keeping of them, surely
this his gracious promise of so abundant love, and as we keep his commands
(which are not grievous) of abiding therein, it may being believed be to us,
as a cord from Heaven drawing us, and an encouragement in our heart, stirring us
to love of his commandments, and diligence in keeping them, the promise to
the keeping of them, being in general, so great, and precious, as has been
shown; that it may be truly said, in keeping of them there is great reward,
Psalm. 19.10, 11. And if we veiw the particulars, the same will apeare.

I. The keeping of the word of grace put in the heart, and believed through
which these commands of faith in Christ, and love of brethren were begotten,
and whence they spring, being through the ministration of the Gospel, and the
inspiration of the almighty written in the heart; this word remembered, loved,
and delighted in, and so tied to the heart, and submitted too, and so tied about
the neck, great the promise theretoo. For is it not said of this word, it shall
lead us when we go, (it shall show us our way, and give us strength to guide
us) and when slumbering befalls us, that we sleep, or are eased of cares in
casting our cares on God, about our own safety; It shall watch for us, and
keep us, and shall be a light to us, and instruction in the way of life to
keep us from evil, Pro. 6.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. That it is able to save our
souls (from falling through ignorance, unbelief, pride, vain glory,
covetousness, uncleanness, and from the evil of the temptationes of the
flesh, devil, or world, and we shall be blessed in our deed, 1 Cor. 15; 1, 2,
3, 4. Iam. 1.21, 23. That it is a fruithfull, and teaching love, stirring up to
fruitfulness, even a word of eternal life, Coll. 3.16. Psalm. 1.2, 3. Ioh. 6;
68, and 15, 7. That it will promote us, and bring us to honor, give to our
head an ornament of grace, and deliver to us a crown of glory, Pro. 4.8.9.
Such is the love found in the word of grace inbraced.

II. The faith in him, that is when through belief of the propitiation made by
the blood of Christ, and the salvation he has wrought in his own body for
men, and the great love of God therein manifested, the heart is brought to
esteem basely of it self, and highly of him, and in belief of this grace
effected by him, is brought to belief on him, and so on God in him for that
eternal life, and all that belongs theretoo, which is in him to give, and
work, this being the faith heere-ment that is the first commandment, Romans
3.24.25.26. and 4.5.22.25. and 5.1.8.10.11.

To which faith, or to them so believing the promises theretoo are very great,
as the receite of the remission of all a man's sins, Act. 10.43. Access to the
throne of grace, justification, and hearing, and answer of all prayers so put
forth, Act. 13.3.6. Romans 5.1.2. Mat. 21.22. fruitfulness, and living springs
of Spirit, yea such though dead shall live, and living shall never dye, but
shall have victory over lusts, support, and victory in afflictions, and
temptations, in a word they shall never be ashamed of their hope, but have
eternal life, Ioh. 7.37.38.39. and 11.25. and 14. and 15. etc.

III. The love to brethren that flows from his love believed, which is the
second command, Ioh. 13.34. and 15.12. Has also great promises to it, as that
all such love with the fruits thereof, shall be accepted as to himself, and
shall be rewarded even to the least fruit thereof, Mat. 10.40.41.42. And that
God dwells with such, and they in him, and are his friends, 1 Ioh. 4.12.16.
Ioh. 15.14. And shall abide in the light, and be watered, and blessed, and
filled with love from God, and Brethren, 1 Ioh. 2.11. Isa. 32.8.

IV. Walking in faith, and love begot in the heart through the word of grace and
issuing therefrom, has great promises also, of increase of light, and
strength, and much fruitfulness every way before God, Pro. 8.12.18. and 10.29.
1 Cor. 13, to the end.

V. Yea even all the fruits of faith, and love in every particular service
thereof have promise of acceptance, and blessing, and answer of prayers, Heb.
6.10. Gall. 6.8. 1 Ioh. 3.22.23.24.

And all comprehended, and summed up in this, if yea keep my commandments, yea
shall abide in my love.

So that if the love of God, and Christ, toward us be of any force with us,
and desired of us. let it be a load stone to us, and have its perfect work with
us, to give up all our members to God, in keeping these commandments of
Christ, Romans 12.1.2.3. Phill. 2.1.2.3.4.5.6. And to prize the same above gold,
and silver, and all earthly enheritances, Psalm. 119.72.111. And count it as our
meat, and drink to be exercised in the services thereof, Job. 23.12. Ioh.
4.34. And to be diligent, and unwearied therein, through what trials soever we
pass for the same, Gall. 6.10. That so we may take up our content in his
love, and in keeping his commandments abide in his love, and so his joy
remain in us, and our joy be fully sound and increase til it come to fullness
in the harvest in his visible presence which is the end, and scope of these
sayings of our saviors in, Ioh. 15.9.10. As the Father has loved me, so have
I loved you, continue yea in my love: If yea keep my commandments, yea shall
abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers ecommandements, and abide in
his love.

From which words together in one considered, we may observe, as a broviary of
all that has been said, these few lessons therein.

Obs. I.
That the choice happiness here to be desired, and obtained, and which has
all satisfying fullness in it to satisfy Spiritual desires, and that will also
bear through al troubles, and bring to everlasting blessedness, is to be
beloved of the Father, as he loves Christ, and to be beloved of Christ as the
Father loves him, and this appears here plainly by Christ his promising of
it, as the choice happiness to his disciples, and his prayer for them, Ioh.
17.21. And promise to them, Ioh. 14.17.21.23. And the prayer of his people for
it, Psalm. 106.4. Cant. 2.4.5. And their profession of it, Cant. 1.2.3. Psalm.
30.5.

Obs. II.
That this peculiar love belongs too, and is to be expected believed, and
waited for of the weakest, that through grace believe in Jesus Christ, and love
their brethren, and this is evident by our saviors affirmation of it, to his
weak disciples, and willing them to continue in it: and the enjoyment of this
peculiar love, with promise of establishment in it, and fullness in due season,
is the portion of all that walk in faith, and love, and this is evident in our
saviors saying, if yea keep my commandments, yea shall abide in my love, etc.

Obs. III.
That it is good, and well-pleasing in the sight of God, and Christ, that all
that believe in him, do continue, and abide in this his peculiar love and this
is evident both by his charge, continue you in my love and his promise, and
direction, if yea keep my commandments, yea shall abide in my love, etc.

IV. Obs.
IV. That the mean, or way for believers to continue, and abide in this his
peculiar love, is to keep his commandments, as he kept his Fathers
commandments, though wanting in such perfection of degree in keeping yet in
like manner, and this is evident in the direction, and promise in express
words.

V. Obs.
V. That all believers so keeping the commandments of Jesus Christ, shall
infallibly continue and abide in this his peculiar love.

And some ground, or reason of these things may be seen in the words also.

I. Reas.
I. Our Savior affirming such love to them, calling them to continue in it,
directing them how, and giving the promise to them shows his will, and gives
ground, and reason to confirm all to them.

II. Reas.
II. Our Savior keeping his Fathers commandments, and thereby first redeeming
us, and then giving us life, shows both, the Fathers love to us, in giving
him such commandments, and Christ his love to us in fulfilling those commands,
and giving such sweet commandments to us also, in which himself has gone
before us, does give us ground, encouragement, and motive, both for believing
in him, and loving one another, and for walking in this faith, and love.

III. Reas.
III. His manifesting our being reckoned of God after him, and his loving us,
as God loves him, and that as he in keeping his Fathers commands (to procure
us life) abode in his Fathers love, so we keeping his commands in receite, and
exercise of the life given us) shall abide in his love; all this is that very
thing we are to believe, which will endeed consolato, and set us on walking.

IV. Reas.
IV. This keeping his commandments, is an exercising our selves in his love,
and suffering it to have its perfect work in us, and so is the very leading
in, and way of continuing, and abiding in his love.

All which as it is seen in the words, so it is very useful as is foreshewn.

I. Use.
I. It shows just cause of reproof of, and grief, and lamentation for many.

I. Such a mistake the mark, either in their conceiptiones, or pursuit of
happiness, seeking it in favor, liberty, riches, and honors amongst men
feeding on ashes.

II. Such as profess to seek God, and yet either ignorant of, or not pressing
after this choice happiness, but striving for life in their own righteousness,
or spending their choice strength to know that Christ dyed for them, leaving
this peculiar love unsought, only to be challenged in a blind conclusion, and
consequence.

III. Such as having begun to see, and taste this peculiar love, either again
through folly withdraw, or complain for want of other loves.

II. Use.
II. It is a good admonition to us all, neither to seek other loves then this
of God, and Christ, nor to rest in his love of compassion, without the
knowledge, and enjoyment of this peculiar love, but seek this above all things.

III. Use.
III. It is a good motive to all that have seen, and tasted this peculiar love
in believing, To continue, and abide ever in it.

IV. Use.
IV. An exortation to keep the commandments of faith, and love, and to walk
constantly therein, as is before shown.

I. Motive.
I. None but such love Christ Jesus sinceerly. Ioh. 14.21.

II. Motive.
II. Nene but such have assmance of abiding in his peculiar love.

III. Motive.
III. All such shall assuredly continue in this his peculiar love.

V. Use.
V. This is a consolation, and encouragement for all that believe in Jesus
Christ: and walk in faith, and love to go one without fainting, in hope, and
diligence, till they come to the end of their hope in the fruition of glorious
love.
