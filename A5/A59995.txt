VIA AD Latinam Linguam Complanata. The Way made plain to the Latin Tongue.
The Rules composed in English and Latin VERSE: For the greater Delight and
Benefit of LEARNERS.

By James Shirley.

Avia Pieridum peragro loca.
Lucret. London, Printed by R. W. for John Stephenson, at the sign of the Sun
on Ludgate Hill. 1649.

TO THE Most hopeful pledge of Honor, William Herbert, Son to the Right
Honorable Philip Lord Herbert.
SIR,
AT this time, the Press does almost groan with the burden of new Grammars, by
which, some would prophetically imply the decay of Learning, as if the Root and
Foundation of Art stood in need of warmth, and reparation: If I were guilty of
his belief, I am not so old in practice, ^o forget how much unworthy I am, ^o
apply to such public necessity. It shall be happiness enough to me, if while
your years are fit for principles of this nature, this Book be not thought
unworthy of your shade and protection.

I dare not be so bold to prescribe it to your particular use, others having
more worthily the honor to be employed in your Education; but if with their
judgment, it may be admitted to your reading, I am very confident, it will much
facilitate your progress, and make the way short and pleasant, if you walk by
Rules to the Latin tongue.

It remains, that I wish you may grow up the great example of true Nobility:
You cannot but raise our expectation, while you are remembered, the Son of your
most nobly accomplished Father, descended from your yet flourishing
Grandfather whose name is worthily affixed a Patron to more generous wit, then
our Nation must hope to see again in all future Ages.

Nor can the glory of your great Uncle, William Earl of Pembroke (the ornament
of the Court and Kingdom) and the ever celebrated name of Sydney, whose blood
is warm in your veins, be out of your eye and imitation: Their fames I look
upon as an immortal treasury, left by them, who had merited for more then
themselves, and might from their supernumerary virtues, spare enough to indulge
posterity.

But let their Characters be the Argument of a more able Pen, I return to my
first ambition, that these Papers dedicate to your name, may ow their first
light, and life to the influence of your morning, so the world shall read to
the happy presage of your great name, that you disdained not to begin to learn,
and to be a Mecenas together; while I (encouraged by your virtue, ^o lay this
first public sacrifice upon your virgin Altar) am but the more engaged to
profess my self,

Sir, The most humble and faithful honorer of your Family, James Shirley.

Authori Amicissimo.
FOelix nefasti gloria saeculi!
Tu qui severo (quas sibi dempserit)
Musas redonaturus aevo,
Ausonios reseras penates:
Annosa linguae jura Quiritium
Non indecoro carmine vestiens,
(Spretae rudimentum Minervae)
Allicis, and reparas juventam;
Immense vates! Cui sacra tempora
Circum tenaci nexae hedera, tuae
Laurus adumbrabunt; Coronas
Grammaticam simul and Poesin.
Tho. Stanley.
To my worthy and ingenious Friend The Author.
GRammar which taught the Poet first to write,
Is by the Poet now taught to delight.
And Poesy, which once unto the School
Owed its Instructions, now to that is a Rule.
Thy grateful Pen, to Science does impart
Civility, and requites Art, with Art.
Yet not like some (who think they hardly should
Be thought to understand, if understood.)
Do thou the minds of weaker Tiroes vex,
Or as perplexed with the Art, the Art perplex,
But what ere seemed therein obscure, make clear,
Brief, what prolix, smooth, what did rough appear.
That so the Art to Learners now is seen
As in a flat, which Hills and Woods did skreen.
How should they err! Their journeys end in view,
Their way so pleasing, and their guide so true!
Rest then secure of Fame; nor think thy worth
Can by a private hand be well set forth.
Attempts which to the Public, Profit raise,
Expect, nor merit less, then Public Praise.
Idem in idem, ad eundem.
SHirleie! Angliacum cui olim, celeberrime vatum,
Drama labor, nomenque fuit: Tibi nunc, novus ecquis
Surgit honas? Qualisive alio subit infula nexu

Carmine facundo tractas Praecepta severae

Afficeres animos, and dura Elementa, nolenti,
Eloquio, nimiumque rudi placitura juventae

Laud nova florens: Dulci nunc munere fandi
Provocet and Musas. Decus hoc Shirleie dedist.
Edw. Sherburne.
To my ingenious Friend The Author, upon his Poetical Grammar.
GRammar, the Scholars labyrinth, Sir, by you
Is now unmaz'd, and opened by your clew,
Those cloudy parts of Speech, which long have worn
Nights dress, shine now bright as the Orient morn,
And courtly move, the lame sick Heteroclyte,
Peevish by their Infirmity, now slight
The Caps and Crutches, and to measures fall,
And you at once have cured an Hospital.
Welcome fair issue of your happy brain;
Now Phoebus rules in his own grove again;
For best examples from the Laurel sprung,
And Poets first adorned each learned tongue,
Where Lilly once was ror'd, the beardless throng
Shall chant thee forth, like Ayrs thou shall be sung.
And where youth learn these clear composed rules,
T'shall not be Grammar called, but Music Schools.
Ed. Salt marsh.
To my worthy Friend the Author.
ALthough with Justice I admired thy Pen,
That did before adorn the English Scene;
I easily can forget, and when I look
On this last act, neglect each other Book.
Thy Buskind, and thy Comic muse may be
Preserved as Monuments of Wit, and thee,
And in another temperate age be shown
To prove our Language had perfection;
But here is a design, who does not see
In this a plot to take posterity?
A plot beyond thy Plays thou do pursue,
And by an Artifice, a silken clew
Of Poesy, do lead, and may betray
Our children into Learning, as they play.
But prosper, I forgive thee, and presage
(If ignorance have not quite drowned our Age.)
Thy Book an entertainment with good men,
And from this root, old Art grow up again.
Geo. Blakeston.
To the worthily Honored Mr. James Shirley.
IF those things always their own use invite,
That yield us profit, and secure delight,
What shall we ow this last work of your Pen?
Which more, then when you steered the souls of men,
With your harmonious Scenes, and graceful dress
Does now a power above that Art express.
For while you seem to stoop, you gently raise
Children into ability to praise,
And make them men, who by your skilful hand
Taught, do both nimbly move, and learn to stand.
Most other Grammars to our youth impart
A Costique, dry, and nugatory Art,
Which they go to, as coldly, as young men
Make love to one of fourscore years and ten.
'Twas a prodigious Music, that did call
Huge stones to build themselves a Theban wall,
We may believe that miracle, who see
You have filled Rocks into a Gallery,
And all those rugged Cliffs, that threatened youth
In their approach, are by your Verse made smooth.
And Grammar portrayed with a smiling face,
Is now no more a fury, but a grace.
Fra. Langton.
To Mr. James Shirley, upon his English and Latin Grammar.
SIr, I have read your Grammar, and do see
Your learning now has kissed your Poesy.
I find a double charm in Syntax, when
You do by this teach Youth, by the other men.
Not that I slight grave Lillies Lyturgy,
Nor love your Work, for change or novelty,
But for the worth I see in it, it is your glory
That now the Schools have found a Directory.
But this will spoil our Hebrew Lectures quite,
Of rigid Masters, which still backward write.
When tears and blood come forth to let in names,
As if the Grammar were all Anagrams.
While the vimineous Bajazets stand by,
Teaching harsh Latin by Phlebotomy.
But you have plan'd the way, and strewn it so,
Children may run in this, as soon as go.
We shall have swaddling Scholars, Infants may
Now shake their Grammar with their Coats away.
Go on brave Petrarch, thy sweet Rules advance,
Leave the world no excuse for ignorance.
What elder days to Lilly rendered, we,
And future times shall attribute to thee;
And to thy memory, fame shall this enroul,
Who ere the Church, thou do reform the School.
Alex. Broom.
To my much honored and learned Friend, Mr. James Shirley, the Author.
IT may hold some proportion, that an Age
Has temper, or degenerates to rage,
As the first rules incline; and may not we
Unto our Iron Rudiments apply
The times condition, and believe we have,
But those impressions a rough Grammar gave?
Ill woven, rugged principles, scarce one
A friend to nature, or digestion;
Verse more uneven then wild Mountains are,
Which makes our traveling Infantry despair,
For only here and there a Boy, that can
Eat stones like the Italian, proves a man.
[*]
But from our dark and frighted Hemisphere,
An unexpected Star begins to appear.
The rudiments are changed, a moddest ray,
Dressed in the blushes of a new born day
Shines with a train of light: This Grammar writ
Up to the truth of Harmony, and Wit,
With its soft numerous enchantment, can
Make every Giant shrink into a man.
Or if incapable of softness, they
Despise to be reformed, their children may,
Drinking these streams, in the next age be found,
Their Hearts with Love, their Heads with Olive crowned.
John Ogilby.
THE RVDIMENTS.

EIght Parts, two Numbers, Cases six, to these
Three Genders, five Declensions, three Degrees.
Pronounes nineteen, four kind of Verbs, and they
Three Persons through both numbers do convey.
Four Conjugations perfect Verbs receive,
On which four Moods attend, and Tenses five.
From race of Verbs, four Participles flow,
Three Gerunds we admit, and Supines two.
These things well laid, three Concords raise at last,
A structure, and the toil of Grammars past.

The way made plain to the LATIN TONGUE.
Grammar is the Art of right speaking.
The Parts are two, Etymology, and Syntax.


Etymology is that part of Grammar, which teatheth the proprieties of several
words, especially in the difference of Terminations, and considers all parts
of speech.

Eight parts of speech.
EIght only Parts the wise Grammarians teach, To all these parts belong
Species, which is Form, and Figura, Figure. Form is when a word is original,
and called Primitive, as Scio to know; or come from another, and called
Derivative, as Scientia knowledge, derived from Scio. Figure is, when a word is
simple, as just us just, or compounded, as injust us unjust compounded of in
and just us.

Because in them we comprehend all speech.
Noun, declined. Pronoun, declined. Verb, declined. Participle, declined.
Adverb, undeclined. Conjunction, undeclined. Preposition, undeclined.
Interjection, undeclined.


Nouns are Substantive, or Adjective.
NOun Substantives the names of Things declare:
[a] and [the] are signs of nouns Substantives. Nouns Proper are all proper
names, and are referred to one, as Thamisis the Thames. Common nouns are common
to all of the same kind, as Fluvius a River.
But Adjectives, what kind of things they are.
A House, Domus; an ancient House, antiqua Domus; a Church, Ecclesia; the holy
Church, sancta Ecclesia.

Numbers, two.
Some nouns in the singular may signify many, as Populus People. Grex A Flock.
These are called Collectives, and yet these are the sing. number, as being
considered One People, One Flock.
ONe is the number Singular, but all
Above, we must the Plural number call.
A man, Homo; men, Homines.

Nominative. Genitive. Dative. Accusative. Vocative. Ablative.
Cases, six.
THe Nominative before the Verb does go,
[Of] shows the Genitive, the Dative, [to.]
The Accusative after the Verb is placed;
The fifth calls, Prepositions rule the last.
Gender is the difference of sex by nature: but by institution and Art, words
may be of the male, or female genesis and yet have no relation to sex.
Genders, three.
Male, Female, Neuter, perfect Genders be,
All others are compounded of these three.
A Noun of the male, or Masculine Gender, as Vir a man.

A Noun of the female, or Feminine Gender, as Mulier a woman.

A Noun of the Neuter Gender, as Saxum a stone.

A Noun of the Common Gender, is male, and female, and belongs to both sexes:
as Parens a father, or mother.

A Noun of the Doubtful gender is commonly masculine, or feminine, as Dies a
day; sometimes masculine, or neuter, as Vulgus common people; and sometimes
feminine, or neuter, as Halec a Herring.

Declensions five.
HIs true declension every Noun will give,
From termination of the Genitive.

Verbs in [o] and [or] are called personal, because they are declined with
three persons in both numbers.

Actives may take ^ to be made passive personals, verbs neuter cannot.

Some neuters signify passively, and are called neuter passives, as vapulo I
am whipped.


Verbs Personal four, Active, Passive, Neuter, Deponent.
VErbs have their mood and tense, and signify
Either to do, to suffer, or to be.
Amare to love, amari to be loved, esse to be.

THe Active verb does signify to do,
So many the Neuter, both must end in o.
Amo I love. Curro I run.

PAssive, Deponent, both in [or] do run,
To do Deponent, Passive to be done.
Amor I am loved. Loquor I do speak.

Persons, three.
WIth Verbs three Persons in both numbers may
Join, and agree, I, Thou, He, We, Ye, They.
Singular.
Ego amo I love, tu amas thou love, ille amat he loves.
Plural.
nos amamus we love. vos amatis ye love. illi amant they love.
Moods, four.
INdicatives tell plainly, or make known
their Mood, by asking of a question.
Amat he loves, amas tu do thou love?

IMperatives we clearly understand, Imperatives want the first person.

Receive both name and nature from Command.
Ama love thou. Monete vos do ye advise. Legito ille let him read. Sunto let
them be.
MAy, might, would, should, Subjunctives nominate,
Or when some Adverbs, or Conjunctions wait.
Si faciam if I do. Vt videam that I may see, or let me see.

INfinitives which [to] before them use,
Number and person in their Mood refuse.
Amare to love. Possum facere I am able to do, or I can do.

Gerunds, three. Supines, two.
IN di, do, dum, the Gerunds chime and close;
[um] the first Supine, [u] the latter shows.
Amandi of loving, amando in loving, amandum to love.

Monitum to advise, monitu to be advised.

Tenses, five.
FIve tenses which their signs discover still,
I do, I did, I have, had, shall or will.
Present tense, as amo I do love. Time present.


Preterimperfect tense, amabam I did love.

Preterperfect tense, amavi I have loved. Time past.


Preterpluperfect tense, amaveram I had loved.

Future tense, amabo I shall or will love. Time to come.


But if these signs come not before verbs, then they are verbs of themselves,
as I do facio, I did faciebam, or feci, etc. I have habeo, I had habui, I will
volo, I would velim, vellem. I will not nolo, nolim, I would not nollem, I can
possum, I could potui, etc. I ought debeo, debui, deberem, I might possim,
possem; so likewise the Passive signs, am, art, is, are, was, were, were, have
been, had been, shall or will be. I am sum; I was eram, essem; I have been fui,
fuerim; I had been fueram, fuissem; I shall or will be ero, fuero.

Conjugations, four.
THe first has [a] long before [re] and [tis,]
[e] long the second Conjugation is:
The infinitive [e] short the third designs,
But with [i] long, [io] the fourth declines.
Active.
Amare to love. Monere to advise. Legere to read. Audire to hear.

Amavisse to have or had loved.

Although the Infinitives in [rum,] as amaturum, moniturum; and the like, were
anciently used when they answered without altering their termination, to every
number and gender, as credo inimicos meos hoc dicturum, I believe that my
enemies will say this; yet they are not now in use with the best Authors, who
supply this tense by the Participle in rus, alterable both in gender and number
(of which infinitive Verbs are not capable) before esse or fore, as when we
would say, I promise that I will satisfy, in stead of promitto quod ego
satisfaciam, by plain congruity, we say elegantly, promitto me satisfacturum,
and so in the plural nos, vos, aut illos satisfacturos esse pollicemur, we
promise that we, ye, or they shall satisfy; Illae dixerunt se empturas, the
women said they would buy; and so in the neuter, by altering the gender to
agree with the substantive. The like may be said for the future of the passive
infinitive verb, by the participle in dus.

horrto, hortas, hortavi, etc. and from hortatum to form hortatus by changing m

Syntax.
SYntax is the due order and connection of the parts of Speech among themselves,
according to the practice of the best Authors.

The parts are Concord and Government.


Corcord is an Agreement,
Between the Nominative case and the Verb. Substantive and Adiective.
Antecedent and Relative.

The first Concord.
Nominative Cases are often understood, but especially ego, ru, ille, nos, vos,
illi, when there is no distinction, or emphatical signification intended.
VErbs personal in Concord do receive
Number and Person from their Nominative.
Knowledge puffs.

It is fit If you leave out the Conjunction [that] which in latin is called
quod or ut, the Nominative is elegantly turned into the Accusative, and the
Verb into the Infinitive Mood.
that a Liar be mindful.

The second Concord.
THe Adjective and Substantive embrace
In their particular Gender, Number, Case.
Extreme right (or Law) is extreme wrong.

The third Concord.
ALL Antecedents their own number give
Person and gender to their Relative.
The man is wise When the English [that] may be turned into [which] it is a
Relative.
that speaks few words.

We put those things to use, which When there comes no Nominative case between
the Relative and Verb, the Relative may be the Nominative Case, otherwise it is
Governed like a noun Substantive.
we place upon the poor.

THe guiding part in every Concord's that,
Which answers to the question [who] or [what,]
This sometimes proves to be no word of Case,
But is an Aptote, and supplies the place.
An other to morrow.

It is a kind of pleasure to weep.

THe Antecedent and the Substantive
Are sometime buried in the Possessive.
Hear The Prayer of me.
my prayer calling to thee.

I wonder at The folly of ye.
your folly which wash an Ethiop.

VErbs may between two Nominatives, that be
Of diverse numbers, with the last agree:
Thus Adjectives, or Relatives, when placed
Betwixt two different genders, choose the last.
Conscience is a thousand witnesses.

All error is not to be called folly.

Let no man take away the stone, which is called a Bounder.

NOuns singular conjoynd, when they precede
Verbs, Adjectives, or Relatives may plead The first person is more worthy then
the second, the second more worthy then the third. The masculine gender is more
worthy then the feminine, but the neuter is before the feminine, when the
things mentioned are without life. Aqua and ignis sunt inexorebilia.

A plural nature, and these three surrender
Themselves to the most worthy person, Gender.
A Friend and Gold are to be tried in the Fire.

I and my business are well.

Water and fire are not to be entreated.

Every word is Governed of that which goes next before in orderly construing,
except the Relative, which is governed of that which follows. Interrogatives
and Indefinites follow the Rule of the Relative.
Government.
Words that descend from Verbs or Nouns, arrest
Those Cases which their Primitives possessed.
Horses drawing the mill walk much, advance little.

It is a wise man's part to meet danger.

Oh man! a Buble, why art thou proud?
