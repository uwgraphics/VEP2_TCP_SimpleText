The Huntsman's DELIGHT: Or, The FORRESETRS Pleasant Pastime.
To the Tune of, Amongst the Leaves so green a etc.
F^^ wh^, 'twas thought that some there was withawn.
The De^r are wounded, but they are not slain,
Yet so they are wound^d, that they are or'etain;
And in their taking, pity it is shown:
The Keepers swore great Oaths, upon their lives,
They Would be as kind to them as Men are to their Wives,
The pleasant Sp^rt this Ditty does declare,
Of the kind Huntsmen, and the Fallow-deer.


COme all you young Maidens and lend an ear,
Come listen a while, and you shall bear
How the Keepers did sport with the Fallow-deer,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, derry derry down,
Hey down down, ho down down,
Hey down, ho down, derry derry down,
Amongst the leaves so green a,
The Keepers they would an a hunting go,
And under their coats each carried his bow,
And all for to shoot the bonny bonny Do,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, derry derry down,
Hey down down, ho down down
Hey down, hodown, derry derry, down,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
They spyed five Does upon a hill,
And to shoot at them was their good will,
But none of them they meant for to kill,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
At the first Do they shot, and they mist,
The second Do they clipped, and they kissed;
And they said them down where no Man wist,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
The one cried out unto the other,
I Am served as my Father served my Mother;
But yet these joys we cannot smother,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
The third Do she made great moan,
Because that she was big with Fawn,
Which made her to go weeping home,
From amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
The fourth Do could no longer stay,
But she must be gone her way,
For fear that the Keepers should her lay
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
But soon after she did repent,
And to turn again she was fully bent,
To lie down and take her heart's content,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
The fifth Do leapt over the style,
But the Keeper he got her by the heel,
And there he did both kiss and feel,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
They drew forth their arrows once again,
And they shot at another across the plain;
She sighed, but it was with a pleasing pain,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down etc.
He pricked her straightways with his dart
But she cried out she felt no smart,
And therein say the Keeper's art,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
These fair Does, they leapt, and they ski^^
Till leaping along, at length they were t^i^^
No sooner they fell, but the Keepers them ^
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
The Keepers did tumble them over and over,
Though often they shot, they required more
They never had met with such sport before,
Amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
These bold Huntsmen were all agreed,
And by consent these fair Does did bleed;
But after that they came often to feed
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
Great Crowds came running over the Plain,
Expecting to see these fair Does slain;
But like Fools as they came, they return^d aga^^
From amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down, etc.
If it be true as old Wives say,
Take a Do in the Month of May,
And a Forrester's courage she soon will ally,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
These Huntsmen were so gently inclined,
They let them rise their courage to find;
But away they tript so swift as the wind,
From amongst the leaves so green a:
Hey down derry derry down;
Hey down down, ho down down,
Hey down, ho down, derry derry down,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
