100. The fourth Century.
I Quite forgot it.

I remembered it not when I came from home.

I will bring it without fail to day, to morrow.

Whose Office is it,

to make clean the Study?

It is my turn, thine, John's.


Put the Books in their place.

Why are you more melancholy then usually?

Are not all things well?

I had a grievous fall.

My Master threatened to beat me.

10.

WHy are you so merry?

We have leave to play.

At what hour must we come again?

Whither go we now?

I go home.

John is gone out of the School.

He went to mictum.

What did you pay for this book?

I had it cheap, too dear.

No Man will sell it cheaper.

20.

NOw it is fair weather.

The weather invites us to play.

We must not play without leave.

Some one is to be sent,

that may get leave for us.

Let, Paul go, he has a good tongue and is bold.

Let him go that has a mind to it,

I had rather want then ask it.

Dear heart go, and make us all bound to thee.

Your importunity shall prevail upon me.

30.

NO man is more fit to go upon this message.

Your Scholars desire of your Clemency leave to play.

Let them play together,

in the place appointed,

and let them return in good time,

about five a clock.

Let us rejoice.

I have got leave, though with much ado.

But we must beware we do no harm.

We will consider what to play at, when we come into the Field.

40.

WHence come you so early?

From my Chamber.

When did you rise?

A little before six.

(...)ll'd you up?

(...) other, my

(...)

Have you said your prayers?

As soon as I kembed my hair,

washed my face, mouth, and hands,

I served God.

50.

Upon my knees,

and with my hands lifted up,

I said the Creed,

the Pater noster,

and the Ten Commandments,

with thanksgiving.

In what language do you pray?

Sometime in the Mother tongue,

another time in Latin,

and sometime in Greek.

You do well and virtuously in it.

Have a care you neglect not this duty.

I will have a diligent care, if it please God.

Are you ready

to give an account of your Study?

I think I am ready.

Say, and be confident.

Can you say your lesson without book?

Almost.

Shall we repeat together?

With all my heart.

70.

BEgin.

I will do it willingly.

But hear me attentively,

that you may tell me when I say wrong.

You have mist once, twice, thrice, four times,

five, six, seven, times,

eight, nine, ten times.

Woe is me.

I thought I could say excellent well.

80.

It Is so oftentimes with me,

when my memory is not confirmed.

He is happy that has a good memory.

It is a real benefit.

But the time goes away.

Hear me now.

I hear you, say.

What do you?

I sit, I do nothing.

But how go your affairs?

90.

THey go very ill.

Perhaps I interrupt your business.

Nay, I am very much at leisure.

I was weary of idleness,

and you drive it away.

Excuse me,

if I come unseasonably.

You are come in the very nick.

I would be loath to trouble you.

We were talking of you.

100. Centuria quarta.
VAh! istud mihi omnino exciderat.

Non venit mihi in mentem cum domo exirem.

Certo afferam hodie, cras.

Cujus est,

purgare musaeum?

Meum est, tuum, Joannis est.


Repone libros in suo loco.

Quid tristior es solito?

Non omnia been se habent?

Graviter cecidi.

Praeceptor minatus est mihi verbera.

10.

QUid tam laetus es?

Data est nobis ludendi venia.

Ad quotam horam jussi sumus redire?

Quo nunc vadis?

Eo domum.

Joannes exivit schola.

Egressus est reddendae urinae causa.

Quanti emisti hunc librum?

Parvo pretio emi, nimio,

Nemo divendit alio pretio.

20.

NUnc aer sererenus est,

Coelum invitat ad ludendum.

Non licet ludere absque venia.

Mittendus est quispiam,

qui ludendi veniam impetret,

Eat Paulus, nam been linguax est and audax.

Eat qui volet.

Ego carere malo quam rogare.

I, quaeso, magnam a nobis initurus gratiam.

Quandoquidem id tantopere contenditis, provinciam accipiam.

30.

NEmo ad hanc legationem magis idoncus.

Discipuli tui orant humanitatem tuam ludendi veniam.

Laudant, sed gregatim,

in loco ad id constituto,

and mature se domum recipiant.

Sub horam quintam.

Simus hilares.

Impetravi veniam, quanquam aegre,

Interim cavendum ne quid peccemus.

De lusus genere in campo consultabimus.

40.

UNde venis tam mane?

Ex cubiculo.

Quando surrexisti?

Paulo ante fextam.

Quis excitavit te?

Frater, Soror.

Precatus es deum?

Quam primu^ pexui crines,

Faciem, os and manus lavi,

Adoravi Deum.

50.

FLexis genibus, and conjunctis manibus,

Recitavi symbolum apostolicum,

Orationem Dominicam,

and Decalogum,

cum gratiarum action.

Qua lingua soles precari?

Alias vernacula,

Alias Latina,

Nonnunquam etiam Graeca.

Recte and pie facis.

Cura ut hanc officii tui partem nunquam negligas.

Dabo operam sedulo, Deo dante.

Esne paratus,

ad reddendum rationem studii tui?

Paratus sum, ut mihi videor.

Read rationem, and sis praesenti animo.

Tenes memoria praelectionem?

Propemodum.

Visne repetamus una?

Maxim velim.

70.

INcipe.

Faciam libenter.

Sed tu attente an sculta me,

Ut corrigas si quid peccavero.

Errasti semel, bis, ter, quater,

quinquie, sexies, septies,

octies, novies, decies.

Me miserum.

Putabam me praeclare tenere.

80.

IDem and mihi solet accidere,

cum memoria non satis confirmata est.

Foelix qui memoria bona praeditus est.

Magnu^ revera beneficium,

Sed tempus abit.

Audi nunc me.

Audio, recita.

Quid agis?

Sedeo, nihil ago.

Sed quomodo se res habent tuae?

90.

PEssime habent,

Fartassis te occupatum seriis negotiis interpello.

Imo maxim vacuus sum.

Jam me ceperat otii taedium,

and tu descutis,

Da veniam,

si parum in tempore te interpellarim.

In ipso tempore advenis.

Nolim ego esse tibi impedimento.

De te locuti sumus.

100. The fifth Century.
I Easily believe it.

My ear did tingle as I came strangely.

Which ear?

the left,

And therefore I think there was no good spoken of me.

Every thing honorable.

(...) what is that

(...)?

They say you are

turned Hunts-man.

And I have in my net what I hunted for.

What? A pretty wench,

whom I am to marry the next day after to morrow.

10.

WHo is your Bride?

Dorothy the Parsons Daughter.

We wish you joy of her,

for she is not only beautiful,

but well bred,

and instructed to be a good housewife.

So they say.

I know it certainly.

If you love me,

grace my wedding with your presence.

20.

Do hear Boy?

Will no man come forth?

This man will break the doors I think.

It is some acquaintance sure.

O Friend what bring you?

My self.

You bring a thing but little worth.

But my Father paid dear for me.

I believe he paid more for you,

then you are worth.

30.

IS John at home?

I am not certain.

But go and see.

Go your self rather, and ask

whether he will be at home or no.

Are you at home John?

I am not.

Thou impudence! do not I hear thee speak to me?

Nay you are more impudent.

I gave belief to your Maid lately, that you were not at home,

40.

ANd will not you give credit to my self?

You say right.

You return such as I gave you.

But you live like a fish in the shell.

You are always at home,

and never creep out.

I have something to do at home.

I have no business abroad.

Or if I had any,

this weather would keep me within doors a few days.

50.

But now it is a clear day,

and invites to a walk.

If you have a mind to a walk,

I am not unwilling.

You sit too close to your book.

You consume your self with immoderate study.

I had rather languish with study, then love.

Was not this a pleasant walk?

Truly I took much delight in it.

I wish you very much happiness.

60.

I Wish you twice as much.

What are you doing?

I am talking.

What do you talk to your self?

Truly I talk with a most pleasant companion.

With whom?

With Cicero.

You do that often.

But variety is pleasant.

You study night and day.

70.

WE cannot have too much learning.

It is granted.

But a moderation is best in all things

Nothing is sweet, that is perpetual.

You keep your old custom.

You have not left your jeering.

I speak seriously.

My books covered with dust,

witness my diligence at study.

But I hinder you.

80.

I Pray take my business to your special care.

I most heartily desire you,

that you would mind this business.

I will do it for you,

and that speed^ly.

I cannot promise you success,

but I Will promise you, neither faith nor care shall be wanting.

I will not brag,

but I will make good in action,

what becomes a true friend.

90.

WHat happened, that you have not seen us all this while?

I could not for business.

I had a good mind to it,

but I had not ability.

I was very ill.

I excuse you,

upon condition you use it not.

Your excuse is more just then I desire.

if sickness were the cause.

100. Centuria quinta.
FAcile credo.

Mire huc venienti mihi tinniebat auris.

Utra?

sinistra;

Unde conjicio nihil magnifice de me fuisse dictum.

Imo nihil non honorificum.

Sed quid est bonae rei?

Aiunt te venatorem esse factum.

Et intra casses meos est praeda, qua^ venabar.

Quaenam? Lepida puella,

quam perendie ducturus sum.

10.

QUaenam est sponsa?

Dorothea concionatoris filia.

De hac tibi congratulamur,

nam non solu^ pulchra est,

sed been etiam educata,

and ad curanda negotia domestica, been instituta.

Ita aiunt.

Ego novi certo.

Si me amatis,

vestra praesentia nuptias meas cohonestetis.

20.

HEus puer?

Nemo huc prodit?

Hic opinor effringet fores.

Verisimile esse familiarem alique^.

O amice, quid adfers?

Meipsum.

Tu certe rem haud magni pretii huc attulisti.

Atqui magno constiti patri meo.

Credo eum sumptus majores in te fecisse,

quam pro dignitate.

30.

ESt ne Joannes domi?

Non certo scio.

Sed abi visum.

Abi tu potius interrogatum,

an velit jam domi esse.

Joannes, es ne domi?

Non sum.

Impudens! non audio te loquentem?

Imo tu impudentior.

Nuper ancillae tuae credidi, te non esse domi,

40.

ET tu non credis mihi ipsi?

Aequum dicis.

Par pari refers.

Sed tu mihi videris cochleae vitam agere.

Perpetuo domi seeds,

nec usquam prorepis.

Est quod agam domi.

Foris nihil mihi est negotii.

Aut si quid esset,

haec aura me dies aliquot a publico cohibuisset.

50.

SEd nunc serenum est coelum,

and invitat ad deambulandum.

Si prodeambulare lubet,

non recuso.

Nimium assides libris.

Immodico studio te maceras.

Malo studio marcescere quam amore.

Nonne voluptati fuit haec deambulatio?

Ego quidem ea vehementer delectatus sum.

Opto tibi multam foelicitatem.

60.

COnduplicatu^ tibi opto quicquid optas mihi.

Quid agis?

Confabulor.

Quid confabulare solus?

Certe lepidissimo congerone confabulor.

Quo?

Cicerone.

Istud quidem saepe facis.

Sed varietas grata est.

Tu noctes and dies incumbis literis.

70.

NUlla est satietas literarum.

Verum est.

Sed modus in omnibus optimus.

Nihil suave quod perpetuum.

Tuo more facis.

Rides me ut soles.

Ex animo loquor.

Libri ipsi pulvere obducti,

testantur meam in studiis diligentiam.

Sed ego te detineo.

80.

QUaeso ut haec res tibi cordi sit.

Etiam atque etiam rogo,

ut hoc negotium tibi curae sit.

Ego hoc tibi effectum dabo,

and quidem propediem.

Eventum praestare non possum,

illud poll ceor, mihi nec fidem, nec studium defuturum.

Oratione nihil polliceor,

sed re praestabo,

quicquid est amici sinceri.

90.

QUid accidit, quod tamdiu nos non inviseris?

Non licuit per occupationes.

Volui equidem,

sed non data est mihi facultas.

Male habui.

Accipio tuam excusationem,

hac lege ne saepe utaris.

Excusatio tua justior est quam vellem.

si quidem morbus fuit in causa.

100. The sixth Century.
THe matter has succeedde more happily then I expected.

I obtained more then I had confidence to ask.

It fell out as I would have it.

I shall thank you as long as I live.

I can hardly thank you sufficiently,

I can requite you never,

for this your favor.

This is the most acceptable

among the many courtesies

which you have done me.

10.

Our friendship is greater,

then that you should thank me, or I you,

for any benefits.

He that does good for a friend,

does himself a courtesy.

He that deserves well from a friend,

gives not a benefit,

but puts it out to use.

If you accept this service,

employ me oftener.

20.

I Congratulate your return into your Country.

I am glad to see you alive.

You are returned fatter,

and taller then you were.

You had no beard when you went,

you are come back with a bush.

I had rather return wiser.

I rejoice for your sake, and our selves,

that you come home safe and sound.

30.

I Am glad likewise,

that I find you well.

I prithee why so pale?

why such beanness?

why these wrinckles in your forehead?

My Body is like my Fortune.

Has any misfortune bafalne you?

Though fortune never smiled upon me much,

she was never more then now my enemy.

I am sorry for you.

40.

WHat is the misfortune?

I have lost all my money.

Where my dearest?

In the Baltic Sea,

sailing from Denmark into Germany.

I make no question, but you prayed heartily.

Never more fervently,

You acknowledge the old saying,

He that knows not how to pray, let him go to sea.

50.

I Find it true by experience.

It Is well you could swim home.

Better lose our money then our life.

Therefore you see

Learning and Virtue are the safest riches,

which can neither be taken away,

nor burden the possessor.

You say very Philosophically,

but in the mean time I have the smart.

But whither are you bound now?

60.

STrait to my own Country.

Stay a while.

I have something to send.

A footman carries no great weight.

I will not burden you much.

That you would commend me to all my friends.

If you load me but with compliments,

I shall easily carry them.

And that you may not do it for nothing,

I pray God keep you company.

70. A Scholar and Master.

Sch. SIr, I having studied some years already

under your tuition,

have been taught faithfully by you.

But now it has pleased my Parents,

that I should go to some University,

that I may improve my Learning,

and serve God more profitably in some Calling.

Wherefore I most humbly thank you,

for the many benefits you have conferred upon me,

and I promise, that I will not only bear them in memory,


80.

But publish them also to all good men,

with a grateful mind and tongue.

Master. This expression of your modesty and gratitude,

which you have declared in language,

is very acceptable to me.

And I would to God, there were more like you

in this corrupt age,

and loose garb of young men,

who would imitate your diligence in your learning,

and temperance in manners.

But I not only with a good will

give you leave to depart,


90.

But also ask of God in my prayers,

that he guide and direct you hereafter;

that as you have made a fair beginning,

so you may proceed,

and not suffer your self to be tainted with the examples of bad men,

whereof there is too great a plenty every where:

That in short time you be a servant to the Church and State,

an honor to friends and Country,

and a pleasure and comfort to your friends.

100. Centuria sexta.
REs successit opinione mellus.

Plus impetravi qua^ ausus fuissem optare.

Res cecidit ex sententia.

Gratiam tibi habiturus sum, quoad vivam maximam.

Pares agere gratias vix possum,

refer nequaqua^,

pro isto beneficio.

Hoc long est gratissimum,

ex omnibus beneficiis

quae tu plurima in me contulisti.

10.

MAjor est nostra necessitudo,

quam ut tu mihi gratias deberes, vel ego tibi,

pro ullis beneficiis.

Qui amico benefacit,

sibi est beneficus.

Qui been meretur de amico,

non dat beneficiu^,

sed foenerat.

Si ex animo probas officium in te meum,

utere fac saepius.

20.

GRatulor tibi de reditu in patriam.

Ego tibi superstiti.

Rediisti nobis obesior,

and procerior solito.

Imberbis abieras,

rediisti barbatus.

Malle^ redire prudentior.

Gratulamur and tibi and nobis,

quod vivus and valens nobis sis restitutus.

30.

EGo vicissim laetor,

quod vos salvos repererim.

Quid tibi vult iste pallor?

quid macies?

quid hae in front rugae?

Qualis fortuna, talis est corporis habitus.

Nunquid tibi acerbi accidit?

Etsi nullo fere tempore fortuna mihi favit,

tamen nunquam mihi magis quam nunc adversa est.

Doleo vicem tuam.

40.

QUid istud mali est?

Universae pecuniae naufragium feci.

Ubina^ charissime?

In mavi Baltico,

ex Dania in Germaniam navigaturus

Non dubium est quin diligenter oraveris.

Nunquam diligentius.

Fateris verum esse quod dicitur,

Qui nescit orare, discat navigare.

50.

RE ipsa expertus sum.

Been est quod vivus nobi enatasti.

Melius est pecuniae, quam vitae jacturam facere.

Vides igitur

Doctrinam and virtutem esse tutissimas divitias,

quae nec eripi possunt,

nec gravant circumferentem.

Pulchre quidem philosopharis,

interim ego crucior.

Sed quo nunc te confers?

60

REcta in patriam.

Resist paulisper.

Est quod tibi mandem.

Pediti non convenit sarcina.

Non imponam tibi magnum onus.

Ut omnes familiares meos amanter salutes.

Si nihil aliud sarcicinae imponis prae ter salutationes,

facile perferam.

Et ne gratis istud facias,

precor ut deus tibi comes itineris sit.

70. Discipulus, and Ludimagister.

Dis. EGo aliquot jam annos bonis literis operam navans

sub tua ferula,

fideliter a te institutus sum.

Nunc vero parentibus visum est,

ut me hinc ad Academiam aliquam me conferam,

ubi possim ampliorem ingenii cultum capere,

and deo in functione aliqua honesta utilius servire.

Quare tibi gratias ago maximas,

pro pluribus in me tuis beneficiis,

and polliceor me illa non solum perpetuo meminisse,


80.

SEd etiam apud omnes bonos praedicare,

grata mente and lingua.

Ludimagister. Significatio haec modestiae and gratitudinis tuae,

quam hac tua oratione declarasti,

est mihi pergrata.

Atque utinam plures tales essent

hoc corrupto secuculo,

and his perditis juventutis moribus,

qui tuam diligentiam imitarentur in discendis literis,

and regendis moribus.

Ego vero non solum libenter

abeundi tibi veniam concedo,


90.

SEd etiam Deum oro,

ut deinceps te regat and gubernet;

ut uti pulchre incepisti,

ita pergas,

nec te corrumpi sinas pravorum hominum exemplis,

quorum ubique magna est copia:

Ut paulo post emolumento sis ecclesiae and reipublicae,

patriae and amicis honori,

voluptati and solutio amicis.

George, Luke.
Geo. ARe you well?


Luke Examine my countenance.


Geo. You should rather bid me inspect your Urine.

Do you take me for a Physician?

I do not enquire whether your body be in health, for your face speaks that
well.

But how you please your self.


Luke Truly my body is sound, but my mind is not well.


Geo. Truly he is not right, that is sick thereabout.


Luke The matter is so with me, my body is well, but my purse is sick.


Geo. Your Mother will easily cure that disease.

But how have you done all this while?


Luke Sometimes well, and sometimes ill, according to the condition of humane
affairs.


Geo. Have you constantly enjoyed your health?


Luke By Gods mercy, I have continued healthful.


Geo. God grant it may be so still.

But did nothing trouble you?


Luke Nothing but that I could not enjoy your society.


Georgius, Lucas.
Geo. VAlesne?


Luc. Contemplare vultum.


Geo. Quin magis lotium jubes?

An me putas medicum?

Non rogo, an vales corpore, nam facies ipsa loquitur te been valere.

Sed quomodo tibi placeas.


Luc. Corpus quide^ belle habet, sed animo male est.


Geo. Non valet quidem, qui ista part laborat.


Luc. Sic res habe^t meae, corpus valet, sed aegrotat crumena.


Geo. Facile medebitur matter isti morbo.

Ut valuifti usque?


Luc. Vary, uti sunt res mortalium.


Geo. Fuistine semper prospera valetudine?


Luc. Dei beneficio, ego semper bellissime habui.


Geo. Faxit deus, ut istud sit perpetuum.

Sed nihil interim tibi molestiae fuit?


Luc. Nihil nisi quod non licuit frui vestra consuetudine.

Henry, Cornelius,
Hen. ARe you well?


Cor. Not so well, as I could wish.

I am as it pleases God.

As they use to be, that have to do with Physicians.


Hen. God forbid.

You tell me ill news.

But you must be of good courage.

You must show your self a man.

Behave your self valiantly against your disease.

A good confidence helps in a bad matter.

What is your infirmity?

What disease have you?


Cor. I know not, and therefore it is more dangerous with me.


Hen. You say very true.

To know the disease, is the first degree to health.

Have you consulted no Physician?


Cor. A great many.


Hen. What do they say?


Cor. One denies.

The other affirms.

Another takes time to consider.

They all agree in this, that I am miserable.


Hen. How long have you been sick?


Cor. Eight days.

Almost a month.

I have been sick these ten months.

A whole year I have been sick.


Hen. If I may be worthy to counsel you, you must have a care, that the
disease be not familiar.

Is it a Dropsy?


Cor. They say not.


Hen. Is it a bloody Flixe?


Cor. I think not.


Hen. Is it a Fever?


Cor. I think it be.


Hen. What kind of Fever is it?

a Quotidian?

a Tertian?

or a Quartan?


Cor. I think it be some new kind of Fever, as now a days new diseases
arise, not known before.


Hen. There were too many of the old.


Cor. So it pleases God, to punish new sins with new diseases.


Hen. What day does your fit return?


Cor. What day do you say?

even every day, oftener then Euripus.


Hen. Oh most sad misfortune!

How did you come by this infirmity?

How do you suspect you took it?


Cor. From Famine.


Hen. You were not wont to be so superstitious, to sterve your self with
fasting.


Cor. It was not conscience but want.

For I had no meat.

I think it came of a cold.

This rawnesse of my stomach came as I suppose, from raw Apples.


Hen. Rather from too much, or unseasonable study, you have got this mischief,
or drinking too much.

But why do you not consult a Physician?


Cor. I am afraid he will sooner enlarge my disease than cure it.

I fear he may give me poison in stead of a remedy.


Hen. Therefore you must make choice of one, whom you may safely trust.


Cor. If I must dye, I had rather dye once, then be massacred by so many
Medicines.


Hen. Provide then to be your own Physician.

If you have no confidence in a humane Physician, I pray God supply your
Physicians place.

Therefore ask of God the benefit of health.


Cor. I know not whether it be a benefit or no.


Hen. Is it not a benefit to be freed from a disease?


Cor. It is sometimes more happiness to dye.

But I entreat of God, only what may be best.


Hen. You act the Christian Philosopher: for when we ask good things of God,
necessary for this life, we must always add, Our Lord if thou please.

But spiritual and eternal things are to be asked of God without any
condidition.

But farewell Cornelius.


Cor. And farewell you till to morrow.

Oh my dearest Harry.


Henricus, Cornelius,
Hen. REctene vales?


Cor. Secus quam vellem.

Valeo ut deo visum est.

Ut illi solent, quibus cum medicis res est.


Hen. Avertat deus.

Rem mihi peracerbam narras.

Bono sis animo oportet.

Virum te praestes, oportet.

Forti infractoque animo esto contra morbum.

Multum juvat animus in re mala bonus.

Quo morbo teneris?

Quid habes morbi?


Cor. Nescio, atque ideo laboro periculosius.


Hen. Verum dicis.

Novisse morbum, primus ad sanitatem gradus est.

Nullumne consu luisti Medicum?


Cor. Multos quidem.


Hen. Quid respondent?


Cor. Alius negat.

Alius ait.

Alius deliberandum censet.

In hoc consentiunt omnes, me miserum esse.


Hen. Quantu^ temporis est quod te hoc malum corripuit?


Cor. Octo dies.

Ferme integer mensis est.

Decimu^ jam mensem laboro.

Totum annum aegroto.


Hen. Ego censeo, admittendum esse, ne morbus fiat familiaris.

Number est Hydrops?


Cor. Negant.


Hen. Number dysenteria?


Cor. Non arbitror.


Hen. Number est febris?


Cor. Credo esse.


Hen. Qualenam est febris?

quotidiana?

tertiana?

quartana?


Cor. Opinor novam esse febris speciem, ut nunc novi subinde morbi exoriuntur,
antehac incogniti.


Hen. Plus satis erat veterum.


Cor. Ita visum est deo, nova peccata punire novis morbis.


Hen. Quoto die recurrit dolor?


Cor. Quota die inquis?

imo quotidie, saepius quam Euripus.


Hen. O malum abominandum!

Unde contraxisti hunc morbum?

Unde suspicaris hoc esse collectum mali.


Cor. Ex inedia.


Hen. Non soles usque adeo esse superstitiosus, ut te jejunio maceres.


Cor. Non erat religio, sed opinio.

Non enim dabatur cibus.

E frigore natum arbitror.

Haec stomachi cruditas contracta est, ut opinor, e crudis malis.


Hen. Ex immodico potius aut intempestivo studio, conciliaris tibi hoc mali,
aut potatione largiori.

Sed cur non accersis Medicum?


Cor. Timeo ne citius augeat morbum quam curet.

Timeo ne venenum det pro remedio.


Hen. Deligendus est igitur, cui tuto fidas.


Cor. Si moriendum est, malo semel mori, quam tot pharmacis excarnificatus.


Hen. Fac igitur ut tibi ipsi sis medicus.

Si homini diffidis medico, precor ut sit tibi medici vice deus.

Proinde a Deo pete sanitatis benificium.


Cor. An beneficium sit nescio.


Hen. An non beneficium est liberari morbo?


Cor. Nonnunquam mori foelicius est.

Ego autem peto a Deo nihil, nisi quod optimum sit.


Hen. Pie tu quidem philosopharis:

cum enim petimus a deo bona,

ad hanc vitam necessaria, semper addendum est, Domine si tu vis.

Spiritualia autem and aeterna bona petenda sunt a Deo sine ulla condition.

Sed vale mi Corneli.


Cor. Et tu vale in crastinum, o charissime Henrice.

Thomas, Peter.
Tho. HAve you had a a good journey?


Pet. Indifferent,

but that there was much robbing every where.


Tho. Did you come on foot, or on horseback?


Pet. Part of the way on fooot,

part by wagon,

part by horse,

part by water.


Tho. How go things in the Low Countries?


Pet. Truly in a troublesome condition.

There are great threatenings of war.


Tho. But let this pass, we have nothing to do with fighting.

How go your own affairs?


Pet. Excellent well.

But are you fortunate?


Tho Rather most unhappy.

It cannot be worse with me.


Pet. Have you not gained what you pursued?

Have you not the game you hunted?


Tho. I hunted, but Delia was not propitious.


Pet. Is there no hope left?


Tho. Very much hope,

but nothing of substance,

whole Wain-loads.

ships-full,

but nothing else.


Pet. Has the Consul sent thee nothing?


Tho. He has promised richly,

but sent not an halfepeny.


Pet. He is bountiful in words,


Tho. but performs nothing in deeds.


Pet. You must therefore feed your self with hope.


Tho. But this will not fill the belly.

Yet I am the more nimble for travel,

because I had no weight in my pocket.


Pet. I confess, and the less in danger,

for there are no greater defensives against Thieves.


Tho. But I had rather have the burden with the danger.

Were not you robbed by the way?


Pet. From me?

Prithee how can you plunder a naked man?

Others had more cause to fear me.

I could without money in my purse,

sing, and be hungry all the way.


Tho. But whither are you bound now?


Pet. Straight home,

to salute my Wife, and Parents,

whom I have not seen a great while.


Tho. I wish you may find all cheerful there.


Pet. So say I, and it be Gods will.

Is there no news at our house?


Tho. Nothing, but that you will find your family increased:

for your hen has laid you a very fair Egg.


Pet. You tell me a fine story,

and for this good news,

I bestow this gift upon you,

a New Testament,

lately printed fairly at Paris.


Tho. This is a very acceptable present.

I will study to recompense this favor.


Pet. Account, you have sufficiently requited it,

if you accept it.


Thomas, Petrus.
Tho. FUitne hoc iter tibi foelix?


Pet. Sic satis,

nisi quod nihil usquam tutum est a latronibus.


Tho. Pedes advenis, an eques?


Pet. Partim pedestri itinere,

partim vehiculo,

partim equo,

partim navigio.


Tho. Quo in statu sunt res Belgicae?


Pet. Sane turbulento statu.

Magnae bellorum minae sunt.


Tho. Sed haec omittamus, nihil enim nobis cum Mart.

Quomodo habent res tuae?


Pet. Optime.

An prospero fortunae statu uteris tu?


Tho. Imo maxim adverso.

Res mea in pejori statu esse non potest.


Pet. Non cepisti quod captabas?

Non contigit praeda, quam venabaris?


Tho. Venabar, sed irata Delia.


Pet. Nihil reliquum est spei?


Tho. Permultum spei,

sed nihil rei,

tota plaustra,

totas naves,

sed nihil praeterea.


Pet. Nihil adhuc misit Consul?


Tho. Promisit quidem largiter,

sed ne obolum quidem misit.


Pet. Multa quide^ promittit verbis,


Tho. sed re praestat nihil.


Pet. Ergo spe alendus est animus.


Tho. Sed hac non sanginatur venture.

Sed sum ad iter expeditior hoc,

quod nihil esset oneris in zona.


Pet. Fateor, atque etitiam tutior,

nulla enim sunt arma certiora adversus latrones.


Tho. Sed ego malim and onus, and pericuculum.

Nihilne tibi ademptum est in via?


Pet. Mihine?

Quaeso quid cripias nudo?

Aliis citius erat periculum a me.

Licuit mihi vacuo viatori,

cantare and esurire per totum iter.


Tho. Quo autem nunc abis?


Pet. Recta domum,

salutaturus uxore^ and parents,

jam diu non visos.


Tho. Precor illic ut offendas omnia laeta.


Pet. Utinam ita velit deus.

Nihil interim extitit novi domi nostrae?


Tho. Nihil, nisi quod reperies auctam familiam:

nam tua gallina peperit tibi pulchrum ovum.


Pet. Been nuntias,

and pro hoc nuntio

do tibi munus,

novum testamentum,

Lutetiae recens eleganter excusum.


Tho. Est mihi hoc munus long gratissimum.

Dispiciam unde possim hoc donum pensare.


Pet. Abunde te pensasse puta,

si boni consulueris.

James, John.
Jam. NO news from our friends?

What novelty?


Joh. A great deal of news,

but no truth.

I bring as many lies,

as will more then freight a Ship.


Jam. Unload as soon as you can,

lest you sink under the burden.


Joh. I have no other then what is talked of,

at the Barbers,

at the Carriers,

and a Ship board.


Jam. What? is our Country free from the Plague?


Joh. Not altogether.

But it is not constant,

sometimes it is less,

then it rages again.


Jam. Was there not mischief enough,

where the sword domineers?


Joh. Yes there was truly,

but it seemed otherwise to God.


Jam. Corn must be very dear in that place.


Joh. There is a scarsity of all things,

but of wicked Soldiers.


Jam. Where Soldiers bear the sway,

there is no sparing Churches nor learning.


Joh. Therefore Xenophon said well and wisely,

Men account peace a very good thing,

but War the greatest unhappiness.

But I will detain you no longer.

We will talk more another time,

when it shall be convenient for both.

Now some business calls me to another place.


Jacobus. Joannes.
Jac. NIhil novi a nostris portas?

Quaena^ nova nuntias?


Joa. Nova permulta,

sed nihil very.

Tantum mendaciorum adfero,

quantum vix una navis vehat.


Jac. Exonera te quamprimum,

ne succumbas tanto oncri.


Joa. Nihil habeo praeter ea quae jactantur,

in tonstrinis,

in vehiculis,

and in navibus.


Jac. Quid? an patria nostra immunis a peste?


Joa. Non omnino.

Sed non perpetua est,

aliquando remittit sese,

deinde recrudescit.


Jac. Nonne satis erat malorum,

ubi bellum grassatur?


Joa. Erat quidem,

nisi aliter deo visum est.


Jac. Annonae caritate^ istic esse oportet.


Joa. Omnium rerum illic inopia est,

praeterquam sceleratorum militum.


Jac. Ubi milites dominantur,

ibi nec sacris templis nec Musis parcitur.


Joa. Recte igitur Xenophon and sapienter dixit,

Pax videtur hominibus esse magnum bonum,

bellum vero maximum malum.

Sed non te morabor diutius.

Alias pluribus colloquemur,

quando erit utrique commodum.

Nunc alio me vocant negotia quaedam.

Nicholas, Matthew.
Nic. I Hear you have lately visited

your native Country.


Mat. I have looked upon it again,

for I had not seen my Parents a great while,

neither could I longer bear

the absence of my Country and friends.


Nic. You did piously.

You are of a good nature,

while you think of that.

For we all desire

the Country wherein we were bred and borne.

But prithee tell me,

how you found all things there?


Mat. All new.

Al things changed.

Me thought I came into another world

I had scarce been absent ten years.

I did no less wonder at all things,

then Epimenides the Prince of sleepers,

hardly out of his Dream.

What story is that?

I Will tell you, if you be at leisure to hear it.

Nothing shall be more pleasing.

Therefore I pray give me a stool and cushion.


Nic. You advise well.

You will tell a lie with the more ease while you sit.


Mat. Historians tell a story

of one Epimenides a Cretan borne,

who going alone out of the City

to take a walk,

a sudden storm of rain enforcing;

entering into a Cave he fell asleep,

and continued sleeping seven and forty years.


Nic. But it was well for Epimenides

that he came to himself at last.

Many learned men never wake

out of their dreams.

But you do like a Poet,

Lie on.


Mat. Epeminides when he waked,

goes out of the Cave,

looks about him,

he sees all things changed,

the woods, the banks,

the rivers, the trees,

the fields,

to be short,

every thing new.

Going therefore to the City, he enquires.

Staying there some while,

He neither knew any man,

nor any knew him.

Another kind of garment.

Not the same faces.

The language was changed.

The manners altered.

Nor do I wonder that this happened to Epimenides,

after so many years,

when almost the same thing has happened to me,

who had been absent but a few years.


Nic. How do your Father and Mother?

are they alive?


Mat. They are both liveing,

and indifferently well,

worn with age, sickness,

and the miseries of War.


Nic. This is the Comedy of humane life,

such are all mortal affairs.

Nothing does last long in the same condition.


Nicolaus, Mattheus.
Nic. AUdio te patriam nuper revisisse.


Mat. Revisi,

diu enim non videram parents meos,

nec poteram diutius far

desiderium patriae and amicorum.


Nic. Pie fecisti.

Humanus es,

qui ista cogitas.

Ducimur enim omnes, admirabili amore

ejus regionis quae nos aluit and edidit.

Sed dic quaeso,

quonam in loco illic offendisti omnia?


Mat. Omnia nova.

Omnia mutata.

Videbar mihi in alium venire mundum.

Vix dum decennium abfueram.

Non secus omnia mirabar,

quam Epimenides somniatorum princeps,

vix tandem expergefactus.

Quaenam est ista fabula?

Dicam equidem si vacat audire.

Nihil fuerit jucundius.

Sellam igitur cum pulvino mihi poni jube.


Nic. Recte admones.

Nam sedens commodius mentieris.


Mat. Historici fabulantur

de Epimenide quodam Cretensi,

qui solus urbem egressus

deambulandi gratia,

subita pluvia vi compellente,

speluncam quandam ingressus obdormivit,

quadraginta septe^ perpetuos annos somnu^ continuarit.


Nic. Sed been cum Epimenide actum est,

qui tandem ad se rediit.

Multi docti nunquam expergiscuntur

a suis somniis,

Sed facis ut poeta dignum est.

Perge mentiri.


Mat. Epimenides somno solutus,

e spelunca prodit,

circumspicit,

mutata videt omnia,

filvas, ripas,

flumina, arbores,

agos,

breviter,

nihil non novum.

Accedens ad urbem, percontatur.

Manens illic aliquandiu,

Neque novit quenquam,

nec a quoquam agnitus est.

Alias hominu^ cultus.

Nec idem vultus.

Sermo mutatus.

Diversi mores.

Nec miror hoc Epimenidi evenisse,

post tantum annorum,

cum mihi idem propemodu^ eveverit,

qui pauculos annos abfuissem.


Nic. Quid uterque parens?

vivuntne?


Mat. Vivunt ambo,

and valent utcumque,

confecti senio, morbo,

and bellorum denique calamitate.


Nic. Haec est humanae vitae Comoedia,

tales sunt res humanae.

Ut in eodem nihil usquam duret statu.

Aesopi Fabulae selectiores.
The first Fable. The Kid, and the Wolf.
A Kid standing upon the top of an house,

spying a Wolf passing by,

railed and reproached him.

But the Wolf replied,

Do hear?

It is not thou do revile me,

but the place.

The moral.
This fable signifies,

That oftentimes

the place and time

do occasion our boldness

against our betters.

Fabula. 1. Hoedus and Lupus.
HOedus super quadam domo stans,

cum lupum praetereuntem videret,

criminibatur and convitiis afficiebat ipsum.

Lupus autem dicebat,

Heus tu?

Non tu me criminaris,

sed locus.

Affabulatio.

Quod saepe

locus and tempus

audacia^ nobis praebet

contra praestantiores.

The second Fable. The Lion and the Frog.
ONce upon a time,

A Lion hearing a Frog creaking aloud,

turned himself to the voice,

thinking it to be some great Beast;

But after a little expectation,

as soon as he saw what it was,

he trod it under his foot.

The Moral.
This Fable teaches,

that we ought not to be troubled

at the report of any thing,

before we see it.

Fabula secunda. Leo and Rana.
ALiquando,

cum Leo audivisset valde ranam clamantem,

conversus est ad vocem,

putans magnum aliquod animal esse:

Cum autem expectasset parum,

ut vidit ipsam,

conculcavit.

Affabulatio.

The third Fable. The Heart, and the Lion.
A Heart flying from the Hunters,

entered into a Den,

but meeting there with a Lion,

she was seized upon by him.

But dying she complained,

Woe is me!

that flying from men,

I am fallen upon the worst of Beasts.

This Fable shows,

that many while they decline

small disadvantages,

throw themselves on greater.

Fabula tertia. Cerva and Leo.
CErva venatores fugiens,

in antrum intravit,

in Leonem autem ibi cum incidisset,

ab ipso comprehensa est.

Moriens ante^ dicebat,

Hei mihi!

quod homines fugiens,

in bestiarum ferocissimam incidi.

quod multi fugientes

magna experti sunt.

The fourth Fable. The Sow and the Bitch.
A Sow and a Bitch did contend

about fruitfulness.

The Bitch affirmed,

that she was the most fruitful

of all Creatures upon the earth.

But the Sow encountering her,

said to this,

But for all your have,

we know you bring forth but blind Puppies.

The Fable shows,

that affairs are judged,

not by the quickness,

but by their perfection.

Fabula quarta. Sus and Canis.
SUs and Canis certabant

de foecunditate.

Dixit Canis,

se esse maxim foecundam

omnium animalium terrestrium.

Sed sus occurrens,

ad haec respondit,

Quando heac jactaris,

The fifth Fable. The Piper, and the Fishes.
A Piper taking with him his Net and his Pipes,

came to the Sea,

and standing upon a Rock,

first played upon his Pipes,

hoping it would come to pass,

that the fishes would take to land,

at the sweetness of his melody.

But when a good while, he could not prevail,

he put up his Pipes, and betook him to his Nets;

and casting them into the Sea,

he drew a multitude of fishes.

But shaking them out of his Net,

he sees them leaping.

To whom he said,

O ye worst of Creatures,

since you would not dance at all

when I did pipe,

it is too late now to make me any sport.

The Fable declares,

that every thing is to be discommended,

which is done unseasonably.

Fabula quinta. Tibicen and Pisces.
TIbicen acceptis tibiis and retibus,

accessit ad mare,

and stans super petra,

primum canebat tibiis,

putans fore,

pisces progressuros in terram,

ad suavitatem cantus.

Sed cum din nihil profecisset,

positis tibiis,

assumpsit retia,

and conjiciens in aquas,

multitudine^ magnam pisciu^ traxit.

Ejiciens autem ex reti eos,

videt saltantes.

Quibus haec dixit demum,

Vos pessima animalia,

quandoquidem noluiftis exsilire,

me tibia canente,

nunc quidem cessate mihi idipsum facere.

Fabula indicat,

quod omne vituperabile fit,

quod citra tempus fit.

The sixth Fable. An old Man and Death.
WHen an old man had out some Wood,

and was carrying it home,

he travailed a great way,

and when he had laid down his burden

in a certain place,

by reason of the weight,

he called upon Death.

But when Death appeared,

and asked him the the reason

wherefore he called him:

The old man affrighted, said,

Only that you would help me up with my burden.

The Fable shows,

that every man loves his life,

although he be unhappy and a Beggar.

Fabula sexta. Senex and mors.
SEnex aliquando ligna cum secuisset,

and illa ferens,

multam viam ibat,

and cum deposuisset onus

in loco quodam,

propter multum laborem,

mortem invocabat.

Ipsa vero mors cum advenisset,

and interrogaret causam,

ob quam se invocaret:

Perterritus senex dixit,

Ut tantum onus meum attollas.

The seventh Fable. The Ass and the Fox.
AN Ass having put on a Lions skin,

went about

frighting the other beasts,

and seeing a Fox,

he attempted to terrify him:

who said to him,

having heard his hideous noise,

You may be confident Sir,

but that I heard you bray,

I should have been terrified too.

This Fable teaches,

that some unlearned persons

which seem to be of ability to strangers,

are discovered by their loquacity.

Fabula septima. A sinus and Vulpes.
A Sinus indutus pelle Leonis

circumibat

alia animalia territans,

and conspicatus vulpem,

tentabat and illam perterrefacere:

The eighth Fable. The Dog and the Cook.
A Dog coming into the Kitchen,

and while the Cook was busy,

having snatched a heart,

ran away with it.

But the Cook turning about

as he spied him running away,

Ho sir,

know wheresoever thou be,

I will be watchful of thee.

For thou have not taken a heart from me,

but thou have given me a heart.

The Fable shows,

that men's losses

are oftentimes their lessons.

Fabula octava. Canis and Coquus.
CAnis insiliens in culinam,

and coquo occupato,

cor cum rapuisset,

aufugit.

Atqui Coquus conversus,

ut vidit ipsum sugientem, ait,

that if she gave her Hen more barley,

she would lay twice a day.

desire many things,

do even lose

that which they have.

supposing there was store of Gold within her,

though it necessary to kill her:

but when she had killed her,

she found her like other Hens.

The Fable teaches,

that we ought to content our selves

with what we have, and not to be transported with insatiable desires.

Fabula decima. Gallina aurum pariens.
MUlier quaedam habens gallinam,

ova aurea parientem,

The Fable shows,

that many undo themselves,

when they will not hearken to men that give them good counsel.

A Certain Man bought a Blackmore,

Thinking that his color was such,

by the negligence of him that had him before.

And having taken him home,

he applied all manner of purgations to him,

and endeavored

with all washing to make him white:

but he could not change his color,

and had his labor for his pain.

that natures will remain

as they were in the beginning.

The thirteenth Fable. The Boar and the Fox.
A Boar standing near to a tree,

did whet his tushes.

But a Fox asking the cause,

why upon no necessity that urged him,

he did sharpen his teeth?

He answered,

I do not this without reason:

for if any danger surprise me,

I shall not then be at leisure

to whet my teeth,

but rather to make use of them.

The Fable signifies,

that it behooves one to be always prepared

against a danger.

The fifteenth Fable. The Fox and the Lion.
THe Fox having never seen a Lion,

when he met him by chance,

was so terrified at the first,

that he was ready to give up the ghost.

Afterward,

the second time he saw him,

he was indeed affrighted,

but not so much as before.

But when he saw him the third time,

he gathered that confidence,

that he approached and talked to him.

The Fable teaches,

that familiarity does make

things otherwise formidable, easily to be attempted.

The Grasshopper being very hungry,

desired some food from them.

But the Ants replied,

Why did you not gather food in the Summer?

But she answered,

I had no leisure,

I spent my time in singing.

Then they laughing at him returned,

If you have sung away the Summer,

you may now dance in the Winter.

The Fable shows,

that it becomes not a man

to be negligent in business,

left he repent too late,

when he is thrown upon necessities.

He asked her

why she came not to the supper.

But when she said,

My house is a friend,

Home is the dearest.

He being enraged condemned her,

that she should always carry her house like a Porter.

The Fable shows,

that many men choose rather

to live sparingly at home,

then with the highest entertainment abroad.

The eighteenth Fable. The Horse and the Ass.
A Certain man had an Horse and an Ass.

As they were traveling upon the way,

the Ass said to the Horse,

Take a part of my burden,

if thou will preserve me.

But he would not be persuaded.

The Ass sinking under his burden dyed.

But the Master laying the whole load upon the Horse,

and the very skin of the Ass,

The Horse complaining cried out,

Woe is me miserarable!

What is happened to me a wretch?

For I that was not willing

to take a little burden,

behold I now carry all,

and the very Asses skin.

The Fable shows,

that when the great ones communicate with the small,

they both shall be preserved.

The ninteenth Fable. Thieves.
THieves entering into a house,

found nothing but a dunghill Cock,

and seizing upon him they went their way.

But when he came to be killed,

he petitioned them to be dismissed,

pretending that he was necessary to men,

as one that in the night called them up to work.

Then they answered,

for this very reason we kill thee,

for by waking them

thou do hinder our trade.

The Fable signifies,

that those things are most contrary to evil men,

which are benefits to the good.

The twentieth Fable. The nightingale and the Hawk.
A Nightingale perching upon the tree,

did sing according to her custom.

A Hawk seeing her and being hungry,

stoops and catches her.

But when she was to be slain,

she entreated the Hawk

that she might not be devoured,

as not sufficient to satisfy his hunger,

but that it was fit for him in his necessity,

to fly upon other greater birds.

But the Hawk answering said,

But I were surely mad,

if I let the food go now in my hands,

to follow a new game not visible.

The Fable shows,

that some men are so inconsiderate,

that they lose what they have in their power,

with hope of greater things only in the air.

The one and twentieth Fable. Youngmen and a Cook.
Two young men stood near a Cook,

and while the Cook was busy at his work,

one of them stealing a piece of flesh,

conveyed it into the others bosom.

But the Cook, turning himself about,

and missing his meat,

he that stole it,

swore that he had it not;

and he that had it,

swore he stole it not.

But when the Cook perceived their craft,

he said,

Although I cannot find you out,

yet you are not undiscovered to God,

by whom you have sworn.

The Fable shows,

that though our perjuries are not known to men,

we cannot put on a vizor before God.

The two and twentieth Fable. A Husbandman and his two Sons.
A Husbandman ready to dye,

and desiring that his Sons should follow their Husbandry;

Calling them togegether, he said,

Oh my Children!

I am now going out of this world.

But when ye shall seek

what I have hid in the Vineyard,

you shall find all.

They therefore supposing,

that there was some treasure hid there,

dig'd all the Earth of the Vineyard,

(when their Father was dead)

and truly found no treasure.

But the Vineyard thus very well dug,

returned them abundance of profit.

The Fable teaches,

that labor is a treasure,

and the best recompense of our expectations.

one said to the other,

Hark thou,

The four and tweneth Fable. Foxes.
A Fox taken in a snare,

and getting off with the loss of his tail,

thought he could not live without dishonor.

He therefore resolved,

to advise other Foxes to it,

that he might hide his particular shame,

with the general incommodity.

And truly having called them all together,

he counseled them to cut off their tails,

because this member was not only uncomely,

but that the burden upon it was unnecessary.

Having made this oration,

one of them said,

Do'ye hear sir,

But if this were not an advantage to your self,

you do ill to engage us to it.

The Fable shows,

that wicked men give counsel,

not out of good will to their friends,

but for their own interest.

The five and twentieth Fable. Mercury, and the Statuary.
MErcury desiring to know,

what reputation he had among men,

went to the house of an Image-maker,

taking upon him the shape of a Man.

And spying the statue of Jupiter,

he asked,

for what price it might be bought.

But answer being made for a dram,

He laughing, asked the price of Juno's.

But he answered, it was dearer.

And seeing his own statue there,

and thinking,

because he was the messenger of the Gods,

and profitable,

that a great estimation should be had of him

among men;

he asked concerning himself.

But the Statuary said,

If you will buy these,

I will give you this into the bargain.

The Fable is

against a man that is covetous of his own vain glory,

who has no honor among other men.

The six and twentieth Fable. The Wolf and the Crane.
A Bone stuck within a Wolfs throat,

and he promised,

to give a reward to the Crane,

if putting his head down,

he would take a bone out of his throat.

But when he had drawn it forth,

having a long neck,

he demanded his reward.

The Wolf laughing,

and whetting his teeth, said,

You have a reward sufficient,

in this respect only,

that your head has escaped safe and sound,

having been once in the mouth and teeth of a Wolf.

This Fable shows,

that it is vain to ask a reward

from men above us in power,

who though preserved from danger,

think it recompense enough,

if they forbear to hurt us.

The seven and twentieth Fable. A Fisherman.
A Fisherman did fish in a certain river,

and when he had set his nets.

he beat the water,

that the Fishes in their flight might unawares be engaged in his net.

But one that did inhabit there about,

seeing him do so,

chid him, as one that troubled the River,

and would not let them drink the water pure.

And he made answer,

If the River should not be thus troubled,

I should catch no fish.

The Fable signifies,

that some evil men

get most profit to themselves,

when they bring their Country into sedition.

went about seeking some food.

But coming to a certain place,

he heard a child cry,

and an old Woman saying to him,

Leave crying,

or i will give you up to the Wolf

this very hour.

The Wolf thinking the old Woman spoke in earnest,

staid there expecting a long hour.

But when the evening came,

he hears the old Woman again,

flattering the child,

and telling him,

Oh my child!

if the Wolf come hither,

we will kill him.

As soon as the Wolf heard this,

he sneaked away, saying,

In this Cottage,

they say one thing,

and do another.

This Fable is against those men,

who have not their deeds

The twenty ninth Fable. Dogs.
A Man having two Dogs,

the one he bred up to hunting,

the other to keep the house.

And if at any time it happened

the hound to take any game,

the Dog that tarried at home, had his share of the prey.

But the hound taking it ill,

and upbraiding the other,

because he every day took the pains,

the other idling at home,

was fed with his sweat:

He submitting himself said,

Accuse not me, but our Master,

who taught not me to labor,

but to eat other folks meat.

The Fable declares,

that young men that are ignorant,

are not to be blamed,

when their Parents gave them no better education.

Fabula vicesima nona. Canes.

quod etiam juvenes qui nihil sciunt,

non sunt reprehendendi,

cum ipsos parents sic educaverint.

The thirtieth Fable. The man which broke an Image.
A Certain man having a wooden god,

and being very poor,

he did humbly beseech him

that he would do something for him.

When he had done this often,

and lived still in great want,

being very angry,

he took him by the legs,

and threw him against the pavement.

But his head knocking the ground,

and presently broken to pieces,

a great deal of gold came forth:

which when the man had gathered up,

he exclaimed,

Thou art perverse,

in my opinion,

and ungrateful:

for thou did me no good

when I did worship thee,

but thou do bestow many good things

now I have beaten thee.

The Fable shows,

That you shall profit your self nothing

by flattering a wicked man:

But if you lash him soundly,

you may get the more benefit by him.

Fabula tricesima. Homo qui confregit statuam.
HOmo quidam ligneum habens deum,

Capite igitur colliso,

and mox confracto,

aurum effluxit quamplurimum:

exclamabat,

Perversus es,

ut ego arbitror,

and ingratus:

minime enim me juvisti

colentem te,

Multis aute^ bonis compensas

me te verberantem

Fabula ostendit,

Quod non sis profuturus tibi

honorans pravum hominem:

verberans autem ipsum,

magis profuturus sis.

The one and twentieth Fable. A Woman and her Maids.
A Widow woman that took pains for her living,

having many maidservants,

used to call them up in the night

to their work,

about the Cock crowing.

But they wearied out with continual labor,

thought fit to kill the Cock in the house,

as one that waked their Mistress in the night.

But it fell out with them when they had done this,

that they fell into greater inconveniences;

for the Mistress n^^ knowing the Cocks hour,

called them up more early in the night.

This Fable teaches,

that to many people

their own counsels are the cause of their ruin.

Fabula tricesima prima. Mulier and Ancillae.
MUlier vidua operosa,

nam domina ignorans gallorum horam,

The two and thirtieth Fable. The Cat and the Cock.
A Cat when she had caught a Cock,

was willing to devour him upon some just pretense,

and did object against him,

saying, that he was troublesome to men,

crying out in the night,

not suffering them to enjoy their sleep.

But he answering,

that he did that

for their profit,

that they might be called to their usual labor;

The Cat objected again,

that he was impious against nature,

by committing with his own Mother and Sisters.

But he replying,

that he did this also,

for the benefit of his Masters,

since by this they gained many eggs;

The Cat concluding,

Although you abound with pregnant reasons,

yet I will not stay long fasting;

and so devoured him.

The Fable signifies,

that a nature resolved to do mischief,

if he cannot do it by any colorable pretext,

he will act it openly.

The three and thirtieth fable. An impious man.
A Very wicked fellow,

went to Apollo at Delphos,

of purpose to try him.

Therefore taking a Sparrow in his hand,

and hiding it under his coat.

He stood next to the Tripod,

and asked the God, saying,

Apollo,

whether is that living or dead,

which I hold in my hand?

purposing,

that if he said it were dead,

he would show the sparrow alive:

but if he said he were living,

presently choking him,

he would produce him dead.

But the God knowing his malicious design,

said,

It it not in thy power,

to do what thou have a list to.

Thou do hold a thing that is dead,

and thinking to confute the God.

he showed the Sparrow dead indeed.

The Fable shows,

that no policy can deceive the Deity,

and that there is no juggling with God.

MAlignus homo,

ad eum qui est Delphis venerat Apollinem,

Itaque cum sumpsisset passerculum in manu,

volens,

ut si non spirare diceret,

si autem spirare,

continuo suffocans,

mortuu^ eum proferre.

Sed deus malitiosam ejus cognoscens mentem,

dixit,

Penes te non situm est,

utrum vis facere.

Non enim vivum contines,

and deum volens confutare,

vere mortuum ostendit.

Fabula indicat,

quod numen divinum nullis rationibus fallitur,

idque nulla res latet.

The four and thirtieth Fable. The Boy and his Mother.
A Boy having stole pins and

toys of his School-fellowes,

brought them to his Mother.

But because she chid him not,

but rather content to be the receiver;

in time growing to be a young man,

he began to steal greater matters.

But at last taken in the very theft,

he was led straight to execution.

But his Mother following,

and much lamenting,

He desired of the Hangman,

that he might speak a few words to his Mother

in her ear.

But as soon as she had applied her self to her Sons mouth,

he bit off one of her ears.

But his Mother, and others condemning him,

that he had not only played the theif,

But had been impipious to his Mother:

He made answer,

she was the Author of his ruin:

for if she had punished me,

when I had stolen pinnes,

I had not come to this point.

The Fable signifies,

that their misdeeds increase

every day more and more,

which, are not punished in the beginning.

The five and thirtieth Fable. An old woman and a Physician.
AN old woman having sore eyes,

hired a Physician:

She having made an agreement,

that if he could cure her,

that she would give him what she promised:

but if not, she would give him nothing.

Well, the Physician went upon his cure.

But every day he came to the old woman

anointing her eyes,

when she could not see that hour

for the unction,

he departed continually,

not without stealeing something or other out of her house.

The old woman saw her household stuff diminish

every day,

so as at last,

nothing was left her at all, when she was cured.

But when the Physician demanded of her

the sum agreed upon,

as from one perfectly restored to sight,

and brought his witnesses:

She answered,

Now more assuredly I see nothing.

For when my eyes were weak,

I could perceive many things in my house,

but now you affirm I can see perfectly,

I can discern nothing at all.

The Fable shows,

that evil men in what they do,

do ignorantly frame arguments

against themselves.

The six and thirtieth Fable. A Man and a Dog.
A Man provided a supper,

to entertain his friend,

and his Dog did invite another, saying,

Oh my friend, come you and sup with me!

But he, when he came,

stood rejoicing,

to behold the great preparation,

crying out in his heart,

What joy on the sudden has ravished me!

for I shall feast,

and eat my belly full at supper,

that I shall not possibly be a hungry to morrow.

While the Dog was grumbling this to himself,

and much wagging his tail,

highly confident in his friend,

as the Cook spied him whirling his tail,

this way and that way,

taking him up by the heels,

he threw him out of the window.

But after his fall, he went away howling.

Another Dog that met him in the way,

enquired,

Friend how supped you?

who answered him,

I had so much drink

more then enough,

that I know not which way I came forth.

The Fable teaches,

that we ought not to trust those,

who promise a courtesy

upon other men's charges.

Fable the seven and thirtieth. A Carpenter and Mercury.
A Man cutting wood over a River,

let fall his hatchet:

Not knowing what to do therefore,

sitting upon the bank,

he deplored his misfortune:

But MERCURY knowing the cause,

and pitying the man,

going down into the river,

brought up a golden hatchet,

and asked whether that were it

which he had lost?

But he saying that this was not it,

He going down again brought up a silver one:

But he answering,

That this was not it neither;

going down the third time,

brought up his own.

But he affirming that this was truly his own,

which was lost;

Mercury approving his honesty,

bostowed them all upon him.

The man going away,

told his fellows

all that had happened.

One of them thought

to do the like things.

And letting his hatchet fall into the River,

of set purpose,

sat down lamenting.

And when Mercury appeared also to him,

and learned the cause of his weeping;

going down in the same manner,

he brought up a golden hatchet,

and asked him,

whether that were the same which he had lost.

But he answering with joy,

Truly this is it,

the God displeased at so great impudence,

not only denied that,

but also not returned him his own.

The Fable declares,

that as much as the Divine power favors the just,

so much he is an enemy to the wicked.

The eight and thirtieth Fable. The Lion and the Fox.
THe Lion worn with age,

being no longer able

to supply himself with food [abroad]

resolved to do something by subtilty.

Withdrawing himself therefore into his Cave,

and keeping close,

he pretends himself sick,

and seizing upon those beasts that came

to give him a visit,

he devoured them.

After many beasts were thus eaten,

a Fox came to him,

having understood this his design,

and standing without the Cave,

he asked him how he did.

But he answering, Not well.

And asking him the reason

why he did not come in?

The Fox made answer,

Because I see the footsteps of many

that have entered into your Cave,

but the print of very few feet that have come back again.

The Fable shows,

that wise men foreseeing,

^ut of certain observations,

do escape great dangers.

The nine and thirtieth Fable. A Woman and her drunken Husband.
A Certain Woman had a drunkard to her Husband:

but she willing to recover him from this infirmity,

invented this stratagem.

For when she observed him overcharged with drink,

and like a dead man without any sense,

taking him up on her shoulders,

she laid him down in a vault,

and went her way.

But when she thought he was come to himself,

she went and knocked at the door of the Vault.

And when he asked,

Who is that which knocks at the door?

His wife answered,

I am come to bring some meat to the dead.

And he said, O my dear friend!

bring me not to eat,

but rather something to drink:

for you are not welcome,

if you have remembered food, and not liquor.

But she striking her breast, said,

Woe is me miserable woman!

for I have profited nothing by my policy:

for thou my Husband, art worse then thou were,

thy disease is grown into a habit,

and thou will be drunk when thou art dead.

The Fable shows,

that we ought not to dwell upon evil acts:

for a bad custom does beget a habit,

The fortieth Fable. The Lion and the Wolf.
A Lion grown old,

lay sick in his den:

All the Beasts came to visit their King,

but the Fox.

The wolf therefore taking this occasion,

accused the Fox to the Lion,

as one that did not honor their general Lord,

and therefore came not to visit him.

The Fox came in at that time,

and heard the last words of the Wolf.

The Lion therefore began to rage against him;

but the Fox desiring leave to acquit himself,

said,

And who of those that are here,

has done so much service as my self?

who have travailed through all parts,

and enquired of the Physicians a remedy for you,

and I have found it?

But the Lion commanding him presently to speak it;

he declares,

If you put on the warm skin

of a Wolf stead alive,

you shall be preserved.

The Wolf presently falling down,

the Fox laughing said,

It does not become you so to inflame our Lord to indignation,

but rather to dispose him to gentleness.

The Fable teaches,

that he that does plot constantly to hang other men,

does sometime prepare a halter for himself.

Fabula quadragesima. Leo and Lupus.
LEo cum consenuisset,

Accesserunt visitatura regem caetera animalia,

ut qui nihili faciebat suum omnium dominum,

and propterea neque ad visitationem proficisceretur.

Interim affuit and vulpes,

and ultima audivit lupi verba.

Leo igitur contra eam infremuit;

sed vulpes defensionis tempus cum petiisset,

inquit,

Et quis eorum qui convenerunt,

Luciani Dialogi Mortuorum selectiores.
Menippus and Mercury. Menippus and Mercurius. nippo ka rm.
Men. O Mercury, where be all these gay men,

and excellent beauties?

conduct me a stranger to them.


Mer. I am not at leisure,

O Menippus,

and yet look on that place,

on the right hand,

where both Hyacinthus is,

and Narcissus,

and Achilles,

and Tyro,

and Helen,

and Leda,

and all the ancient beauties.


Men. I see nothing but bones,

and naked skuls,

all alike.


Mer. And yet these are the bones,

which all your Poets have admired,

which you seem to despise.


Men. But show me Helen,

for I did not know her.


Mer. This baldpate is Helen.


Men. Were so many Ships fraught for this,

from every part of Greece,

so many Greeks and Barbarians slain,

so many Cities destroyed?


Mer. But you never saw this woman alive Menippus.

You would not have blamed your self

to have suffered misery a long time,

for such a Mistress.

Thus it is with withered flowers,

if a man look upon them when they have lost their beauty,

they will seem very unpleasant to thee.

But when they are in their flourish,

and have their glory upon them,

they are ravishing.


Men. But this I admire at Mercury,

that the Greeks understood not themselves, to suffer [so much]

for a thing of so small a continuaance,

and easily fading.


Mer. I am not at leisure Menippus,

to dispute the Philosophy with you.

Wherefore if you will choose a place,

in what part you like,

lay your self down:

I will call some more of the dead presently.


Men. O Mercuri, ubinam illi formosi sunt,

and illae formosae?

deduc me advena^ existentem.


Mer. Non otium est,

O Menippe,

tamen in hunc locum aspice,

ad dextram,

ubi and Hyacinthus est,

and Narcissus,

and Achilles,

and Tyro,

and Helena,

and Leda,

and plane veteres pulchritudines omnes.


Men. Ossa solum video,

and calvas carnibus nudas,

similes valde.


Mer. Et tamen illa sunt ossa,

quae omnes poetae admirantur,

quae tu videris despicere.


Men. Tamen Helenam mihi ostende,

non enim cognoscerem ego.


Mer. Haec calvaria est Helena.


Men. Itane mill naves propter hanc repletae sunt,

ab omni Graecia,

tam multi ceciderunt Graeci and Barbari,

tot urbes eversae fuerunt?


Mer. Sed non vidisti Menippe mulierem viventem.

Dixisses and tu sine reprehensione esse

longum tempus dolores pati,

tali pro muliere.

Si quidem flores aridos

si quis aspiciat ubi abjecerunt colorem,

informs scilicet ipsi videbuntur tibi.

Quando aute^ florent,

and habent colorem,

pulcherrima sunt.


Men. Enimvero hoc O Mercuri admiror,

si non Graeci intellexerunt se laborare

pro re adeo exiguae durationis,

and facile deflorescente.


Mer. Non otium mihi O Menippe,

philosophari tecum.

Quare ubi delegeris locum,

qua part volueris,

jace prosternens teipsum:

ego alios mortuos jam accersam.

Menippus and Cerberus. Menippus and Cerberus. nnippo ka Krbero.
O Cerberus, tell me

by the River Styx,

for I am a kinsman of yours,

a Dog as well as your self,

How did Socrates behave himself

when he came down to you?

It is very probable,

that you being a God, do not only bark,

but can speak like a man

when you please.

Cerb. At a distance he seemed Menippus,

to approach us wholly with a composed countenance,

as one that had little fear of death:

and this he seemed willing should appear,

to them that stood without the gate.

But when he perceived the vast Chasma or gaping within,

and the horrid darkness,

and that I had bitten him with my poison,

when he made a halt,

I dragged him by the heels,

he cried like a Child,

and lamented his children,

and was much distracted.


Men. He was then a jugler,

and did not truly despise the matter.


Cerb. No, but when he saw there was a necessity,

he took upon him a confidence,

as submitting to suffer

what he was compelled to,

that the spectators might admire him.

And clearly I can say thus of them all,

they are bold and valiant in their tongues,

but within their conviction is manifest.


Men. But in what manner did I appear

to approach to thee?


Cerb. The only man O Menippus,

worthy of thy honor,

and Diogenes before thee;

who entered without compulsion,

or provocation,

but voluntary and pleasant,

proclaiming sorrow to all the world beside.


O Cerbere, dic mihi

per Stygem,

Cognatus enim sum tibi,

Canis etiam ipse existens,

Qualis erat Socrates

quando descendit ad vos?

Verisimile est,

te deum non latrare modo,

sed and humano modo loqui,

quando velis.

Cerb. Procul quidem videbatur Menippe,

omnino immoto vultu accedere,

and non multum timere mortem:

atque hoc declarare voluit

iis qui extra os stabant.

Sed cum despexit intus hiatum,

and tenebras vidit,

and ego ubi memordissem cicuta,

ipsum remorantem,

dextraxi pede.

sic ut pueri flebat,

and filios lamentabatur,

and varius erat.


Men. Sophista homo erat,

and non vere contemnebat rem.


Cerb. Non, sed ubi rem necessariam videbat,

audex erat,

ut scilicet non reluctans passurus

quod ominno oportebat pati,

ut mirarentur spectatores.

Et plane de omnibus illis dicere possum,

usque ad os audaces and fortes,

sed ad interiora convictio manifesta.


Men. Ego vero quomodo visus sum

tibi descendiffe?


Cerb. Solus O Menippe,

digne tuo genere,

and Diogenes ante te;

qui non coacti intrastis,

neque impulsi,

sed spontanei ridentes,

lugere denuntiantes omnibus.

Pluto Ploton. Protesilaus Proteslao. Proserpina Persephne
Prot. O Thou Lord, and King,

and our Jupiter,

and thou daughter of Ceres,

despise not a Lovers Petition.


Plut. What do thou beg from us?

or who art thou?


Prot. I am truly Protesilaus

the Son of Iphiclus,

borne at Phylace,

a Soldier among the Graecians,

and the first man that was slain at Troy.

My suit is to be dismissed for a very small time

to live again.


Plut. Truly Protesilaus,

all dead men are at this love,

but none of them can obtain.


Prot. O Pluto,

it is not life that I affect,

but my wife:

whom but newly married,

leaving her in Bed,

I went to Sea

afterward unhappily I was slain by Hector,

at my landing:

Therefore the love of my dear wife,

O Sir, does much afflict me,

and I desire to return again,

but for a little time

to see her.


Plut. Have thou not drank

O Protesilaus

the water of Lethe?


Prot. Yes Sir,

but this was a far more weighty business.


Plut. Therefore expect her;

for she will come hither in time,

and you shall not need to go to her.


Prot. But I have not patience to tarry,

O Pluto!

you have been your self a lover,

and know what love is.


Plut. But what good will it do you

to live again for a day,

to repent a little after?


Prot. I am confident I can persuade her

to come to you:

So that for one dead,

in a little time you shall receive two.


Plut. These things cannot be done,

nor ever were done heretofore.


Prot. Let me put you in remembrance Oh Pluto!

You gave back Eurydice to Orpheus,

upon the same score,

and you sent my Cousin Alcestes,

to gratify Hercules.


Plut. But have you a mind,

being such a naked and deformed skull,

to appear before your beautiful Bride?

and how will she look upon you,

not being able to know you again?

I know she will be frighted,

and fly from you,

and then you will make a pilgrimage back to no purpose.


Pros. Therefore Oh my Husband,

do you remedy this,

and entreat Mercury,

as soon as Protesilaus comes into the light,

upon the stroke of his wand,

to make the young man as beautiful,

as he was when he came forth of his bride chamber.


Plut. Since Proserpine does consent

securing his return,

make him a bridegroom.

But look you remember,

that you have but one day.


Prot. O Domine, and Rex,

and noster Jupiter,

and tu Cereris filia,

ne despicite postulationem amatoriam.


Plut. Tu vero qua re indiges a nobis?

aut quis es?


Prot. Sum quidem Protesilaus

Iphicli filius,

Phylacensis,

commilito Graecorum,

and primus mortuus ad Ilium.

Rogo dimissus ad breve tempus,

reviviscere iterum.


Plut. O Protesilae quidem,

hunc amorem omnes mortui amant,

caeterum nullus eorum consequatur.


Prot. O Pluto,

non vitam diligo,

sed uxorem:

quam recens nuptam,

in thalamo relinquens;

abii navigans,

deinde infelix sum occisus ab Hectore,

in descensu navis:

Igitur amor conjugis

non me mediocriaffligit domine,

and volo descendere rursus,

vel ad modicum,

visus ab illa.


Plut. Non bibisti

O Protesilae

aquam Lethes?


Prot. Equide^ o domine,

res autem illa long gravior erat.


Plut. Itaque expecta;

veniet enim illa aliquando,

and nihil te ascendere oportebit.


Prot. Sed non fero moram,

O Pluto!

amasti and ipse aliquando,

and nosti qualis res amor sit.


Plut. Porro quid te juvabit

unum diem revixisse,

paulo post eadem lamentaturum?


Prot. Credo me persuasurum

and illam sequi ad vos:

Itaque pro uno,

duos mortuos accipies paulo post.


Plut. Non licet fieri haec,

neque factum est aliquando.


Prot. Revocabo in memoriam tibi O Pluto!

Eurydicen tradidistis Orpheo,

ab eande^ causam,

and consanguineam meam Alcesten emisistis,

Herculi gratificantes.


Plut. Voles autem,

sic cranium nudum existens and deforme,

pulchrae illi sponsae apparere?

quomodo and illa contuebitur te,

neque dignoscere valens?

Timebit sat scio,

and fugiet te,

and incassum tantam viam redieris.


Pros. Ergo o mi vir,

tu etiam hoc medicare,

and Mercurium jube,

postquam in luce Protesilaus fuerit,

ubi percusserit virga,

juvenem statim pulchrum efficere ipsum,

qualis erat ex thalamo prodiens.


Plut. Quando Proserpina consentit

reducens ipsum,

fac sponsum.

Tu autem memineris

unum accepisse diem.

Diogenes, Mausolus. Diogne, asolo.
Diog. YOu, man of Caria,

why are you so insolent,

and desire to exalt your self above us all?


Maus. For the vastness of my Empire, O Sinopian,

who have commanded all Caria,

And tamed many of the Lydians.

I have conquered some Islands,

and invaded as far Miletum,

reducing many parts of Jonia under my dominions.

I was also beautiful and tall,

and valiant in fight.

But that which is most famous of all,

In Halicarnassus I have a most sumptuous Sepulcher,

above any other of the dead,

so curiously wrought,

with Men and Horses exactly carved,

to beautify it,

with the highest of curiosity,

all of rich stone,

such as no man can find a temple to compare with it.

Do not thou think,

that I boast justly for this magnificence?


Diog. For your Empire say you?

and your beauty?

and the dignity of your Tomb?


Maus. Jupiter knows, for these.


Diog. But my gay Mausolus,

neither is that strength any longer your own,

neither is that beauty surviving:

for if we choose any man to be judge

touching beauty,

I cannot see for what reason

your sconce should be preferred to mine.

They are both bald and naked,

and our teeth grin alike;

our sight is vanished,

and our flat noses snuffle alike upwards.

But your Sepulcher and precious stones

are to be seen

among the Halicarnassians,

and ambitiously boasted to strangers,

that indeed there is such a gallant pile amongst them.

But oh my gallant Sir,

I see not what you enjoy from it,

unless you will say,

because you carry a greater weight then we,

whiles you lie under the pressure of such heavy stones.


Maus. Are all these things things then unprofitable to me?

and are Mausolus and Diogenes equals?


Diog. Not equals excellent Sir, by no means.

For Mausolus shall groan,

with the remembrance of those things upon earth,

wherein he placed his felicity.

But Diogenes shall laugh at him,

and say the Monument at Halicarnassus,

was built at the charges of his wife Artemisia, and his Sister.

But Diogenes knows not truly,

whether his body have a burial, or no,

nor is he at all troubled at it.

But he has left a fame behind him,

amongst the best men,

of one that lived a life worthy of a man,

taller then your mighty structure,

(O thou abject Carian)

and built upon a more solid foundation.


Diog. HEus tu Car,

quamobrem insolescis,

and omnibus nobis anteponi vis?


Maus. Propter regnum quidem O Sinopensis,

qui rex fui universae Cariae,

imperavi etiam Lydis quibusdam.

Insulas aliquot subegi,

and Miletum usque invasi,

pleraque Joniae in potestatem redigens.

Et pulcher eram and procerus,

and bello fortis.

Sed quod maximu^ est,

In Halicarnasso sepulchrum habeo maximum impositum,

quale non alius mortuus,

neque sic elaboratum,

equis and viris exactissime effictis

ad pulchritodinem

ad summam curiositatum,

ex lapide pulcherrimo,

quale neque templum inveniat aliquis facile.

Nonne tibi videor,

just propter haec magnifica super bire?


Diog. Propter regnum dicis?

and pulchritudinem?

and gravitatem sepulchri?


Maus. Per Jovem, propter haec.


Diog. Sed O formose Mausole,

neque robor amplius tibi illud,

neque pulchritudo inest:

si enim aliquem eligamus judicem

de pulchritudine,

non possu^ dicere, cujus rei causa

tuum craniu^ praeferatur meo.

Utraque pariter calva and nuda,

and dentes similiter oftendimus;

oculis privati sumus,

and nares simi redditi sumus.

At sepulchru^ quidem and pretiosi lapides

ostendi possunt

Halicarnasseis,

and ambitiose jactari erga hospites,

quod scilicet magna aliqua structura est apud ipsos.

Tu autem o egregie,

non video quam utilitatem capias ex eo,

nisi hoc dicas,

quod onus gestas quam nos majus,

a tam magnis lapidibus oppressus.


Maus. Inutilia igitur mihi sunt illa omnia?

and pares erunt Mausolus and Diogenes?


Diog. Non aequales o praeclarissime.

Mausolus enim ingemiscet,

memor eorum quae super terram,

in quibus se foelicem putavit.

Diogenes autem irridebit eum,

and sepulchrum quidem in Halicarnasso dicet suum,

ab Artemisia conjuge and sorore constructum.

Diogenes autem ignorant quidem,

si corpus sepulchrum habeat,

neque curae ipsi erit illud.

Famam autem de seipso reliquit,

apud excellentissimos,

ut qut peregerit vitam viro dignam,

excelsiorem tuo sepulchro,

(Carum abjectissime)

and in firmiore loco constructam.

Simylus, Polystratus. Smulo, Polstrato.
Sim. ARe you come O Polystratus at last,

are you come to us?

I think almost one hundred years old?


Pol. Above fourscore and eighteen Simylus.


Sim. But how have you lived these thirty years after me?

For I left the world,

when you were about threescore and ten.


Pol. Most sweetly,

although this may appear strange to you.


Sim. Strange indeed,

if being both old and infirm,

and beside without any children,

you could indulge your self with things of this life.


Pol. The rather Sir,

I could do any thing:

for I had many fine lads,

and my delicate lesses,

and my unguents,

and my wines with a flavor,

and my tables above the Sicilian luxury.


Sim. This is news.

I knew you very parsimonious.


Pol. But I had plenty of all choice things

from other men:

And duly every morning

many waited at my gates,

and afterward I was presented with gifts of every kind,

the fairest of all the world.


Sim. Did you reign after me Polystratus?


Pol. Not so:

but I had an infinite many lovers.


Sim. You lovers at that age,

with two brace of teeth in your head?


Pol. Yes, the greatest men of the City

were proud to court me,

old as I was,

and bald as you see,

and bleer-eyed,

and full of rheum;

and happy was he

among them all,

I could but smile upon.


Sim. Did you like Phaon

transport some Venus from Chios,

And she after, upon your Petition, granted you

to be young,

and fair, and lovely again?


Pol. Not so, but in the condition I was,

I was very lovely.


Sim. You talk riddles.


Pol. But this love is often manifest

to men that have no children,

and rich old men.


Sim. Now I understand your beauty admirable Sir,

it was from your golden Venus.


Pol. However, I received no small benefit from these sweethearts,

almost idolized by them.

But I carried my self high,

and sometime excluded some of them.

Then were they at a contention

which should exceed the other,

in their affection to me.


Sim. But at the last,

How did you dispose of your wealth?


Pol. Truly I did in public declare,

that I would make every one of them my heir.

And every one swallowed the belief,

and became more obsequious to me.

But having the other true instruments of my will, I left them,

bidding sorrow to all men.


Sim. Whom did those last tables declare your heir?

One of your Kinsmen?


Pol. No, by Jupiter,

but a handsome young Phrygian,

whom I had lately bought.


Sim. Of what age, Polystratus?


Pol. Near upon twenty.

And yet he was more worthy then they,

to be my heir,

though he were a Barbarian,

and ignoble:

whom now the very grandees Court.

He therefore, was my heir,

and is now registered among the Patritians,

with his Chin shaved,

and talking barbarously,

but more renowned then Codrus,

and more lovely then Nireus,

and reported more wise then Ulysses himself.


Sim. I care not,

let him be General of all the Grecian Armies,

if he will,

but let not them be his heirs alone.


Sim. VEnisti tandem o Polystrate,

and tu ad nos?

annos puto non multo pauciores centum vivens?


Pol. Octo supra nonaginta o Simyle.


Sim. Quomodo autem vixisti hos triginta annos post me?

Ego enim obii,

circa septuagesimum te existente.


Pol. Suavissime,

licet and tibi hoc insolitum videbitur.


Sim. Novum quidem,

si and senex and infirmus,

sine liberis insuper,

laetari iis quae sunt in vita poteras.


Pol. Primum quidem,

omnia poteram:

insuper and pueri elegantes erant multi,

and mulierculae delicatissimae,

and unguenta,

and vinum odoriferum,

and mensae supra Si culas.


Sim. Nova haec.

Ego te valde parcum sciebam.


Pol. Sed affluebant mihi bona

ab aliis:

and mane quidem

multi ad januas veniebant,

post autem, omnis generis mihi dona adducebantur,

ex omnibus partibus terrae pulcherrima.


Sim. Regnasti o Polystrate post me?


Pol. Minime:

sed amatores habebam infinitos.


Sim. Tu amatores, id aetatis,

dentes quatuor habens?


Pol. Imo optimates civitatis

valde laetabantur colentes me,

senem and calvum ut

vides existentem,

lippientem insuper,

and muco plenum,

and beatus erat

quemcunque ipsorum ego

solum aspexissem.


Sim. An tu, sicut Phaon,

aliqua^ Venerem e Chio transvexisti,

Et deinde tibi oranti dedit

juvenem esse,

and pulchrum denuo and amabilem?


Pol. Nequaquam, sed talis existens

valde amabilis eram.


Sim. Aenigmata loqueris.


Pol. Atqui manifestus hic amor est crebro,

erga liberis carentes,

and divites senes.


Sim. Nunc teneo tuam pulchritudinem, o admirande,

quod ab aurea Venere fuit.


Pol. Caeterum non exigua ab amatoribus percepi commoda,

tantum non adoratus ab illis.

Sed efferebam me saepius,

and excludebam aliquos ipsorum interdum.

Illi autem certabant

and mutuo se superabant

erga me studii contentione.


Sim. Tandem igitur,

quomodo deliberasti de possessionibus tuis?


Pol. Palam equidem dicebam,

unumquemque ipsorum haeredem relicturum.

Quisque autem credebat,

and adulantiorem exhibebat seipsum.

Sed alias veras testamenti tabulas illas habens, reliqui,

plorare omnibus dicens.


Sim. Quem igitur ultimae illae haeredem habuerunt?

An aliquem ex consanguineis?


Pol. Non per Jovem,

sed adolescentem aliquem formosum Polystrate?

recens emptum.


Sim. Quot natum annos circiter, o Polystrate?


Pol. Fere circiter viginti.

Tamen long illis dignior

haereditate^ capere,

licet Barbarus,

and vilis:

quem jam and ipsi optimates colunt.

Ille igitur haeres fuit meus,

and nunc inter patritios numeratur,

subrafus quidem mentum,

and barbare loquens,

Codro autem nobilior,

and Nireo formosior,

and Ulysse prudentior dictus esse.


Sim. Non mihi curae est,

and dux sit exercitus Graeciae,

si ita videtur,

illi autem non haeredes sint solum.

Diogenes, Diogne. Alexander, lxandro.
Diog. What Is this?

And are you dead Alexander, like one of us?


Alex. You see Diogenes: nor is it any wonder,

if being a man I am mortal.


Diog. Therefore Ammon told a lie,

saying that you were his Son;

it seems you were the Son of Philip.


Alex. Questionless the Son of Philip,

^or I had not dyed,

^eing the Son of Ammon.


Diog. But the like was said of Olympias,

That a Dragon mixed with her,

and was seen in her bed,

and that you were so begot.

But Philip was deceived,

supposing that he was your Father.


Alex. I heard these things as well as you,

but now I am sensible,

that neither my mother,

nor the Ammonian Prophets

spoke any thing of truth.


Diog. But yet their lies O Alexander

were an advantage to you

to advance your business:

for many were terrified

out of the belief that you were a God.

But tell me prithee, to whom did you leave

this so mighty Empire?


Alex. Diogenes I know not,

for I had not time enough

at my death,

to determine any thing about it,

but only that,

I gave a ring to Perdiccas.

But why do thou laugh Diogenes?


Diog. What should I do else,

when I call to mind

what Greece did,

flattering you, when you took upon you the Kingdom,

and choosing you their defender,

and Champion against the Barbarians,

and some adding you

to their twelve Gods,

and building Temples,

and making Sacrifices,

as to the Son of the Dragon?

But tell me,

where did the Macedonians bury thee?


Alex. As yet I lie dead in Babylon,

this being the third day.

But Ptolemy of my life guard promises,

when he shall be at leisure

from the tumults now on foot,

that he will translate me to Egypt,

and there I shall be buried,

one of the Egyptian Gods.


Diog. Shall I not laugh O Alexander,

seeing thee dote in these infernal shades,

and hoping to be made Anubis or Osiris?

But O thou most divine thing,

do not cherish such a hope:

for neither is it possible,

that any of those should return,

which have once passed the lake,

and come within the gulf:

neither is Aeacus so careless,

or Cerberus so contemptible.

But this I would feign learn from thee,

how thou do take it,

when you remember

what happiness you forsaking upon earth,

came hither?

the Squires of your body,

and your guards,

your men of state,

and so much gold,

the Nations adoring you,

Babylon and Bactra,

your mighty wild beasts,

your honor and pomp,

your riding in public triumph,

your head bound with white Ribbands,

attired in Purple robes.

Do not those things sad your heart,

when they come back to your memory?

Do thou weep fool?

your wise Aristotle taught you not

to think these things of Fortune permanent.


Alex. Wise [say you?]

he was the most impious flatterer of men.

Give me leave to know only what Aristotle did,

what large boones he asked me,

what he had by letters,

how he abused my ambition

about learning,

flattering and commending me

now for my feature,

saying, that this was a part of beatitude:

then for my exploits

and my treasures:

for this he thought was a blessing,

that he might not blush o Diogenes,

like a Cheater and Jugler

when he took them.

But this fruit I had from his wisdom,

to lament the loss of those excellent things

which you repeated but even now.


Diog. But do you know what to do?

I will teach you a cure for your sorrow.

Because here grows no Hellebore,

drink the water of Lethe,

taking it in with an open mouth,

and drink again,

and often:

So shall thou leave off

to mourn for these blessings of Aristotle.

But I see Clitus and Callisthenes,

and many other rushing in upon thee,

to tear thee in pieces,

and punish thee

for those things thou have done to them.

Therefore sneak this other way,

and drink often, as I told thee.


Diog. QUid hoc?

Et tu mortuus es o Alexander,

sicut nos omnes?


Alex. Vides o Diogenes:

neque mirum,

si homo existens mortuus sum.


Diog. Igitur and Ammon mentiebatur,

dicens ipsius te esse filium;

tu vero Philippi eras nempe filius.


Alex. Philippi certe,

neque enim obiissem

Ammonis existens filius.


Diog. Atqui de Olympiade similia dicebantur,

Draconem permixtum illi,

and visum esse in lecto,

deinde sic te genitum.

Deceptum autem Philippum esse,

putantem se esse patrem tuum.


Alex. Et ego audiebam haec sicut tu,

nunc autem video,

quod neque matter,

neque Ammonii Prophetae

quicquam sanum dixerunt.


Diog. Sed mendacium eorum o Alexander

non inutile tibi fuit

ad negotia tua:

multi enim perterrebantur,

Deum esse te credentes.

Caeterum dic mihi,

cuinam reliquisti

tantum imperium?


Alex. Nescio o Diogenes,

non enim erat mihi sat spatii

moriendo,

statuere aliquid de illo,

quam unum illud,

annulum tradidi Perdiccae.

Caeterum quid rides o Diogines?


Diog. Quid enim aliud facerem,

quum memini

quaenam faciebat Graecia,

adulantes tibi accipienti imperium,

and defensorem eligentes,

and ducem contra Barbaros,

and quida^ annumerantes te

duodecim diis,

and templa aedificantes,

and sacrificantes,

ut Draconis filio?

Sed dic mihi,

ubinam te Macedones te sepelierunt?


Alex. Adhuc Babylone jaceo mortuus,

tertium hunc diem.

Pollicetur autem Ptolemaeus satelles meus,

si quando vacaverit

a tumultibus praesentibus,

in Egyptum deducens me,

ut ibi sim sepultus,

unus Aegyptiorum deus.


Diog. Non ridebo Alexander,

videns te Orco adhuc desipientem,

and sperantem Anubin vel Osirin fieri?

Caeterum o Divinissime,

ne speres haec:

Nec enim fas est

aliquem eorum asscendere,

qui semel trajecerunt paludem,

and intra hiatum devenerunt,

Nec enim neglige^s est Aeacus,

Aut Cerberus contemptibilis.

Haec porro libenter discerem,

quomodo fers,

ubi cogitas

quantam felicitate^ super terram deserens,

venisti huc:

Corpotis custodes,

and satellites,

satrapas,

and aurum tantum,

and nationes adorantes te,

Babylonem and Bactra,

magnas feras,

honorem and gloriam,

conspicuum esse equitantem,

revinctum vitta alba caput,

purpurea vest indutum fibulata.

Annon contristent haec,

in memoriam venientia?

Quid ploras fatue?

neque te haec sapiens Aristoteles docuit,

putare haec stabilia esse, quae sunt fortunae.


Alex. Sapiens,

adulatorum omnium ille scelestissimus?

Sine me tantum Aristoteiis facta cognoscere,

quanta petiit a me,

quanta per literas mandaret,

quomodo abutebatur mea ambibitione

circa eruditionem,

adulans and laudans

nunc quidem ob pulchritudinem,

dicens, quod hoc esset pars beatitudinis:

nunc autem ob actiones,

and divitias:

hoc enim beatum putabat esse,

ut non verecundaretur, o Diogenes,

praeftiagiator and vafer,

accipiens.

Caeteru^ hunc fructum percepi ex ejus sapentia,

triftari tanquam propter magna bona

quae numerasti paulo ante.


Diog. Sed nosti quid facies?

remedium tibi doloris subjiciam,

Siquidem hic Helleborus non nascitur,

tu Lethes aquam bibe,

hiante ore attrahens,

and rursus bibe,

and saepius:

Sic cessabis

contristari propter Aristotelis bona:

Caeterum Clitum illum video and Callisthenem,

and multos alios in te irruentes,

ut te discerpant,

and poenas repetant a te

ob ea quae fecisti illis.

Itaque altera tu hac via vade,

and bibe saepius, ut dixi.

Zenophantes, enophnte, Callidemides, Kallidemde.
Zeno. But oh Callidemides!

how came you dead?

Truly I a Parasite to Dinias,

was choked with eating too much,

you know it well,

for you were present at my death.


Call. I was there Zenophantes:

but mine was an unexpected accident.

You were acquainted with old Pteodorus.


Zen. The rich man that had no children,

with whom I observed, you did very much converse?


Call. That very man I did always court,

promising my self,

that he would dye for my advantage.

But when it happened not, after a long expectation,

having outlived old Tithonus,

I found a compendious way to the inheritance:

for having bought a poison,

I persuaded his Cup Bearer,

as soon as Pteodorus should call for drink,

and he drank stoutly;

when he poured wine into his cup,

to have the poison ready,

and give it him:

and if he would do this,

I swore to make him a Freeman.


Zen. And what was the event?

for you tell me a strange story.


Call. When we came from bathing,

the young man had two cups ready,

one for Pteodorus with poison,

and the other for me,

by what mistake I know not,

he gives me the poison,

but to Pteodorus that without poison.

Then he drinks,

but I presently fell down dead,

in stead of him.

Why do you laugh at this Zenophantes?

Certainly you ought not to jeer your friend.


Zen. You have suffered quaintly oh Callidemides.

But what said the old man to this?


Call. At first he was somewhat troubled

at the unexpected accident,

but afterward understanding (as I suppose) the matter,

he laughed,

and the Cup Bearer at what he had done.


Zen. Surely you need not have put your self upon such a straight:

he would have come to you by the common road more safely,

though he had not come so fast.


Zeno. TU vero Callidemides,

quomodo mortuus es?

Ego quidem parasitus Diniae,

plus justo cum manducassem, suffocatus sum,

ut nosti,

aderas enim morienti mihi.


Call. Aderam o Zenophantes:

porro mihi quid inopinatum accidit.

Nosti and tu Ptoeodorum senem.


Zen. Illum sine liberis divitem,

quo te plurimum videbam conversantem?


Call. Illum ipsum semper colebam,

promittens,

ipsum meo bono moriturum.

Sed cum ea res in longum proferretur,

and plusquam Tithonus senex vireret,

compendiosam aliquam viam ad haereditatem inveni:

siquidem cum emissem venenum;

pocillatori persuaferam,

statim ac Ptoeododorus posceret bibere,

bibit autem abunde;

ubi meracum infudisset in calicem,

paratu^ habere venenum,

and tradere illi:

si autem hoc faceret,

liberum juravi me dimissurum eum.


Zen. Quid igitur accidit?

valde enim aliquid inexpectatum dicturus videris.


Call. Ubi loti venissemus,

duos jam adolescens calices paratos habens,

hunc quide^ Ptoeodoro habentem venenum,

illum autem alterum mihi,

deceptus nescio quo pacto,

mihi porrigit venenum,

Ptoeodoro vero veneno carentem tradidit.

Tum ille quidem bibit,

ego autem statim extense jacebam,

supposittius pro illo morrtuus.

Quid hoc rides o Zenophantes?

Certe non oportebat viro amico illudere.


Zen. Lepida quidem o Callidemides, passus es.

senex autem quid ad haec?


Call. Primum quidem nonnihil turbatus erat

ad subitum eventum,

deinde, intelligens, (puto) quod factum erat,

ridebat,

and ipse ea quae pocillator fecerat.


Zen. Enimvero neque te ad illud compendium oportebat divertere:

venisset tibi per viam regiam securius,

licet paulo tardior fuisset.

Ajax, Aa. Agamemnon, gammnon.
Aga. IF you like a mad fellow have killed your self Ajax,

and tear us all to pieces,

why do you rail upon Ulysses?

And would not a little before look upon him,

when he came hither to consult the Oracle,

nor would vouchsafe to speak to him,

your old fellow-soldier and friend,

but in a proud posture passed by him.


Ajax. It was but just, O Agamemnon,

for he was the cause of my madness,

the only man that did contend with me for the armor.


Agam. Would you have a victory without an enemy,

and without any dust?


Ajax. Yes, in that matter,

for that armor was my own,

being my cousin germans;

and you that were much before him,

declined the contention.

But this son of Laertes,

whom I often rescued,

endangered to be cut in pieces by the Trojans,

would presume to excel me,

and pretend his more just title to the arms.


Ag. Lay the blame then, oh noble Sir, upon Thetis,

who, when she should have given the succession of the armor to thee,

as being his kinsman,

but bringing them, she laid them down in the middle.


Aja. No, I only accuse Ulysses,

that durst oppose me alone.


Agam. It is to be excused Ajax,

if being a man,

he be ambitious of honor,

the most excellent thing,

for which every one of us

would engage any danger;

the rather, when he overcame you (afterward)

and that by the judgment of the Trojans.


Ajax. I know who she was that condemned me;

but it is sin to speak ill of the Deities.

Therefore oh Agamemnon,

I can do no other then hate Ulysses,

though Minerva her self should countermand me.


Aga. SI tu insaniens o Ajax teipsum occidisti,

and nos membratim concidisti,

quid tu accusas Ulyssem?

and paulo ante neque aspicere eum voluisti,

cum venisset huc consulturus Oraculum,

neque alloqui dignatus es,

virum commilitonem and amicum,

sed superbe grandi incedens gressu praeteriisti.


Ajax. Jure o Agamemnon,

ille enim mihi furoris extitit auctor,

solus mecum judicio contendens pro armis.


Aga. Velles autem superare absque adversario,

and absque pulvere?


Ajax. Certe, quoad talia,

propria enim mihi erat armatura,

consobrini cum esset;

and vos alii long praestantiores,

detrectastis certamen.

Hic autem Laertae filius,

quem ego saepius servavi,

periclitantem concidi a Trojanis,

praestantior me esse voluit,

ut qui dignior armis potiretur.


Aga. Accusa igitur o generose Thetin,

quae, cum deberet successionem armorum tibi tradere,

utpote cognato,

sed afferens in medium deposuit illa.


Ajax. Haudquaquam, sed Ulyssem,

qui mihi solus opposuerit.


Aga. Venia danda est o Ajax,

si homo cum esset,

gloriam appetit,

rem dulcissimam,

pro qua and nostru^ unusquisque

periculum adire sustinet,

quandoquidem and te vicit,

idque apud Trojanos judices.


Ajax. Novi eam quae me condemnavit;

sed nefas est dicere aliquid de diis.

Igitur o Agamemnon,

Ulyssem non odisse non possum,

non si ipsa Minerva mihi hoc imperet.

Menippus, nippo. Chiron, eron.
Men. I Have heard o Chiron,

that when you were a God,

you desired to dye.


Chi. You have heard a truth o Menippus,

and I am dead as thou see,

when I might have been immortal.


Men. What desire of death possessed you,

a thing generally displeasing to all?


Chi. I will tell thee, seeing thou art a wise man.

I was no longer delighted with immortality.


Men. Was it not pleasant to live and behold the light?


Chi. Not, O Menippus:

for I call that pleasant,

which has variety and not a simple thing.

But when I was always living,

and enjoying the same sun, light, and food,

and the same hours return,

and what other things are made,

every one in his order,

as it were chained

one upon another,

I was surfeited.

For true pleasure consists not

in the constancy of a thing,

but altogether in the change, or variety.


Men. You say well Chiron:

but how do you like these things below,

since you chose to come higher?


Chir. Not amiss Menippus:

for the equality is general,

and there is no difference

to be in your light, or in the dark.

Beside we are sensible of no hunger nor thirst,

as above,

but we are not wanting all those things.


Men. Take heed Chiron you contradict not your self,

and that your tongue falter not in the same thing.


Chir. Why do you say this?


Men. Because if the likeness of things, which are in our life,

and the same things bred a satiety,

since here all things are alike,

the same dislike will be upon you,

and there will be a necessity to seek out some change,

and from hence to escape into another life,

which I think is impossible.


Chir. What shall one do then Menippus?


Men. It is my opinion,

and men do say,

he that is a wise man will acquiesce,

content himself with his present condition,

and think nothing insupportable.


Men. EQuidem audivi Chiron,

quum deus esses,

appetiveris mori.


Chi. Vera audivisti o Menippe,

and mortuus sum ut vides,

cum mihi licuerit immortalem esse.


Men. Quaenam mortis cupido tenebat te,

rei vulgo inamabilis?


Chi. Dicam tibi non imprudenti.

Non erat mihi amplius jucundu^ immortalitate frui.


Men. Non suave erat viventem, lucem tueri?


Chir. Nequaquam o Menippe:

nam jucundum, ego esse arbitror

varium quoddam, and non simplex.

Ego autem semper cum viverem,

and iisdem fruerer sole, luce, cibo,

eaedem horae recurrerent,

and quae fiunt omnia,

ordine unumquodque,

tanquam subsequentia,

alterum aliud,

satietas me cepit eorum.

Voluptas enim non est

in perpetuitate rei,

sed in permutatione omnino.


Men. Been dicis Chiron:

verum quo animo fers haec quae apud inferos,

posteaquam huc potiora eligens contulisti?


Chir. Non injucunde Menippe:

aequalitas enim valde popularis est,

and res nihil habet discriminis,

in luce esse an in tenebris.

Caterum neque esurire oportet, neque sitire,

ut supra,

sed non egentes horum omnium sumus.


Men. Vide o Chiron ne incurras in teipsum,

and in idem tibi oration recidat.


Chir. Quomodo hoc dicis?


Men. Quoniam si similitudo eorum semper quae in vita erant,

and quod idem tibi fastidio fuit,

and cum hic itidem similia sint omnia,

satietas similiter tibi fuerit,

and oportebit quaerere aliquam mutationem,

and hinc in aliam vitam,

quod puto impossible.


Chir. Quid igitur faciat quis o Menippe?


Men. Quod puto,

and homines dicunt,

sapientem acquiescere,

and contentum esse praesentibus,

and nihil eorum intolerabile arbitrari.

Charon. Mortui. ron. Nekro. Mercurius. Menippus. rm. nippo. Charmoleus.
Lampichus. armleo. Lmpicho. Damasias. Crato. Damasa. Krton. Philosophus.
PHilsopho. Rhetor. tor.
Char. HEar in what condition your affairs stand,

we have but a small boat,

as you see,

and that rotten,

and very leaky,

and if it be inclined on any side,

it will be overturned.

And you throng many together,

every one bringing many things with him;

and if you come aboard on this fashion,

I fear you will afterward repent it,

especially as many as cannot swim.


Mor. What shall we do then to have a safe passage?


Char. Why, i will tell you,

you must all come abord naked,

leaving all your superfluous things ashore,

the boat will hardly receive you then.

And therefore it shall be your care Mercury,

to take none of them at present,

that shall not be naked,

and has not cast away his furniture,

as I told them.

Therefore standing near,

take notice of them,

and take them in,

but compel them all to strip.


Merc. (...) say well,

^e will do so.

Who is the first?


Men. I am Menippus.

But behold Mercury,

my wallet and my staff

are thrown into the lake,

and I took a good care to bring no cloak.


Merc. Get up O Menippus,

most excellent man,

and take the first seat,

next your Pilot highest,

that you may oversee all.

But that handsome man, what is he?


Char. Charmoleus of Megara the lovely,

whose kiss was bought for 2000 talents.


Merc. Put off that beauty,

and your lips together with those kisses,

and that long hair,

and that rosinesse upon your cheeks,

and all your smooth skin.

It is well,

you are fit,

now enter.

But he with the purple robe

and a Crown,

that looks so big,

what are you?


Lamp. I am Lampichus Prince of the Geloans.


Mer. Why do you come hither,

having so many things upon you, Lampichus?


Lamp. Does it become a Tyrant, Mercury,

to come naked?


Merc. Not a Tyrant,

but a dead man without doubt,

therefore away with these things.


Lamp. Behold, my treasure is thrown away.


Mer. And your pride too, O Lampichus,

and your high looks:

they will overcharge the boat if they come in.


Lamp. But let me reserve my Crown and my Robe.


Merc. By no means, you must quit them too.


Lamp. Be it so, what else?

You see I have parted with all.


Mer. And your cruelty,

your madness,

your disdain,

and your anger,

they must all go.


Lam: Behold, I am now naked.


Mer. You may now ascend,

But you thick and brawny Sir, what are you?


Dam. I am Damasius the wrastler.


Merc. You seem no less.

I know you very well,

having seen you often in the wrestling places.


Dam. It is so, Mercury,

but now receive me naked


Merc. Not naked oh my famous Sir,

entrenched with so much flesh;

you must down with that too,

for you will sink the boat,

if you put but in one foot,

but you must part with those Girlands,

and your Panegyricks.


Dam. Now behold I am perfectly naked as you see,

and equal to the rest of the dead.


Mer. So it is better to be light,

therefore get up:

And you Crato,

lay aside your riches,

and your effeminacie,

and your pleasure,

neither bring any of your Epitaphs,

nor the honor of your predecessors,

leave your pedigree,

and your glory,

and if at any time,

the City has declared you their assertor,

and inscriptions upon your statues,

and built you any glorious monument,

discover it,

for these memorialls will overlade us.


Crat. Though I be not very willing,

yet I will throw them away:

for what shall I do?


Merc. Strange!

you that are in armor,

what would you?

why do you carry this trophy?


Crat. Because I am a Conqueror Mercury,

and have done gallant things,

and the City has honored me.


Merc. Lay down your trophy.

In the shades there is peace,

and no need of arms.

But that reverend man,

as I guess by his habit,

that is so proud,

and looks so superciliously,

and full of thoughts,

what is he?

he that has the long beard?


Men. It Is some Philosopher Mercury,

Rather an impostor full of his cheats,

wherefore strip him too,

you will observe hid many ridiculous things.

under his cloak.


Merc. Put off your Cloak first,

and afterward the rest.

Oh Jupiter!

what a luggage of pride he carries?

what ignorance, contention,

vainglory, and hard questions,

sharp discourses,

perplexed sentences,

much unprofitable pains,

not a few extravagancies, and toys,

and disputes about nothing:

By Jove he has both gold and pleasure,

and impudence, and anger,

and delights, and softness:

for they stand discovered to me,

though you obscure them never so much.

Discharge your lying,

and your arrogance,

and to think your self better than others,

for if you bring all these into a boat,

what vessel with five oars in a seat will receive you?


Phil. Therefore I resign them all,

because it is your command.


Men. But let him quit his beard Mercury,

it being heavy and bristled, as you see,

the heirs weigh three pound at least.


Merc. You say well, come, off with these.


Phil. (...) shall be the ^arber?


Merc. Menippus with a Ship-axe shall dispatch it,

and make use of the Ship ladder for a block?


Men. No Mercury: give me but a saw,

there will be more sport in it.


Merc. The axe will serve.


Men. Look, thou show more a man,

having parted with the stink of it.

Shall I pare a little from his eyebrows?


Merc. ^^^is, for they advance upon his brow.

I know not why exalting himself.

What Is this?

do thou weep wickedness?

and shrink at death?

Come therefore ascend.


Men. He has one thing heavy

under his arm.


Mer. What Menippus?


Men. Flattery Oh Mercury,

which has been very advantageous to him in his life.


Phil. And you Menippe cast off that liberty,

and your confident talk,

your jollity, jour generosity,

and your laughter,

you only deride all others.


Merc. By no means:

but take these things,

light, and easy for Carriage,

and fit for navigation.

But you Rhetorician,

leave your mighty loquacity,

Antitheses, and adequation of words,

your periods and your Barbarismes,

and your other overcharge of words.


Retor. See I cast them away.


Merc. It Is well done.

Now, loose the Cables,

let us hale up the ladder,

weigh the Anchor,

Hoist sail.

Look to the Helm Ferryman.

A fair passage to us:

why do ye lament fools?

and you most of all you Philosopher;

that lost your beard so lately?


Phil. Because oh Mercury I thought,

the Soul had been immortal.


Men. He lies,

they are other things afflict him.


Merc. What are they?


Men. Because he shall not have such costly suppers,

nor going out in the night,

undiscovered to any,

muffling his head in his Cloak,

he shall walk the round about the wanton houses,

and in the morning cousening the novices,

he takes money for his temperance.

These are his vexations.


Phil. And are not you troubled Menippus to dye?


Men. How should that be?

that made have to death,

without any invitation?

But while we are talking,

I hear a noise,

as it were of some crying from the earth.


Merc. It Is so Menippus,

and not from one place.

But some gathering in multitudes,

are all laughing aloud

for Lampichus death,

and his wife is taken by some women,

and his young Children,

are persecuted with many stones,

by boys.

(...) acclaime to Diophantus the Rhetorician,

at Sicyone,

reapeating a funeral oration

for this Crato,

and there the Mother of Damasias howling,

leads the lamentation of the women

for Damasias.

But none weep for thee Menippus,

you lie most quietly of all the rest.


Men. Not so, Mercury.

Not you shall hear the Dogs anon

howling miserably over me,

and the Crows whipping themselves with their wings,

when they come together to bury me.


Merc. Thou art generous oh Menippus.

But now we are come to land,

go you to the seat (...) justice,

keeping straight that way,

I and the Ferryman will fetch others.


Men. I wish you a good voyage Mercury,

let us go forward.

Why do ye stay?

you must receive your judgments,

and the torments they say are mighty.

wheels, and vultures, and stones,

for every man's life shall be laid open.


Char. AUdite quomodo se res habeant vestrae,

parva nobis navicula est,

ut videtis,

and putris,

superflua haec omnia in littore relinquentes,

vix enim etiam sic capiat vos navigium.

Tibi igitur o Mercuri curae erit,

deinceps neminem recipere eorum,

qui non nudus erit,

and supellectilem abjecerit,

ut dixi.

Prope autem navigii scalam stans,

recognosce ipsos,

and assume,

nudos ascendere cogens.


Merc. Been dicis,

atque sic faciemus.

Primus ille quis est?


Men. Menippus ego.

Sed ecce Mercuri,

pera mea and baculus

in paludem projecta sunt,

pallium autem neque attuli, benefaciens.


Merc. Conscende o Menippe,

vir optime,

and primum locum habe,

prope gubernatorem in summo,

ut omnes intueri possis.

Pulcher autem ille, quis est?


Char. Charmoleus Megaricus amabilis,

cujus osculum duobus talentis emptum erat.


Merc. Exue igitur istam pulchritudinem,

and labia cum ipsis osculis,

and comam illam promissam,

and illam in genis rubedinem,

adeoque totam cutem.

Been habet,

expeditus es,

jam ingredere.

Ille autem purpuream vestem indutus

and diademate redimitus,

truculentus ille,

quisnam es?


Lamp. Lampichus Geloorum tyrannus.


Mer. Quorsum venisti huc,

tam multa habens Lampiche?


Lamp. Tyrannum oportebat o Mercuri,

nudum venire?


Mer. Nequaquam Tyrannum,

mortuum autem certe,

itaque depone haec.


Lamp. Ecce tibi divitiae proiectae sunt.


Merc. Et superbiam projice o Lampiche,

and fastum:

gravabunt navigium, si coincidant.


Lamp. Sed diadema permit me habere and vestem.


Merc. Nequaquam, sed and illa demitte.


Lamp. Ita fit, quid amplius?

omnia enim dimisi, ut vides.


Merc. Et crudelitatem,

and dementiam,

and contumeliam,

and iram,

and haec omnia mitte.


Lam. Ecce tibi nudus sum.


Merc. Jam conscendas,

Tu vero crassus and carnosus, quis es?


Dam. Damasias Athleta.


Merc. Certe videris.

Novi te admodum,

in pulaestris saepe videns.


Dam. Ita est o Mercuri,

sed recipe me nudum.


Merc. Non nudum, o optime,

tot carnibus vallatum;

quare exue illas,

etenim submerges scapham,

alterum pedem imponens solum,

sed and coronas has abjice,

and praeconia.


Dam. Ecce tibi nudus, ut vides vere sum,

and aequalis caeteris mortuis.


Mer. Sic praestat levem esse,

itaque ascend

Et tu Crato,

depone divitias,

and mollitiem insu per,

and voluptatem,

neque sepulchralia affer,

neque majorum dignitates,

relinque and genus,

and gloriam,

and si quando,

te civitas declaravit vindicem pro meritis scilicet,

and statuarum inscriptiones,

and magnum sepulchrum extruxerunt,

dicito,

gravabunt enim haec si memorentur.


Crat. Non volens quidem,

abj. ciam tamen:

quid enim faciam?


Merc. Papae!

tu qui armatus es,

quid vis?

quare hoc trophaeum fers?


Crat. Quia vici o Mercuri,

and res praeclaras gessi,

and civitas honoravit me.


Merc. D^mitte in terra trophaeum.

Apud inferos pax est,

and nihil armorum opus erit.

Venerabilis autem ille,

quantum ex habitu conjicio,

superbiens,

and supercilia attollens,

qui in curis est,

quis est?

qui promissa^ barbam habet?


Men. Philosophus aliquis o Mercuri,

Impostor potius, praestigiaru^ plenus,

quare and hunc exue,

videbis enim multa ridicula occultata

sub pallio.


Merc. Depone tu habitu^ primo,

deinde and haec omnia.

O Jupiter!

quantam superbiam circumfert?

quanta^ignorantia^,

and contentionem,

inanem gloriam, and interrogationes difficiles,

sermones spinosos,

sententias perplexas,

inutilem laborem valde multum,

and deliria non pauca and nugas,

and de rebus nihili disputationes!

Per Jovem [secum fert] and aurum, and voluptatem,

and impudentiam and iram,

and delicias and mollitiem:

non enim me latuerunt,

licet multum occultes illa.

Depone mendacium,

and arrogantiam,

and putare te esse aliis meliorem,

quod si rebus his omnibus ingrediaris,

quaenam quinqueremis te capiat?


Phil. Depono igitur omnia,

quia sic jubes.


Men. Sed hanc barba^ deponat, o Mercuri,

gravem and hirsutam, ut vides,

capilli sunt trium minarum minimum.


Merc. Been dicis, depone and hanc.


Phil. Quis abradet?


Merc. Menippus, accipiens nauticam securim, abscindet illam,

and scala navali pro fulcro utens.


Men. Non Mercuri: sed serra^ mihi trade,

magis enim ridiculum hoc erit.


Merc. Securis sufficit.


Men. Euge, humanior nunc appares,

ubi deposuisti illius faetorem.

Vis detraham paru^ ex superciliis?


Merc. Maxim, nam has super frontem etiam attollit.

Nescio quare erigens seipsum.

Quid hoc?

etiam ploras senex?

and mortem refugis?

Conscende igitur.


Men. Unum adhuc gravissimum habet sub ala.


Mer. Quid Menippe?


Men. Adulationem o Mercuri,

quae multum in vita fuit illi utilis.


Phil Et tu igitur, o Menippe, depone libertatem,

and loquendi fiduciam,

laetitiam, generositatem,

and risum,

solus enim alios rides.


Merc. Nequaquam:

sed habeto illa,

levia and portatu facilia,

and ad navigationem utilia.

Tu autem Rhetor,

depone tanta^ verborum loquacitatem,

Antitheses and verborum adaequationes,

periodos and barbarismos,

and alia verborum pondera.


Rhetor. En jam abjicio.


Merc. Been habet.

nunc solve funes,

scalam attollamus,

anchora attracta esto.

Pande velum.

Dirige clavu^ Portitor.

Been sit nobis,

quid ploratis stulti?

and maxim Philosophus tu,

paulo ante barba spoliatus?


Phil. Quia putabam o Mercuri,

animam esse immortalem.


Men. Mentitur,

alia videntur illum contristare.


Merc. Quaenam?


Men. Quia non amplius tam opiparas coenas habebit,

neque noctu exiens,

omnes latens,

pallio caput involvens,

prostibula in orbem lustrabit,

and mane decipiens juvenes,

pecuniam accipiet ob sapientiam.

Haec contristant ipsum.


Phil. Et tu o Menippe non gravate fers quod mortuus sis?


Men. Quomodo?

qui ad morte^ properavi,

nemine vocante?

Sed interea dum loquimur,

clamor aliquis auditur,

sicut quorundam a terris clamantium.


Merc. Sic est Menippe,

non ab uno loco.

Sed illi in coetum convenientes,

laeti rident omnes

propter Lampichi mortem,

and uxor ejus a mulieribus comprehenditur,

and liberi nuper admodum geniti,

crebris feriuntur lapidibus,

a pueris.

Alii extollunt Diophantum Rhetorem,

in Sicyone,

orationes funebres recitantem

pro hoc Cratone,

ibique Damasiae matter ejulans,

inceptat lamenta cum mulieribus

propter Damasia^.

Te autem nullus o Menippe deflet,

tu tranquillus jaces solus.


Men. Nequaquam o Mercuri.

Sed canes paulo post audies,

ululantes miserabiliter super me,

and corvos verberantes se alis,

quando convenientes sepelient me.


Merc. Generosus es o Menippe.

Sed quandoquide^ trajecimus,

vos quidem abite foru^ judiciale,

rectam illam viam progredientes,

ego and Portitor alios accersemus.


Men. Been navigate, o Mercuri,

progrediamur and nos.

Quid igitur moramini?

Judicari oportebit,

and poenas dicunt esse graves,

rotas, vultures, and lapides,

oftendetur autem uniuscujusque vita.
