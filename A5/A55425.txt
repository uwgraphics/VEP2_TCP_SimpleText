The Old Man's VVISH.
^ IF I live to grow old, (for I find I go down,) let this be my Fate, in a
^ Countery Town; Let me have a warm House, with a Stone at the
^ Gate, and a cleanly young Girl to rub my bald Pate; May I
^ govern my Passion with an absolute sway, and grow wiser and
^ better as my Strength wears a -- way, without Gout or Stone by a
^ gentle decay, By a gen -- gen-tle de-cay.
2.
In a Country Town,
by a murmuring Brook,
The Ocean at distance
on which I may look;
With a spacious Plain
without Hedge or Style,
And an easy Pad Nag
to ride out a Mile:
May I govern my passion*
with an absolute sway,
And grow wiser and better
as my strength wears away,
Without Gout or Stone,
by a gentle decay, etc.
3.
With a Pudding on Sunday,
and stout humming Liquor,
And Remnants of Latin
to puzzle the Vicar;
With a hidden Reserve
of Burgundy Wine,
To drink the Kings Health
as often as I Dine.
May I govern my passion, etc.
4.
With Plutarch, and Horace,
and One or Two more
Of the best Wits that lived
in the Ages before.
With a Dish of roast Mutton,
Not Venison, nor Teal,
And clean (tho course) Linen
at every Meal;
May I govern my passion, etc.
5.
With Courage Undaunted
may I pass my last day,
And when I am Dead,
may the better sort say,
In the Morning when sober,
in the Evening when mellow,
He Is gone, and has left
not behind him his fellow.
For he governed his passion
as his strnegth did decay,
And grew wiser and better
as his strength wore away;
Without Gout or Stone,
by a gentle decay, etc.
Sold by N. T. at the entrance into Old Spring Garden at Charing Cross.
