The Married-mans best Portion: Or, A new Song plainly setting forth the
Excellency, and incomparable Worth of a good Wife, as also how much Happiness
does continually attend upon that Man that enjoys her.
To the Tune of, Fancies Phoenix.


A Among those worldly Tores, of which
Men equally may have their share,
Where of the Poor as well as Rich
most commonly possessours are:
The great^st happiness I find,
Is that which comes from Women kind:
There is no comfort in this life,
Like to a constant loving Wife.
A vertu^^s wom^n does excel
^^^ richest Treasure of the Earth,
(...) can find her parallel.
(...) set her pra^ses forth:
(...) Phonix very rare,
(...) past compare.
(...) is no comfort, etc.
(...) is happy in his choice
(...) such a one is wed,
(...) ch^^rfulness rejoice,
(...) he so well has sped,
He has his portion with the best,
that with a virtuous wife is blessed,
There is no comfort, etc.
How sweet a sight it is to see,
a married Pair so truly joined
In perfect love, that though there be
two Persons, yet there is but one mind:
Such Couples do enjoy content,
And in true peace their lives are spent.
There is no comfort, etc.
A virtuous woman evermore
her husbands pleasure does fulfill,
She treasures up his love in store,
and always strives to do his will,
She gives consent to what he says,
When he commands, then she obeys.
There is no comfort in this life,
Like to a constant loving Wife.


SHe uses not abroad to rome,
amongst the Gossips idle Crew,
But careful is, and stays at home,
With diligence her work to do,
Her Family she will direct,
And give her husband due respect.
There is no comfort in this life,
Like to a constant loving wife.
She Is wary, and she is provident;
and often saves what others loose,
By right forecasting the event.
she well does know which way to choose,
Accordingly her course she steeres,
And daily orders her affairs.
There is no comfort, etc.
If that her husband fault does find
with any thing that is amiss,
As soon as ere she knows his mind,
she rests not till it mended is,
His love does all her pains requite,
And in the same she takes delight.
There is no comfort, etc.
When he with sickness is ^^prest,
or any ways cast down wit^ grief,
She suffers not her heart to (...),
till she has gained (...) some releif:
When he does mourn, then she is sad,
When he rejoices, she is glad.
There is no comfort, etc.
If sometimes for a little space,
his business calls him forth from home,
She greatly longs to see his face,
and often wishes he would come:
His presence gives her full content,
His absence she does much lament,
There is no comfort, etc.
She will not vary in the least
from what at first she seemed to be,
Her constancy shall be encreast,
but not diminished one degree,
Her husband she has vowed to love,
And she to him will faithful prove,
There is no comfort, etc.
Thus having set before your e^es,
in Caracters right plai^ (...),
A virtuous woman's qua^^ties,
^
Choose such a (...),
My ^ords will all (...) be.
There is no comfort in this life,
Like to a constant loving wife.
