Roger L' Estrange.

TO THE Right Honorable Sir John Robinson, Knight and Barronet, Lieutenant of
his Majesty's Tower of London.
Honored Sir,
FAme, which is the Worlds Herald, having proclaimed Your honor with his
Golden Trumpet in the Maeanders of all men's Ears, and every place Ecchoing with
Your rare encomiums, hearing this, these did call upon me to fly unto You, with
my winged Devotion to serve You, and become the least of the least of Your
devoted Servants. Therefore I make bold to Dedicate these Rude, Barbarous and
Unpollisht Essays and Characters unto Your Honor.

Right Honorable, do with these as that great Persian Emperor Xerxes, who
accepted with a kind Aspect, and loving Respect, a Cup of Water presented to
him by a poor man, with both his hands

I confess that they rather deserve to be disowned then owned; because they
may lay a blot on the door of Your Innocence; because they are delivered from
my Pia Matter, in such Adulterate and bastard Phrase: I have Essayed and tried
to Characterize every man, but I have Characterized none so clearly as I have
done my self, in showing mine Ignorance, Folly and Imbecility: These are Iron
or Leaden Essays, yet being Coined with Your Image, and having on them Your
Inscription, they will go current with all that beholds them.

Worthy Sir, Do not esteem me a Gnatho, for what I speak, I think, but all that
I think, I cannot speak.

Quid enim nisi verbis inane. Essays and Characters, are as so many Peculums,
mirrours and Glasses, wherein one may see every one clearly and perspicously,
but these Glasses unless they be gilded by such a Mercury, as you are with
Silver Aspects, what reflection will they have? None can see any thing in them,
no more then in Looking-glasses, with out Silvered on the one side.

Sir, If You look with a kind Influence, with the two radiant Stars of Your
Eyes upon me, frozen in the frigid Zone of Fear, then I shall rejoice; but
contrary if You scortch me with the flagrant flames of Your Anger, then You
will melt me into Tears.

Pardon (Great Sir) pardon my Audacity, in Presenting this little Pamphlet unto
You, who am a stranger; but my reason is, that I would show my good will to,
and highest esteem of such Famous and Virtuous men; I therefore cast them and
my self at Your Honors Feet; Accept of them if You please, reject them if they
do displease, they are not worth presenting, much less worth receiving; What
shall I say more? look I pray You for no profundity of matter, no Rhetorical
Flusculations, no witty Inventions; but for a few plain Essays, mean
Characters, and meaner Language, and think the Author meanest of all, Vtra
Posse non est esse, no man can do no more then he can: but be pleased to
consider, they were every one written Extempore, and therefore by reason of
other Studies; I had no time or very little to Study and Write them over; but
according to my good will, I pray you Gracious Sir) accept them, and do not
intercept my weak endeavors, my poor Labors, and my painful Pains: But in
the Scales of Justice, allow me grains of allowance, and do not scruple at them.

But I draw to a Conclusion, and to a beginning of my Work too; but the Gate
ought not to be Great, when the City is so little; I crave leave, And

Remain Your Honors Devoted Servant, Samuel Person.

TO THE Critical READER (if any such there be.)
IF thou ask what pedantick Fellow is this, that presumes to intrude upon the
paper Stage, my responsal is, that (being not at age, I need not Answer for my
self, yet to give thee some satisfaction which is more then I owe thee, my
reason is, that I come upon this Paper-Stage to act that part, which thou
actest upon the Worlds Theater, viz. the Fool; But thou art not so much Worthy,
that I should tell thee my Name; Suppose it be John a Nokes, Nicholas Nemo, or
the Man in the Moon, what is that to thee? Spit thy Gall, vomet up thy Spleen,
I care not; I have given thee as black a Character as thou can give me; I
have Gall in my Ink, as well as thou have, I know thou will find nothing but
Errates in my Book; it is pity but that thou should have been a Corrector of
the Press; Thou think 'its good fishing in troubled waters, and thou art
for nothing but Carps, and do with the Elephant trouble the clearest streams
(although these are none such) least they should reflect thy ugly Visage; This
is thy Doze or Pill; But though I am made ex quercu to thee, yet to the
Courteous Reader, I am formed ex salice, entreating them to be as Popes (though
I would not have them Papists) to give me pardon, if they see any faults (as
these cannot be without) remembering Venus has her Mole, Helen and Phaebe her
spots, and none can expect so many written Assayes without a blot, Humanum est
errate; My unripe years might also Apologize for me; but I pass, and have past
them over; I did at first intend that they should have seen no more light then
my window, but by reason of Friends importunity, I am made unwillingly willing,
and therefore if thou be trapt in loosing thy time, in reading of them, say
nothing, others may be irretiated and entangled in the same gin, and if they
deserve not to be read, thou may give my Book a Super sedendum; and if it
should but cause other young Striplings to emulate or to Ape the same; I am
contented, if thou see my weakness, thou have more need to pity and help me
up, then quite to deject and cast me down; There is charity in the former,
malice in the latter; But I must not stay thee no longer from thy peregrination
over all my Living Regions; If thou please to be a Peripatetick here (I care
not whether thou be a Philosopher or no) I wish thee a good Journey, and so
Farewell.

An Anatonical Lecture of Man.
Character of a Character.
IT is an Hyerogliphick, a little Enchiridion that Ensphears much, like Homers
Iliads in a nut shell, or the Chariot and Horses curtained with the wing of
Myrmicedes Fly; It may be termed a Chrystaline Mirror or Looking-Glass,
wherein every man may see his Face; a stigmatizing Iron to those that are bad,
branding them with a black Theta, the worst characteristical letter that may
be, and also it will be an R. in their credit; but like the Planet Mercury, its
good with the good, and bad with bad, it will set a glorious glore upon the
virtuous, but an ignominious mark upon the vicious; it makes the former petty
Proebus's, and their virtues are like those twinkling winking eyes that
attracts all other to behold them; for when as virtuous man sees himself
delineated, he by and by accounts himself another Felix. Policrates and
Narcissus-like, falls in love with himself, and that fair face of virtue he saw
in the forementioned myrrour; But when the virtuous man's Antipode vir, a wicked
one studies Optics and Glances into this Glass that reflects his true Shape
and Effigies, he will be fit to do with this, as the deformed woman did with
her Looking-Glass, who broke it and made it a multiplying one, because she saw
such a Spectrum as through her self, and by that means reduplicated her
deformed Face and Image, and made her a Janus faced Monster, just thus will he
be served, who out of his Vatinian hatred to Images (being conscious of his
fair one) will despise those that are reflected by this Speculum; A Character
is the Picture or Draught of each person, it has not only the signatura rerum,
but also, Personarum stamped upon it; it is the Counterpane of Natures Book,
and also of each Individuum; the Mark or Badge that every man has, by which he
may be known, it alters with a man as ( Gemurists say) the Turmois in a ring
looks well or ill as with him, the umbra or shadow which continually follows
him, and is his concomitant; they may be termed petty Chronologies or
Chronicles, the impress and token that is stamped upon each man, his Nature,
Dispositions, and Qualities are here known; the pulse by which you may know
whether well or ill with him; a Microcosmography or a Map of man, the Anotamy
of the Soul, which rips up men's Qualities, as old Democritus did Beasts in his
Garden at Abdera, and there sees within them; a kind of Legitimate augury that
looks into the intestines of things, then it may be called the hand in the
dyal, that points at each one its mimical, that imitates all things Cynical,
that carps at all things Scomical, that derides all things with the forenamed
Philosopher; It is a Tautological echo, a greater blab then Patto, they are
the Registers that put all things upon Record, the Diurnal that tells News of
such and such men, and gives notice in what State and Condition things are; no
dumb Mercuries, but give intelligence, yea and understanding too; to the Reader
they are not Flesh-marks, but infallible symptoms of things and persons; it may
properly be Baptized a man's Zodiac, for in it are all his signs, both good and
bad, especially a bad man's Character may be named, so because there be so many
Beasts and Monsters in it, and it is his Flag, Banner, or Ensign that hangs
out, intimating what is within; Characterizing is a kind of Physiogmony, and that
which is written in the book of a man's Soul, it beholds and copies it out, and
transcribes it into another Book, in blak and white Characters, whatsoever was
inscribed, they are Hierogliphical, or Emblematical Writings (such as the
Egyptians used) that write with the (...) and (...), great and little Letters
in Natures Alphabet, rather then other Printed Letters, for here a man writes a
great deal in a little room, and so these Characters will in this sense agree
with those other Characters, called Brachigraphy, and certainly those Figures
or Letters drawn by Natures pencil, are more significant then those that are
the result of a man's fancy; Characters are like Ingenious Pictures that look at
every one, they are the Prospectives that a man should well eye, the
Weather-glasses, or Urinals in which one may take a survey of humors; It is
good for all men, good and bad, to look in these, as the Philosophers
counseled his Scholars to see themselves in their reflecting Glasses, so that
if they be Fair and Beautiful to do that which becomes them, if soul and
deformed, then to compensate it by the beauty of the internals; so let them
rectify their obliquities by the straight lines of this Copy; I would counsel
them to have (as one Antipheron thought he did,) carry their Images before them
in their sight, or else they will never obey that oracular precept, Nosce te
ipsum; but many will call the Character of some bad man, A Libel, that is, a
Bell with a lie that rings about the Country, but it is far otherwise, the
worst mischief of it is, that it is true, to conclude, a Character is every
man's Physics Epitomized, viz. his Nature; Historia animalium, it is an
harmonious clinching of diverse senses, all ending with a sweet finiall
flowrishing cloze, and relish: the word Character intimates a thing engraven,
so that it should have a deep impression upon men, and now my Character is
conceived, and brought into.

The World.
IS the (...), the Universe which contains all living things, it is the
habitation of all the Creatures, Natures Mansion House, and the receptacle of
all humane entities. The World is round, no marvel then if it be so unconstant,
so voluble, so soon turned topsy turvy, although it is a vulgar error for men
to say the World stands still and is constant, which the Famous Phylosoper
Copernicus proves nothing to be more unconstant, more frail, more giddy then
it; The World is a Center, the Heavens are its circumference, which do encircle
it, yea the World it self is a circle, and the Devil is the Conjurer in it,
men are bewitched, and are so charmed with enchantments, that they do nothing
but sleep in the bed of insecure security; That is a very good Emblem of the
frailty of the World, the World being pictured, and a hand from Heaven
holding it in a string which string is the thread of this Life, during its
Duration in the World, which when it is divided by Atropus the destinies
knife, then the World falls into an abyss of nothing, from whence it came;
and so according to that distick, Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia filo,
Et subito casu quae valuere ruunt.
All humane things hang by a slender thread,
What stands most strong, is quickly ruined.


Experience that severe Mistress, teaches us every day how unconstant, how
brittle, how unstable the World is, and what man is there now that will not
believe the opinions of the New Philosophers and Mathematicians that the World
turns round.

This World is a stage, or a theater, upon which all men come to act their
parts; Heavens are the Spectators, they fight or should fight against the
Devil, and divellish vices.

This (...), as the Philosophers calls it, is a Labirinth, and death is the
Minotaure in it, which devoures all men in its devouring jaws; but our
Heavenly Theseus will be the death of this death, and the life of our life.

The World is more filthy then the Augaeano Stable, oh! for a Hercules which
might cleanse it by letting the Alphean Rivers of Justice run through it, to
purge it from the dung of sin, and puddle of iniquity; This Structure of the
World is as an Ark swiming and floating in a Sea of Miscry deluged with floods
of iniquity; Oh there is too many unclean Beasts in it, not only whose feet
bears the Image of the Beast, the Devil, but whose Souls have upon them his
Devilish inscription; The World is round, as though it stood for a Cipher,
but in my Arithmetic it is one, though in the laughing wiseman Democritus's
account, there were plurality of Worlds, but Mundus wants the plural number.

The World by that ingeniousest of Poets Ovid, is said to have four Ages, the
first Age, was the Golden or best Age, the second the Silver Age, the third the
Brazen Age, and this last and worst Age, is the Iron Age; well may it be called
so, for so much war and so many Iron instruments of it, that it seemed as
though Mars had made the World his field of War: So here is an end of my
description of the World, though not of the World it self.

A Man,
IS by the Philosophers called a (...), or a little World, and by a witty
Characterist, the world is called a great man, and man a little World. Man is a
Map or Description of the great World, he is the World in Epitomy, man is
Natures darling; This Microcosme, is a compendium and an abridgment of the
great World. Let us peep in the cranyes of secret Anatomy, and let us symbolize
man's parts with the worlds. Man is compounded of the four Elements, viz. Fire,
Air, Earth, and Water, and so is the World a compound of these; his Liver,
Blood and Moisture, is as the Sea which sends out its streams into all parts of
the body, by little sanguine Rivers, in Violet veins, which are as so many
leaden pipes to convey his blood. Man's natural heat is his fire, his radical
moisture, his Water, his breath, blown out and in by the bellows of his Lungs,
his Air, and his Flesh is earth; but man's soul by the tenent of all
Philosophers and Christians is held to be of a spiritual substance, like to the
Angels, and his soul is the angellick intelligences, so it does move its little
orb, its body in its right course, as do the celestial inteligences or Angels,
move their orbs, every one in their proper sphere; man's body is of admirable
Architecture, Frame and Composure, but man's soul, which Ovid calls his better
part, which some brutish men makes the worst, it is as the heavens of an
heavenly existence, though his body be but as the earth. Man's reason is the sun
that shines in the Firmament of his soul, and gives light to his body, the
little world: his soul is a little heaven (as I may call it) his faculties,
viz, Fancy, Imagination, Wit, Memory, Understanding, Will, etc. are the Stars
that gives light to his lesser World. Man is the model and extract of nature,
he is all the creatures epitomized in his little copy, he is the greatest
letter in the book of nature; man's soul is endued with such exquisite
faculties, his soul can fly from one pole to another in a moment, and with this
winged motion, can ascend to the heavens in a minuite, and descend into the
abisse in an instant, and can pierce with the Lynx's eyes of his Imagination
and Fancy into the secretest places, yea and behold imaginarily, the center of
the Earth.

A man is a masterpiece, in which there are a thousand several motions, a soul
endued with such excellencies, as in one minuite, it can be in a thousand
places, mounts up to the top of the world, fadoms the universe without touching
it; which goes, glisters, sparkles, which is the great indagatrix, which
searches all the treasures and magazines of nature, which finds out all sorts
of inventions; which frames Arts, which governs States, which orders Worlds Man
is a book which he ought to dedicate to his Maker, and this man is the King,
Lord and Master of all other creatures, which man shall be an inhabitant of
heaven or hell; if he be a valiant Champion and fight his Battle on the Stage
of the World, and can say truly Caesar's three Triumphant words, Veni, Vidi,
Vici. Then he shall be an inhabitant of the Celestial Paradise, where he may
eat of the tree of Life, freely drink of the Waters of Life abundantly, and
enjoy the Tree of Knowledge eternally, when he shall know what soever is to be
known, but if he be vanquished, he may say of heaven and happiness, as one said
in another case, Vale and in aeternum Vale, farewell, and forever farewell; but
he shall be a prisoner in the subterraneal Gaol of hell, settered in chains of
darkness. The World is a Center, and men are the lines about it, he who moves
in a larger Orb, he is further from the Center of the World and nearer heaven;
but he who moves in a narrower Orb and Sphere, is nearer the earth, and further
from Heaven.

Riches are trash, and pleasures a toy,
But peace of conscience is a perfect joy.
A Wise man,
IS one of Apollo's Disciples, yea he is a second Apollo himself, his words are
Oracles, he partakes of the Serpents wisdom, and Doves innocence, the Serpent
amongst the Egyptian Priests, was an emblem of Wisdom, which does extricate
and wind it self out of the maze of troubles and dangers, and it insinuates it
self into rocks, and winds it self out again. In like manner does a wise man
wind himself out of the Labrynths of trouble, and winds himself out of the
Rocks of Error, and there finds the Pearl of Truth. This Wisdom he is endued
with, is like to that Mahumetan Dove that inspires him.

This wisdom is the quintescence of other moral Virtues; the World is a Ring,
and this divine Sapience is a Diamond in it, all other precious stones are but
glistering Pebles, spangling Fopperies; yea Vtopias toys. This this is the
Stone of Stones, Pearl of Pearls, and Jewel of jewels, a wise man is not only a
Phylosoper but a great traveller, and has encompas't the World before he could
compass this Wisdom; yea he is a Philosopher, and this Sapience is the
Philosophers Stone, that will turn all things into Gold; this Wisdom is the
Chemists Elixar that is spoken of, that will prolong a man unto Nestors age,
yea Methusalams years: O happy prolonger! that with its holy oil, will make
the Taper of man's life burn unto infinity of years, I mean it will be a means
for a man to soar to the Hyacinthian Skies, with the wings of this Eagle-like
Sapience: Wisdom is a wise man's Guardian Angel, that protects him from all
hurt: A wise man is like a Star that shines transparently in his Horison, but
wisdom or Apollo the God of wisdom, is the Sun that darts his beams into his
little Orb, and inlightens his Microcosme. It is said in natural Philosophy,
that Forma dat esse rei, but wisdom is the divine form (may I call it image)
Quae dat esse sapienti, Diogines and the Ancient Philosophers fained Wisdom,
to be in a deep pit, yea in an abyss, but who can fadom this fathomless Pit; I
doubt wisdom now a days is buried in such profound graves, but yet some of
its divine sparkles are left in some, unless Behmen the German, that Teutonick
Philosopher in his mistical or Magical, Teutonick Philosophy means, that
Wisdom is the Center of all things; I know not what his intent is; Scaliger
did think, that Wisdom did inhabit among the Rocks, (so it had better, then
live among such stocks and stones as some men are,) and that this Pearl is
there to be found, Pearl call I it, yea I rather miscall it, for all other
Pearls are but Pebels in comparison of it. Wisdom is pretiouser then the
pretiousest of Pearls, the Carbuncle is as it were, incenst in slames; that
this Pearl of Wisdom out-shines it; the Ruby, or rather the Purple Amethist
blushes, that this Ruby of Rubys should outshine it, the Diamond looks pale
for envy: Wisdom is a spell against all the worlds enchantments, an Antidote
against the poison of Vice, the all heal that will heal our distempers.
Wisdom is the milky way, its virtues are the Stars and this is the way, and
the innocent snowy path that leads to felicity: This is the Primum Mobile, that
moves the wheels of men's affections, yea makes men move every one in his proper
sphere; Wisdom in the garden of this World, is a herb that may be termed life
everlasting, yea it will make men sage; wisdom is a Chariot of fire, and
Appolo is the Phaeton, the four Cardinal virtues, viz. Justice, Fortitude,
Temperance and Prudence, are as the four horses; Prudence differs from this,
Wisdom, as it is an ethical morral, Virtue and pertains to the manners, as the
Philosophers define it: but let us define what Wisdom is; It is a divine
virtue; whereby a man knows all things to be known, sees all things, does all
things to a right end, it is the soul of souls, and it is a knowledge infused
into men's hearts, whereby a man knows all divine mysteries, searches into the
causes of all things, orders all things, wisely does all things, discreetly
thinks on all things, judiciously judges of all things, justly understands all
things rightly. It is the quintescence and extraction of all wit, the product
of all excellent judgments, the understanding of all understandings; the wit of
wits, the reason of reasons, the virtue of virtues, and all these in
perfection. This Serpentine Wisdom is the Ariadneean thread, that winds men out
of the Labyrinth of miry, and now I may cry out with the Poet.

Pinge duos angues, -- With the Egyptians (as I said before) a Serpent was the
Hyrogliphicks of Wisdom, it being one of the wisest Creatures in the World;
Wisdom is the great Rabby that teaches all its Disciples, that Sophe's, his
Angelical wisdom is a Cherubin for knowledge, or knowledge in the abstract,
knowledge it self it is a Serpent for wisdom, a Dragon that keeps the Golden
Apple of virtue in its Hesperides, it is a Cock for Vigilance, a Dove for
Innocence, a Lion for Courage and Strength, and what not? There is a story of
one of the Roman Emperors that saw a Serpent at his bed side, as it were to
defend him, so wisdom is a safe-gard to wise men; (May I say without
profaneness) that wisdom is the Tree of Life in the Paradise, or Wilderness
of this world, and that Mercury's Rod which signifies wisdom, is a twig of
that Tree that whips out folly.

O thou Divine Sapience! thou Caelestial Cherubin, descend unto us, and the
Hyacinthian Clouds shall screene thee again; I doubt wisdom has plumed its
feet, and flowne to Heaven, nothing but folly remaining on Earth; Wisdom is
a Eortress to the weak, strength to the strong, a glory to the rich, riches to
the poor, Power to the impotent; Wisdom in a man's Microsme, is the (...). It
is pictured in the form of a woman, as that Divine Plato said of virtue, so I
may say of wisdom, Could it be seen with mortal eyes, it would with its beauty
attract all eyes unto it.

Then surely, it may see well its heartsravishing form, and divine beauty
would amaze all eyes, and dazzle them with its Phaebian rays; its voice is
sweeter harmony, then the Harmony of the chiming Spears, or the Music of
Orpheus's Harp; Wisdoms, me thinks its very Name is a charm; If I were to
decipher and picture out wisdom, I would picture it full of eyes to see all
things, full of hands, to do all things, full of ear; Midas-like, ears to
hear all, and full of tongues; Apollo the God of Wisdoms streams out his
Oracles in Rivers of Mercurial eloquence; he is endued with Mercuries Golden
tongue, to speak as many Languages as that rare Linguist Mithridates. Wisdoms
is so profound, that I have not sounded its depth; its an Abyss Abyssus,
Abyssum invocat; A wise man is an Argos, his eyes keep Centry, he is so
circumspect, nothing can circumvent him, he sees and fore-sees things past,
present and to come; This Terrene Apollo is a second Solomon; A wise man is led
by reason and judgment, others by their sensual appetites, he is withheld
from vice by the chain of virtue, and this bondage is true liberty; other men's
liberty is their bondage, in sin, or bondage in comparison of this freedom; A
wise man looks at the end of things, others at the beginnings, which is a
Preposterous speculation, for as our English Proverb says, All is well that
ends well; Exitus acta probat; And as Solon said to Craesus, when he was
demanded by Craesus to judge, whether he was happy or no, for his Honor and
Riches which he showed to Solon; wise Solon shaking his Head, said to him, He
would judge whether he was happy or not, when he saw, Craesus's end, or the end
of these things; this is a wise man's practical syllogism, his Major is for
virtue, his Minor is for earth and earthly things, but his conclusion will be
Heaven and Happyness; A wise man is his own guide; his Ship is himself floating
in the Ocean of the world, he sails by Compass and keeps within compass, and
so is seldom blown and ship-wrakt against the Rocks of Adversity; neither is
blown about with the wind of vain Doctrine, nor is charmed with the Siren Songs
of vices, but sails on, neither is swallowed up in a Sylla of Misery, nor in a
Charibdis of despair, but at last arrives at the Holy Land: This Grand Sophy,
he fixes his eye of contemplation on Heaven, and cares for his Country, As
Anaxagoras the Philosopher, who being asked by his Countrymen why he cared not
for his Country, He pointing with his finger to Heaven, said, I care for my
Country.

A wise man is a Phoenix, for being burned (if a Martyr) or, when he yields to
the fates, the Son of Glory out of his ashes, will raise him again, and so the
Phenix's Motto fitts him, viz. Ex morte Imortallibus; A wise man is a good
Physician, for out of Poisonous things he can bring out wholesome Medicines; He
(with Promotheus) flies to Heaven, to steal this Heavenly fire of wisdom to
inspire his lumpish clay, and also to warm and refresh him in the winter of
Adversity, when the Storms and Tempests of Affliction do not breath into him
the breath of life, but storms him to death; he waits upon the goddess Occasio
and tempus, he rides upon times flying wings, his actions may be examples;
When the Rivers of Affliction would deluge his little world; wisdom is the Ark
that saves him from drowning, and as the saying is, it keeps his Head above
water; nay, when he is in a Sea of misery, sorrow, and grief, like the
devouring Leviathan, would swallow him up, and hurry him down into a Gulf of
woe, then he is like the many eyed Lamprey who sets his eyes as so many
Watchmen, dives and swims out, and at last arrives at the Pacifick Sea, after
he has been floating in a Turbulent Ocean of Misery. A wise man is an
Arithmetician, for he has learnt the Golden Rule of Wisdom; He has obeyed the
Grecian Sophyes injunction, Nosce te ipsum, and has studied Vossuis's Book de
Cognitione Sui.

A Fool,
IS Diametrically opposite to a wise man, The Poles are not further distant
from one another, then a wise man is distant from a Fool; a Fool is one of
Simplicius his Offspring. A Phylosoper says, A Fool may be known by these
three things; 1. By his Talk, 2d. By his Clothes, 3d. By his Cate or walking;
for his Speech bewrayes what he is; A Fool is a Mute, when he should be a
Consonant, and a Consonant when he should be a Mute; so me times he is so
loquar, talkative, that you would think he were all tongue, and other times he
is so silent, that you would think he is an Egyptian that Sacrificed to the god
Harpocrites, and had lost his tongue, and he is dumb with silence.

Then for his Clothes he wears them so fantastically in such a fashion, nay
rather out of fashion, that they are ensigns of his folly; And lastly, for his
Gate, swinging both his Arms as though he would cast them away, and as a dog
goes many wast Journeys, so does he.

A Fool is a mere Animal, though not Animal sociabile; He is no more useful to
his Generation then the fifth wheel is serviceable to a Chariot; A Fool is
Natures Hiroclite. He is sent into the World to make up the Order of the
Universe, but he does rather disorder it; A Fool is Thema Simplex, he differs
from a beast only in shape; yea and that he has understanding, and reason in
Potentia; yea but the chief difference is Resibilitas, for by his laughing too
much he is differenc't from other men, whatsoever he apprehends, he will do it,
per fas aut nefas, be it right or wrong, and this simplex apprehensio spoils
him; yea he comes not so far as Discursus.

It is the opinion of most Philosophers, that by reason of the indisposition of
the Organs men become fools; alas, folly misbecomes them, and this
indisposition of his Organs is the cause why there is such bad harmony, nay
rather such discords in his thoughts, words and actions; He has wisdom in
Potentia, folly in Acta: The definition of a fool, may be that of Heaven, Est
corpus simplicissimum, and he wilders himself in a wilderness of trouble, and
so becomes an Individuum vagum; A Fool is an Intelligible Ass; It is a hard
thing to tell where his reason and understanding is, whether it be in Sr.
Thomas Moors Vtopia or not; If he be a Shepherd, then his mind, wits, runs a
wool gathering, he commonly busies himself about de lana Caprina; A Fool, is
Natures Antipode, he does always contrary to it: He is so missed by the Ignis
fatuus of his imagination, and wanders up and down in a maze of folly, in the
Meanders of trouble, and Tabrinth of perplexities; yea he is sick of the
Apoplexy, besotted in a Lethargy, and may make the eighth sleeper; he proves
the best of any, that man's life is a dream, for he is always asleep; but he
never dreams of these things, viz. what he came into the World for, nor of
Death, Judgment, Heaven, or Hell, etc.

The World (as I said before) is a Stage or Threatre, and he acts his part,
viz. The Fool in the play, he is come into the world to make one, though I
think he stands but for a cipher; Let me speak a Sarcasmos Mundo, he is sent
into the World to be an Emblem to mock other men that account themselves wise,
and shows what indeed they are, though in specie, in show they be other wise,
and his foolish actions are the mocking of most men's business, he laughs at
other men's folly, and men deride his foolishness, he laughs men loudly to
scorn: I have read a witty feigned story in Lucian, where Charon was Conducted
by Mercury to a high place, it may be Glympus, where he might see all the world
at once; Mercury would needs know of him what he observed: He told him he saw a
great Multitude of People, their Habitations like Molehills, the Men as
Emmetts, he could discern Cities, as so many Hives of Bees, wherein every Be
had a sting, and they did naught else, but sting one another, some
tyrannizing-like Hornets bigger then others, some like filching VVasps, others
like lazy Drones, over their heads was hovering, a confused number of
perturbations, Hope, Fear, Anger, Avarice, Ignorance, etc. and a multitude of
Diseases hanging, which they still pulled on their heads; some were Brawling,
some were Fighting, Riding, Running, Solicit ambientes Calidelitigantes for
toys and trifles, and such momentary things. Their Towns and Provinces mere
Factions, Rich against Poor, Poor against Rich, Nobles against Artificers, they
against Nobles, and so the rest; In Conclusion, he Condemned them all for
Madmen, Fools, Idiots, Asses, O Stulti quaenam haec est amentia? O Fools, O
Mad Men, he exclaims, Insana studia, insani labores, etc.? Mad endeavors, Mad
actions, Mad foolish, Mad Oseclum insipiens and infacetum, a giddy headed age.
Heraclitus the Philosopher out of a serious meditation of men's lives fell a
weeping, and with continual tears bewailed their misery, madness and folly;
Democritus on the other side burst out a laughing, their whole life seemed so
rediculous, and he was so far carried with this Ironical Passion, that the
Citizens of Abdera took him to be mad, and sent Ambassadors to Hippocrites the
Physician, that he would exercise his skill upon him.

O if now that Cynick Philosopher Diogenes, should search with a Lantern and
Candle, he should travel as far as Drake or Candish did before he could find a
man, a wise man, such as he desired to find (with this exception) one Wise,
Honest, and just in every thousand. A Wise man is one of a thousand but one of
a thousand is scare a wise man; Suppose all the wise men were put in one scale,
and all the foolish should be put in the other scale, in which the Fools were,
would ore weigh and have the Praestat, as the Emblem is; and now in a strict
Arithmeticians account, in so many millions of millions of men, deducting all
the Fools, and then in his numeration numbering how many Wise, he would hardly
come to his thousands; But to return to him from whence I came; A Fool, if he
be a little world, surely the Sun of wisdom shines not in his Horizon, his
Orb goes all out of frame, because he has not his Intelligence to direct it in
its right Course and Sphere; Nature is only in him, and therefore he is called
Natural, and yet none more unnatural then he; A Fool is Natures Embryo, he is a
materia prima absque forma Sapientia, he is deformed, and wants that divine
form of wisdom, he is a Chaos rather then a world.

A Knowing Man,
A Learned man is a Cherubin on Earth, he does well prove that our first
Parents tasted of the Tree of Knowledge, neither does the flamings sword of
obscurities keep him from that Tree; He has Mercuries, or rather Trismegists
rod, that will whip and beat out ignorance, he is ignorant of nothing but
ignorance. We will not ascribe Omniscence to him, yet he knows all that men
can take Cogniscence of, a Learned man is a great Traveller, for he travels far
for this Pearl of knowledge, which like that Pearl will shine and give him
light in the might of Ignorance, when the glorious Sun of Knowledge is Eclipsed
by the Clouds, and Mists of Ignorance.

Monstrum horrendum ingens cui lumen ademptum. Learned men are not usually
Conjurers (though it may be some are) though they see all things in this Glass
of knowledge; The Learned man knows what to do, a Learned wise man does what he
knows; yea a learned man and a wise man commonly go together, they are Termini
Convertibiles, for the most part a Learned man is a wise man, and a wise man
usually is a Learned man, A Learned man studies to know, and labors to be
unknown; Speculation is the life of a Scholar, Practice is the life of
speculation, and Zeal is the life of Practice; I have seen wisdom Pictured
with three faces, to see things past, present, and to come; I think Learning
ought to be Pictured in like manner, and wisdom is said to be the Basis of the
world; I think learning may be said to be the basis and foundation of wisdom,
and therefore Learning is the Foundation of Foundations; These Seth's Pillars,
I mean Learning, which was engraved on them (as Josephus relates,) one whereof
was made of stone, least the deluge should wash it away, the other of brick,
that when the World is destroyed by fire it might remain; These I say are the
Pillars that uphold the world from falling into a vacuum of ignorance (as I may
call it) it being so empty of Knowledge, yea now adays, there are many
illiterate Asses that would pull down the Babel of Learning (if I may call it
so) as it reaches almost to Heaven; where is so many Languages: in these
respects it may be termed a Babel, but of this Monument and Pillar of Learning;
I may say with Martial, as when he spoke of the Roman Amphitheatre, Barbara
celarent sileat miracula Nemphis.

And now these Monuments of Learning, are rather like so many Tombs under which
Learning lies buried, and this Glorious Babel of Learning is fallen down; Oh
where is Bacon's advancement of learning if we listen, may we not hear the
Brazen Head speak these words, Time is past; unless time be past, and so we
cannot hear it, but Time was when Learning was advanced on the highest spire
and pinicle of Glory that could be, but now alas Ovids Metamorphesis is
verified about men, being transformed into ignorant Beasts, and men now adays
make nothing of learning; Of learning, there is now a sad annihilation, Minerva
is not adored, but ignorance is followed, is not Minerva the goddess of
Knowledge drowned in the Euxine Sea of ignorance, and does not Neptune bath
himself, therefore in brinish tears, in salt Seas for sorrow: A Learned man has
Lynex's eye, that he may see into the intestines of all things, he is an accute
and excellent Anatomist, for he unrips every thing, and sees Nature thoroughly;
He is a Philosoper, a good Logician, for he is rational, and all for reason; He
is an Excellent Moral Philosopher, and skilled in Ethics, but he has such
Ethical virtues in practice, as well as in speculation; He is an expert
Physician, skilled in Nature and natural Philosophy very well, and a rare
Metaphysitian where he is above Nature. A Learned man is a good Orthographer,
for he can spell right his destiny; A wonderful Arithmetician, for he can by
his reduction, reduce all things to one thing, from whence they came; as did
the Pithagoreans of old, and practices his Division, and gives every mad his
due; he is a sweet Musician, for there is such sweet harmony proceeds from his
Organs, and such Concord in all his thoughts, words and actions, every Learned
man moving in their proper Spears; Oh the harmony of these Spears, and Orbs
and besides these, he is a real Musician, one of Therpsicore, or Vterpe's Sons;
He is an Astronomer, for his eye is always fixed on Heaven, and considers
whether the Stars, Heavens-eyes look with kind aspects on the Sons of Men, and
a deep profound Astrologer, and considers the powerful working influence, and
effects of the Stars, the Caelestial torches, and an eloquent, eminent
Rhetorician, who has Mercury's Golden Tongue; another Mithridates, a Scholar
is a Geometrician, for he measures the Earth, and knows that the World is a
circle, and man's heart a triangle; therefore the world cannot fill man's heart;
He is also a Medick or Physician that can cure the sickness of the Soul, viz.
ignorance by that All-heal knowledge, and the end of other Sciences, is but the
beginning of this Science, of Sciences, viz. Divinity: For he is a Divine;
Whose object is his Maker; nay, and besides all these, he is an Exquisite
Chemist, sucking the marrow of all Philosophy, extracting out of it the
quintescence; and by his Mercury, and other Alchymistical ingredients, He makes
his Elixar, and Philosophers Stone, if possible to be made, and then he makes
his Furnaces, his Golden Indies from whence he gets his Gold, and all this is
to an excellent end, to aspire to the top of Pythagoras Y which deciphers
Wisdom, and he knows he cannot climb to it without Craesus's Golden Ladder; A
Learned Man is a Rabby that is skilled in the Oriental Tongues; This knowing
man being pollish't by Mercury, and Minerva, may become one of the tall Caedars
in the Lebanon of the Church or State, other shrubs being not fit Ex quovis
ligno non fit Mercurius: Learning to a Scholar is good Armor, Armor of proof
against the Heretical Cannons of Adversaries; yea, he is out of their Gunshot,
having drunk of the Muses Hellicon, that Spring and Fountain of Learning; He is
then as it were inspired by that Learned goddess Minerva with Heavenly fire,
and having tasted of Aristotle's Well, he detests the muddy waters of ignorance;
A learned man (with Esops fellow Servant) can do all things, not ascribing
Omnipotence to any man, but all things that a man can do.

Learning is the stamp and superscription that is coined upon learned men, and
therefore they are current, and runs with the swift Curranto's of his
imagination over the Universe; Learning is the Jewel in a Learned Man's head,
yea his Head is the Muses Storehouse, their Capitol Learning is an Ornament to
the Rich, Riches to the Poor, Power to the Potent, and what not? And now I have
given you a Description of the Learned, hear what difference that Cynick
Philosopher Diogenes makes between the Learned and unlearned, says he, As much
difference there is, as between the dead and the living, so much difference
there is between the learned and Ignorant; But I had almost forgot to play the
Astronomer about Calculating the Learned's Nativity, they are commonly brought
into the World, when Mercury is culminating, which does presage them to be
Wise, Studious, contemplative.

An Ignorant Man,
IS a mere Simplicius, he may have St Austins Confession written in Capitol
Letters about his head (after the Roman manner) with this Inscription, HOC
TANTVMSCIO, QVOD NIHIL SCIO, I only know this, that I know nothing; Ask him
any thing, and the Answer will be that Nescunt word Nescio, I know not. When an
Ignorant man is to bring his Verdict in about any thing, it will be this,
Ignoramus; Yea, he is an Ignoramus himself; ask him what he has been Reading,
he will say de nihilo, of nothing, if you draw many Interrogatories he is vexed,
and says, He knows what he knows.

Were I to picture an Ignorant man, I would paint him without eyes, for he is
blind, the eyes of his Soul, of his understanding; the chief part thereof are
blind, yea all those that wants the eye of Knowledge, may be said to be blind;
in my Judgment, the Mole would be a good Hyerogliphick of an ignorant man, for
as Naturalists say, it is blind, and always plodding and digging in the Earth,
so do ignorant men, and they with Aesops Cock in the Fable, had rather have
Corn or a little Earth, then the Pearl of Knowledge; Ignorant men are Owls
that howl for woe in a night of Misery; The Ignorant are inveloped in such
Cymmerian darkness, where the Sun of Knowledge never visits them, nor darts
its joyful Beams into the crany's of their Souls; Ignorance is a Prison, the
ignorant are the prisoners that are enchained with chains, and setters of
slavery; yea until the scales of ignorance be wipt from their eyes they will
be blind; I may say just, and justly contrary of him; what I said of a Learned
man, the Sword of obscurity keeps him from tasting of the Tree of Knowledge;
yea his knowledge afterward for want of knowledge will be a miserable
knowledge to know his misery, which a Learned man shall be ignorant of; An
ignorant man is a kind of a fool, yea he may be embarked in Barkleys Ship of
Fools: You my know what an ignorant man is by the Rule of contrary, he is an
opposite to a learned man, and I put them together, that you may see the
greater difference, according to that Axiom, Cannon or Rule in Philosophy,
Contraria juxta se opposita maxim Avecseunt; Is it not a wonder that he
objects not this; if a Knowing, Learned man know all things, then with Aesop, I
Answer, I know nothing; if he know all things, what need I know any thing; he
leaves nothing for me to know; But I Answer, one man cannot Monopolize all
Knowledge, but every man ought to have his share of it; The World is a
Wilderness, Knowledge is men's guide, now without this, they know not which way
to go, nor what to do, neither (as the saying is) do the ignorant know what is
what; An Ignorant man is unfit for all business, put to any, and his excuse
will be, I am a poor ignorant man, I cannot; yet he thinks he is an innocent
man, an Innocentius, though not a Pope; Every thing is a Riddle to the
ignorant, with every unusual thing, they are caught with an ecstasy of
admiration, and think it a miracle, so indeed it is a wonder to him; and no
wonder, he being so ignorant of Nature and Natural Causes; An Ignorant man is
one of the Worlds Herd, grunting in a dunghill of ignorance, and will never
enter into Minerva's Paradize, where is Trismegists Tree, or Rod of Knowledge;
I do not say it was a bough or twig of the Tree of Knowledge, but it has such
virtue in it, as it will be to him Lignum Sacrum, or a Holy Oak; Learning and
Knowledge is the fruit of it, its leaves or bark, are (as it were) Books as in
old time they were, out of which knowledge is gotten; It may be an ignorant man
is of the opinion of some Philosophers to think that when Souls are separate,
they know all things, and so defers his knowledge till then; This Ignoramus,
Oh! he will take heed of a book, for he thinks that will trouble his head with
knowledge; his Soul is as white paper he thinks, and not scribled with such
intricate notions of knowledge as the Learned is; He can live very well in this
Dungeon of Knowledge (as the Child that was born in a Dungeon) if he have but
meat and drink what cares he for Hellicon, or learning the food of the Soul, he
likes the Tullianum of ignorance, far better then the Sunshine of Knowledge.

A Covetous Man,
WIth ^rake, he compasses the World, or at least he desires to do so; the
world is his Zodiac, and he and his Gold makes Gemini; he may be called an
Idolater, for he worships Images; and a Papist, for he adores Pictures; He
would have been the first man that would have worshipped Nebuchadnezzar's
golden Image; Poor simple man he is said that he lived not in the Gold Age; for
then he thinks he might have gotten Gold enough, and he is sorrowful, he had
not a being in the Silver Age, but is fallen into these hard times, into this
Iron Age, last and worst times; He wishes with Midas, all were turned into
Gold, and he loves to drink of the golden waters, and his ^est drink he thinks
is Aurum potabile, and Gold is his dainty, and in these (as Apitius in his
dainty Banquets;) he places his summum bonum: A Covetous man is always for
Arecipe, and the Lawyers Terms, To Have and to Hold, are his three Principle
Tenants, but Yielding and Paying are as easily got of him, as fire out of a
flint; but by the steel, if he be a coward, he is never in a good mood, but he
is always in the Optative Mood, with an Vtinam for Silver; This greedy man
would (with Augustus Caesar) make all men Tributaries to him; A Covetous man is
the rust that sticks to his Gold; He has heard Physicians say, that Gold is
preservative, but to him it has a contrary quality, for it is destructive, Gold
is the Center of all his hopes; yea the World is the least and most that he
desires, yea pieces of Gold and Silver are the circles in which he is conjured;
these Images are laid up in fit places, and repositories, and he will never
forget them; The Crosses on his coin, are those upon which his mind is
Crucified Excruciated and tormented; Well may he be called a Papist, yea a
Pilgrim, that has so many Crucifixes and Crosses, wandering in the Wilderness
of the World; this greedy man well proves that he was made of red Earth; Adam
(...) as this Hebrew Word signifies, because he so unsatiably seeks after
reddish Earth; This Covetous man, is the Vtopians fool, as they count Covetous
men, because they adore the shining of Pearls, or Gold or Silver, when they may
see a thousand times more in the Sun or in a Star, and because he is such
reprobate Metal, himself, he thinks he had need get Gold, or else every one
would make light of him; A Covetous man makes himself more unclean then the
Augean Stable, that might Purchase the Indies; O! Gold is a Covetous man's
Paragon, he is a good Chemist, for out of his labors he extracts gold; he
rather abuses then uses money, for his money is not current as it should be,
but it is dormant; He sometimes buries his money, yea always when he dies, he
buries it in graves (who knows) but he is of opinion of the men of China, who
buries when a man dies all his Goods with him, to help him in the other World;
A covetous man is a Griffen, for he does build his nest of Gold (as Naturalists
observe the Griffens to do so) We will not give a Covetous man so much honor,
as to call him a King, because he has many Crowns; nor well guarded, because he
has so many good Angels to protect him; money is the mark he aims at; A
covetous man wishes for Democritus's plurality of Worlds; yea, and that there
should be a Platonic year, and of all books of the World, he contemns none
more then Petrarchs, de contemptu mundi, this man is a Heathen, would go to the
Elysin fields, but he will not, because Charon will have too much for Ferrying
him over Styx, and he would not go to Elysium, but he hopes there is besides
that Paradise a land of Havilah, where he can get Gold enough; and now having
Uncharacterized him, I will brand him with a black salt, is troubled much with
the Ethical vice, Avacitia, Covetousness is an Abyss, a bottomless pit, a pit
of destruction, a gulf; it is deciphered by the Poets, to be a Dog always
devouring never Satisfied. It is a vacuum, always empty, never filled, and
that which the Philosopher Democritus affirmed, De infinito vasto; that I may
say of covetousness, it expatiates its desire in Spatium Imaginarium, into
that imaginary space beyond World's Heaven, and it would find out a new
America; truly this is like to the informed and deformed beast of America.
This Covetousness, it does with men as Circes did with Ulysses companions,
transform them into Swine, and make them wallow in Gold and Silver, the red
and white excrements of the earth, and such dunghill pleasures, as it made
that Roman Emperor Caligula wallow and lie all along amongst heaps of money;
Covetousness is a Dragon, that keeps the Golden apples in its Hesperides; made
that great Emperor of Macedonia, Alexander the great weep, when he heard the
Philosopher Anaxagoras say, there was no more worlds but one, Vnus Peleo Juveni
non sufficit orbis.

You may see what an irremiable Labrynth, this covetousness is, it is a Hydra
oh for a Hercules to destroy it; it is a Lion Rampant, whose devouring jaws are
never satisfied; here what Plutarch said of Covetousness; a covetous mind
says he, is as restless in seeking, as it has pleasure in finding; as fire
is never satisfied with wood, nor earth with water; so the Avarous is never
satisfied with money; The covetous man's desire is never termin'd nor bounded
within the limits of reason; Covetousness is all hands and arms to hold and
embrace all things; A covetous man was born, when Saturn had dominion, he is so
covetous: So here is an end of this Essay of a Covetous man, and of
covetousness, and of Avarice, I wish there were a Finis.

A Free Spirited, or a liberal Man.
IS one, who is much for Plato's community of goods, and of all countries, and
form of Government, he likes Vtopia, and its community the best. He practizes
the morral, Ethicall virtue, liberallity, most he knows is speculative parts
of Ethics; morral Philosophy, is not enough for a man, unless he have the
Practick too, it is a Practical Science. He knows, what he has is distributed
to him, by the hand of providence; and he must give account of it again, and
that he is but a Steward; and therefore he with a liberal hand gives it away,
and does good in his generation. This law of nature is so deeply imprinted on
his mind; that he must do as he would be done to, that time shall not raise
it out, it being engraven in the table of his mind, and printed in the book of
his conscience, as with a pen of iron and pencil of brass with indellible
Characters. This man is surely in a good case, for he is commonly in the Dative
Case; he gives that away liberally, which he received freely, and he knows
hereafter he shall be no looser by it. A liberal man is the best Usurer, for
what he gives, it is but a lending, for he knows he shall be repaid hereafter
in better coin doubly and trebly. He is one of the most sensible members in a
body politic, for he simpothizes with others. A liberal man, is a sun that
shines bright in his horizon, and his good influence is upon every one, and
every one participates of his Golden rays, his ears are open to all Petitions;
Prayers, Supplications and Requests, and his hands is liberal to supply their
necessities. He knowns man is not made for himself, but ought to do good to one
another, though he be not Rich, yet nihil est nihil de est, he is very
merciful; Mercy has its throne in his heart; Charity is the Diana that he
worships, liberality it self seems to be his essence. A liberal man knows that
excellent Paradox, give all and have all; he is a public spirited man, he
desires, labors and endeavors more after the good of his Country then his own
private interest, It may truly be said of him as it was said of that Roman
Emperor Titus.

He is Amor and delicium aetatis, I wish there were no end of such liberal men.

A proud self conceited Man,
IS a Castril; his Liver has too much blood in it, overflown with it, for he
has a Plurifie; he had need be let blood by the Sword of Justice, and being
Anatomized, his heart will be found a great one; he swells so with the poison
of pride, that he is like to burst; he has got this plurifie by fitting in, and
being too much heated by the sun of glory; he soars up to the Clouds, being
blown up thither by the Winds of Fame. A proud man with Iccarus with his waxen
wings of pride, soars up to heaven; but the sun of righteousness, will melt
their daring wings with his fiery radiant beams; and then they must have
Icarus's his fate fink down into a sea of misery, woe and calamity.

This self conceited proud man, looks at his virtues (if he have any) with his
eyes as multiplying Glasses; and sees, rather thinks, he sees two virtues when
he has but one; if he have done a good deed, he thinks he is the tenth Worthy,
but unworthy of such a dignity, and may be registered amongst Plutarchs selected
Heroes, and that famous act Chronicled and with Augustus Caesar in this Theater
of the World, he thinks he has acted his part gallantly and deserves a plaudit.
A proud man thinks he is a Phoebus, and he would have all men Parthianlike,
worship such a sun as he is, and he thinks his virtues like stars, and when
soever he reflects upon himself, his eyes are dazzled when they look upon such a
Phaebian Transparency, Transparent splendour, and splendent glory and
brightness, which he thinks he contains in his sphere and orb; nay, more he
thinks his eyes, or the glassy humor of them after he has looked upon him, the
Sun as he thinks himself; they may be as burning-glasses reflecting his
Sun-like splendor on men to inflame their hearts with love to him, and
admiration of his glory, and glorious brightness, and bright excellency, and
excellent beauty; A proud man is a Camelion, he lives by Air, with the breath
of praise; He cannot think of his excellencies with out an ecstasy, when he
does any thing, he styles it Opus aureum, a golden work, as Erasmus colloques
were named; he has not learned the Wise man's Apothegem yet; Nosce Teipsum, but
he is a great stranger to himself.

A proud man, if he can speak two or three languages, he thinks he may compare
with Scaliger or Mithridates, for a Linguist, and thinks he has Mercuries
golden tongue; he conceits for every word that he speaks, and for every thing
that he does, he may fly upon the wings of fame and add golden feathers to it;
besides to say the truth of him, he is famous for infamy. A bladder blown full
of wind, he looses himself, when he spies what prodigious parts he has, so
indeed; it is true, he has so, for he is a Monster; he is a flattering Gnatho to
himself, he proves the best, that man's life is but a blast; he is a self
conceipted fool, and a fool in a play on the Worlds Stage, and at the end of
his Tragedy; serpentine wisdom instead of a plaudit, shall give him a hiss:
Pride is like gun powder, that blows him up to the clouds to heaven, that he
may fall as low as hell, and so pride has a fall.

A proud man, he is the second of England; if a native, he thinks he is the
man, a brave Heroic spark, a Lucifer or a bright Star in his generation; and
he sings an Euge to himself: This Weldone annimates him exceedingly, he will be
chief, aut Caesar, aut nullus; he with Caesar; will have no superior; and with
Pompey will have no equal, he thinks all his words be Oracles, and he thinks
he is a second Apollo himself, his words he esteems axioms, and would have all
men to have his words, of that authority as Pythagoras speeches was to his
disciples, Ipse dixit, all his commands must be laws; yea, and as the laws of
the Medes and Persians, that must not be altered, he has diminutive thoughts of
all other men, but he thinks he has superlative parts, though they be nothing
in comparison to others; I do not wish him a Vale, unless he will descend into
the Valley of humility, and puts to his pride an end.

A mere Physician.
A Mere Physician, is a kind of an Emperick, but is distinguished by his garb;
his Authors are Gallen and Hypocrates, yea he sometimes reads Alexis of
Piemont, or the regiment of Health; the subject of this Physic, as well as
Physics natural Philosophy, is, Corpus natural; yea, he has some skill in
Tacticks, for he feels Pulses; yea, and his speculation is an Urinal, which
Urinal is a looking to him, to see the faces of all Diseases; and though the
Patients water cannot drown them, yet with his Druggs, he will poison and
expel them: He is a Quacksalver, and Paracelsus is his Patron; his sentences
are Aphorisms; He reckons up the names of Diseases, though he cannot tell you
the nature of them; it may be he will reckon them in Greek, he cracks much of
his All-health, and other quirkes, that he has to get money. This dull
Physician is a pretty good Chemist, for out of these Druggs of his, he can
extract gold; yea, and he labors to get the Philosophers Stone, but he will
knock out his brains against it, if he have any; his practice is so much about
bodies, he never minds souls, but is all for the body, that I think is the
reason of that sharp sentence, ubi sunt tres medici duo Atheist: Where there
is three Physicians, there two of them are Atheists, and he has a sad sickness
of his soul; and now there is need of Rosse, that our Medicus may be
Medicinatus, our healer heald, and Physician cured. This Physician is of the
strangest disposition, he is sick when others are well, and when others are
fick he is well; Hierophilus, says a Physician, meaning a right learned and
skillfull one, is manus Dei, but this if he be so, is sent to hurt, rather then
to heal; Paracelsus his Author, would have Physicians to be Magitians too; I
think he has followed his masters desire, and can by his Prefisciens prevent
Witchcraft: there is a witty flout put upon Physicians, but is proper to such
Quack-salvers as he is, that they of all men can kill scot-free, and then they
cure men of all Diseases.

A Divine,
HE thunders in his Doctrine, and lightens in his conversation, he is or should
be a divine man, whose contemplation is fixed as with Eagles eyes on the sun of
righteousness, and is like the precious pearl; Afterities contains those suns
beams, and rays in it, and reflects them unto others; but is not like the
Gloe-worm, only to give light to himself; but is a shining Lamp to his
Generation: He is endued with Mercuryes golden tongue; for truly to declare his
message, he needs to have the tongues of men and Angels, and to deliver those
divine Oracles to his people; he is an Ambassador from the King of Kings unto
men, that they may become his Subjects and enjoy an heavenly Kingdom. He is a
Prophet, to prophesy, and a Priest to offer the Incense of prayer for the sins
of his people: He is a shephard, his people are a flock, the Church the fold,
he does not fleece them but feed them. First, by his good example. Secondly, by
sound Doctrine. Thirdly, subsidio vitae sustenance, which if he have it, he is
charitable to the poor, yea he reduces and brings them back from the by ways
of sin; His Longus are his bellows, that he may blow the winds of Doctrine
into them, which is the breath of life. He is a good Physician which heals the
sickness of men's souls with heavenly Balsome, and the falling sickness, when
they fall into sin; that sad Epilepsy he pores in Oil of consolation into
their wounded consciences; He shows them a nearer way to heaven then by Homers
chain, or Aquinas's aurea Catena; but his chain is, Aura Virtutum Catena, the
golden Chain of Virtues: Religion is a Chariot, and Christians are those that
bear the Yoke of this Religion and Christianity. This Chariot of Religion has
almost been overwhelmed in a Sea of blood, a red sea, in the time of those
butcherlike Emperors, but this Divine is an Aaron, and the Captain of
Salvation is our heavenly Moses, that will lead Christians, those true
Israelites out of this Wilderness of trouble; yet giving them the Heavenly
Manna, and will bring them out of this red Sea, and conduct them into their
Heavenly Canaan, after they are got out of this Egypt of the World and
Wilderness, where the Scripture, or God will be a Pillar of Fire by night to
direct them in this night of Ignorance. This Chariot of Religion will be a
fiery Chariot to convey us to Heaven, like to that of Elijahs; A Divine is a
Pillar of the Church, and one who is always hurried in the Fiery Chariot of
Zeal; He is a Cherubin for Knowledge, and a Seraphin for Zeal, as the word
Seraphin signifies, Burning, Flaming; He is sometimes a Boanerges, a Son of
Thunder to conitruate comminations and threatenings against evil doers; other
times he is a Barnabas, a Son of Consolation, He is a Good Soldier of Jesus
Christ, and a good Captain in the Church-Militant, and therefore shall be
glorified when the Church is Triumphant, when all its Enemies are under its
feet, yea, and that squattie Moon; This Divine, I say with the Silver Trumpet
of the Gospel, Summons and Alarams all Christians to come to their Spiritual
Warfare, and to Arm themselves with the Sword of the Spirit to fight against
the World, Flesh and Devil, that grand Enemy of Man, who is the Dragon that
foams out Fire and Brimstone, but our Heavenly Hercules will slay him; This
Dragon kills many with his breath, the wind and breath of False Doctrine,
breathing the wind of temptations and afflictions, and so storms poor Souls to
death; This Divine is Learned, that he may teach the unlearned, wise to teach
the unwise; He is a Merchant that has traveled over all Arts and Sciences to
the Pearl of Learning, yea, he makes his Arts to be Handmaids to wait on
Divinity, which is not the (...) but the (...) of his Studies; yea, at the end
of his Life; (with Luther) he desires his Disciples to Read his Books, Audi,
Lege Libros; Yea, his last Speeches are (as it were) his Funeral Sermons,
wherein he himself is a Spectacle of Mortality, in which they may see Death
clearly.

A Grammarian.
IS one that can spell his destiny; as well as words, yea, and he can spell it
by the accents; He puts on man's birth an Asperate; and on tender Infancy he
puts a Lene; Man's youth and manhood will have an Accuit; Old age will have a
Circumflex when they bend; and death at the end of all will have a Grave. A
Grammarian is an utter enemy to Barbarism and Solacisme, he is a very orderly
man, he puts all things in method and order, he lays the foundation of
tongues, he is a punctual man and minds all his stops, he uses more then
Lypsian curiosity in his pronunciation, which other Nations deride; He puts all
things into good Syntax; and surely he is a peaceable man, for he is all for
concord; A Gramarian would have Women to be Supines, and himself to be in the
Genitive case, in Casu gignendi, if he be one of Pluto's Troops, or be skilled
in Ovids de Art Amandi; all books that are not punctual about Orthography, nor
the Language not linked with the Cords of good Syntax, whose Sentences are as
Nero said Senaca's was, to make ropes without sand; These Books he says,
deserve to be put in Pantagruells Library, or bound with Tartaretus de modo
cacandi,

A Grammarian whose Art, viz. Grammitica, consists of four Pillours, First,
Orthography; Secondly, Etymology; Thirdly, Syntax; Fourthly, Prosodia: First,
For Orthography, Cato's discerning-eye, could not descry a knot, sooner then he
will perceive his Orthography corrupted; Secondly, for his Etymology, he will
slice words in twain, and mince them so long, until he finds out the root he
diggs for, he abstracts all compounds, and at last he comes to Simples, he runs
from one thing to another (as the Pythagoreans did to find a Deity) from whence
came this word from, that from whence that, until he comes to the Theme and
Radix he trases words; And for Syntax, whosoever does not tie his speech with
its ties, he wishes a rope were about his neck, (...) and hanged within the
Letter II which is a figure of a pair of Gallows, neither does he ever abide to
see woman's manuscripts, and that which would break Prisians Head, will break
his Heart; The last part or Pillar upon which his art depends on his Prosodia;
and here he speaks sometimes in a grave tone, sometimes he is an Asper,
sometimes a Lene, and he has sometimes a rough Spirit, Spiritus Asper,
sometimes of a mild Spirit, Spiritus Lenis, yea to conclude, he is part of a
Musician, for he keeps his time, and scans words.

A Logician.
A Logician is a Reasonable Man, he is skilled in the Art of reasoning; He with
Phaeton rides upon the Sun of Reason, which is the eye of the Soul, which Sol
with his bright rays shines gloriously in the Firmament of man's Soul; But when
our Great Sier Adam fell, then the Sun of man's Reason was Eclipsed, and then
this Lucifer had its fall too; But this Logician he strives to dissipate the
clouds of ignorance, that bemists man's reason, so that men by this means
recovers the sight of this eye of the Soul; But yet he hides this Gem, this
Pearl in such a Trophonious Den of Obscurities, that men need have Tiberius
his eyes to discover it, and Lynx its sight to perceive it; A Logician when he
cannot unloose knots of difficulties, more harder to unloose then that Guardian
knot, then with Alexander he cuts them with the sword of distinctions; A
Logician is an Aedipus, to unriddle those riddles of that Sphinx Phylosophia,
or Sphinx Phylosophica, which if a man cannot undo, it kills him with Grief,
Care and Study; yea and of Nature too; Another Sphinx which drowned our
chiefest Philosopher Aristotle in Euripus, and smothered or Martyred, that
great yea greatest Naturalist Pliny in Vesuvias flames; Logic is Philosophy,
or Phylosophies Mechanic, that makes all its Instruments; A Logician
distinguishes of all things, divides all things, reasons and disputes of all
things, and defines all things; he disputes pro and con, he refutes errors
stiffly, answers Objections thoroughly, distinguishes rightly, explains things
thoroughly, defends his opinions against gainsayers; A Logician is a very
understanding man, and his art is to bring a reformation to reform the
understanding, though this Art will puzzle Intellects; he is a cunning
Sophister, who by his Sophistry can circumvent; yea he can sometimes delude by
his fallacies, but to say truth of him, he has his veritas logica; he is not
Thema Simplex, but singular, a singular man; he is ens completum, he is homo
omnium horarum; But now I come to a Conclusion, which is Finis.

A Rhetorician, or an Orator.
A Rhetorician, or Orator, is one whose Speech is elevated to the height of the
Ciceronian Pole, whose style is copious, flexible and eloquent; he has gotten
Erasmus's Copia verborum; He has a very well-tuned Genius, (as I may call it)
for his Words are sweet Harmony, that charms men; He is one that minds the
cadency, and chiming of words, as much as the density of the matter, his words
are genuine and masculine; He is very sententious, yea, as that famous Seneca,
and he seems to have read Gabriel and Camaracensis books of Sentences.

Mercury the God of eloquence, is feigned by the Poets to have wings on his
arms and feet, that he might fly to Heaven; so this our Mercury may be said to
have so too, for he soars to the clouds sometimes with his winged Eloquence;
His words are like Aresta's arrows that catch fire as they fly; surely
Promethius is present with him with his heavenly fire, that does inspire him;
Mercury's Golden tongue he has (which being a good tongue is) Aesops best dish,
which makes a good relish in the Pallat of every Judicious man's Judgment.

An Orator is a second Orpheus, who with the sweet Music of his words, draws
every one after him; He is a second Apelles, for he ran depict and sets forth
every thing in lively Colors; He is another Proteus, for he can transform
himself into what form and shape he will; sometimes he will be a Dog to bark at
all men's manners, a biteing Menippus, sometimes a Serpent to sting men with
reproaches, a stinging Hipponax; And thus he has as many delusions as a Jugler,
but in them all, he shows that he has skill in Politics, and is a Politician,
for he does all these things out of Policy; A Rhetorician is all Tongue, by
which Instrument he overcomes and wins more then Mars by his Weapons, witness
the Orator Cyneas, whom King Cyrus confessed he had gotten and won, more Towns
by Cineas's Eloquence, then by Mars's Instruments; An Orator is so persuasive,
that if he but say it, none can gainsay it; truly he by his charms of
eloquence rocks men into such pleasing lul-la-bie, and dallies them in such a
Dallilahs Lap of pleasure, that he takes all strength from such strong Sampsons.

An Arithmetician.
I wonder whether an Arithmetician, in the Book of Nature stand for a cipher,
or is a figure; He seems to play with his figures, and makes them fight with
one another, and musters his Armies of Figures which are almost innumerable,
and sets them in rank and file, and those that are overcome, he cancels them,
but of all cancelling, he loves to cancel his debts in other men's debt-Books;
His Art of Arithmetic consists of nine Figures, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and a
cipher it stands for nothing; but if that o Cipher, be well pondred in the
scales of a Judicious man's Judgment, it will preponderate, and over weigh all
the other nine figures; An Arithmetician says, o the Cipher is no figure, but
the Phylosopers say, an o, or a circle is Figura Capacissima, the World is an
o, the Heavens the Caelestial Spears are os; o is called figura divinissima;
This o is the greatest Letter in the Book of nature, o is the figure in which
Motus runs and moves in; o after figures increases the sum ten times, yea and
will make them run into Infinitum.

An Arithmetician (with the Pythagoreans) minds mystical numbers, he says, 1.
3. 5. 9. are mystical numbers; but his prime words are Imprimis and Items; If
this Arithmetician be for a Curtesan, a Whore, then he practices the Rule of
Multiplication, and puts an Addition to the innumerable number of Men and
Women; Arithmeticus is a nounce of number, and he is all for numbers; An
Arithmetician is a good player at Tables, for by his Table of Numeration he
Lives, yea and it is always furnished with such multiplicity of Unites, Tens,
Hundreds, Thousands, etc. of nothing but figures, He Lives by his Figures; We
may call him a Rhetorician, for he uses figures, and when he writes, he writes
figure-hand; He would think it a Paradox for to say 200. Ciphers make 8. as
they do 8. An Arithmetician is a piece of a Mathematician, but if he be Bacchus
Companion, he Learns the Rule of Good Fellowship; When he breaks out, then he
falls into Fractions, and then he exceeds the Golden Rule of Temperance; An
Arithmetician, if he be covetous, and an Idolliter of money, he practices his
Arithmetic most upon his money in numbering of it, until he come to the Summa
Totalis, he could wish he could practice the Rule of Multiplication upon his
Gold and Silver; In sum, I will tell you first what he is not, he is not a
Cipher, but one, who of all men may number his days best, but of all other he
numbers them least, because he thinks they are innumerable; Item, he is a
Figure in the Book of Nature until death come with his Dart, and Cancel him,
and then there will be an end of this our Arithmetician.

A Musician,
IS one of Therpsicore and Sterpes his Sons; He is a merry Fellow, He obeyes
Heliogabalus's precept the most; Ede, Bibe, Lude, post mortem nulla Voluptas.

He is a Chorister, and with his loud and unintelligible Chantings, Inchants
men with his Charming Magic; He is Natures sweetest voice, and is Cupids
Chanticlere, who with his Divine Airs, chirps out his fringing matutines; A
Musician by his joining of Concords and Discords, betwixt them both strikes an
heart-ravishing harmony; he is a conjurer in the circle of the ear, that
Conjures men with his Conjuring Charms; A Musician is only a voice, and Aeolus
lends him Air, and so by the Bellows of his Lungs, and by his windpipe, and
other parts he has, which are the Organs from whence this Music proceeds; when
the heart sinks down (as it were) into the Earth, and would be buried there,
yea, when it is almost dead, he with the breath of his Music resuscitates it
again; by his Music he warms the benumed Spirits that were frozen in the
Freeze-land of grief and sorrow; He is another Orpheus, who with his Harmonious
Harp draws men after him; He is one that is skilled in the Ionick and Dorick
Diolect of Music; He is natures Nightin-Gale, that sings Sweet, Sweet, and
Jug, Jug, for he is much for drink, strong drink he thinks is Joves Nectar, and
wishes that Ganemedes were his Cup Bearer; He is a Bird that is Imprisoned in
the Cage of the World, sometimes he is a prating Fellow, and then he is a
Parrat; sometimes he is ravenous, and then a Raven; He is a merry man, a Jolly
Fellow, a Boon Companion, and a Friend to Bacchus; if one be liberal to him,
he will sing their Praises above Ela, yea above Heavens Ela, but poor man, he
is almost choked with that Guttural Gam-ut, and when he is about paying his
debt to Nature, his groans and fighs seems to be his Funeral Songs, his sad
ditty; but when he is absolved from Natures debt, then he will stretch forth
his voice until he come to his Diapasons, so that he may sing his part with
those warbling Spears, and he thinks himself happy to be an Auditor of the
rare Harmony of these Celestial Spears and Orbs, yea, and he aspires higher to
bear a part in the Quire of Heavenly Angels, whose perpetual task it is to sing
their concording parts without pause, redoubling and discanting Halelujahs. A
Musician, his rare Harmony leaves as many Eccho's in the ears and hearts of his
hearers; as Travelers reports, their is in the Pyrenian hills; A Musician of
all other men he keeps time the rest, but the flying wings of sechered time
wafts away from others; But to be Brief, he is but a sound, a voice; The Poets
might have feighned a Musician to be turned into a Nightin-gale, but death
Metamorphises him, and he becomes a Bird of Paradise, I mean of Plato's
Paradise, the Elisian Fields.

A Geometrician.
A Geometrician is not an unmeasurable man, for he measures all things, saving
unmeasurable things; He by his Geometry finds the figure of the World that is
round, and therefore he is almost persuaded to be an Athist, and to be of the
Opinion of some Philosophers, viz. That the World is Eternal; He uses Jacobs
Staf, more then he uses Jacobs ladder, viz. prayer to climb to Heaven, I think
he is not proud, though he be high-minded; He Surveys all the World, and finds
it to be but a Punctum (in respect of the vast circumference of the Heavens,
that are circular; A Geometrician beholds his figures (as it were) in sport and
measures the distance, whether a thing be nigh or far off; He is not an unruly
man, for he does every thing by his Rule, and he keeps within compass, he
knows that the Diameter, the Worlds Axel-tree is that upon which the World
hangs, as though the World were Crucificed, and wrack't upon the Tree of
Knowledge; for Knowledge torments more then ignorance; you would think this
Geometrician were a Conjurer, for he is always drawing Circles, and Lines, and
Triangles, and Quadrangles, and Cones, and such strange Figures; He seems to be
a kind of a Philosopher that has skill in Quantities, Lines, Superficies, and
Corpus he knows has three dimensions. And when this Geometrician has viewed all
the World, he sees it is a Ball, and there he knows nothing that is round can
fill his Triangular heart, but that the three Corners are empty, and those he
ought to fill with those three that are one, and with that one which is three;
This Geometrician he squares out his actions the best of any I know; He has
skill in the Globes, both Terrestiall and Celestial; If he be a Beastly fellow,
he beholds his Emblem or Picture in the glassy Terrestrial Globe which is a
Looking Glass, and sees Beasts in it, and especially a Swine; but truly I
think he will never see himself in the Terrestrial Globe it self, nor any
besides; I doubt he will never come there, but may be Pluto will take him to
measure his Subterraneal World; A Geometrician is like to Alexander the Great
in this, for the whole World cannot content him, if he be a Covetous man, but
death fills his mouth full of Earth, who could not fill his heart with
Possessions; yea a yard or two of Ground will suffice him, when he yields to
the fates, and he who by his Compasses would have Compassed the whole World, I
mean the Compasses of his Covetousness as well as his other; He now must be
contented to lie in puncto. terrae could not this Geometrician with that wise
Aesop, have made him a Tower in the Air, whose four Corners might have been
born up with four Soaring, Flying Eagles, and that this Tower might have been
as the Tower of Babel, whose top should have aspired to Heaven, and so cause
these Eagles that are Joves Messengers, carry his Soul to the Emperean Heavens,
as the heathens of old, when they used to Canonize their Emperors for gods;
when their bodies was burnt, they used to set an Eagle or a painted Eagle at
the top of the Rogus or funeral piler, to signify; that the Emperors soul was
transported to heaven by that soaring Eagle: A Geometrician with Archimides is
drawing lines, when the fiery destinies is about burning the Mansion House of
his body; and then there is an end of him.

An Astronomer,
AN Astronomer, is an Heavenly minded man, he with the Philosopher Anaxagoras
cares for his Country; his contemplation is in heaven, about heavenly things,
he has power over the Stars, -- Sapiens dominabitue.

An Astronomer considers the motion of the Star; he is a sublime Traveller, for
by his imagination, he Travells in that milky way; He looks on the Stars with a
judicious eye, yea with his eyes, as two prospective glasses, beholding the
caelestial eyes of heaven, whether or no they look kindly upon the earth; He
beholds heavens countenance, that shines with those her orient Pearls, her many
eyes, that are as though Titan the bright eyes of heaven were divided into so
many eyes; He beholds those eyes, often weep their fiery beams, to see the
flames of anger burn in men, yea he beholds what opposition there is in the
houses of heaven about Venus as well as in the houses of the earth. This
Astronomer if skilled in Astrology too, considers the powerful working
influence and effects of the Stars, Tycho and Braha are his Authors; He beholds
Aquarias eye, that it weeps always to look on the miseryes and obliquities of
men done upon the earth; of all signs he thinks Libra, which is thought to be
as the Scales of Justice, yea and as Poets feign, this Libra was a Justice on
the earth, who is now flone to heaven; and that is the reason why we have so
little justice on the earth; I say this Astrologer sees that Libra has the
least influence on men then any sign has, which is the reason why there is so
few Aristides's just men: He also sees Leo, that's a bad sign, that it has
great influence on men below, that's the reason so many men are so Lyon-like; He
has casten his own Nativity, and can tell you that Mercury in his geniture was
culminating, which is the reason why he is so Studious and contemplative: This
Astronomer or Astrologer, Prognosticates what will come to pass, he knows that
those heavenly Signs; viz. Stars are set up, that they may be as signs and
tokens, what shall be done on Earth, which they first Presage. This Astrologer
he sees future things in the Chrystaline or glassie heavens; yea, and in his
Gallilaean glass, he sees heavens face clearly, and perspicuously, and sees
whether heavens face frowns upon the Earth or no; but oh! when he sees heavens
Hyperion, its illustrious eye to be blinded, as to us, thick mists clouds, and
the moon interposing, and Titan suffering by reason of these, a fatal eclipse;
then he says it prognosticates, that the sun of the worlds glory, or rather
the sun of righteousness shall as to us be ecclipsed, by reason of a world of
sin and misery interposes: An Astronomer is swallowed up in Des Carts
Vortices, in which we leave him hopeing, that he (as Sir Francis Drake) will
pass the Gulf.

Nemo.
NEmo is a negative; I will affirm, that Nemo potest omnia; Nemo is very wise,
Nemo omnibus horis sapit; Though Nemo have no real existence, yea, we may have
some confused notions of such non entitis, and have a Platonic Idea of him in
our minds; many may wonder at this strange Chimaera, that never was, nor is,
nor will be; but will suppose he is only a Chimaera of our brain: The Poets
have attributed much to this Nemo; he like Esops fellow servant, can do all
things, then he leaves nothing for others to do; all blame and accusations are
laid upon poor Nemoe's back; but that we may come to the knowledge of Nemo, we
will dive into the Abyss, and see if we can find him there; then with our
fancies we will rove into that spatium imaginarium, that imaginary place beyond
world and Heavens, and we will fly into all Democritus's worlds; and we will
fly to the Moon, and see if the opinions of the new Philosophers be true, that
there is a world there, and see whether that thing in the moon, that represents
a man, whether it be so or not, and if it be no man, Nemo then I will cry out
with Archimedes, (...), I have found him, I have found him; Nemo is some
nonentity, he dwells in Sir Thomas Moors Utopia, and has his habitation, in
terra incognita Magellanica; Nemo surely is something spiritual, for we use to
define spiritual things negatively, and tells what they are not, rather then
what they are; I think it would puzle the Delphick Oracles to declare Nemo unto
us.

A Giant.
A Giant is a Hercules in a Lions skin if he be wicked, he is a Zamzummim if
rebellious, a Berisides, that with his hundred hands, attempt to throw Jupiter
out of his Ivory throne. A Giant is natures Monster; man's wonder a colosse and
does little, but stands for an image. A Giant thinks to be a King, for he has
gotten his Iron Mark or Scepter, and he is called Terra Filius the son of the
Earth, he is a Cyclops, he attempts to snatch Joves Lightning out of his hand
to reach the stars, but Jupiter and they are out of his reach, he looks at
other men as so many Pigmies, he has as little of goodness as he has a great
deal of greatness and quantity; but when he yields to the fates he is good for
nothing but to make the birds of the Air a feast, and his bones Shields, and
Mace, as Precious relics for antiquaries to adore, and to show as wonders to
succeding generations; He lives in the bowels of the Earth, and may well be the
son of the Earth, and lives in Cells, though I think he is no papist, not so
devout; He is a Tytheus that shakes the Earth and makes the Earthquake for
fear; He is a puple to the Whirl-wine, and is a Cyclops skilled in the accents
of the cracking spears, when he speaks, he speaks in Thunder and fulminates
comminations: he sits upon the Center of the Earth then in all likelihood he is
a Teutonick Philosopher that mind Centers much: Nature has expatiated him to
such a length, and has reard him to such a height, that he might be an Atlass
to bear up Heaven with his shoulders: This is his resolution when he cannot
prevail with his (...).

Flectere si nequeo superis Acheronta movebo. A Melancholy Man.
LIves in the subterraneal goal of grief and his sorrows are like so many furys
to torment him crueller, then that ancient Rhadamanthe, that tear him as though
he were already lodged in Acheronta's prisons, surely this Atrabilis is the
Water of Stix or of that Laethean lake, I should call this humor Orcus, and
his body Hell: this Melancholy humor though it be black, yet it may be termed
a bloody humor for it kills him; A Melancholy man makes his body an Urine, and
he seems to be a Mourner and to put on sables, all his hopes and joys being
buried; A Melancholy man is a great Architect, for he builds Castles in the
Air; He is as dull (as the Phraise is) as Dun in the Mire, he sits as though he
were in Dole commans ecstasy, he muses as though he were a student in the
Platonic Den, sometimes he has such freiks of fancy that would make Democratus
(if he were alive) break his spleen with laughing; sometimes besotted in such a
lethargy, sick with such an Apoplexy and bedlam-like possessed with such a
frenzy, that it would have made weeping Heraclitus, if he had been a spectator
of his misery have wept his Eyes out, that he might never again be a beholder
of such woe, misery and calamity; surely this man need sail to Antasiria. A
Melancholy man's Hieroglyphick is a Dormous: A Melancholy man's black humor, is
like Stix its water, or it is some thick vapors that rises out of man's little
world; O that the Sun of comfort would exhale them, but I doubt these vapors
will Eclipse it; A Melancholy man lives, as they do in the Northern coasts,
that are blinded in Cymmerian darkness, and have some glimmering light from the
ignis fatuus of his understanding, as they have from the North Pole; but the
Sun of comfort does not visit him with his comfortable rays before the
Egyptian Serpent encircles it self, I mean a year: A Melancholy man sees or
rather thinks he sees such strange Phanomenons, but are but the Chimera's of his
brain, he with his plumed imagination flys into terra incognita, the earthly
part, the worst part of him (as Ovid accounts it) is the terra del fugo, the
Land of Smoke for the fates and destinies, have made him a martyr in the flames
of their wrath, anger and displeasure; yea, and a Melancholic man's moisture is
as the Euxime or dead Sea, yea he is, and has been deluged in an Ocean of woe
and misery, his Sun of Glory is Ecclipsed, his night of sorrow is come, his
body is his prison, his fetters are his vexatious thoughts, and this
Melancholy, his Executioner; and now you may hear his sad Catastrophe, of this
sad Tragedy of his; O Death is the end, Exit.

A Soldier.
A Soldier is one of Mars's Champions, when he comes out of a fight, then the
Almanacks red Anatomy of a man is his Picture, his body, is (as it were) all of
Iron, saving his Face, which is a Face of Brass; In the Zodiac of the world,
he is Leo, he is a vigilant man for he is often upon his guard, and if at any
time Morpheus lull him in the bed of security, he is quickly rouzed by
thundering alarums, he deserves to be indicted in the high Court of Justice,
for he vi and armis by force he takes away men's goods: King James calls great
Warriors and Conquerours splended Robbers, for they gild their Robberies with
golden pretenses; A Soldiers chief Music, is that of Drumes and Trumpets,
that are of a Jonick and Dorick Dialect; yea, his voice imitates them, he
thunders with his voice, and lightens with his power, he is another Vulcan,
this Soldiers, sides are Iron sides, yea a man of Iron and money, is the
Lodestone, that draws this Iron man, this Soldier is something like that
Image of a man that Albertus Magnus made, that could go, and speak, but what he
can do else, I know not, Experience knows, saving that he can fight, and that is
the essence of a Soldier, he seems to have this motto put on him, pro aris and
focis, but I think this is a truer motto that he should have (for my self) as
the Proverb is, evere man for himself, and God for us all: He has the crimson
Oath Wounds, as often in his mouth, as he has bloody Wounds on his body; if his
name be William he calls himself William the Conqueror; He loves to be clothed
with Iron Cap a pe, and then he is all a mode, he is Bellona's Son, and she
often makes Anatomies of them, and then there is a feast for Canibals, yea, and
their fresh is carved before with the sword, and there bodies are roasted in
sulphurious flames, This poor soldier is often weather beaten, for when the
Cannons rear like devouring Leviathans swiming in an Ocean of blood, there
Mars takes Neptunes place, and then Deaths gulf swallows them up; I wonder
that when a soldier goes amongst the men he has slain, the dead bodies do not
bleed at the sight of the Murderer; I have wondered why so many soldiers have
scarlet cloaks, but I have fancied one cause, it is because they dye and imbrue
their cloaks in blood, or else because they have been brave Chirurgions of
Mars, and have let many blood and killed many, and therefore are made Captains,
and bears the badge and sign of their Office.

A Child.
AS a man is a Map, and Description of the World, so a Child is a little Map,
and Desciption of a man; a little world is the great world in Epitomy, a Child
is man in Epitomy, he is Iliads in a Nutshell; a Child is a little letter (if
not the initial) in the Book of Nature, yet he is man's best Copy and example,
his Soul is as yet an abrasa Tabula, which is not blur'd, blotted, nor defiled
with the black Stigian Ink of sin, he is white and pale, whiteness is a sign of
inocency, he is a Lamb for meekness, a Dove for simplicity and innocence, a
Pigmy for Parvity, and is, or may be, an example for his purity, this his first
Age is his Golden Age; his youth, his filver Age, his Man hood his brazen Age,
and his old Age, is his Iron Age; a Child is Natures Paragon, a darling, his
first days are the prime days; these are the halcyon days when the Sea of
affliction does not toss him with the Waves of trouble; he is a young guest,
come into this Inn of the world, and according to Luthers phrase, the Devil is
the Host; and therefore he cries and exclaimes on the fates, when he comes into
thee Wilderness of the world, where he must combat with beasts or beastly
lusts, and now must be as a Bear baited in the circle of the World with cruel
miseries, as so many Dogs; when he was buried in that vast abiss of nothing,
none of these troubled him: A Child is the Diminitive of a man, Angels are
Pictured like Children, to show when they are Children, they are like Angels,
he is a good Copy of innocence, for I may say saving his original sin, he
(...) the state of innocence, he is one of Adams branches, but as yet there
grows no bitter fruit on him; A Child shows us what our great fire Adam was for
innocence, his playing with Rattles, Hobby-horses, Whistles, does as it were
mock and laugh at the folly of man's business, and are the Emblems thereof; his
Parents Pens him as their little History, and he is one of the best letters in
the Book of Nature; A Child he is a good example and pattern for simplicity and
innocence, there are but few that imitates either of these, and when he yields
to the fates, he changes time for an unchangeable Eternity.

A Critic.
I Have heard there has been a great murmuring amongst the Critics, because
our Maker did not make our Breasts of Christial or Glass, that so through these
Glass-Windowes they might see every ones heart, but fools that they are, I
think their hearts are the worst of all: Where envy like, Radamanthe that
tearing fury fits in her Majesty, her Head been perriwig'd with an Adders
tail, and her Cresses are Serpents Tails in which she has stings swelled
with poison and venom, that will invenome every one that she has to do with;
this Critic has Cato's discerning Eye, that can discry the least knot; This
carping Momus with his Kene Teeth, like that grinning Cerberus bites every one,
he is a nipping and sharp Menippus, a stinging Hipponax; if he be a
Philosopher, he is a Cynick; He vomit up nothing but gall and bitterness,
surely if this man were Anatomized he would be found to have a great gall, or
else none at all, having spit it all out in men's faces; A Critic is a carping
Zolsus when his curious Eyes goes a fishing there will be many Carps; A Critic
is a Severus that is so severe over all, but himself; A Critic with Augustus
Caesar, will tax all the world, in the strict balance of his Judgment, there
are many scruples, yea and he will not allow any grains of allowance: He is a
correctour of all men's manners but his own, and he is the unmannerlyest fellow
in the world: If he be a Scholar, it seems he has not learnt good Ethics. He
is the cruellest sharp saty re in this wilderness of this world, who throws his
Poisonous darts of envy against all men; A Critic he carries behind him the
wallet of his own faults, and before him the Wallet of others men's offenses, as
wise Aesop feigned every man to have two Wallets, the one of his own faults,
and that he carries behind him, the other Wallet of others men's faults, and
that he carries before him; a Critic does not put Errata's in the latter end
of his Book of Remembrance; He views Books, and scans Words, Spells Volums and
he is the Castigator of the Orthography, and the Chyrurgion of Manuscripts.

Riches.
Riches are the Wings, yea the golden Wings upon which men soar to the Clouds;
Riches are the earths treasure, which nature has hid in the bowels of the
earth, and I wish it had been buried there yet; Riches are snares, golden
fetters, which entangle men's minds, and makes men slaves to it, living in
Slavonia; Riches as Gold and Silver are Vtopia's rattles and baubles, they have
been the wise Philosophers contempt and scorn; men Idolize their glistering,
glimmering brightness, when as the wise Vtopians say, a man may see a thousand
times more luster and brightness in the sun, or star; Riches are Golden
baits, and hooks that catch men swimming in the Ocean of the World: Riches are
counted the Al-heal, but they wound all with caret, grief and perplexities:
Alas, if men should wallow always in Midas banquets it would be but lean cheer,
and they would desire to have their wishes revoked: Riches are cruel
temptations, they are the Devils spells, wherewith he enchants poor mortals.
Heavens grant that I may never be bewitched by them; Riches are not goods as
they commonly are called; but they are the greatest mischiefs that can come to
men, even the Heathen could say, Effodiuntur opes irrittamenta malorum.

Riches is the cause of the strifes; Fighting, Brawling, Scolding, Envying and
what not? they are Pluto's treasure, for he is said to be lord of the earth's
treasure; Riches are the firebrarnds that are cast into the world, to burn in
the flames of envy and making all men poor Salamanders, living in the fire of
anger, contention, discention; riches as silver, the out side of it glysters
like Serpents stings, but it has a poisonous sting that invenoms men, and with
its poison swells them with pride; yea, at the end of a man's riches, there is
such a sting, I mean such trouble and vexation of spirit, who can bear it?

Fortune.
THe Ancients pictured Fortune in the form of a Woman, fitting upon the Globe
of the World, and also men do suppose that Fortune is blind; this is because
men cannot see her actions, but Fortune is not blind, but rather they cannot
see her Labrinthical windings and turnings; simils, are sometimes liked by
some, and therefore by a simile I will declare Fortune: as when a man sends out
two of his servants a Journey, and sends them two several ways; now the master
knows at what time these two servants will meet with one another, though they
be ignorant; so Fortune is the prime cause, as the Philosophers call him: He
sends all things, into the world, and he knows and foresees what chances and
things shall come to pass, but men knows nothing until they do come; So that
in respect of the Primary cause, there is no Fortuna nor Casus, but in respect
of men, there is Fortune and Chance. Our Precisians now adays laugh at the
word fortune; Fortune is Pictured by some to be blind, and standing above the
Globe of the World, and casting to some Crowns, to some Books, to others
Mechanic Instruments; Fortune is overmuch adored by some, some take it for
providence, but fortune is a Accidental Concurse of secundary causes; Some
attributes a wheel to Fortune, and men depend upon this wheel of Fortune, as
they say, and as it turns, so men are sometimes high, sometimes low; They say,
fortune gives Riches, and takes them away again, and therefore in Pythagoras's
Tabula Cebetis, some are cursing fortune, others bless their fortune; fortune
is good to some, bad to others; Dame fortune it seems has been a good Hus-wife
that has gotten all these things to give away; Fortune has the most
contrarieties, she is good, and she is bad, liberal and niggardly, and all at
the same time, but to several persons.

A Virgin.
A Virgin in the Zodiac of the world, she is Virgo, she is a Chaste Diana, she
will let no Herostratus burn the Temple of her chastity with the Fire of his
Lust; yea, she is in a happy case, for she is secure; The Murus Aheneus the
Brazen Wall of her Innocence will keep her from all hurt; I have heard that
Friar Bacon did intend to make a Brazen Wall about England, but the Murus
Aheneus of Justice and Innocence would better Fortisie it, then his Brazen
Wall, or the Walls of Babylon: Virgo is a good sign, you may see her
Constellation, or Emblem in Heaven; Our Terrene Virgo, will take heed of
Scorpio, which in the Astronomers Anotomy of Man is the Secrets; she has a care
least she be stung with it, least she be envenomed, and her belly cause to
swell; She is a sweet Virgin, she seals her Virginity with her Virgins Wax,
which the flames of fiery Lust shall never melt; Of all things, she has a care
least she become an Hermophrodite, to have a Male Child within her, or to make
an Hermophredite her Husband, and she should constitute and make a Hermophite,
as all Husbands and Wives are or should be Hermophredites; A Virgin is a Dove
for Innocence, simpler then simplicity; she keeps the Fort of her Chastity
against all that assail it, and she knows if she should loose it, men would
point at her as at a Map of Misery; All uncivil words paints her face red, and
beautifies it with crymson blushes; A Virgin is the purest, clearest, and most
transparent piece that ever Nature drew, she is the Metaphisicks of her sex;
other women that have lost their pearl of Chastity, are but like the Almanacks
mishappen Anatomy (excepting Scorpio the secrets) in comparison of her that is
like the Celestial Virgo for Glory and Luster, she is a Phoenix a none such; yea
all the World (if I may say so) is but Her Per^phrasis.

Death.
ANd now Death is the end of all things, Death is the last line in man's
Tragedy, Mors ultima linea rerum; Death is the Finis in the Book of Nature, it
is the literae finalis, and it makes men literae quiescentes; Death is an
Arithmetician, and especially practices the rule of Substraction, for it
abstracts as fast from Natures numbers, as Nature can add to it; Death to good
men, is the (...), end of all Misery, Grief and Calamity; yea, and the (...)
beginning of Joy, but Death to bad men is the (...) of Joy, and the (...) of
Misery; Death to the good, is rather life then Death, Death it is quies to the
Godly, its the mino taure in the Labrynth of the World, that kills every one
that come into it; Death has its Sithe, because all flesh is as Grass; Death
is a Skelleton, and it makes men like it; Death Anatomizes men, and puts them
out of the robes of mortality; Death is the destinies Atropos, its knife that
cuts the thread of Man's Life; death is man's Executioner, death is by the
Philosophers said to be a privation of life; it is Heavens Messenger that is
sent for men; death is a cruel murderer, who has made a crimson deluge of the
blood of myriads of men; death is the great change, it has its Quiver and its
darts, and arrows, men are the marks it aims at, death lets fly its winged
darts, and crosses man's heart, and makes (as it were) a Crucifix, and sends him
to the Holy Land, or else to Tartary, to such a Purgatory or Lymbo where
Vestigia nulla retrorsum; death is a Sargeant that Arrests all men, and casts
them into the Prison of the Grave, and makes them pay their debt to Nature;
death is but a Sleep, striectly taken, but death is such an Opium, that will
make a man outsleep the seven sleepers; death when a man is running his full
carear, is the full stop, there he pauses; death makes an end of all things,
death is the end of all ends, this death is the Neplus Vltra, and lastly, death
of all things is the

FINIS.
