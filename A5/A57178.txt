TO The Right Worshipful, his loving father-in-Law, Richard Waltham Esquire,
and Justice of Peace and Quorum in the County of Devon: JOHN REYNOLDS, your
obedient Son, wishes as much prosperity as the Gods can distribute, or You
desire.
IF the Golden Axioms (Right Worshipful) of Grave Pythagoras be authentical, I
am then by the influence of his flourishing precepts induced to believe, that
courtesies once received ought to be repaied with thanks; which harmonical
Nectar-sentence penetrating the (Daedalian) citadel of my adrupt Muse* as also
presenting th'Idaea of your kindness before the Theater of my contemplations;
I could in conceit reap no (Ambrosian) applause of my capacity, until
(although in Baucis homely dish) I had presented you with the first
April-fruits of my cerebrosities extraction: by virtue of which audacious
resolution (arming my Muse with obedience, and my Pen with submissive humility)
I have presumed to present you this my unpolished Pamphlet, or rather to betake
my FLOWER OF FIDELITY under the (benign) wings of your worthy patronage: the
material effect whereof (albeit derived from the Index of Cytherea) I have so
overvailed with the mask of chaste modesty, that I hope not only the
apparition of scandalising method is abolished, but also the Physnomy of
superfluous amorous terms (which may not correspond with the climate of your
complexion) utterly razed out. Accept therefore, worthily Worshipful, this my
peevish Pamphlet, as the pledge of my zealous affection; and grace my FLOWER OF
FIDELITY with this happiness, to be established in the fragrant Garden of
your flourishing Library: so shall I esteem my Labors coroniz'd with the
Laurel of content, my Muse invested with the exquisite Trophies of applause,
and my self smoothed up in the Terrestial Eden of fortunate delectation.

Your obedient son and devoted servant JOHN REYNOLDS.

A Sonnet sent by the Author to all Beauteous and Virtuous Gentlewomen.
YOu Sovereign Nymphs, whose Crimson-chrystal Dye
Obscures the taint of Juno's Lovely face,
You which for sumptuous Princely Modesty
Like fair Diana through the streets do trace,
Come leave your taskes and with a gracious look.
Peruse the method of my Pamphlet-Booke.
Therein does no Lascivious phrase remain,
But only sparks of chaste FIDELITY.
Wherefore sweet Nymphs let me this Boon obtain
That midst your triumphs in May's jollity.
Together with your Diapred Nosegayes fair
You will vouchsafe my faithful FLOWER to wear.

The Preface.
THe generality of ingenious Philosophers, within whose industrious capacities
Discretion sits triumphant, do in the sympathy of their resolutions
confess, that there is no Love comparable to that which is built upon the Rock
of Virtue; divine experience does by (sacred) examples daily demonstrate us,
that desires which exceed the limits of Honor, ar^ always in the prime of
their hopes meritoriously crossed by some prejudicial misfortune: whereas on the
contrary, Love grounded upon a sacred determination, does not only most
flourishingly live in fortunate prosperity, but likewise dies in most blisful
assured felicity: God at all times hates a disloyal heart, and with the events
of contentation coronizeth that Love whose effects tend to unfeigned fidelity.
The rage of Loves passions are great, and so great, that in a manner all
esteem Venus powerful; for first she (as mother) predestinateth, and then
Cupid (as her obedient son) strikes whom she commands. By Nature all men are
made of one essential substance, yet being produced under diverse Planets, Love
with her intricate authority does more torment some then others; for beauty
has such power, and her power such virtue, that (in a manner) all Mortals are
some times scorcht with the ardent flames of her tirannical recognisance; as
well Potentates, as Impotents, fight under the banner of Beauty; and Cupid, the
Paphian Archer, being blind, as soon strikes Robes as Rags; Art can never
displace the impression which Nature has imprinted, nor Dignities ever avoid
that which Divinity sets down for a period. All men are subject to Love;
therefore no marvel if Love so seize the top of Princes conceits, that they
build their external felicity upon enjoying their Mistress favor; and lay their
(sacred supposed) foundation of hope, in being enrolled a servant upon the
memorial of their Saints contemplations: Youthful fancies very often run at
random; yet being once in the field of love, vanquished by the prospect of
some excelling beauty, they so render themselves captives to the (Circes)
enchantments of partial complexions, that they will not only engage their
constancy for the obtaining of their hearts desire; but also pawn their lives,
yea fidelities, for the establishing of their breasts contentation; as by the
sequel of this ensuing History shall most manifestly appear.

THE FLOWER OF FIDELITY.
IN the thrice renowned Island of Cycilia, (which being situated in the Center
of the Mediteranean sea, is most gallantly embelished with the Treasure of
Ceres and Flora) before ever the inhumane pride of tyrannizing Spain domineered
in these Quarters; there sometimes reigned a virtuous and valorous King named
Druyno, whose skill in Martial exploits, and knowledge in industrious Sciences
did no less daunt the courage of his professed enemies abroad, than with
content satisfy the expectation of his loyal Subjects at home. Who having
lived a long time with his beautiful Queen (and wife) Gratiana, without Issue,
being daughter to Polydor King of Barbaria, had at last in his old declining
age, when Reason would have induced men to believe that his hoary white hairs
(as the Avaunt Coureurs of Thanatos) betokened a speedy death, A very gallant
young Son; to the no little applause of his aged Father, and no less rejoicing
of his (more than) joyful Subjects; who in stellification of their young Prince
his Nativity, so sumptuously solemnized his Birth with Heroical triumphs, that
all foreign travelers being spectators of their voluntary Bountifulnes, might
condignly conjencture them (I mean the generality of true-hearted Cicilians) to
be exactly ravished in an ecstasy of celestial contentation. Which Princely
B^be being baptized with such pompous (magnificent) solemnity, as was
correspondent to his Noble extraction, was in fine by the King his Father (with
the consent of his honorable Parents) named Thalmeno. Who being nursed with
care, and disciplinated by the most expert Martia^ists of Europa; At the age of
seven years, had so well profited in the (courageous) School of Bellona, that
the Physnomy of his face, as true Almanacks of future Qualities, did perfectly
prognosticate that his Princely self would at the age of reason undoubtedly
merit to be triumphantly crowned with the superlative Laurel garland of
Olimpian dignifi^d fame. Beautiful he was of complexion; more curiously
resembling Adonis than Paris: Courteous he was of demeanor; for his benignity
surpassed the affability of Alexander: And more than exceeding discreet he was
of Capacity; for that from his supereloquent Tongue flew the very enchanting
Phrases of admired Demosthenes. So that as Nature had surpassed her (intricate)
skill, in framing him outwardly most excellent; Art likewise had bestowed her
chiefest curiosity in b^d^cking the Temple of his Cerebrosity with the prime of
ingenious industry. Palas, if she had heard his report, would have praised his
perfection: Juno, if she had seen his Personage, should have forsaken her
Jupiter: and the Syrenes themselves, if they had settled their sights upon the
soil of his Physnomie, would have withdrawn their melody from fearful Ulysses,
and tuned the harmony of their Voices to invest only Thalmeno their Favorite;
who in the bloomy springtime of his tender Juvenility demonstrated so many
virtuous Apparitions of his Princely towardness, that King Druyno his Father
rendered many millions of thanks to sacred Jehovah for giving him so sweet a
Son; and his joyful Cicilians yielded devout gratulations to Goddess
Fortune, for affording them so gallant an Heir to their flourishing Empire.
Which Heroical young Prince being the very Map of Modesty, the Patron of Piety,
and the Flower of Audacious Magnanimity; had no sooner made the Horologe of
Time sound the year fifteenth of his age, but having from his cradle his
tostica^ed conceits fixed upon renowned Travel, did upon the Rock of his
valorous Resolutions so constantly determine to try what the event of his
Princely fortunes might be, that youthful (yet Majestical) desires, still
kindling within the embers of his heroical affection, did at last so flame to
the absolute fire of a desperate Determination, that hap life or death Thalmeno
resolved, and in resolving vowed to pass the blast^ of Boreas and streams of
Neptune; the better to adorn the storehouse of his conceits, with the strange
Accidental sights of some foreign Novelties. But here a main battle of
encumbrances began to pitch a million of Doubts in the inspiring Cell of his
Imaginations: For first considering, that to depart s^ns Conge, were to bereave
his Father of his only Comfort, and to forsake Cicilia were to withdraw his
^^affe of Consolation; (The which precedent premises considering) he again
resolved to entomb his military Resolution in the evaporating dust of Oblivion:
so that smothering up the submissive Motives of Obedience in the concavity of
Self-will; and pricking forward the superbity of his sense^ with dignified Spur
of honor; he lastly resolved, that maugre the effects of Fortune, or the
treachery of Time, very soon to depart. But this his private secrecy was not so
surely concealed in silence, but the news thereof arrived (to the Harbor of
his cousin Palmas understanding, being only Son to Blithgor^ King of Egypt,
who having his capacity tickled with the exquisite Etymology thereof, could
reap no perfect rest of his disturbed Contemplation, until he had engaged
himself a Participator of his Cousins adventurous proceedings. Whereupon
finding Thalmeno in the Arboury desolate, he very familiarly began to discover
him the Physnomy of his audacious resolution: The which Zephyr-novelty Thalmeno
no sooner understood, but being in conceit with celestial Applause ravished,
in that he found so Princely compartner of his future fortunes, he to the
purity of affectionate entreaty most soon condescended: So that each taking a
Page, with such commodious necessaries as was be^^tting their Voyage, they very
closely in a night (when the Moon being overshadowed with obscure Clouds,
seemed to condescend to their resolutions) most secretly departed, directing
their course to Trapani one of the chiefest Ports in Cicilia; where finding an
Argazil ready to set sail, bound for the Country of Arabia they instantly
(with rejoicing contemplations, being glad that Dame Fortune had so soon
provided them speedy passages, without making the King, Court, or Commons
acquainted with their pretense) imbarqued themselves. Who after finding these
two tender Princes absent; what sorrowful mournings, melancholy aggravations
and distempered dolefulness was in all places, but especially in the
Palace-Resident, I refer to the discreet Readers impartial censure. And in
respect that our History depends not on their Bewailings, but on the
adventurous proceedings of our Bloomy young Princes; I will for a while leave
their sorrows to be comforted by the Dictamnum of patience: And return again to
the azured Commonwealth of Neptune, whereon these our Princely Parogons were
fortunately sailing; who tracing upon the Deck, not only reaped exquisite
applause, to see the Armatho furiously cut through the surges of the Seas, but
also enjoyed the Prerogative of delectable exhilaration in beholding the
Zephyr-G^le fairly blow the Swanlike Sails from the superbious Mast. Which so
long l^sted, that in time they were fortunately come within kenne of their
desired Port: whereat the whole company, but especially our two young Princes
rejoicing, they forthwith generally rendered many millions of zealous
gratulations to Divine Jove, in that so favorably he had blessed them with
wished for success: who seeing their Argasill at an Anchor, and having
invested* themselves with fresh Habiliments, did thereupon forthwith entreat
the Master to set them ashore, which immediately was accomplished: At whose
triumphant departure, the heroical Mariners let fly such a thundering peal of
Ordnance, that the Repo^t thereof rebounding from the concavity of the cl^ty
Shores, not only made these our valorous Martialists tremble, but also
terrified Bellon^ her self (being resident) in the citadel of her celestial
Monarchy, but the brumy smoke thereof being evaporated with the freshness of
the furious wind, our Princely Gallants instantly attained the Shores, and
royally rewarded the Boatsens gang; they betook themselves to the commencing of
their desperate adventures, where through the African Deserts they solitarily
so long traveled, that at last being destitute of victuals, and not finding
wherewith to content nature (in respect these parts were un-inhabited) they
passionately tracing these unknown Groves, very grievously began to exclaim
upon the inhumane disaster of their miserable calamities; but in vain, for they
saw no food to replenish their hungry appetites, unless to have brutishly fed
upon unknown roots; which exactly they disdained, hoping ere long to harbor
themselves in some homely Cottage, where with rustical Cates they might appease
their gormandising hunger: Upon the foundation of which hope, advancing their
pace, they at last came to the descent of a deep Valley, wherewith a faint
courage very pensively walking, they through the thicket of an ancient Forest
might epsy the Architecture of some domestical Mansion, which to their
sorrowful contemplations, producing unexpected encouragement, they arming
themselves with audacity, thereunto directed their course; where being to the
outer gate arrived, they beheld a famous Castle of sumptuous edifice, but
solitarily situated in the Center of the aforesaid Forest, that the wind
piercing most dolefully through the branches of the lo^ty Cedars, made such a
mournful mu^mur of disconsolate melody, that the dolefuln^sse thereof drove our
two young Princes into a very dist^steful conceit of effeminate despair: but at
last hunger constraining them, they resolved to enter; where opening the
outergate, they past the first Court without espying any; and entering the
second they beheld a delicious Court most ingeniously paved with illustrious
Marble, which very stately was circumferenc'd with a sumptuous arched Gallery,
p^opp'd up by pillars of bright shining Al^baster; from which by chance
reflecting their eyes, they forthwith saw a sweet ^miable Lady, which under the
umbrage of a Fig Tree sat recreating her senses with the dulcid sound of a
delect^ble Lu^e, and thereunto contracting her Angelical voice, she
harmoniously breathed out this sorrowful Sonnet.

My mournful breast! into the duskie air
Send forth sad sighe^, true witness of thy plaint;
Band pearled tears into Jove's sacred Sphere,
And show how with Love's sorrows thou do faint.
Vnvail the curtains of thy misery
Before the Throne of great Jehovah's sight,
That contemplating on thy Tragedy,
He may send favor on thy side to fight;
Post therefore tears to Juno's Diety,
Relate thy rage, display thy Passions fire:
Sincerely crave of her bright Sanctity,
The comble of thy mournful hearts desire.
Fly thobbing sighs unto Dame fortunes throne,
And thunder forth the taint of thy distress:
Unmask the Subject of thy direful moan,
And of her (Janus) power implore redress.
And both like twins of Dame Latona fair,
Through Thetis sail unto the Paphian Isle:
Solicit Venus and young Cupid rare,
That now discordant fate they will exile,
And safely send Prince Maedor to thy sight,
Whose Physnomy with chaste applauds my soul
Has vowed eternally for to unite,
And character in Adamantine ro^l.
The which as soon as she had ended, repeating again and again the name of
Maedor, one might apparently perceive many pearled tears distill down the
(sacred) soil of her Vermilion cheeks, as also manifestly hear many secret
sighs, which her perplexed heart sent forth, as testimonials of her tormented
passions: and therewithal lifting up her eyes toward the seat of her
celestial Maker (as being overcome with too many in supportable sorrows) she
instantly shrinking to the ground, fell into a dangerous trance. The which
Tragical spectacle our two young Princes perceiving, very soon advancing their
pace, stepped to her assistance; And elevating her from the Flowrie-bank, whereon
she was fallen, they used such, or at least the best preservative means for her
recovery, as their unskilful (though willing) industry could afford them: So
that in time (by good fortune) she again recovered; And remembering her self
(or at least thinking to remember her self) and seeing these two strangers
before her, she very disdainfully (having anger seated in the furrows of her
Brow (uttered these or the like words following.

GEntlemen (for so the Physnomy of your favor and prospect of your personages,
invites me to term you) if you knew how divinely quiet I endured the enjoyance
of this dangerous swound (or rather deadly slumber) whereinto I was fallen, I
absolutely know (or at least audaciously conjecture) that in equity and reason
you would have refrained from disturbing me of my rest, and also permitted me
to reap the tenuity of my consolation: But since things past cannot be
recalled, because accidents once produced, do soon fly far, having Times wings;
I will, on condition you speedily depart my Castle, for this your first offense
give you an absolute pardon. I have here wholly betaken my self to
sorrowfulness, and have long since devoted my zeal to the shrine of
disconsolation, my desire is neither to see nor be seen, but rather to lead the
Pilgrimage of my life from the sight of any: This solitary place I have elected
for my Purgatory; And here, unless death prevent my premeditations I resolve
to abide the return of a most dear Friend of mine, which inconstant Fortune
this forty Months has detained from me. I in heart hate the sight of any,
and for his sake loath the prospect of all. Therefore at the request of a
sorrowful Lady, (or if ever a tormented Damsel, may gain acceptance at the Bar
of your Discretion) I beseech you delay not to depart, that according to my
accustomed manner I may sincerely upon the Altar of his absence, devoutly
sacrifice my affectionate sighs; In token, that till death in the Garden of my
Maiden Amity, the resemblance of his self, and Idea of his perfections, shall
(to my everlasting comfort and souls contentation) immortally flourish. The
Princes having very lowly saluted this lovely Lady, and with attentive ears
listened to the effect of her speeches, They both began or at least Thalmeno for
both, instantly to frame her this benign reply.

RIght virtuous Lady! (for so your inward qualities and exterior perfections
demonstrate you to be) if our sudden arrival has prejudiced your sorrowful
devotions, or detained you from executing some service due to your Friend; by
so much the more we are thereof exceedingly discontented. But since the purity
of our pretense may plead for the excuse of our audacity, and the innocence of
our resolutions crave remission for our boldness* we doubt not, but having
heard the History of proceedings, you will in equity afford us a benign
pardon: For know fair Lady, that we are both Princes; the one heir apparent to
the Crown of Egypt, and the other to the Diadem of Cicilia; Our Names Palma and
Thalmeno: who in the prime of our bloomy minority, before the consideration of
future fortune was established in the Zenith of our capacities, we resolved to
travel, and so secretly imbarquing our selves (without taking leave of our
Parents) we of late arrived in the next brdering Harbor; since which time, as
(faithless) Fortune would, (E^rour being our guide) we strayed into aan
unknown Desert, where these three days we have most dangerously traveled,
without finding sustenance to relieve our hungry stomachs; So that at last
ranging these solitary Forests, we fortunately arrived to the view of this
your Castle: Our pretense, fair Lady, is not to incur your indignation, but
only to entreat you to relieve us with some benign demonstrations of
courtesy; that in giving Nature her due, we may avoid the tyrannizing dint of
Death, which most inhumanely does now begin to domineer over us: which if you
effect, as virtuous reason cannot well deny we shall continually remain
servants both to your Bounty and Beauty; and till the period of death, hold the
term of our lives as again re-bought by your Majesticall Merits, and likewise
depart when it shall please you to command us. The Lady pondering upon these
pitiful speeches, very soon in her breast conceived a motion of relentation,
which flaming in the embers of her zealous imaginations, very secretly
commanded her to entertain them with all agreeable curiosity: so that taking
them kindly by the hand, she most debonairly conducted them to a very sumptuous
Dining-chamber, where causing her waiting Virgins to attend, and furnish the
Table with such store of rich poverty as her solitary Cell could afford, They
very orderly without the vanity of prolixious ceremonies fell hungerly to their
meat; till repast being done, the Princes satisfied, and the Tables taken up,
Thalmeno still burning with desire to know the effectual cause of this Ladies
desolate retirement, evpaporating bashfulnesse, and arming his capacity with
courage, he very boldly (yet with a Princely grace) continued his familiar
Oration as follows: MOst beautiful Damsellif the repetition of your
misfortunes renew not your grief, or the display of your sorrows increase not
your disconsolations, I would (if I might crave so much grace at your Lilly
hands) entreat you to relate why so sadly you make this Desert your domestical
Mansion. And the occasion why so often with vollies of sighs you repeat the
name of Maedor. Me thinks your Beautiful face, Slender personage, Majestical
comportment, and virtuous perfections, should rather befit a Monarchs Court
than a rural Country, and a Princes bed than a Pilgrims Cottage. But whether
wade I so far, since by experience I am taught to see, that all are subject to
fate, and none exempt from adversity? for as soon the Prince as the Peasant, the
Madame as the Milkmaid, are (or at least may be) crossed with the dart of Cupid,
the sting of sorrow, or the Tyranny of misfortune; Therefore fair Lady, if any
of these distastful accidents have befaln you, with the (Sovereign) salve of
patience so mollify your passions, and raze out your sorrows, that the
residence of aggravation may not overtop the blossoms of your flourishing
Juvenility, and so Tragically bring your beautiful self to the (untimely)
enjoyance of a desperate Martyrdom.

The Lady perceiving Prince Thalmeno had now ended his speech; For answer
thereunto replied him as follows.

KNow, virtuous Prince, that I have long since loved a Noble Cavalier, the
absence of whom has willingly constrained me to live thus solitarily. Name him
I will not, because the motive thereof will refresh the birth of my accustomed
disconsolation: yet in respect you shall not condemn me of perverse ungrateful
coyness, I will (if you please to attend my arrival) bye me to my Closet, and
there constrain my trembling Pen to indite the secrets of his Mistress sorrows,
and in effect to discover the sole History of my as yet tragical misfortunes.
Our two young Princes joyful of this benign courtesy, accepted of her
proffer; and so having familiarly saluted each other, the Lady instantly with a
tormented Complexion departed.

But by that time a future hour was spent, and swiftly constrained to follow
his forepast predecessors; Lo, immediately the Lady descended the stairs, and
so presenting her self to their views, delivered them this short speech
following.

MOst renowned Princes! To satisfy your earnest demands, here take this
scroll; wherein though rudely, yet sincerely I have demonstrated the cause of
my retiring hither, and penned down the sorrows which in heart I do (more than
sorrowfully) endure. My present wealth is such, as I cannot afford you many
gifts; yet as a Testimonial of my zealous affection toward you, here take
these Victuals and small sums of money, to repleat your necessities, when any
future occasion shall present. What you find fault with in this Castle, I pray
forget with favor, or in me I beseech you remit with partiality: in recompense
whereof, I will sacrifice my devout prayers for the establishing of your
prosperity, and beseech the Almighty to send you a most fortunate and safe
Return. In hope whereof, betaking you to your journey, and my self to my
accustomed Cell of disconsolations, I most dolefully in all Honor take my
sorrowful Conge. Thalmeno and Parma receiving the Scroll, with weeping tears
kissed her mournful cheeks; And so rendering her many millions of thanks for their
unmerited courteous entertainment, most sorrowfully departed, directing their
course to a very high Mountain: Whose top having attained, and burning with
desire to peruse the Scroll, they at last casting themselves on a green Bank,
embelished with the essence of many diapred Flowers, under the covert of a
stately Pine Tree, whose branches were likewise apparelled with a summers
ve^^ure; taking the Paper in their hand, found this or the like therein
contained.

ADmired Princes! (as well for your virtuous qualities, as heroical conditions)
being that in courtesy you have requested my abrupt Muse to relate you the
cause of this my desolate retirement* Know (valorous Martialists) that I am
Florina, the only daughter of Agenor King of Numidia; who attaining to the
perfect age wherein Nature seems to triumph in the delectable pleasure of
Nuptial ceremonies, I was sought for in marriage by diverse Princes both of
Africa and Europe; whereof as the King my Father affected some for their
private wealth, so others I hated for their public enormities; in such sort,
that to be plain I could not esteem of any with whom I was contented to finish
the limits of this my terrestrial pilgrimage: by virtue whereof, I some two
years remained without either fixing mine eyes upon the influence of Love, or
ever devoting my breast to the shrine of affection. But at last Cupid storming
at my Liberty, and Venus her self at my single estate, (acknowledging that
there was no life but Love, nor no paradise but the pleasures of Marriage) they
so bent their invective ambition against my innocence; that at last by the
means of Fortune, which had likewise intruded her self in the union of their
sympathy, they unexpectedly to my Fathers Court sent a sweet young Prince named
Maedor, being son and heir to Orlando King of Biafara; which Prince being
penetrated with the report of my Personage, came of purpose to Numidia to
protest him my Servant: Upon the soil of whose beautiful Complexion I no
sooner settled the influence of my Regards, but I immediately felt the flames
of fancy sparckle within the concavity of my tormented breast. On the other
side, Prince Maedor so often frequented my company, that at last (if his
Protestations were unfeigned) he reposed his bliss in my Beauty, and reaped his
chiefest pleasure in enjoying my (desired) presence: So that tract of time did
(by reason of many amourous Glances) so firmly unite our affections with the
twist of combined Ratification, that in few days I became mistress of his
thoughts, and he master of my imaginations. But now despightfull Destiny
resolving to metamorphose our sweet Nectar into bitter Aconitum; began to
display part of his infidelity: For the news of this our late familiarity being
bruited throughout the Court, did in fine arrive to the King my Fathers
understanding; who storming at this unexpected event, (because he bore a secret
malice to Orlando Prince Medors Father) resolved not only to nip the blossoms
of this our tender Affections in the April of their minority, but also to blast
the Buds of our Love in the spring time of their juvenility: In respect
whereof, sending for Prince Medor before his Royal personage, he after having
imbathed his capacity in the Acheron of indignation, so checked him up with
thundering threats, and frowned at him with invective speeches, that in fine,
albeit Prince Medor began with a pithy Oration to plead for himself, and in his
defen^e to descant upon his unmerited discourtesie; He not only command^d him
to silence, but also charged him to depart the Territories of his Kingdom. Ah
unfortunate sentence for so swe^t a Prince! And therefore unfortunate, because
being constrained to depart, he left me desolate in the distastefull surges of
perplexity! But again, after the King my father had bereav^d me of this my
Princely Paramour, (within the influence of whose personage I reposed my
delectable contentation) being not any thing appeased with this his inhumane
accident, but still severely determining to invest me with the recognisance of
his wrath, He so cruelly entreated me, and so unnaturally restrained my
liberty, that I could not one minute reap repose of my Imaginations, but
continually lived in most tormented calamity; in respect whereof sacrificing my
Orisons upon the Altar of Prince Maedors absence, and devolving my
contemplations to the beautiful Idea of his excellencies, accounting Courtly
joy^s vain glorious trifles, and a Princely life a splendent misery; in a
Cymmerian night, which seemed to allow of my resolutions, departed the Court,
and betook my self to the establishing of so sorrowful life. So at last Fortune
resolving to assist me in my misery, very happily made me retire hither; which
solitary Castle does so correspond with my mournful conceits, that for the
ardent love which I bear Prince Maedor, I firmly resolve either here to attend
his (expected) arrival, or else to finish my days in manifestation of my
Fidelity. Therefore (sweet Princes) attribute my disobedience to my Parents a
f^vourable censure; and resolve that what my Pen prescribes, my capacity shall
perform; that is, immortally to remain faithful to Maedor, or everlastingly
unfriendly to my self. Which scroll they had no sooner perused, but pitying the
estate of the miserable D^msel, they instantly vowed to range the confines of
Africa in researching Prince Maedor, that by their friendly diligence Florina
might enjoy her breasts chiefest solace and her souls delectable contentation:
By virtue of which infused resolution elevating themselves from the fragrant
grass, they at last with delicious familiar Amity, and delectable friendly
applause prosecuted their Journey, in such pleasant sort, that Phoebus gracing
the Cincture of the day with his radiant complexion, they traversing many lofty
Mountains, and pleasant Penean Valleys, at last toward the approach of drowsy
Vesper arrived to a silver Fount ore-vail'd with the Canopie of a sprowting
Cypres, who frizling his curled locks, took this Crystal spring to be his
reflective mirror, whereon (with Narcyssus) deliphting to gaze, he continually
tximmed himself in his verdant jolity: many Angelical Nymphs they likewise saw
circumferencing this fountain in a Dance, who (resembling Daphne) had their
splendent hair dallying with the Nectar-breath of amiable Zephirus, being all
apparel'd in Crimson Robes imbrodered with Lillies and Couslips; who no sooner
saw our two Cavaliers approaching, but thinking that the Shepherds and Satyrs
had sent them as spies, thereby to entrap them in some treacherous Ambuscado,
they forthwith (as having Pegasian wings) flew through the Thickets, with far
swifter pace than ever did Atalanta when she ran with Hipponeanes: Our Princes
seeing this Amourous Troop fled, were exceeding sorrowful that their arrival
hindered their pastimes; so that hailing them with a shrill Holaw, and
perceiving none returned, they instantly sat them down upon the Diapred brim
of the fountain; where accumulating many Nosegayes of Daffadilies and prime
flowers, they dipping them in the Orient water, therewith bespinkled their
faces to refresh their spirits; so long till reflecting their light upon the
excellency of the neighboring Pasture, they at last espied a verdant Tent, on
whose lofty Turret a snow white Ensign deliciously flourished in the Air;
whereat admiring, because they could not conjecture what this delightful object
betokened, (as also to the end they might satisfy their ardent contemplations)
they both very joyfully directed their course thither; which no sooner they
approached, but they perceived it to be an Eglantine Bower: Bespread (here and
there) with Colombine and Damask-Roses, so that burning with desire (from point
to point to survey it) they at last audaciously entered; where a snow-white
Beagle being (with Argus eyes) awake, saluted them with his shrill (discordan^)
barking, wherewith as a vigilant servant arowsing (a Nymph) his Mistress from
sleep, she altogether at this unexpected Alarm began to tear through the Bower.

But Venus and Diana having metamorphosed their (forepast) malice to a future
Sympathy, so ordained, that her Amber locks should be entangled in the
Eglantine Briars; whereat our Princes setting hold of her loose Garments, did,
despite her force, compel her to stay: but the Nymph thinking them to be
Apollo and Jove, who had descended from Heaven to ravish her Maidenhood on
earth, bitterly cried out, and grievously tore the Tresses of her hair in a
rage; the which our Princes perceiving, with fair exhortive speeches began to
appease her aggravation, r^questing her only to conduct them to some adjoining
Cottage, where for that night they might assuredly r^st in some peaceful
tranquillity: whereat this jolly Nymph elevating her self from the earth, and
gratifying them with many milions of thanks, bedecking her Lily Countenance
with a cherry complexion, (as a skillfull Pilot) very joyfully conducted them
through the Woods and Forests, where many Troops of (Light-foot) Satyrs ran
on before as triumphant Heralds to proclaim them passage, so long till
radiant Tytan flying the Zenith of our Horizon to alight the obscure Antipodes,
she at l^st brought us to a sumptuous Palace, whose Pyramids and Towers
superbiously presumed to elevate their tops in the (sacred) skies; the glorious
sight whereof (repleating their senses with astonishment) made them conjecture
it to be that admired Palace of renowned Felicia (so much dignified by the Pens
of civil and profane Poets) for the Walls thereof were of clear glistering
Alabaster, the gates of pure Crystal, the pavement of black Jet intermixed
with azured Marble, the Battlements of refined Gold, the Arches of stately
Porphyre, the windows of translucent Diamonds beset with Carbuncles and
Saphires, and the roof of Vermilion Coral, wrought Checkerwise with orient
gards of Silver: what shall I say? The interior lineaments owed nothing in
correspondence to the outward Edifice; for the Portals and Galleries were of
snow-white Ivory, the Bedsteds of clarent Amber, the Coverlids and Curtains of
green Damask imbossed with Emeralds and Chrysolites, and the Tapestry of
Crimson-Velvet imbrodered with Amethysts and Pearl. In the spacious Courts and
delicious Bowers (which Flora had adorned with the Treasure of her painted
Drapery) were likewise many curious (conceited) fountains, some thither
conveyed by the instinct of Nature, and othersome they erected by the Ingeny of
Art) There might you have seen Diana errais'd aloft upon a sumptuous Pillar,
with a Bow in one hand, and a Banner (wherein was charactered Chastity) in the
other, from whose Alabaster Paps the water sweetly distilling, was by her
Nymphs in Crystal Vases received, and so artificially conveyed to the
Fountains center; and also another, where Pallas, Minerva and Juno, do from
their breasts rain Veins of water upon the beautiful faces of Daphne and
Phylomela; the which entering their coral lips, does distill to the concavity of
their Chrystaline Paps; from whence with a stern countenance, they furiously
sprout it in the eyes of inhumane Jupiter and lustful Tereus; also upon the
borders of these fountains are growing many fruitful Fig-tres, whereon
artificially range diverse harmonious Birds, whose heavenly music according
with the waters murmr, does yield forth many ravishing Tunes of Angelical
melody: so that there wanted no bravery to make this sumptuous Palace a
terrestrial Paradise; It was impaled with lofty Woods, fenced Draw-bridges, and
impregnable Bulwarks, as also circumferenced with a dainty River, within whose
Tempee Gleam many Caistrine Swans most pleasantly imbathed themselves. So that
our two Princes with their Nymph, being arrived to this dignified Palace, were
forthwith met by an ancient Damsel, who seeming to be thereof Lady, very kindly
bad them welcome: her habit was of a Sable hue, having her snowy hair dangling
down her withered face; her beauty seemed to be nipt by age; yet in the
lineaments of her complexion lay furrowed the anatomy of an indifferent
Countenance: the arches of her sorrowful eyes were overvail^d with a c^imson
taint; from out whose conduits it appeared, many brinish tears had had their
issue. Which desolate Lady, after having had some conference with these our
unknown Princes, and perceiving how the zeal of their youthful resolutions were
devoted to travel, she with a faint voice delivered them these speeches:
COurteous Friends, (for such I wish you to be) fear not to enter this Palace,
but advance with applause! for your eyes shall be presented with such
delectable objects, as shall both please your thoughts, and solace your
contemplations.

Whereat she abruptly brake off, and so as fast as the Postilions of Aeolus,
fled to the Forests. Our Princes seeing the sudden departure of this ancient
Lady, exceedingly admired what this unlookt for novelty meant: But at last
arming their resolutions with courage, as also seeing the sable night begin to
orevail the Element with obscurity, taking leave of their Nymph, they boldly
entered; where no sooner they had past the outer gate, but they were forthwith
met by two glorious Virgins, who saluting them with a smiling countenance, arm
in arm most lovingly conducted them to a sube^bious Theater, from whence they
might deliciously behold many amorous Ladies and gallant Cavaliers
circumferencing themselves in a dance: from whence after having repleated their
eyes with applause, they by the Ladies were conducted to a sumptuous
Bedchamber, where diverse flourishing Knights were unchastely Courting of their
beauteous Paragons, yea and with such unseemly dallyance, that Vesta nay Venus
her self could scarce refrain from blushing at their immoderate familiarity; in
such sort, that being glutted with the variety of diverse unchaste prospects*
(which to repeat would but vainly replenish the Readers capacity with
prejudicial contemplations) they were at last by many radiant Tapers alighted
to their chambers: where to pass away the tediousness of the night, two
lascivious Ladies were proffered to bear them company: But our young Princes
(albeit ardently tempted with carnal enchantments) having their immovable
resolutions charactered upon the foundation of Honor (not accepting of this
unexpected courtesy) very virtuously craved their absence; when thinking to
repose themselves, lo they were instantly again solicited by two tender
Virgins, who bringing two Ivory Lutes in their hands, with their melodious (
Orphee) Music, thought to lull their premeditations asleep: Their breasts were
nakedly unmasked to the spectators eye, where one might apparently behold their
Alabaster Paps swell and sink at an instant, as being inspired with the
Luxurious wind of unsatiable desire, Immodest smiles they had at command; and
wi^h the Hiaena, their eyes darted forth prejudicial Assummons: Their outward
vestments were both gay and loose, in all things fitly corresponding with their
inward qualities: and their glistering Hair being escaped from the Tresses of
Chastity, most viciously sported with their Crystal complexions, as the
amiable Fe^ters of Lust to inchant the Approachers. But neither their Syrene
deceitful Melody, their sweet Aconitum-glances, nor their alluring lasciviou^
gestures, could either (with Circes) charm the capacity of our Princes, or else
with Medea inchant their conceits to range beyond the Lists of (dignified)
Modesty: but like two religious Pilgrims they valorously fought against
(vicious) Concupiscence, and ardently devoted their zeal to the shrine of
Virtue: So that not passing for their smile^, nor esteeming of their
temptations, they audaciously thrust them out their Chamber, and so securely
bolting the door, betook themselves to sleep. But Morpheus had not long
detained their spirits in delicious slumber, but having contracted his
Influence with the instinct of Celestial deity, they were in the depth of
Nocturnus arowsed by a grievous Clamor, which ratled in the Palace with such a
thundering noise, as if the battlements, nay foundation thereof were subject to
a sudden revolution; Grievous groans were plenty, Cries were common, and all
diverted to such a tempestuous confused Cha^s, as if the Atlas of the world had
in the vivacitie of his fury assummoned the Confines of Earth to the dreadful
day of Judgment: whereat our two young Princes, a^ having their obtuse senses
repleated with fear, and their heroical courage daunted with timerosity,
instantly slumbled from their beds, as if they had been transcended to the
infernal concavity of obscure Acheron; thinking that their glass of life was
already run, and that inhumane Thanatos had now taken his dart of tyranny in
hand, to finish the period of their terrestrial Catastrophies. But whiles being
thus in the (supposed) path way of destruction, lo there suddenly appeared unto
them a delectable Dwarf, being apparelled in Crimson; which to evaporate their
timorous despair, with an Angels voice pronounced them these speeches: Fly
Vice, fly Sin, fly Earthy vanity,
And with a martial courage fear displace;
Detract no time but with celerity*
Come view the Beauty of Dame Virtues face.


Our Princes seeing this pretty pigmy, and with advised deliberation pondering
upon the Etimoligie of his speeches, could not at first refrain from infusing
their contemplations within the Cabinet of astonishment; but at last more
seriously ruminating which way to elect for their security, they both resolved
to follow the tender guide; thereby to free themselves from the peril of this
ensuing stratagem; upon which resolution, arming their courage with
magnanimity, they as having Pegastan wings flew through the Courts, directing
their pace to a lofty mountain, from whence they espied this glorious Palace,
to be suddenly swollen up in the earths concavity, and in such admired sort, that
no appearance of foundation remained, but was utterly razed out as if the
essence thereof had never there erected his (once) substantial situation. Which
tragical (prospective) accident our Princes could not at first believe, but
instantly thereupon surmised that their eyes and imaginations had been deluded
with invasions: the Dwarf perceiving their doubtful perplexities, ran exactly
from them; when to comfort their passions, the old forlorn Lady which they
first met, again presented her self to their viewes, and so after having lowly
saluted them, very mournfully uttered these speeches.

MY sons (quoth she) my name is Virtue, who of my own authority have invented
this Tragedy for your advantage. The glorious Mansion which ye have seen
destroyed, was the Palace of Folly, wherein only remained the Imps of luxurious
Iniquity; who pampering up lustful Cytherea, were always persecutors of chaste
Diana: my society they ever disdained, and contumeliously smothered my Temple
with the contagious Incense of Lubricity; amongst which cursed Diabolical
Regiment Perjury was rife, Swearing no sin, Pride a Pearl, Lust a Lord,
Ambition a Saint, and Treachery a Goddess. But now (my sons) rheir
immoderate Pride is past, their unchaste Desires extenuated, their devilish
Oaths drowned, their aspiring ambition evapora^ed, their graceless Treachery
abolished, nay and all their superbious actions, with themselves, utterly
destroyed, and furiously sent to remain in the infernal dungeon of everlasting
perdition: Therefore beware by their (unaccustomed) stratagems, and let the
mirror of their misfortunes serve as an Instance to Impale you within the
circumference of Piety. And to the end that, being absent, you may still ponder
and premeditate upon my Exhortations, here take this Paper and observe such
Divine counsel as I have therein prescribed for your salvations. Which having
said, she in the twinkling of an eye elevated her self in the air, and so a
brumy cloud orevailing her in the cincture of his imbracements she immediately
vanished.

Our Princes astonished hereat, took up the Paper, and opening it, found these
Observations therein contained.

1. Build the foundation of thy faith upon purity and piety, that thy zeal be
not eclipsed with the contagion of idolatry, but rather perfumed with the sweet
incense of sincerity.

2. Let devout Prayers be a Mediatrix between thy Savior and thy self; for it
is the most assured step to obtain felicity.

3. Conceal thy secrets in the closet of thy breast: left rashly displaying
them to others thou produce the prejudice of thine own tranquillity.

4. Fly Ambition as the poison of the sense; and detest En^^ as the Canker of
thy contemplations.

5. Gaze not on Beauty, lest it engender repentance: but loath a lascivious
Courtisan as the scourge of iniquity.

6. In thy Actions be faithful, lest being blemished with reproach thou impair
thy reputation.

7. Hnonour thy Prince as the anointed of Christ; and if occasion present, live
and dye for thy Country.

8. Detest vain glorious superbity, as the Aconitum of sin, and abolish
Superstition, as the cloak of ungodlines.

Which having read, and knowing the sacred influence thereof tended to the
establishing of their celestial tranquillity; they so imprinted it in the
concavity of their contemplations, as it futurely should serve for a fenced
circumference to retain them within the confines of Piety; and likewise for an
impregnable Citadel to defend them from the fury of ungodliness: so as
triumphing that fortune (in the mirror of experience) had presented them with
so sacred an Instance, they repleating their thoughts with applauses, and their
conceits with delectation, very joyfully departed. But wanne Aurora (being
daughter of Thetis) had no sooner skipt from the bowers of Neptune, and so
saluted the excellency of transplendent Phoebus, but our Princes afresh
prepared themselves to their journey: when timely in the purpled Morn, as
radiant Titan began to give the Bezo les manes to the verdant Mountains; the
Satyrs, Fawns, and Nymphs skipt through the Forests; and doleful Philomela
(basinating her Breast in the air on the superbous People) warbled forth her
Tragedy: they were by a soft bloamy wind, which caused the verdant Leaves to
caper, made acquainted with the delectable sound of a ravishing Cornet: the
delicious (tripled) echo whereof, redoubling through the thickness of a
curled Grove there next adjoining, gave such a quavering grace to the aforesaid
Melody, that our Princes were perforce constrained to find out the said
(unknown) excelling Orpheus. To the end he might for a whiles recreate their
distempered senses, with the rare exquisiteness of his praiseworthy Art. And
so directing their courses by their attentive Ears (which they took to be their
guid^) they at last arrived to the beautiful prospect of a fair (Penean)
Valley; in midst whereof ran most leasurably a (Tempe) silver stream, whose
banks in equal distance were beset with fruitful Lemmon trees; on the branches
whereof, they might afar off espy the yellow Citrons naturally growing: which
delightful pleasant prospect so well contented their youthful imaginations,
that immediately they b^nd their course directly to the aforesaid Arboury;
where entering, they espied this famous Musician, being a beautiful young boy,
apparelled in white, who being crowned with the Laurel garland set upon a
Flora-Bank, close by the Rivers side, unto whose melody most attentively
listening they at last in a fragrant Bower of delicious Eglantine espied an
aged old Father, which as it seemed by the furrows of his complexion, had in
his tender years past the indurance of many distasteful calamities; his habit
was of a Sable Black, which coming scarcely to his knees, was about his weak
waste begirt with a Willow stripple; his Visage was of a Wane taint; and his
Snowy Beard, being milky-white, descened almost to his sorrowful middle; in his
hand he held a Brazel staff, which as it seemed manifested to be the feeble
supporter of his withered age; And before him, on a Table of Swan-like
Alabaster lay open a gilded Book of absolute beautifulness, whereon in
Reading he solitarily busied the conceits of his tormented cerebrosity; which
prospect as soon as our Princes espied, being instantly transported with desire
to know the cause of his disconsolate retirement, they boldly entered, where
inte^rupting him from his earnest study, Prince Palma, (to awake his
distempered Muses from the Chaos of his perplexity) boarded him as follows:
RIght aged Father, (for so the Calendar of your Complexion induces me to term
you,) If our audacious arrivals have distu^b^d your study, or our presence your
pati^nce; we beseech you to pardon the first, though a rash attempt; and to
excuse the second, as being an unwilling enterprise. Travelers ears are (you
know) am^tors of novelties, and their capacities as desirous of news, as the
Antipodes of the light of the Sun: Therefore, Reverend Father, we beseech you
to relate us the cause of this your disconsolate r^tirement, and the Motive
which induced you to embrace this austere Life, as the Image whereunto your
contemplations dedicate the generality of their terrestrial devotions: as also
to afford us so much favor, as (being foreigners, and unacquainted with the
pas^ages of this Country) we may under the support of some Debonaire
Seignieur, erect (for a while) our residence; and so avoiding the scandalous
imputation of Vagabonds betake our resolutions to the obtaining of (desi^ed)
peaceful Tranquillity.

The ancient Father perceiving by his speeches, that he had been trained up in
the School of virtue; ^s also conjecturing by the Physnomy of their
countenances, that they were issued from some noble extraction; very kindly
(with a gravity, which seemed to embellish his speeches) returned him this
Friendly reply: GEntlemen, (for such I esteem you to be) Your arrival has
n^^^her disturbed my study, nor your presence prejudiced my patience: For as my
nature is not attractive to severity on the one side, so on the contrary, I
make use of the other at leisure. Therefore to my sorrowful Cel you are both
exactly welcome: And in respect a friendly demand deserves a familiar reply,
Know (Gentlemen) that the Bower which I have here caused to be erected within
the Incirculets of this fruitful grove, I make my retiring place, when
passionate conceits begin to ^osticate my distempered senses. This Boy being an
Orphan, for charities sake I have caused to be instructed in the art of shril
music, to the end that when my eyes begin to dazzle with overmuch reading, he
may with his loud melody arouse my spirits from the thought of slumber, and so
put me in mind of my accustomed duty, which in heart I immortally owe to the
(sorrowful) shrine of my dead Saint, which whilst she lived I affected more
dearly then my self; and being (now) dead, will honor with such ardent
fidelity, that future ages shall have a meritorious instance to acknowledge*
That till death, and after, to my fair Eucellina I remained completely
constant: Ah sweet Excellina! which sacred Name when I repeat, enforces my
cordial blood to distill my sorrowful heart, and also my brinish tears to
descend the soil of my penitent cheeks; she (oh she!) was the unique daughter
of a valorous Knight, whom I long courted with unfeigned love, and at last
(after having received many bitter repulses) obtained the enjoyance of her
gracious affection; whereof her shrewish stepmother being (by misfortune)
thoroughly advertised, (as one that rather sought her ruin then advancement)
she so severely looked to her, and ^o inhumanely entreated her, that her Father
being absent in a far journey, she most tyrannously bolted her up in a V^stal
dungeon; where seeing she could by no means obtain the object of my personage,
she in the bitter anguish of (Phlegiton) dolor, (bidding the World, but chiefly
Me, farewell) most dolefully yielded nature her due; In remembrance of whom, to
the other end of this Grove, in a Fragrant Valley, I have (as Duty and Love
enforced me) erected a Tomb, whereunto till the period of my ending days, I
have in heart daily vowed to offer her, not only my devout Prayers, that I may
soon follow her, but also my throbbing sighs, as repentant witnesses of my
tormented calamity: Therefore Gentlemen, if you please to afford the time to
walk thither, I will make your eyes spectators of that, which with great grief
and aggravation I have discovered to you; And after give you such Observations
in your travels, that doubtless, if the celestial influence cross not your
Fortunes, you shall find them very profitable for your advantage, and no way
prejudicial to your adv^ntures.

The two Princes returning him thanks for his proffered Courtesies, very
willingly to his demand, soon condiscended; and so walking through ranks of
lofty Cedars, which with their verdant branches beautified the adjoining
(silver) stream, They in fine arrived to a sacred Chapel, which with Alabaster
Walls circumferenced that glorious Tomb; where entering, they espied it so
repleeted with muni^^cent curious workmanship, that the view thereof drove them
speedily more near to approach, and so beheld the body thereof to be of
Dove-white Ivorie, whose cover being of radiant Jeat, there was thereon the
Picture of the aforesaid fair Excellina in Crymson fresh colors, most
ingenuously pourtraicted, and under her feet, in characters of rich Gold
(Inammeled with Azur) this Epitaph most sumptuously engraven.

EXCLLINA'S Epitaph.
Within this Ivorie Tomb does lie
The Phoenix of pure modesty,
Sweet Excelline, whose Beauty rare
With Hellens taint surpassing sure,
Nay, Hellens taint surpassing sure,
Which did the Grecians Love procure;
Being in Jove's Imperioll sight,
A Nymph excelling Juno bright.
Cut off by fatal Sisters three,
In confluence of Loves Plauditee.
Therefore if any pass this way,
With penitential tears do pray,
That she may in the Elizian Plain
Until Eternity remain;
Still crowned with hearts delicious joy,
And freed from rage of dire annoy.
Which Epitaph, when they had a^ain and again over-read; as also reveiwing the
Tomb, and regarding her Picture, they very sorrowfully departed to find out
the ancient Delmon (for so they knew him now to be named) who purposely
attending their coming, took them by the Hand, and the tears standing in his
Eyes, he (albeit his Tongue did falter) at last breathed out these speeches.

AH Gentlemen! my grief is such, that I loath my life; and were it not for too
much off^nding my Soul, I could willingly be the administerer of mine own
(untimely) martyrdom; But alas, I know (I too truly know) that that would be a
sacrifice too abominable before the sight of my maker; which I protest is only
the Rein that withdraws me from executing of my Resolutions: For why, though
I (...)* I live discontented; and by my death, my dolorous ca^^mity would enjoy
a period, Should I (most misera^le I) be the cause of so sweet a Ladies
destruction? Or by my means should so gallant a Virgin be depr^^ed of her
future (delectable) pleasures? No, no, ^elmon; Live not but dye in memory of
her Mar^^^dome; for so shall thy aggravations and, and (...) everlasting joys
commence. Our two young Princes, seeing him run so far in the diversity of
(amorous) sorrow thought be^^ to recall him from his passionate dumps; and
interrupting him, Thalmeno began as follows.

WHy Delmon we think the effects of amorous contemplation should be now
(through Age) evacuated from your memory; and the remembrance thereof dried up
in the Cinders of Oblivion: for it is not for you, which are ready to salute
the Grave, to sacrifice sighs to Cupid; but rather for Youth, such as we are,
to fight under the Banner of Beauty. Remember therefore with your self, that
Venus was by Appelles Boy pourtraited with fresh colors, and not set forth
with a withered Visage: and though Vulcan offered to the shrine of Juno, yet he
at last cried peccavi, and was for his simplicity laughed at by Jupiter.
Therefore Delmon, consider now with thy self, that Excellina is dead, and may
not by any (mortal) possibility again be revived: In respect whereof, dry up
your tears, and forget any more to devote your Oraisons to the image of
Cytherea: that fighting against concupiscence, your actions may approve you to
be an unspotted Personage for the celestial Monarchy; and while tracing on this
earthly vale of misery to observe a blissful decorum of aged stayednesse.
Delmon perceiving he was answered somewhat roundly; instantly afresh wept,
because their exhortive speeches touches him to the qui^k: but at last
comforting his sorrowful Muse with patience, he evapouring his tears requested
them to enter his Cel, and to accept of such homely Cates as his poverty could
afford: whereunto they willingly agreed; and so deluding the time with familiar
conference, they a long time solaced their capacities in amourous prattle; till
at last repast being ended, and the Princes ready to depart; Delmon with as
much audacity as his tormented passions could permit, at their Dernier adieu,
pronounced them these speeches.

SEeing, heroical Gentlemen, that your resolutions are devoted to Travel; Know
that some leagues hence, in the Kingdom of Zanfara, there reigns a
magnificent Prince, surnamed Brilion, whose Virtue does no less applause his
Subjects, than his valor does dant his Enemies; rewarding each with the
guerdon of his merits, and retaining no honor from those which demonstrate
their actions to be absolute m^gnanimous: So that, for discretion, he may well
be ^steemed a Solomon; for Majesty, a Caesar; for Prow^sse, a Scipio; and for
benignity, an Alexander. His Court likewise may be termed the Rendevous of the
flower of Chivalry, for there are always resident innumerable of Cavaliers;
which as they account Discretion a chief point of valor, so they stick not
(though desperately) to adventure their lives for the establishing of their
same. Their Senators likewise are both grave, politic, and provident; which
from the sincerity of their contemplations, account Ambition a heinous crime,
and Treachery a deadly sin. Also their Pastors of the people are both zealous
and virtuous, admonishing their Flocks, not with the servants of Baal, to place
their Religion upon diabolical Idolatry, but to ground their zeal upon that
Celestial Temple, whose Foundation is Faith, whose pavement Purity, whose
doors, Devotion; whose Arches, Amity; whose pillars, Pi^ty; whose Windows,
Sincerity; whose galleries, Glorification; and whose towers Humility. Their
Ladies and Damsels are likewise both gracious and fair, and generally so
chaste, as if Diana and Nature had adorned them with the pride of their
excellency; being of gesture, modest; of capacite, quick; of quality, kind; and
of behavior courteous. Therefore, Gentlemen, if you direct your course
thith^r, you shall generally see each live by the fertilenes, of his own Land,
each reap the fruit of his own Vine, and (delectable) content sit smiling in
every corner: there likewise shall you see the fragrant Fields adorned with
their verdant Vestures, the lofty Trees with their gay garments, and the
delicious Arbours with their diaper'd treasure of Flora; as also the mountains
orev^iled with snow-white Flocks, their Meadows with the riches of Ceres, and
their Valleys with Daffadils, and prime flowers: In their Parks may you
likewise see regiments of Fallow-Deer running untaken; in their Forests may
you likewise behold, troops of Nymphs trace unravished; and to be brief, on
every bush, harmonious Birds warbling forth their melody. Thalmeno and Parma,
perceiving that Delmon had finished his speech, being partly in conceit
ravished with the report of fo flourishing a Kingdom, giving him thanks for
their benign entertainment, as also for his debonair virtuous exhortations,
very joyfully departed: where traveling a long time these unknown Countries,
they at last very fortunately arrived to the chiefest City of Zanfara, where
the Court then was; And taking up the Lodge in the best Inn which the City did
afford, they there some three days rested, to refresh themselves of their
forepast (troublesome) travels: And after having (as was requisite) given
almighty Jove most humble thanks for their safe arrival, they betook themselves
to this private parley, where Thalmeno began as follows.

MOst dear Cousin! We are now in a Kingdom far from our Native country; and
therefore with celerity it behooves us to settle our proceedings upon the main
of some resolution, to the end we may futurely avoid the receipt of ensuing
misfortunes. Therefore, understanding that the King exceedingly delights in
heroical Virtues, it were not in my opinion unfit to betake our selves under
the umbrage of his service, where cherishing our valorous magnanimity, we may
produce the demonstrations of dignified Princely achievements, whose effectual
apparitions in the eyes of all spectators may condignly purchase us the title
of gallant (admired) admiration. Prince Palma hearing Thalmeno utter this
haughty resolution, very instantly returned him this reply: MOst affectionate
Cousin, I allow right well of your conclusitive determination: therefore,
delays set apart, let us proffer our selves to the Kings service. This day, I
understand, he resolves to hunt in a Forest neer-adjoyning the Court; where,
if you please, we may present him with a submissive supplication, thereby to
intrude our selves within his Princely service; but let our names be obscured
under the cloud of secrecy; So that Thalmeno may be termed Thalmo, and I Palma
named Plivio, justifying our selves to be both Knights of Arabia.

This pleasant invention was well liked of Thalmeno; And so solacing their
cerebrosity, they forthwith indicted this supplication, which by a young Knight
(a fri^nd of theirs) they instantly sent to the Kings Majesty, the tenor
whereof follows, To the most puissant, famous and flourishing Prince, Brylion
King of Zanfara
RIght renowned King! whose magnanimous fame (by the Herald of report, has
been transported to the bar of many Cavaliers understanding) in such sort, that
they not only admire at your Princely valor, but also wonder at your
(virtuous) animosity; so as their thoughts burning with desire to be made
possessors of your (gracious) presence, and their resolutions flaming with
applause to be spectators of your heroical audacity, they have upon the Altar
of fame, long since devoted their resolutions to direct their course to your
Country; amongst whom, we Thalmo and Plivio, two Knights of Arabia, having our
capacities penetrated with the report of your affability, have undertaken this
journey, to be made spectators of your renowned personage; So that being
arrived to your flourishing Palace, we most humbly beseech you to accept us
into your dignified service, assuring you, that our valor and fidelity shall
be such, as shall well testify our resolutions to take their offspring from
audacious magnanimity. So imploring your Majesty to admit us into your service,
and to grace us with that stellified Title to be invested your Servants, We in
all humility prostrating our lives to your (gracious) command, Rest,

Your Sovereign's devoted Vassals, Thalmo and Plivio.




This supplication was no sooner presented to King Brylion, but forthwith he
commanded the two foreign Knights to be admitted to his pres^nce, where
saluting them in such sort as befitted his Royalty, He very benignly accepted
of their voluntary service: Which famous acceptance adding applausible hope to
our Princes expectations, made them in conceit conjecture that they were now at
the foot to mount the steps of honor. And therein to conclude, because
peradventure the discreet Reader may think the time too tedious in describing
their proceedings, let this as a brief annotation suffice: That their valorous
actions, virtuous demeanor, gallant comportment, heroical courtesy, and
Princely grace, did so conquer the capacity not only of the King, but the
Commons; that in a manner all the Island of Cicilia esteemed them worthy the
prize of Olympian victory, I mean the Trophies of Laurel dignified honor:
Which by often demonstrations of their interior audacity did so instigate the
King with the meritorious humor of preferring them, that not long after their
arrivals, he appointed Thalmeno to be Attendant on the Princess Athelia his
daughter; and established Plivio to be Lieutenant of Ithica-castle, wherein the
fair Princess Mersilva daughter unto Samor King of Bohemia was retained
prisoner.

But leaving them, I mean the aforenominated Plivio and Mersilva, to the
protection of fortune, we will for a whiles entreat of Thalmo and the Princess
Athelia.

IN a pleasant morn (before the pearled Dew was exhaled by ^he golden rays of
translucent Phoebus, when the Flora-flow'rs were displaying the Pride of their
beauty, and the melodious Birds on the verdant bushes straining forth their
melody) it chanced that Thalmo being tosticated with the beauty of Athelia his
Mistress, betook himself to the fields, as well to refresh his tormented
contemplations, as to make the flowery Meadows acquainted with his amorous
fancies; when directing his pensive course to the verdant Forests, he at last
arrived to a spacious Beech-tres, whose Branches expelling the darts of Tytan,
made a complete shadow for all tir^d passengers to repose themselves. Which
pleasant umbrage corresponding with Thalmo's passions, (and so much the rather,
because amiable Zephirus, embelished it with his Nectar-Blooms) being
over-pestered with ardent affection, he there cast himself down on a Bank of
Prime flowers, and taking out his pen and paper, endited this ensuing Sonnet.

So sit thee down accloy'd with lovely care,
Begirt with flames of Cytherea's fire;
And to the Woods relate the taint most fair
Of her which did thy youthful breast inspire.
And sigh and say,
Oh Beauty gay,
The causer of thy mournful Lay!
First show the Trees and fragant verdant Bo^ers
The piercing looks of thy Atheliah's eye;
Next tell the streams, and dainty Florah's flowers,
The sweet Idaea of her jollity:
And sigh and say,
Oh Beauty gay,
The causer of thy mournful Lay!
Then to the Sylvanes, Satyrs, Nimphs divine,
Depaint the glistering hair, white front most pure,
Together with her beauty Chrystaline,
Which did thy Paphian torments first procure:
And sigh and say,
Oh Beauty gay,
The Causer of thy mournful Lay!
Nay to the shrine of Venus stately Throne
Strain forth the praise and gracious rarity
Of her whose beauty made thy breast to moan
With plains and tears of Love's perplexity:
And sigh and say,
Oh beauty gay,
The causer of thy mournful Lay!
Having thus pourtraicted out his passions, and made the Forests acquainted
with the Praeludium of his malady; He forthwith as being submerged with the
variety of amorous contemplation, resolved to return, but fortune willing to
smooth up his Conceits in an ecstasy of Contentation, so ordained that his
Mist^esse the Princess Athelia, with her Troop of Ladies should trace that
way. Glad of this heavenly news, he immediately blushed, because the Celestial
Object thereof ravished his capacity with many millions of delicious applauds:
So as elevating his resolutions upon the wing of Honor, and investing his
courage with the consideration of magnamity, he audaciously determined to
present her with the Physnomie of his affection; By virtue whereof, at last
finding her sequestered from her attendant Damsels, and resident within a
myrtle-bower, in midst whereof she gazed on a silver-Fount there conveyed by
Mistress Nature; he steeling his tongue with boldness, and taking a manly
courage in the front of his faltring Oration, (with a grace, which though
gallant took his offspring from fear) boorded her in this sort.

RIght excelling Princess! When by the aid of ^ortune I first espied the
singular sight of your delectable self, I immediately felt my tender b^ea^^ to
be inspired wit^ the endurance of a Lovers passion, in such accidental amorous
sort that min^ eyes ever since conceiving their chiefest contentation from the
vermi^ion-hue of your Alaba^ter-beauty, (at so divine an object) has so firmly
sworn my flourishing fidelity to the celestial service of your superexcellent
Deity, that I utterly abandon the contemplation of other beau^y, and sincerely
b^take my inward devotion^ to the glistering shrin^ of your dignified
perfection. The grace which I saw did adorn your comely personage, the beauty
which I espied did (sweetly) bedeck your lovely cheeks, and the virtue which I
beheld did garnish your Sovereign self, has so inflamed my senses with the
coals of affection, that in the prime of my con^^ancy I am like to be raked up
in the embers of despair, unless revived by the joyful news of your Princely
favor. My birth is such, a^ if you thoroughly knew, peradventure might
occasionate you to render the accomplishment of my Brea^^s expectation; whereon
I will not now descant, because the motive thereof shall not move you to term
me by the phrase of a peevish Insinu^tor. But (sweet Athelia!) if my si^h^
might disclose, my tears explain, my rage manifest, or my passions discover
with wh^t zealou^ purity or affectionate love, I i^ heart cherish the dainty
resemblance of your sacred Idaea, I not only think, but resolve, that your
gracious self would at the first report, not only recompense my desert with
the reward of my merits, but also repay my fidelity with the guerdon of your
affection; whereof till the celestial Deity shall by inspiration partly
advertise you, I will til the period of my (definitive) humane pilgrimage,
remain as constant to beautiful Athelia, as I wish Athelia should be courteous
to perplexed Thalmo.

Athelia hereat overveiling her Lily-cheeks with a c^imson taint, on a sudden,
as much blushed as Diana, when she espied unlookt for Acteon: and so
metamorphosing her pleasant physnomy to a melancholy complexion, (being
altogether unacquainted with such amourous encounters) bending her brows,
within the furrows of whose lineame^^^ it seemed anger sat triumphant, She
very sharply returned him this quick reply.

WHy Thalmo (quoth she) has my too much kindness made thee so proud, or my
undeserved favor so presumptuous, that thou now give wings to thy tongue to
run a course absolutely so lavish? has my courtesy emboldned thee to aspire
so high, as now out of sense to sue for thy Mistress? Has thy idle leisure,
being in my service, taught thee to deck thy tongue with the phrase of
flattery? and is there no other for thee to aim at but my self? Ah fond Thalmo!
and therefore fond, because possessed with a peevish fancy. As thou deridest my
beauty, I will laugh at thy folly; and in accounting me fair, I will ^steem
thee frivolous. For thy Birth, know, that I disdain it as nothing, and thy self
as less: If heretofore, thou have sacrificed sighs, or shed tears for my sake,
Why, expect a recompense where there is no satisfaction to be made; and
hereafter be, more wiser, to engender the conception of the like simplicity. To
be brief, refrain from prosecuting thy audacious folly; or else I will use such
means that my Father shall qualify your courage* by nipping the blossoms of
your flourishing estate. This thundering answer proce^ding from ^ Princesses
mouth, might doubtless^ have made many fresh water soldiers retire for fear;
but our valorous Thalmo, disdaining to quit the siege for the first repulse,
repairing his sense, and furnishing his Muse with a fresh supply, very boldly
(as bei^^ nothing danted) continued his combat in this sort following.

MOst benign and beautiful Princess! If you conjecture, that in discovering
my affections, I flatter your merits with a show of derision, you greatly wrong
mine honor, in respect my nature was never attractive to so base an enormity;
for what I protest in words, my effects shall manifest to be of truth, against
the proudest Champion which durst undertake to maintain the contrary: Therefore
sweet Athelia, let not an unconstant thought so obscure your Maiden-breast with
obscurity, that for my faithful affection, you term me an ungrateful servant:
for if the flower of my love was predestined for your alone self, why, partly
seek the means to affect him, which in heart has long since vowed to adore
you, as the image to whom he dedicates the generalities of his terrestial
devotions: And therefore reward me not with checks for my affection, nor with
frowns for my love; but kind^ly repay me with a sweet consent, which at the Bar
of your courtesy I daily attend. Athelia perceiving that he still directed his
course to one harbor, being in a manner over-pestered with listening to his
old Love, instantly framed him this bitter Answer: THalmo, if thy affection
were equal to the tenor of thy speeches, me thinks thou should at my
sincere request bury the reiteration thereof in the shrine of silence, and not
so audaciously presume to advance the pretense of so unreasonable demand: I^
thy phrase of glozing were so unfeigned as thou make a show of, or thy lovely
passions perfect messenger^ of a sacred constancy, yet my determinate desires
can never be diverted from reaping the enjoyance of a single life, which I have
already upon the Altar of Vesta imposed: my desires rather adore the image of
chaste Diana, then adore the shrine of lascivious Venus; rather allowing of the
ones principles, then esteeming of the others precepts. Therefore, Thalmo,
since my mind may not be subject to the serviles of Love, let my commands in
the closet of thy capacity be a mediatrix to make thee give a solemn conge to
thy peevish (commenced) enterprise.

Thalmo perceiving the Princess Athelia now pretended to shroud her self under
the Cloud of a solitary Climate; by informing him, she meant to embrace the
austere deity of a she-Saints devotion: V^ry hastily returned her this sudden
Reply.

FAir Athelia! If my speech could decipher my love, or my tongue my affection;
I should then account my self most happy, whereas now I esteem my fortunes most
unfortunate. Unfortunate, I may well say, in that the Idaea of my fidelity is
(without desert) obscured in the vaporous mist of incredulity; which if
(without partiality) you would sincerely poise in scales of reason, I assure my
self, the zeal of my virtuous constancy would evacuate the residence o^ your
mistrust, and as absolutely advertise you that my love is graciously sprung
from the exact soil of fruitful fidelity. Whereas you demonstrate, that your
pretense is to live solitarily, without accepting the society of any; Why, know
(fair Nymph, and Goddess of my imaginations!) that the possessing of your
presence, and the obtaining of your commands, would yield me partly the
satisfaction of my trembling desire: So that, (fair Athelia) if you please to
grace me with the dignity of your Servant, it shall suffice; and upon that
pleasant foundation will I futurely erect further delectable Trophies of
delightful hope; And till my merits shall deserve more favor at your Princely
benignity, I am resolved immortally to live and die in your service, and to
attend on your sacred personage with such firm fidelity, virtuous affection,
and submissive loyalty, that ( Athelia) your sweet self and King Brylion your
father, shall one day bless the hour of my arrival, and have just cause to
acknowledge that the sympathy of our affections was predestined to be united
by the condescent of Celestial deity. Athelia well noting with what fervency he
uttered his passions, began immediately to produce some motion of debonair
pity: yet in respect he should not conceive any spark of hope, where there was
no performance meant to be effected, bitterly returned him this sharp Reply:
Thalmo! If thou leavest not thy prattle, I will leave thy presence; For thy
obstinate opinion will constrain me to fly thy fight, and hereafter
meritoriously) to loath thy company. It is now (more then) time to give a
conclusion to thy conference, because the tediousness thereof does overpester
my senses in understanding it* What I have said, I mean to perform, that is,
Athelia will live solitarily, and leave Thalmo to his passionate folly: and
where thou d^sirest to remain my servant, I thereunto condescend, so far forth
as thy desires aspire not to thy Mistress prejudice. Let thy future attempts
be seasoned with discretion, (for fear) lest folly overtopping thy capacity,
thy downfall prove the more dangerous, Consider with thy self I beseech thee,
what my Father will say, being acquainted with thy presumption; And resolve not
that he will bless thee, but rather curse the instant of thy arrival, and (for
recompense) reward thee with the recognisance of his indignation. Therefore,
Thalmo, ask counsel of thy wits; Repent thee of thy forwardness, recall thy
follies and be penitent for thy offenses: in effecting whereof I will assay
with my self, not only that I may pardon thy presumption, but also that I may
exempt my memory of thy crime out of the Maiden garden of my youthful
remembrance.

Thalmo no sooner perceived that Athelia had finished her cruel Oration, but he
instantly framed her this Answer: AH Athelia! is it possible that Beauty and
Cruelty (albeit two Rivals) can at sometimes demu^e within the incirculets of
one personage? And is it possible, that each being others enemy, they should
both seek my ruin, and so in a seditious sympathy, triumph over my
martyrdom? Ah, sweet Athelia! make not my fall your felicity, nor my ruin
your rejoicing! But present before your sight the complexion of my Constancy,
the fervency of my Fidelity, and the regard of my affection! Consider (I
beseech you) the purity of my Pretense, the pretense of my Desire, and the
desire of my Expectation! and think that if Thalmo live, he must love his dear
Athelia; and though Athelia hate, yet Thalmo must needs love. What was
predestined for my fortune, perforce I must needs endure: yet in suffering
her repulse, I in humility die, to see my fortunes checked with Athelia's frown
Sweet Athelia! Distill into your heart the motion of pity, and amidst the
showers of your anger, let the splendant Sun of Favor evaporate your wrath!
Let the dew of patience so mollify the conceits of your cruelty, that I may
(though long, yet) at last, amongst the briars of your displeasure, gather the
delectable fruit of my Acceptance!

Athelia perceiving that Thalmo still rejoiced in repeating his passions, very
boldly interrupted him in this sort.

THalmo! I now see thou art bound apprentice to folly, and therefore may not
be exempted until thy time of innocence be expired. I perceive it is in vain
to dissuade, where senseless absurdity does command; And it will little avail,
where I see Exhortations are held as Toys, and Requests obeyed as Trifles. I
am sorry that I have remained with thee so long, in respect thou art blinded
with a frivolous humor; which, I see, rather springs from a fond capacity,
then any way from a t^^mented spirit. But howsoever, it nothing avails the
advancement of thy demand, because unlawful, and therefore to be rejected.
Thalmo seeing she first interrupted him, thought now to render her le pareil,
and so continued in this sort.

SWeet Athelia! If ever the sighs, tears, love, fidelity, or affection of a
tormented Lover, may gain acceptance in the contemplation of his Saint* I
beseech you to grant me the accomplishment of my virtuous desire, that I may
once in all chastity of marriage enjoy your sacred personage, which above the
world I chiefly affect! But Athelia (as the custom of women is) resolving to
have the last word, answered him, That his talk disturbed her thoughts, and his
speeches her senses. And so in a disdainful humor (without bidding farewell)
she immediately flew from him: when directing her pace to the Court, we will
for a while there leave her, and a little entreat of Thalmo his passions: Who
seeing his Athelia so sudainly departed, thereat (as being impatient with love)
immediately ^^ormed, changing his pleasant countenance to a pale complexion; and
repenting the time that ever his mother Gratiana produced him into this
miserable world, continually crying out on crooked Destiny, and very often
sighing, as though his breast were overpestered with insupportable calamities,
sometimes falling from sighs (...) tears, and then from tears to sighs again;
sometimes repeating the name of Athelia, and then (sweetly) closing up his eyes
as though the Oracle of that celestial word had ravished his conceits with too
many divine cogitations; At last desperately tracing these forenamed meadows,
as though the Barque of his hope had alre^dy suffered the shipwreck of
misfortune, He very pensively withdrew himself to his Closet, where to ^ase his
tormented stomach, he resolved to write, and send Athelia a Sonnet, the
Contents whereof follows.

Athelia fair, the Image of my mind,
The mistress of my thoughts, my heart and breast;
Exile the appearance of all frowns unkind,
And all disdainful looks do now divest;
Behold the torments of thy beauties power,
Which pierced mine heart in an untimely hour.
Your lofty front, the Throne of Graces fair,
Amidst whose milk-white soyls does always ^^eet
Celestial Veins of purpled blood most rare,
Which sometimes stray, and then again do meet;
Has so inflamed my heart with lovely fire,
That of all Saints your self I do desire.
Your splendant hair, fine threeds of natures skill;
Which does obscure the brightness of thy Sun;
Has so combined my Heart with Fancies fill,
That their Idea in my thoughts do run:
In such strange sort that when I think to slumber,
A thousand lovely toys my brains do cumber.
Your eyes like glistering Stars divinely bright,
Do shine most fair, as having sacred power
To draw all those that do approach their sight,
Captives unto their beauteous prisons Tower;
Amongst the rest my self at first epsy,
Was forced to love, wherein I mean to die,
Your lovely cheeks within whose center spring
Two dainty flowers, the Rose and Lily fair,
At first espy did to my senses bring
The thought (O thought!) of future pleasure rare;
Which glads my soul, and makes my heart revive,
When as my hope unto despair does dive.
Within my tortured breast your sanguine sigh
Has pitched his Tent, and swears there to remain,
And still as Gardien both by day and night,
The keys thereof does vow for to retain;
The fair resemblance of whose dainty view,
Does force my breast his love for to renew.
All sweet perfections, Beauty, Virtue, Grace,
Which do adorn the April of your age;
Do force me secretly for to embrace,
Your dainty self, to whom I do engage
My love, my life, my service, constancy,
My settled faith, and firm fidelity.
Which Sonnet being ended, made up, sealed, and directed; he forthwith posted
to a Gentlewoman of Athelia's, named Levina, whose perfect visage promised him
the accomplishment of a faithful performance; and imboldening himself to
request her secretly to deliver it to her Mistress, she thereunto voluntarily
condiscended; and so finding her very solitary in her Chamber, advancing her
pace, she with an humble reverence effected her promise; albeit the Princess
at first made great difficulty to r^ceive it, in respect she knew not from
whence it came; but at last unripping the Seals it came from Thalmo: she dying
her Crystal visage with a crimson blush, bade Levina depart; when bolting her
door^ and casting her self on her dainty bed; she unripping the Seals, read the
contents before repeated, very often she perused those sillables and lines which
best delighted her cerebrosity; and so kissing the Sonnet (contrary to
expectation) she laid him in her naked neck, directly in that Crystal valley
which her Alabaster paps do inviron; when finding her self overpestered with
many lovely contemplations, which ranged on the absent Idea of Heroical Thalmo,
she at last to her self uttered these speeches; MOst unfortunate Athelia! If
thy tears might assuage thy pains, or thy sighs thy miseries; thou might
then envy (the better) the residence of thy tortures, and with preservative
patience, the sweeter bear the insupportable burden of thy tormented
calamities: but alas, as the first cannot perform the one, nor the second
effect the other; by so much the more may thou esteem thy estate more than
unfortunate; and curse the hour wherein thou did first espy the (charmed)
face of virtuous Thalmo; Thalmo I say, whose valorous actions, heroical
disposition, comely grace, and gallant demeanor has so conquered the thoughts
of thy maiden capacity, that thou with the pale-faced Moon, midst clouds of
obscurity, do take thy pleasant light of conceived hope from the most
resplendant Sun; which in effect is only Thalmo. Remember with thy self (nay
perforce thou must rem^mber) with what fervency of affectionate fidelity he
pleaded to thy self for a kind acceptance; and call to mind the pearled tears,
doleful fighes, and passionate agonies, which as messengers (of faithful
constancy) he sent to depaint before thine eyes the miseries of his malady; and
blot not up in oblivion his wan complexion, hollow aspects, and repining
despair; which as (Authentical) solicitors, might have caused the most obdurate
heart to relent, and have produced a motion of pity. But wretched Athelia, (and
therefore wretched because Athelia) forget not the proud repulses, sharp
answers, bitter threatenings, nor obstinate denyals which thou gave his
enterprise, which when I consider, I burst into the very humor of Anger;
condemning my self of (impudent) ingratefulnesse, in that I repayed the prime
of his pretense with unkindnesse, and crossed the proceedings of his hope with
unmerited discourtesie: And being now alone, I must (nay will) confess, that
obstinate coyness set apart, I in heart then honored Thalmo, although
Maiden-bashfulnesse would not permit me to discover it; and in such sort do
still adore him as the (sacred) Image to whom I bind all my devotions; Ah sweet
Thalmo! none but only Thalmo lives within the commonwealth of my memory, nor
none but he (alone) may boast, has conquered me with the prospect of his
perfections: though at first I was proud in refusing his precepts. I will now
be as courteous in accepting his pro^^ers; though then obstinate in denying his
requests, ye^ now as willing to agree to his conditions; and though then
stubborn in not listening to his desires, yet now as tractable to hearken to
his demands But soft, Athelia! what Lunatic humor of folly does possess thy
senses, or whether run thy wits a wandering without their guide, discretion?
Has amourous passion so soon transported thy Conceits with fancies, or lovely
toys so instantly obscured thy Reason with absurdity, that without regarding
modesty, or respecting bashfulnesse, thou show thy simplicity such, as the
world hearing it, may condemn thee of peevish Levity? Is she which was so long
courted, now become an Oratory suitor? and must she plead to him for love,
whereas heretofore he prayed her for affection? Ah Athelia! but such is thy
fortune; And therefore contradict not that which the gods have already set down
for a period; content thy self with that which is befallen thee; and hereafter
seek by some favorable means to parley with thy desired Thalmo, to the end
that his presence may evacuate the mist of sorrow which does so tosticate thy
senses, and extinguish the birth of ardent flames, which does begin to scorch
the substance of thy fore-contented estate.

The which she had no sooner uttered, but Levina her waiting Gentlewoman
suddenly rushed in, as being from the Queen her mother to seek her (much
marveiling where she should be so long absent) Athelia perceiving that the time
had deceived her, instantly rose up, and masking her fancies (the best she
could) under the shadow of (partly) a merry countenance, failed not according
to her duty with all celerity to find out the Queen her mother, where being
arrived, contrary to her expectation, she received this check.

WHy Athelia, has your too much liberty made you forget your self? or is it
some extraordinary affairs which has detained you so long from my presence?
was your Tutress Lady Flerma with you, or else from whence came you? The
Princess Athelia (as a maxim incid^nt to the Female Sex) being in such
amorous actions, never unprovided of a sufficient excuse, extempore framed her
this applausible answer.

MAdam, (if it please your grace) I have long since been precisely invited to
see Fulvia the Countess of Arios dau^hte^s Chamber; and this morning
unexpected she in person came for me; you being as then in your secret Closet,
I was loath to disturb you, and so depar^ed without Conge: for Lady Flerma, my
mistress, she was then at her devotions, and only Iffida my waiting-maid
attended me. This dulcid Reply soon contented the Queen; and so Athelia
remaining in her presence, we will a whiles there leave her, and return again
to tormented Thalmo.

Who being as it were plunged in the stream of Athelia's beauty, and almost
drowned in the River of her affection, as also hearing no answer of his Sonnet
sent by Levina; stormed in such sort, that his familiars, (who being not
acquainted with his passions) thought he would sure run Lunatique to dance with
the skies, or else stark mad with the Man in the Moon to caper above the
Clouds; for such rage possessed his senses, and such Anger overmastered his
Reason, that I think he resolved with himself, or else vowed to Apollo to run
to the confines of his wits Commonwealth; all company he abandoned, and
detested the light, as Jupiter when he transcended in a cloud to dazzle Vulcan,
thereby to enjoy Juno: His speeches were far-fetch't sighs, unless now and
then he would breathe forth the name of Athelia: his laughter was metamorphosed
to tears, and no motion could enter the Cabinet of his conceits, but the
resemblance of Athelia* his Closet seemed to him a mere Purgatory, and his Bed
a very exact Hell in conceited show, (though not in effectual substance) his
torments might be compared to the tortures of Ixion, only excepted, that he had
a more fair Mistress in Athelia, then Ixion had in Proserpina. When he
walked, the image of Athelia stood before him, whose Picture (with Pygmalion)
he adored, as the unique solace of his hearts contentation: being in his Study
pensively passionate, he would suddenly arise and ask who was there? as if
Athelia had been always knocking at the door: From thence in a fantastical
humor he would forthwith direct his course to the Fields, where most
sorrowfully he would to the senseless Trees decypher forth the manner of his
Mistresses cruelty; And again, as having offended, immeditately fall to sing a
Sonnet in praise of her: and from thence, as though he had been bound
apprentice to no trade, fall into another humor of recording his passions:
among^^ the rest (as I well remember) he once ranged into a very pleasant
Forest, and so from thence to Mountains next adjoining, and again to Valleys,
as the weathercock of his contemplations guided him; when being over-pestered
with innumerable of amorous fancies, on the plain ground (where Mistress May
had naturally spread a Summer-Carpet) taking out his Pen and Paper, he there
endited this ensuing Sonnet.

If walking by some stately silver stream,
When as there chances a bloomy wind to be,
Me thinks amidst that cockling vaperous gleam
I presently my fair Athelia see;
And if I trace upon their borders sweet,
Instead of trees I still Athelia meet.
If that I chance into the fields to hie
To pluck a Nosegay for Athelia fair:
Me thinks amid'st each flower I do epsy
The sweet resemblance of her beauty rare:
And if by chance to sing I do pretend,
For answer, she her ecchoing voice does lend.
If on high mountains sometimes I ascend
To see the harmless flocks their pasture take,
Me thinks from hill to dale mine eyes I lend
If of my dear I may espial make;
And if some Nymph or Shepherdess I see,
Me thinks far off, it should Athelia be.
From whence if I in valleys do ekart
My self to shade me from all humane sight,
Or think to live in Woods alone apart,
Hating the day, loving the mournful night:
Athelia, as I hie, does run before,
When as my fortune hard I do deplore.
Which having ended, forgetting both pen and paper, yea Sonnet and all behind
him, (as Neptune did his Trident, when Nereus had almost found him with a
Syrene) he resolved to range further into the unknown Forests. But as posting
time gives a period to all terrestrial accidents, so in roving from place to
place, without reaping so much as the blisful thought of one delectable
applause, he at last arrived to a fair Cypres tree, where resolving to sleep,
he was no sooner down, but (Love being impatient of delays) he rose again
instantly, determining to depart; yet desirous to write some Ditty (in
testimonial of his passions) although not knowing what to write, he busily in
his pocket searched for his Pen and Paper; but not finding it he immediately
drew out his poniard, and there on the Bark of the aforesaid Cypres tree (with
as much skill as his trembling hand could afford) he engraved (or carved) this
Ditty following* Thou Cypres tree,
If once thou see
My fair Athelia pass this way,
Tell her I came
To print her name,
Thereby my passions to display,
And let thy bark
Whereon I mark
This sacred Ditty of delight,
Say only Love
My hand did move
In secret sort it to Endite,
And without fear
Do witness bear.
On bended knee I do protest
Whiles death shall give
Me leave to live
To wear her Pourtraict in my breast.


Which having ended he very often kissed it, as if there remained some figured
resemblance of his Mistresses perfection. And so leaving the Fields, he again
returned to his melancholy Cel, where busying his brain about his Mistresses
beauty, we will instantly leave him to the fancy of his affections, and a
little entreat of almost forgotten Palma.

PALMA being by King Brylion appointed Lieutenant of Ithica-Castle, (wherein
the beautiful Mersilva was detained Prisoner) did, as having his heart inspired
with pity, grievously sorrow to see Porus his Captain so rigorously entreat
her: For whereas King Brylion did allow her a comely Chamber, a pleasant
Arboury, a correspondent Diet, and a Damsel to attend her; He on a sudden
withdrew from her all those aforenominated Privileges, placing her in a very
obscure Dungeon; where the thought of so detestable a Damp might have driven
Alexander himself into the labyrinth of conceited despair: for in stead of a
Garden for her walk, she had the only liberty of her close-Prison; her Diet
being of a homely fare, and that scarce enough to content nature; And in stead
of being attended on by some Lady, very basely served by an ugly ruffian, in
the furrows of whose angry brows it seemed envious wrath sat triumphant,
having from his Captain a strait command to hinder all those which (in her
distress) should aim to succor her, Mersilva perceiving her self to be bolted
up in this unmerciful Prison, (as a Climate contrary for her Complexion to
endure) exclaimed on Fortune, deploring that ever her tender years had attained
to the sight of so dismal aspect! But well might she weep, and having wept
return to weeping again, because there was no spectators of her lamentation!
and well might she lament, and having lamented, sigh again, because there were
none to solace her in the depth of her perplexed miseries! For if at any time
she bemoaned her self to her rigorous Keeper (with applausible reasons to
enduce him to pity) she was forthwith checked up with a dictionary of
reproaches, alleging that her entertainment exceeded her merits. Which as a
second wound, though the first deadly, did so transport her reason to the
profundity of complete anguish, that with wringing hands, and throbbing sighs,
as walking in her Citadel of despair, she to her tormented self breathed out
these speeches; PErplexed Mersilina! thou have now (being by experience taugh^)
just cause to acknowledge how inconstant Fortune does at her pleasure conduct
Princes to the top of prosperity; and immediately changing humor, and turning
the Needle of her Compass to another point, does violently tear the Bark of
their former estate against the dangerous shores of future perdition, where
suffering shipwreck, the memory of their happiness is immediately submerged in
the unmerciful intrailes of tyrannizing misfortune. Amongst the rest, a^
unfortunate Mersilva, thou may of that Camelion Tragedy term thy self a
prinipal actor; because the subject of thy present misery, has already as a
Prologue, accidentally mounted the Theater of destruction: most wretched
Mersilva! when the memory of thy birth does (through the Chaos of thy conceits)
pierce to the thought of considerration; And comparing dignities past to
calamities present: what terror of aggravation it does proffer to thy hope,
thou may (since knowing) well conjecture; whereas others (therewith
unacquainted) can scarcely presuppose. Ah, desolate Mersilva! how are thy
delicious delights now transmutated to melancholy contemplations! Thy pleasant
pastimes diverted to doleful mourning! and thy sweet sports metamorphosed to
sorrowful disconsolations! Ah, sure it is, (and therefore sure, because
ratified by the gods themselves) that glory does fade as well as flourish;
beauty dye as well as domineere; and honor wither, as the flower^ of the
Field, which no sooner sprout, with Titan, but die with Cynthia, what is then
the, world but a labyrinth of perplexities? What then is dignity? but the seat
of ambition? and what is Glory, but the throne of superbity? Ah Mersilva! but
such i^ the course of this terrestrial diadem, That being produced in sin, we
prosecute in folly; and never forbear to detest Virtue before ingulf'd in the
Stygian stream of Vice. Therefore account thy miseries, as a recompense
predestined for thy fortune* account thy torments, as a reward sent for thy
sin* and lastly, term thy calamities, as a meritorious affliction, projected
for thy misdemeanour.

Which doleful speeches she uttered with such ^ealous fervency, that the report
thereof would have caused Disdain her self to have pitied her; for sometimes
she walked (like mute Progne) in her miserable Cottage; and then instantly
threw her se^^ on her Bed of care, where drawing her Curta^^ close about her,
one might well deem it to (...) Tomb, and her self a dead Corpse, therein in
(...): when again reviving her spirits and remem; bring her misery, she would
sorrowfully smile-and instantly rebuke her self for committing so comical an
offense. Her Holland-Handkerchiffe (resembling the Caystrine Swans for
whiteness) she often washed with pearled tears (which distilled down the soil
of her sorrowful cheeks,) and then immediately dried him with fanning wind on
her face to arrouse her spirits: in which sorrowful sort she most grievously
past the day, without being comforted by the assistance of any; until at last
the exclamation of her mournful complaint (by good fortune) arriving to the
understanding of Princely Plivio, drove him to so instant an humor of
relentation, that knowing her to be a Princess most royally descended, as also
innocently imprisoned without committing any crime or scandalous malefaction to
the Crown or Kingdom of Zanfara: he being vanquished with debonair pity, burst
into these terms; WHY Plivio! can humanity suffer that so beautiful a Princess
as Mersilva should endure imprisonment, thy self being present? or, can the
dignity of that (divine) Sex obtain no more favor at thy hands, where thou
may by virtue of thy power bear sway? are thy senses so masked with
obscurity, thine eyes so obscured with im^iety, or thy heart so fraughted with
cruelty, that ^er tears cannot (to thee) sufficiently solicit for ^er
freedom; or her complaints, as advocates of ^er innocence, perfectly plead to
thee for her speedy enlargement? How may the world blame the^ of ingratitude?
how may thy conscience accuse thee of rigor? or, how may thy thoughts condemn
thee of tyranny? when the odio usnes of thy (impudent) fact, shall (with the
wind of report) arrive to the bar of (unpartial) discretion; where thy faults
being descried, and thy follies disclosed, what color of correspondent
argument can thou allege for thy excuse? or, what mask of sensibility can
thou produce to orevaile thy inhumanity? Ah Plivio! consider with thy self in
reason (unless exempt of all reason) from whence thou art extracted: if thou
say (as thou can not deny) from the loins of a woman, how falls it then
out, thou dfferest from so temperate a nature? or, if thou allege thy father
to be a Centaure, or thy mother a Prisciraxe; no marvel thou art so
perfidiously inclined to their devilish disposition. Ah, Plivio! recall thy
senses to the throne of Pity, and drown the rigorousnes of thy conceit, in the
vast gulf of oblivion: Let thy thoughts before thine eyes bear the Banner of
lenity; and let the Ensign of remorse pitch his Tent in the Camp of thy
cogitations: and, ungrateful Plivio, resolve, that to succor the distressed,
is a point of good nature, and to assist a tormented Lady, is a fact condignely
worthy commendation. What though Porus thy Captain hate her? is it therefore
cons^quent that thou should loath her? No Plivio, no, let not the suspicion
of inhumanity? obscure the appearance of thy benignity? nor let the thought of
perverse impiety drown the apparition of thy flourishing affability* but rather
let thy (demonstrative) actions savor of courtesy, and let thy resolutions be
tempered with charity; so shall thy contemplations be ^stablish^d of the Saints
for mere bountifulness; thy conceits accounted of all men for gracious
benignity, and thy debonaire nature of the gods themselves esteemed for
blisfull Piety.

Upon the ground of which applausible resolution, pricking forwards his breast
with the animosity of honor, he very resolutely determined to visit Mersilva.
So that giving wings to his courage, and liberty to his resolution, he
immediately directed his course to the place where she sorrowfully lay
imprisoned: where he was no sooner entered, but he might forthwith espy her
mournfully sitting on her Bed of misery, having her face overvailed with a
sable skarf, as if she partly loathed to see the appearance of delight some
Phoebus; when not securely sleeping, but rather dolefully slumbering, being by
his pace aroused from her pensive contemplations, she forthwith elevated her
self from her seat of sorrow, and ruffling aside her skarf, discovered the
whole substance of her singular Visage (as the most fair Phoebe being released
from the obscurity of the darksome clouds) from whence her radiant eyes
displayed their splendent influence as fixed Stars divinely seated in the
(b^autifull fi^ld of) cel^stial Element, so she attending his coming, he
boldly approached her (where with an humble reverence) after he had most
courteously saluted her he borded her in this sort.

MOst fair Princess! I am at last come to your delectable presence, as a
guilty offender to crave pardon for my forepast crime, (in that I which within
this Castle may something command, have so long defered from affording you
consolation:) But sweet Mersilva! my Captains command was the Rein that
(inhumanely) withheld me from prosecuting my pretense; who being now departed
to the Court, if you please to walk into the Fields (or Gardens here next
adjoining) to recreate your self in taking the fresh air, I will accompany
you assuring you that if this Castle possess any thing which may pleasure or
serve you, you shall not only command it, but my (voluntary) assistance
likewise. Mersilva seeing this (unknown) Gentleman proffer her such kindness,
dying her Crystal Cheeks with a Vermilion blush, (which it seemed Hope had of
purpose instantly sent her) very courteously returned him this applausible
answer.

GEntleman, my vanquished Hope (which already has been transported to the brim
of despair) being now by the wind of your benign news again infused within
the stream of consolation, does for this your debonaire courtesy render you
many millions of affectionate thanks; and, gracious Knight! since of
(unmerited) kindness you proffer me this sweet comfort, I will not deny your
(Nect^r) demand, but account my self fortunate to enjoy the air of the
fragrant Fields. Plivio perceiving how exceeding glad she was to sign her
prison a general a^quittance, (and again how willing to walk in the gardens)
kissing his hand and very kindly taking her by the arm, he conducted her by a
Post^rn gate (through the Castle) to the Fields, and from thence to the Arbours
of pleasure: where Mersilva delighting to range from Bank to Bo^der, and from
Fountain to Bower, leaving in a manner no place therein unprospected, she at
last arrived to a very sumptuous Cistern; whose walls being of clear glistering
Alabaster and shining Marble, gave such a complete grace to Mersilva's
(partial) eyes, that her spirits at so pleasant a prospect did then receive the
long looked for motion of delightful contentment: so at last hearing the descent
of some issu^d stream (which as it seemed made a musical acord, in falling to
the concavity of the earth) she (taking her ear to be her guide) began to trace
about the circumference of the aforesaid Cistern, where she forthwith espied on
the eastern side thereof (some Ell distant one from the other) two stately
Pillars of Dove-white Ivory, being very curiously carved and begirt about with
diverse spacious guards of refined Azure, wherein were enameled both lovely
Roses, and splendent Stars of most beautiful and artificial ingeny; on which
Pillars tops stood two female Images most industriously painted, well
resembling the Graces, each holding in their outward hands a little Vane,
whereon one side was painted Minerva, and on the other Diana; and joining their
other hands (which they elevated over their heads) did support the third Grace,
being crowned with an Olympian Garland, holding in both her hands a Table of
Celestial hue, seated in a frame of illustrious Argent, from out whose six
globy Paps resembling for whiteness the snow which does embrace the Pyrenian
Mountains, rushed forth clear Crystal spout^ of silver water; wherewith she
being with too much joy for a whiles ravished, at last perceived (betwixt the
two Pillars) a pretty conceited Geometrical door therein to enter, where
entering she saw a small Mountain in form of a Pyramides, which did attain unto
the top of the Cistern, from whence Nature (being by divine instinct commanded)
did yield forth full many a Vein of weeping water, which by degrees distilled
down the Rock, was lastly through Pipes of Silver by ingenious art, most
curiously conveyed to the Graces Paps, which Mersilva seeing (and shutting the
door) resolved to depart; but by chance again thereon reflecting her sight (as
unwilling so soon to take her farewell) and glancing her eyes at random upon
the perfection of the upper Grace, (she either deluded with a shadow, frumpt at
with a Fancy, or how I know not) immediately conceived that she saw her
artificial eyes naturally reflect in the Model of their influence, and so being
in conceit induced that it was so, or else thinking that at the request of some
second Pygmalion, the Goddess Venus had with life likewise inspired her; She
resolved with her self that the said Grace although how she knew not) had
interiorly some lively feeling of Natural sense, and applying it as the
illusion of her fantasy drove her, conjectured that she invited her (more
near) to approach, In respect whereof, mounting a step which stood (very close)
before the Graces, she thought of them, but especially of the uppermost, to
have some secret conference: where being elevated she forthwith forgot her
self, (as if some sacred Deity had so before predestined it) and after was
instantly put in mind of her doleful calamities, whereat much lamenting, she
blushed with shame in that she had committed so sottish an absurdity: when
looking about her and not seeing Plivio there espying the blew Table which the
Grace held in her hand, she from out her golden hair drew her glorious
Head-bin, and so essaying and finding the stone tractable, (recalling her Muse
to her sorrowful humor) in fair letters, Ala Romanisto, she thereon indicted
this Sonnet.

Fortune is frail and changes with the wind,
Riches does fade and Beauty soon does fly,
Honor is dross, and Glory now I find
With Times instinct does in oblivion die.
What then is Riches but a Summers shower?
What then is Beauty, but a Winters-blaze?
What then is Honor but a withering-flower?
Or what is Glory but the worlds amaze?
Riches and Beauty, Honor, Glory, all,
Are they not subject to Times Deity?
Yes time does cause their splendour for to fall
At the assignement of his Soveraginty.
Whiles thus Mersilva was overviewin^ the pride of this sumptuous garden,
Plivio commanded a very gallant banquet to be there prepared; the which most
kindly in an Eglantine-Bower he presented her: And to make her Cates seem the
more pleasant, he so ordained that a Consort of Lutes, together with three
tender Eunuchs, should (in her hearing) warble forth melodious harmony. So in
this delectable manner for a whiles they deluded the time, wherein Plivio never
failed to glance his eye on the sweet Object of Mersilva's Beauty* the which
Cupid (at unawares) espying, immediately bent his Bow and let fly an arrow,
headed with Desire, and feathered with affection; which so forcibly hit Plivio
to the heart, that he immediately fainted at the stroke, so that now he
acknowledged no Goddess but Citherea, no Saint but Venus, nor no Lord but
Love, so that his breast being penetrated with the influence of amorous
contemplation, after having reconducted Mersilva to the Castle, he bying to his
Chamber, alone to himself breathed out these speeches: HOw now Plivio! what in
a moment vanquished in the field of Beauty? or has Cupid such power at the
first approach to penetrate thy breast with affection? can thy resolutions,
which were devoted to Bellona now stoop to Venus, and so make (Laurel) Garlands
in her praise, whereas heretofore thou disdainedst her society? what, will thou
fondly imbathe thy Capacity in the stream of Amorous contemplation, and (so
albeit to thy prejudice) devote thy Oraisons to the Altar of Lo^^? Beware,
Parma! The Syrenes have sweet voices, ye^ deceitful; the Panthers fair skins,
yet infectious; and the Amazons beautiful faces, yet mere dissemblers. What?
Helen was fair, yet a Wanton; Thais was lovely, yet lewd; and Simiramis, though
curious yet a Courtezan. But alas Plivio! One matter makes not a Maxim; nor
does forepast examples include general actions: for speak without partiality,
and thy conscience will plead, that as there has been a wanton Helen, so a
wise Galliope; As a lewd Thais, so a chaste Lucretia; and as a vicious
Semiramis, so a virtuous Susanna: therefore Plivio, retire not with shame, but
advance with valor; (For as the Poets report, Faint heart never plucked fruit
from the tree of Love:) Consider Plivio, with thy self, what Mersilva is; and
then as in the Mirror of Ve^ity, thou shall perceive her to be, of Descent a
Princess, of Qualities a Queen, of Beauty an Angel, and of perfection the
only Phoenix of her Sex. Who then but would like such a Virgin? who then but
would love such a Paragon? Nay, who but would (upon the altar of Humanity)
sacrifice his life in the behalf of so sweet a Saint?

Thus embathing his Capacity in the ( Nectar) Aganippe of Amorous
contemplation, and solacing his senses in the ( Tempe) stream of Mersilva's
Beauty, he remained so tosticated in conceit, that no plaudite could please
him, but the Idea of his fair Mistress; no thought content him unless sprung
from her majestical virtue; nor no imagination delight him, unless derived
from the pure Model of her rare perfection: So as burning with desire to
display his pretense, he at last with a trembleing resolution indicted this
Letter, which (by a trusty Messenger) he sent to fair Mersilva, the Heavenly
QUEEN of his Humane imagination^.

SWeet Lady! I heretofore infused this period to my Resolutions: That the power
of Cupid was peevish; the Instinst of Love, lewd; and the Influence of Cytherea
vicious. But now, dear Mersilva, (and therefore dear, because Mersilva)
having sent the eyes of my Capacity to rang upon the superexcellent soil of
your Beauty, and finding the Model thereof to be repleated with the physnomie
of Majestical grace, I was instantly so surprised with a Favorable censure,
That abandoning my former invective cruelty, I forthwith bent my devotion to
the Altar of your flourishing excellency; Wherefore, amorous Princess! since I
repose the prime of my delight, in contemplating upon the Idea of your rare
perfection, and derive my chiefest solace from the lovely Index of your
angelical Personage, by so much the more seek to counterveile my love with the
recompense of your friendship: and let an applausible answer be the
(meritorious) guerdon of my constant fidelity. I will not in depainting my
passions, seek to tosticate your conceits with (the prolixitie of) a tedious
Epistle; because the report is, Many words umbrage desimulation: therefore
sweet Angel of my breast, and goddess of my cerebrosity, (I beseech you)
penetrate your capacity with this brief principle, that Plivio must perforce
either affect Mersilva, or hate himself; and ever account Mersilva till
eternity to be the (divine) (...)


Bonnet, he forthwith accomplished his Ladies command, Plivio not knowing from
whom it came, very busily unript the Seals, and so without further prolixity of
literature-introduction, he directed his sight to the Signers name; where
finding the consonants of Mersilva to be charactered, whether his thoughts were
then obscured with divine conceits, or his breast replenished with many
ravishing contemplations: I refer the censure thereof to those Gallants which
have likewise enjoyed the essence of the like sacred tenuity: Yet sure I am,
that the sight of this divine pre^^nt did not only solace our dispairfull
Plivio, but likewise infused a sudden encouragement to his tormented malady;
that embracing the Epistle in his hand, he very often kissed the Nectar-oracle of
Mersilva's name, and with many pearled tears, seconded with affectionat^ sighs,
instantly paid thereof the Bien venue. But at last, calling his thoughts to a
retreat, and sounding the drum of Discretion to refresh his senses, he orderly
mounted the steps of the Letters preamble, and so with the Sun again
descending, overviewed sincerely thereof the substance; which being not
contrived to his humors complexion, nor complotted after the fashion of his
distempered fancy, he instantly raged and stormed, as if the demonstration of
his fumes were to be presented upon the Theater of folly; sometimes he would
stamp, and in a moment stare, as if his brains had been besotted with a
lunatic frenzy; then curse Cupid because h^ was contrary to his enterprise;
and yet instantly yield many million^ of thank^ to gracious Venus for investing
him a servant to so sweet a Mistres^, when repeating the name of Mersilva, he
would thereat quietly sit down and slumber, as though the Deity of that sacred
word had some charming authority to lul him asleep; and again rise, and with
detestable reproaches rebuke his eyes, because they so unfortunately anchored
upon the Sand of Mersilva's Beauty. The Page being all this while spectator of
Plivio's tormented passions; and knowing that it was only his Mistress
Mersilva's refusal, which begirt him in that perplexity; instantly (leaving him
to his passions) departed, when being arrrived to his Mistresses presence, he
failed not in the highest degree to depaint her the manifestation of the
Gentleman's malady; as also the melancholy humor of his perplexed calamity.
Which Mersilva no sooner understood, but being afresh inflamed with his
affection, she very suddenly in her Princely breast conceived a motion of
remorse; being exceedingly sorry that her occasion should administer the sparks
of his aggravation: when separating her self from company, she betook her to
her Closet (resolving to breath out her passions to her alone) where she was no
sooner arrived, but the Princess Athelia knocking at the door, came to pass
the time with her, as also to invite her self for that night her Bedfellow.
Mersilva smothering up her sorrows under the mask of a merry countenance, bade
her (outwardly) welcome (For her inward contemplations ranged upon the Idea of
Plivio) And so they with familiar dalliance, and friendly conference deluded
the time, till Suppe^ being done, and the skies overvail'd with the canopy of
obscure night, they both betook themselves to their Bed; where both, but
(especially Mersilva) slept with a watchful countenance, (as having their
conceits tracing upon their Favorites perfections. Till splendent Aurora, the
joyful messenger of Phoebus, had no sooner in combat conquered the vastal
Night, and so given the sable Clouds a valorous overthrow; but radiant Titan
transpiercing his darts through their Damask-curtains, early in the morn, made
Mersilva arise; who without any noise (leaving Athelia in bed) apparelled her
self, directing her course to the Fields, when circumferencing diverse pleasant
Meadows, she at last arrived to a fragrant Mountain, where not only finding
that the Spring did present her with a delicious umbrage, but also that Phoebus
had there exh^led the Balmy-drops from the face of Flora she very lovely (on
the verdant grass) most majestically laid her down, (having a bush of
Eglantin^ branches (interlaced with Couslips) in her hand, not only to repulse
the Rays of ardent Olympus, but also to keep off the Gnats and Bees which
delighted to range upon the bloomy Roses of her Damask-cheeks; where pensively
contemplating with her senses, she at last breathed out these speeches: AH
Mersilva! how are thy conceits now suddenly caught in the snares of affection!
and how are thy delightful pleasures now diverted to amorous passions! Can the
model of thy capacity, which heretofore could receive no impression, become now
tractable to receive any print? and must thy tender breast be so soon given
over to affection?

Which words she had no sooner uttered, but casting aside her fight, she might
very plainly perceive her (unexpected) Plivio approach, wherereat exceedingly
blushing (because such fortunate news incharmed her purpled blood to assemble)
she immediately prepared herself to entertain him; who being arrived (as the
Praeludium of his blissfulness) imboldned himself to kiss her, wherein he so
exquisitely delighted, that he absolutely resolved, her coral lips had
attractive power, on so sweet a soyl^ to make his domestical demeur; but at
last recalling his senses (though unwilling to depart from so sacred a solace)
and sitting her down on a proper bank) which the Lady May had made the more
pleasant in bestowing for his recognisance a uerdant livery) regarding her very
lovingly, and straining her modesty by her Lily hand, at last (though affection
a long time had made his tongue silent) with a trembling Rhetorical voice he
laid his fiege in this sort.

MOst beautiful Mersilva! My humane eyes no sooner reflected their aspects upon
the dainty soil of your divine beauty, but I immediately felt my breast
inspired with the sudden flames of lovely Citherea; the which in respect my
abrupt Epistle can hardly relate, I am now on purpose come to present my
faithful service to your sacred benignity protesting that in heart I alone
adore your exqu^sit^ self, as the Celestial Image to whom I bind and consecrate
my earthly devotions: therefore, fair Mersilva, I beseech you to return my
Love affection, my Courtesy kindness, and my Suit acceptance, that triumphing
over fortune, I may give despair a farewell, and so again cherish my afflicted
hope, with the joy which your delectable self shall engender in my more then
joyful imaginations. Mersilva well noting with what zealous affection he
pronounced his speeches, could instantly have found in her heart to condescend
to his so reasonable request, but (though transported with Love) thinking so
soon to yield, were in her sex a point of imprudency, she at last framed him
this answer.

PLIVIO! The fairest flowers do commonly harbor the fowlest wasps; and where
the stream seems most delectable, it is often most dangerous; sweet words are
but counterfeit shadows for deceit; and when the sky seems clear, it
commonly presageth a storm, Men in these days resemble the pictures of Ianus,
which can fit a color for every countenance, and a fancy for every favor;
therefore as I will trust none, so I mean not to try any; lest reposing
confidence unadvisedly, I buy repentance too dear, and so discretion coming
too late, cry peccavi out of season. Diana's maxims in my capacity are not so
soon evaporated, neither will I so prejudice my quality as to account Venus my
patroness; in the mirror of experience I daily see the downfall of diverse, in
respect whereof, by others harms I mean to beware. Therefore, Plivio, if thou
leavest thy suit, I will perchance love thee as a friend; or, if the contrary,
assuredly hate thee as an enemy. Plivio perceiving his Saint to fight always
under the Banner of cruelty, (as also that she held his fidelity in suspect)
Having his tosticated Mus^ ingulph'd in the Ocean of perplexity, did a long
time remain silent; but again reflecting his regards upon the daintiness of
her (excelling) beauty, he rousing his spirits, answered her as follows.

WHy fair Mersilva, one Swallow makes not a Summer, nor does forepast matters
include future maxims: Affection comes by destiny, not by device; and is
therefore natural, not artificial; it is hard to censure of my qualities by
others conditions, and very difficult to judge of my affections by others
infidelity; therefore because you mistrust that many circumstances overvaile
inconstancy, I will cease only with this sincere protestation; That my Love to
Mersilva is firm, not fickle; faithful, not fained; and so grounded upon the
rock of immovable, entire amity, that as my days shall demonstrate my
perpetual affection, so my death shall testify my immortal Fid^lity* Mersilva
understanding this his constant resolution, (as being penetrated to the quick
with the dart of Cupid) immediately blushed in such amorous sort, that she
could scarce refrain from condescending to his demand; but at last danting her
Vermilion complexion with a modest countenance, she briefly returned him this
sharp Reply.

WHy Plivio, it is high time to impose a conclusion to our conference, since
the theme whereon you descant proceeds from folly; for if you conjecture that
my conceits will stoop to the (alluring) bait of Love, you dec^ive your Hope
with a vain absurd imagination, and only with the Mastiffs of Cirum bark
against the Moon. What I outwardly speak, I in heart inwardly presuppose;
therefore ground the Anchors of your speech in the sands of silence; and
presume not to present her with the Pills of your Love, which esteems not any
way of your affection. Here perplexed Plivio was on the point to answer her
Poetry. But Mersilva perceiving by the mutability of his countenance, to what
harbor he still directed his course; very suddenly without taking Conge,
departed; where leaving him to his perplexities, and her to her passions, we
will for a while err from their proceedings, and a little entreat of Prince
Medors adventures.

PRince Maedor, as before you have heard, having gotten the good will of the
Princess Florina, and settled his affection in the soyles of her memory, was in
the prime of his hope and entrance of his expectation frustrated by King Agenor
her Father, because he utterly denied to match his Daughter with him, in
respect of an ancient quarrel between Maedors Father and himself. So that
Maedor seeing he could not obtain his purpose, nor so much as confer with his
desired Florina, (because the King her Father had to that effect conveyed her
secretly to the Country, he immediately (perwiging his Capacity with Honor)
resolved for a whiles to travel, hoping that the influence of time would raze
out the residence of the Kings indignation: So as assummoning his wits to
appear before the Theater of Discretion, he at last determined by Sea to
voyage to the Isle of Madagasear, there to remain with his Uncle Duke Alphonso.
But yet, if departing without Conge of his Saint, she might meritoriously
rebuke him of ingratitude, he determined to send her a Letter: and so taking
ink and paper, the tears standing in his eyes, he wrote to this effect. To the
most fair Princess FLORINA, Eternal Contentation.
SWeet Lady! Destiny resolving to metamorphose our pleasant Nectar into bitter
Aconitum, has doubtless instigated the King your Father, to bind his
invective malice against our innocence: So that dear Florina) I must depart,
and being constrained to lose the paradise of thy angelical personage, live, I
know not where in the Acheron of exact Hell; Oh Camelion Fortune! not faithful
in any thing, but in absurd infidelity! How can I live without fixing mine eyes
upon the Beauty of fair Florina? and losing her sight, how can I demeure upon
this vain earth, without drowning my self in the brinish tears which distill
from the Conduit of mine eyes? But such (fair Princess!) is my fortune, nay
unfortunate fortune, because the Gods in the Synod of their resolutions have
imposed it for a period to commence my misery; nay more then so, I think,
ratified it for a plague to impale me within the circumference of endless
disconsolation. But sweet (Florina!) in what desolate place soever I erect my
residence, my contemplations shall range upon the Idaea of your Beauty, and my
Capacity ruminate upon the Physnomie of your perfections: For in the Closet of
my distempered breast I will establish the Image of your sweet Personage; and
daily upon the Altar of Love sacrifice scalding sighs, in testimonial of my
immovable affection; Therefore, heavenly Paragon of my Capacity, and earthly
Queen of my imaginations, pluck up your courage from the profundity of sorrow,
and resolve, that maugre the treachery of fortune, or the cruelty of the fates,
I will shortly return, and despite destiny crown our amity with the triumph of
contentation, Therefore, sweet Florina, till again I am blessed by enjoying the
celestial substance of your sacred presence, I will rest as I am (and till
death mean to be) that is, ever constant to Florina, or always faithless to
my self.

Your vowed and devoted Servant Maedor,


Which having ended, he forthwith delivered to a Gentleman of his to convey;
and so at Galathio finding a ship ready to s^t sail for Madagascar, he
immediately therein departed; where being a long time floating upon the back of
Nereus, and having past the Isle of Maio Cape Verd, and Cape bone fortune, he
was, at last betwixt the Bay St. Anne and Isle Fernando, overtaken by a cruel
tempestuous storm; which continuing a long time, forced them to stop at L'
Golpho Delfei in Africa; where getting the shore, and finding himself weak by
reason of his sea-sicknesse, he instantly vowed there to make his demeur, and
so taking leave of his ship-master, and bestowing his liberality upon the
Company, he there betook himself (as aforesaid) to erect his residence; till at
last being advertised by a Merchant of Tormano, that the Court of Zanfara was
the Rendezvous of the flower of Chivalry, he determined thither to travel: In
which journ^y, some ten Leagues from the Court, by chance straying into a
Forest, and arriving to a solitary Cottage, those situation in all things
corresponded with his distasteful passions, he (all prepositions to the
contrary) resolved there to make his abode; the better to delude the doleful
time whiles he was absent from his fair Florina, (For to a lover separated from
his Saint, there is nothing so agreeable, as solitariness, which always
prsents him opportunity to record his amourous passions apart.) And the better
to mask his secrecy from the sight of neighboring spectators, he shrouded
himself in a Hermites weed, seeming outwardly to all passengers, the chief
inhabitant of that vast^ll Grove; where forgetting his former dignity, and
solacing himself with the remembrance of his fair Florina, he a long time lived
as a man which had forsaken the alluring jollities of this fickle world,
devoted his soul to the only enjoying of celestial felicities. But love which
still pierced him to the quick (with the beauty of his Mistress) would not so
abandon this her amorous favorite, but so tyrannously intosticated his
conceits with ardent flames of affection, that thinking to sleep, Cupid would
permit Morpheus no entertainment; but enforced him diverse times to arise, and
pourtray forth his passions in affirmation of his fidelity: where amongst many
Sonnets and Elogies which he penned in memory of his absent Florina, I will not
omit to relate these three following; because they are partly incident to the
accomplishing of this our History.

The first he framed in an arboury adjoining to his Hermitage, which displayes
the Beauty of his Saint, to this effect following: The picture of Florina fair,
Within my breast does finely spring
Her lovely self and beauty rare
Unto my senses joys does bring.
Her sweet delightful color pure,
Unto my throbbed thoughts does send
Some hope of constant love secure,
Which dainty Love I still attend.
Her constant Eyes like Stars most bright,
Does always shine within my mind.
Her Lily hew and lovely sight
Printed within my breast I find.
Her cherry-Cheeks of taint most fair,
In snow white fields does lurk and lie;
Her coral-Lips like pastures rare,
Does force me there for food to fly.
Her azured Veins like Rivers pure
Through dainty soyls does fleet and run,
Her slender Waste did soon procure
My steadfast love long since begun.
Her speech most sweet unto my mind
At all times ease for grief does send;
Her pretty pace, behavior kind,
Likewise some show of love does lend.
Her modest grace, Vermilion hue,
Like Claret-colour fair does show;
Her self, her sight, and smiles most true,
In love with her did make me grow.
Her Beauty fair at first epsy
Enforced my mind her self to love:
Therefore Florina, till I die,
Most constant to your self I Will prove.


The second, approving his Constancy, he coined in his Closet, which was as
follows: You little Birds, fly swiftly to my Dear,
And there unfold my faithful constancy:
Tell her, my loyal Love shall firm appear,
And whiles I live, all others I defy:
Unfold my mind, and make her know for sure,
Her Grace and Beauty did my Love procure.
You whistling Winds, go tell my Mistress fair,
That still till death her Beauteous self I love;
Disclose to her, that first her taint most rare
To Cupids lure my tender Breast did move:
Vow, swear and plead by right of reasons law,
That first her sight my Breast to love did draw.
You Sun-bright Beams of Phoebus splendant light,
When with your golden Hair through azured Skie^
You wipe the Dew from dainty flowers bright;
Go tell my Mistress, that her piercing Eyes
At first prospect did so my heart inchain,
That constant to her still I must remain.
You pleasant Flowers which in fair Gardens spring,
Relate unto my sweetest Saint most fair,
That still her abscence does annoyes me bring,
And always does my joy with grief impair:
Go plainly tell that when I lose her sight,
My Sun is soon obscured with darkesome night.
You stately Woods, inform my Phoenix fair,
That on your lofty verdant trees most tall,
I have with faithful Pen, as well elsewhere,
Engraved her name which first did work my thral,
And written for her sake full many a rhyme,
In dainty morn of lady May's chief prime.
You Valleys fair, in midst whereof does run
Sweet silver streams of dainty water pure:
Go tell my goddess, that my love begun,
Till death, and after death must needs endure,
Run swiftly, run, and swear, till final end,
A thousand sighs for her sweet sake I send.


The third is the description of a Dream, which he in his sleep conceived to
this effect: When darksom night began to vest apace
Her Vlie Mantle on the Sun-bright day;
When Clouds obscure resolved to run their race,
And with the pale-fac'd-Moon to sport and play;
Lo then, even then as slumbering on my Bed,
A lovely Dream ore-whelm'd my drowsy head.
Me thought I saw my Florina fair
Sitting alone in princely modest sort,
Within the circuit of a golden Chair;
Where with her tears her heavenly hair did sport,
In night attire, a Co^f of Holland pure,
Whereas she sighed, and sometimes slept secure.
A Cloak of milk-white Damask did she bear
All lined with azured Satin end for end;
And likewise under that, a robe did wear
Of blushing skarlet, which did to me send
The sight (fair sight) of Velvet Slippers pure,
Wherein her naked Feet did rest endure.
Her Color pale, and yet as Crystal clear,
Did freshly shine within her Angel face;
Her cherry Lips whereon delight did pear,
Again did deck her hue with lovely grace,
Grace so complete, as Art can never blame,
Nor once the like Dame nature may not frame.
And yet amid'st her Lily Cheeks did spring
A bloomy Rose of Crymson sanguine hue;
Which sight unto my gladsom breast did bring
Celestial joy^, which did my heart subdue.
Her splendant Eyes like Stars divinely bright,
Did shine most fair, within my fancies sight;
Sight which did force my trembling self to trace
Unto the presence of my beauteous Dear,
Where when she saw me with a princely grace
She roused her spirits, yet fraughted with some fear*
Began to sigh, in the midst her sighs did say,
Oh, welcome Maedor! Fear fly now away.
And then me thought, Oh! I with arms outspread
Did softly take my fair Florina kind,
And laid her on her dainty maiden Bed
Whereto in honest sort I always lined,
And gave her many a time a chaste sweet kiss,
Which then was sole contentment of my bliss;
Whereas she soon with lovely tears did pray,
And praying blushed, and blushing prayed again,
That I would then Dame Honors hes^s obey,
And from all Venus-toyes my self refrain:
Whereto at first, I soon did condescend,
And so in talk we both the time did spend.
At last in trembling sort, she faltering said,
Since ( Parma) now thou have performed my will,
And instantly my dear command obay'd,
No doubt hereafter thou shall joy thy fill:
For Jove will grant, where men aright require,
In honest sort their chiefest hearts desire.
Which having said, away she clean did fade,
Quite from my sight in twinkling of an eye,
And so from slumbering sleep mine eyes soon made
The fresh Aurora quickly to epsy:
When day was come, I knew 'twas but a Dream,
Whereof the thought does breed me woes extreme.


IT were too tedious to relate from point to point the austere life which
Prince Maedor in this solitary Grove led. Therefore let this suffice: Tha^
being pestered with ardent affection, he finally vowed to devote the pilgrimage
of his days to Florina^^ service, and protested to adore her as the sacred
Deity to whom he dedicated the generality of his terrestrial devotions.
Therefore leaving him to hi^ disconsolate living, and his tormented Conceits to
be solaced by patience; We will again entreat wha^ befell Prince Thalmo, and
his fair Athelia.

THALMO, as you have heard, perceiving his Athelia to be always devoted to
cruelty, and conjecturing with himself that she triumphed of his martyrdom,
being overcome with Love, and fraughted with affection, could reap no rest of
his Conceits, until he was made fortunate by prospecting the object of her
singular Beauty. So that resolving to speak with her, and knowing her in the
next adjoining A^bour, he boldly advancing his pace, saluted her in this sort.

MOst fair Athelia! the nature of Planets is to have each his Influence: and
therefore I am of purpose come, to know whether you are diverted from your
accustomed cruelty.

Athelia blushing to see Thalmo present; yet shadowing her love under the mask
of coyness, very soon returned him this sharp Answer: FOnd Thalmo! If Planets
have power to transform manners, then I hope your old Folly is metamorphosed to
new Discretion. For my part, ^ remain as I was accustomed; and if you the like,
^hen as you came unlooked for, you may depart ^hen you please.

Thalmo seeing he was so peremptorily answered, ^rosecuted his purpose in this
sort following: WHy fair Athelia, should I which from the birth of your first
aspect have been to you faithful* bec^me now to your Deity inconstant* Or would
you counsel me to divert my forepast affection into future hatred?

Whereunto Athelia replied: THalmo, thy hatred does more please me then thy
affection, and yet I care little for both, and for thy self less.

Thalmo being ready to answer her, was instantly by Levina her Gentlewoman
prevented, who came of purpose to attend her Mistress; the which no sooner
espied, but vailing his Bonnet with a sorrowful resolution he departed, raging
against Cupid in respect he had predestined him to serve so cruel a
Mistress: when walking apart in a private place there next adjoining, he
espied his Saint Athelia to direct her course to the Court: by virtue whereof
re-entring the Arbor, and liying himself to the Bower, he there espied A
Nosegay which Athelia had left behind her; whereunto very often smeling, he at
last, at so fantastical ^ Subject, indicted this ensuing Ditty.

Say Crimson-Rose and dainty Daffadil,
With Violet blew;
Since you have seen the Beauty of my Saint,
And eke her view:
Did not her sight (fair sight) you lovely fill
With sweet delight
Of Goddess grace and Angels sacred taint
In fine most bright?
Say, golden Prim-rose, sanguine Couslip fair,
With Pinck most fine;
Since you beheld he Visage of my Dear,
And Eyes divine:
Did not her ^loby Front, and glistering Hair,
With Cheeks most sweet,
So gloriously like Damask flowers appear,
The gods to greet?
Say, snow white Lily, speckled Gilly-flower,
With Daisie gay;
Since you have viewed the Queen of my desire,
In brave array:
Did not her Ivory Paps, fair Venus Bower,
With heavenly glee
Of Juno's grace, conjure you to require
Her face to see?
Say Rose, say Daffadil, and Violet blew,
With Primerose fair;
Since you have seen my Nymphs sweet dainty-face,
And gesture rare:
Did not, bright Couslip, bloomy Pinck, her view
White Lily, shine,
Ah Gilly flowers, and Daisie, with a grace!
Like Stars divine?
Having thus breathed out his Passion upon the fragrant Nose-gay, and yet
therewith nothing applaused, continually burning in conceit, to see his ^^ire
Athelia absent, he at last, resolved to find her ^ecretly in her Closet: where
very pensively entering, and not seeing her there, finding her Standish on the
Table directly open; he on a fair Paper, which of purpose he brought with him,
indicted this ensuing Sonnet: Earths only Phoenix, Map of Modesty,
Angel of grace, pure Paragon of praise:
Ah, from your breast now banish cruelty,
That yet in fine, some hope I may eraise!
Fair Saint, bright sovereign of my tender breast,
Sweet Nymph, dear darling of heavens Deity,
How may my Muse with endless grief oprrest
Display the pourtract of my misery!
Ah sure, my Muse, nor yet Parnassus tr^in
Cannot relate my burning hearts desire;
Beceause in Beauties fire I do remain*
Fire, which I fear will life and breast destroy.
Will lovely fire destroy both life and all?
Then welcome death sweet actor of my ease:
Ah on thy sacred influence I call,
Because thy tortures best my mind does please.
Come Death! else, Dear, invest my suit with Love;
With Love which of your self I do implore,
That so your bashful sweet consent may move
Jove's Deity my life for to restore.
Else minion of my thoughts, fair Saint, farewell,
Farewell my joy, my breasts sweet ecstasy,
And Cupid to the world now weeping tell,
That firm and constant to my Nymph I die.


The which having ended, he very zealously kissed* and doubting whether she would
for that night have occasion to use her Standish, took the Sonnet, and laid it
fairly on her milk-white Pillow; where falling on his knees, and praying that
his service might be accepted, he ex tempore (as having his Muse bedewed with
the Chrystaline water of Aganippe) to himself uttered these Verses.

Imperial Cupid! on whose shrine
I do present my Passions rage,
And to whose Altar I resign
My faithful love, which I engage
Here on my knees I thee require,
That my Athelia now may find
This bashful Sonnet, whose desire
Is to enjoy an answer kind:
And let his sight have perfect leave
Her cruel Breast to mollify;
That my pretense may once receive
Some sacred sign of amity.
Which words pronounced, he (giving her dainty Chamber a solemn Conge)
immediately directed his course to the Court; where he was no sooner arrived,
but a superbious Page apparell^d in crimson, with a lofty resolution, delivered
him these proved speeches. Sir, Prince Almion my master, being certified of the
love thou bear the Princess Athelia (affecting her beauty more firmly than
thy self) protests his Valor thy Rival; and to the intent thou shall know
his courageous determination, he has by me sent thee this resolute defiance,
which I here d^liver thee. The which Thalmo opening found to this effect
therein contained: THou proud Arabian! Being by the wind of a true report
informed of thy aspiring affections; and seeing thou take the Lady Athelia,
to be thy Saint, which the world knows I have (with honor) so long served:
My courage disdaining to digest so unpleasant a disgrace, has by virtue
thereof sent thee this defiance, commanding thee, that as thou pretend^st thy
l^ve to Athelia faithful thou alone in the Castle trench after Dinner (with
thy Rapier drawn) meet me, where I will teach thy lewdness to cross my Love,
and make thee know, that in all things, thou have abused thy superior: And so
expecting thy ans^er, together with thy accept^nce, I rest,

Thy mortal Foe, Almion Prince of Calexi^.




Thalmo wondering to hear such unexpected news, and yet disdaining to be
outbraved by any Zanfarian Seignior, boldly by his own Page returned him this
answer: Understanding (Almion) by the tenor of thy defiance that for my Love to
Athelia, thou profferest me Combat* Know that my nature is such, that I
disdain, for her sake to refuse any; and so in token of acceptance, I herewith
send thee my Gantlet; assuring thee that if I live, I will at the time and
place assigned meet thee, To demonstrate that my affection is such to Athelia,
that whilst I live, I will dedicate my love to her Service; and neither thy
valor (nor fear of death) shall raze her resemblance out of my memory: and so
charging thee not to fail to accomplish thy Promise; I in hope thereof remain,

Thy professd En^my, Thalmo.




The Combat (as you have heard) being appointed, and the hour come, Thalmo
according to his promise failed not to present himself; where, instead of
meeting his Rival Almion, he was (there) very treacherously encountered by a
crew of despera^e Ruffians, which (of purpose) were there by Almion placed in
an Ambuscado to destroy him; who seeing they so fiercely approached him,
instantly began to fit himself to defend their fury: where with a magnanimous
courage he dealt such gallant blows amongst them, that at first, not able to
endure his manhood, they were generally forced to retire: but after stretching
their Veins, and redoubling their strength, they very valourously (as being
d^sperate servants) flew upon him, where they so manfully behaved themselves
that Thalmo not able to withstand their force, was glad to retire, and take the
Castle wall for his defense; where he so valiantly behaved himself, that for
recompense of their treachery, he made many of them b^ar the badge of his
Cicilian Blade: but in fine, their force bearing sway, and their number
masterdome, he unfortunately received many dangerous wounds; from whence such
abundance of his Vermil-blood distilled, that finding his body weak, and
feeling his senses fail him, thinking there was no way but death, falling to
the ground, and gasping as he thought his last, he in memory of his dear
Athelia breathed out these speeches: Lo now my blood shall testify
To sweet Athelia's amity,
How constant Thalmo did remain,
When death his life almost did gain.


But now remark how fortune never fails to assist fidelity! For Thalmo had no
sooner uttered these his speeches, But Prince Plivio being there in a slumber
behind a Bank next adjoining, hearing the name of Thalmo repeated, immediately
started up; and seeing the Prince his Cousin to be in danger amongst these
rageful Ruffians, very suddenly (as having his breast inspired with part of his
Associates calamities) stepped to his assistance: where making way with his
sword, he again lifted him on his feet, and so praying his Cousin to be of
courage, stepped to his Adversaries, where he distributed such valorous payment
amongst them, that in fine they being some fled, and the rest vanquished, he
triumphantly remained Conqueror: which no sooner he had finished, but with his
best art binding up his Cousins wounds, he immediately conveyed him to a
skilful Chyrurgion there next adjoining, commanding him to dress him with all
care and industry; And so recovering a gallant Courser, he speedily post^d to
the Court, and advertising Athelia of these sorrowful news, she thereat (as
being in conceit slain) immediately fell to the ground in a trance. Plivio
seeing the arrival of this unexpected tra^ical accid^nt, bethought himself what
was ^^tt^st to be done; and so at last calling his Lunatic sen^es before the
throne of Discretion, he employed his best diligence for the recovery of the
Lady which very soon he ^ffected, praying her to be of good comfort, for that
there was no doubt to be made of Thalmo's health, The Princess being therewith
a little qualifi^d, for a whiles appeased her self; yet continually weeping to
see him suffer such (painful) misery for her sake (and knowing it was her
affection Which induced him to endure so desperate a hazard) bethinking how to
comport her self in so tragical an enterprise, at last (shedding full many a
tear in his memory) she resolved by his friend Plivio to send him a kind
Letter, which as a Preservative-Mediatrix should consolate him in his malady;
and so calling for pen and paper she wrote to this effect: To desolate THALMO
Salutations.
THalmo! If thou marvel to see the appearance of this my Letter; why, resolve,
it was the news of thy misfortune which has caused my affection to put pen to
paper; the which has so replenished my senses with sorrow, that I may even
right-well say, there are almost no words herein contained, but has been
washed with a tear, nor no yllable but has been saluted with a sigh. Before
mine eyes, methinks, Parasius does naturally present me with the physnomy of
thy misfortune; and in the Closet of my conceit, Apelles proffereth me the Idea
of thy agg^ivation* which untimely tragical prospect does so pierce to the
profundity of my senses sorrowful imagination^, that I almost melt into tears,
in that my obsurd o^casion should be the Administer of thy prejudicial
Accident. Yet, valorous Thalmo! since it is none but Athelia that is the
original Actresse of thy misfortune* why, in cou^tesie, know that to the
Confines of my power I will research the means to recomp^nce thy affections
with such friendly appl^usible amity, as either thou in right can with honor
ask, or I in reason may with honesty afford. In which mean time, till
experience demonstrate thee what a dent ze^le I have to congratulate thy
valorous (and virtuous) affections, I abruptly end, continua^ly upon the Altar
of Love sacrificin^ many millions of penetential Oraisons f^r thy speedy
Recovery: And so in hope thereof, recommending my sorrows to your favorable
censure, I unfaignedly ^est,

Yours as her own, ATHELIA.




This Letter being conveyed by Plivio, and received of Thalmo, did instantly
infuse such encouragement to his despairful malady, that in few day^s he
recovered: And contemplating in his breast on the courteous Epistle which his
dear Athelia had sent him, thought she would (or at least well might) condemn
him of impudent ingratitude, if he vouchsafed not to return her a correspondent
Answer: whereupon ^nforcing himself to sit up, he endited this ensuing Letter:
MOst fair Athelia, (and therefore fair, because Athelia!) Being fortunately
presented with the essence of your (sacred) Epistle, I instantly felt my
tosticated senses to be ravished within the Lists of exquisite contentation:
But at last in trembling wise unripping the seals, and perusing thereof the
sweet Nectar-substance; I not only deemed my Conceits, but likewise my self to
be in an ecstasy, tracing within the divine Eden of Elysium: so as administering
that sovereign Antidote to my green wounds, I find the virtue thereof so
pleasant, and the nature so delectable, that from a sickly Patient I am become
a sound Personage, and from a dead Man in show a living Saint in substance.
Therefore* fair Athelia upon the shrine of Love and altar of your absence* I
not only thank thee for the r^-establishing of my liberty, but also for the
restoring of my life: Which benign (nay blis^ul) Courtesy, my sense in this
world shall be alwais mindful to requite, and my soul in the Celestial
paradise to come, never forgetf^l, to congratulate. The fervency of my faithful
love, and the Idea of your fair perfections, does has my Muse in the streams
of distempered contemplations: Therefore what I omit with silence, countervaile
with a favorable censure; or let ^asse unpolished, rectify with a smiling
conceit: So shall my Muse have a meritorious subject to acknowledge your
benigni^y; my self a deserved instance to eternize your courtesy; and both a
delectable motive unfainedly to remain

Yours now and ever, THALMO.




Athelia perceiving by this Letter, that he had for that time made the Bark of
his courage double the point of death, being thereof exceedingly glad, could
find no rest in the Chaos of her joyful conceits, until she had fixed her eyes
upon the (desired) Object of his Personage, within whose incirculets remained
her chiefest solace: So that at last finding a fit opportunity, when both the
King and Queen her Parents were absent, (taking with her only Levina) she hyed
her to the Lodge where she was advertised Thalmo was resident; and so being by
the Lady of the house conducted to his Chamber, she very modestly opening the
door, entered. Which Thalmo being pensively there alone walking, (having his Arm
bound up with a Lavender-scarf, betokening hope) no sooner espied, but he
forthwith (as doubting whether waking or in a dream) went and embraced her:
where upon her Coral-lips, the sympathy of their affection was of each part so
celestially united, that their eyes attractiuely reflecting piercing aspects
upon each others sight, did (as ambassadors of Love) in the Closet of their
breast seek to confirm a mutual alliance: the contemplation whereof forced
their breath to bereave their tongues of the use of parlying; till at last when
an amorous blush had given Conge to that so pleasing encounter, Athelia (the
tears standing in her eyes) began in this sort: AH Thalmo! The news of thy
misfortune has invited me hither; and therefore marvel not at my unexpected
arrival: I am now of purpose come to display before thine eyes the model of my
love, and to make thy sight a prospector of my chaste fidelity, which albeit the
appearance thereof has been hitherto hidden under the mask of secrecy, yet
know (dear Thalmo) tha^ thy forcible Virtue has long since made breach of my
maiden affections, and as the Avaunt Coureur of Cupid, has built his Tent in
the proudest situation of my amorous breast.

Thalmo having his ears repleated with this blisful news, and perceiving by the
fervency of her method, that she spoke no more than Love did enduce her; very
instantly, as being ravished with overmuch joy, giving her the impression of a
second kiss, and softly straining her by her Lilyhand, very kindly returned
her this courteous Answer.

AH fair Athelia! thy divine speeches has breathed life in my despairful
personage; and likewise caused my breast to triumph over my sickness, which I
heretofore conjectured would not only have conquered my conceits, but also
with Atropos cut off the vital thread of my life: Therefore welcome sweet
Athelia to thy sorrowful Thalmo; and millions of thanks to gracious Fortune,
for inuesting mine Eyes with the sweet Object of your dainty Personage! But
gazing on the rarity of your Beauty, whither wander my conceits to erect
Trophies in the Air, or Piramids in the Sky; that I forget my self so much, as
not to grati^^e your Love with reciprocal affection? but pardon me, sweet
Athelia, and attribute the defects of my capacity to the distempered
contemplations of my imbecility; and, Athelia, resolve that I will both now and
ever honor you as the immortal Saint of my Fortunacy; adore you as the ternal
goddess of my prosperity, and esteem of you as the sacred image of my
felicity. Athelia being ravished with the swee^ cadence of these his sugared
speeches, in lieu of his courtesi^ returned him this kind reply: WHy Princely
Thalmo, where there is no offense committed, the excuse ensues of custom:
therefore thy actions having cleared thee from imputation; fear not, for thy
pardon ^s already granted, in respect wherereof, advance in Love, and I will
prosecute in Affection; proceed in Amity, and I will correspond in Friendship:
The which to app^ove, take here my heart and hand as the steadfast seal of my
immortal constancy; vowing before the Imperial throne of Heaven, to establish
only Thalmo as husband within the youthful garden of my tender juvenility.

Thalmo esteeming himself exceeding fortunate, by the receipt of this angelical
reply, In congratulation of her protested Amity, returned her this joyful
Answer: THe gift sweet (Princess) of your si^cere affection, does with blisful
applause, so repleat the influence of my capacity, that in recompense thereof;
I vow not only to dedicate my zealous devotions to the shrine of your bright
excellency, but also to finish my terrestial Pilgrimage in enrolling my self a
loyal Servant upon the marble-Statue of your maiden contemplations.

Thus with many amorous ceremonies they firmly (each to other) contracted
themselves; and in such affectionate sort, that neither the frowns of Fortune,
the treachery of time, or the Sugar of insinuation, should either blast the
blossom of their flourishing friendship, or once daunt the appearance of their
immovable fidelity: and the more deli^iously to manifest their merriment, they
ratified their resolutions with many heavenly kisses. So that having brought
this lovely Couple to a sacred atonement, we will for a whiles leave them to
the Paradise of their contemplations; and a little discourse of the strange
accidents which bef^ll the Lady Florina.

FLorina (as you have before heard) living very sorrowful in her desolate
Castle, was at last by Agenor the King her Father commanded to return to the
Court, (all delay to the contrary set apart) whereat being exceedingly
discontented (in respect the effecting thereof would prejudice her devotions
due to her Dear Maedor) she very peremptorily, as being a faithful Amator of
his perfection, utterly refused thereunto to condescend; King Agenor her
father, being advertised of her stubborn resolution, instantly sent forth
Pursevants (perforce) to bring her to the Court; but she being before (by some
of the Nobility her friends) therewith acquainted, assummoned her wits to a
parley how she might avoid her Fathers indignation: at last, knowing there was
no other means for her to escape than to shroud her self under some Peasants
Cottage; forgetting both her Princely birth, and flourishing dignity, she
instantly maugre all contrary oppositions thereunto, addressed her self, so that
reaping an exceeding delight, to see the homely Shepherds lead their
milk-white flocks to the fragrant fields, as also, to hear diverse quires of
harmonious Birds (at the sight of Titan to carol forth their madrigals she a
long time there remained, as well contented as a Damsel in her estate (oppressed
with Love) might^ till on a day, bearing a Shepherdess company to the Fields,
directly in an evenings edge, as Phoeb^^ was flying the Zenith of our Horizon
to alight the Antipodes, and silver Cynthia began to point out the Pilgrims to
their desired rest; as these our two love^ly females were returning from
solding their flocks, Florina hiding her self under; the Canopy of a sprouting
Fig Tree, drawing out her Pen and Paper (out of her Pocket) in praise of a
Country life, indicted this ensuing Sonnet.

Court harbors Pride, whilst Country does retain
Instead thereof most rich humility;
In Countries soil Love always does remain,
Whilst Court does nourish vicious enmity
Ambition still in Court does pitch his Tent,
And vows even there to make his sole demeure,
Whilst in the Country friendly sweet content
Delighfully in Peace does rest secure.
Which she had no sooner ended, but perusing it again and again, and finding no
remembrance of her Maedor therein circumferenc'd, blaming her capacity for so
oblivious an offense, she at la^^ with as much speed as her tormented conceits
and trembling hand could afford, in his memory framed these Verses following.

Though fortune 're^^e me of thy wished sight,
And cross my Love perfore against my desire;
Making my night seem day, and day seem night,
Add yet it both still burn in endless fire:
May though I flame, yet does my soul pretend
In honoring thy self my life to end.
Though time detain thee from my troubled eyes,
And shroud my self from off my pale aspects;
Yet in thy thought my wandering hope relies*
And in thy absence writes loves intellects:
Therefore despite of time thy Princely hu^
Shall cause my maiden-Love for to renew.
Though destiny resolve for to compel
My sense for to forget thy memory,
Or ^hink to make my constant breast expel
The sweet resemblance of thine amity:
Yet never shall his power me once constrain
So wavering to my Maedor to remain.
In fine, though fortune, time, and destiny,
Would bend their force to make me leave to love,
Or join in league of rageful unity
To cause me to my Maedor faithless prove:
Yet never shall (despite their force) my mind
To other love than Maedor's ^e inclined.
The Shepherdess seeing Florina had now ended, entreated her to repair home,
whereunto she willingly accorded; so along they go; the Shepherdess being
repleated with C^u^try-applause, and fair Florina replenished with
(distempered) amarous contemplation: but long they tript not o'r^ the diapred
fields, (wherein remark the infidelity of Fortun^!) but as they were pleasantly
conferring together, they might behold a very young Stripling which hastily
drew toward them, who being with running almost out of breath, to the Lady
Florina uttered these speeches: GEntlewomen, I am of purpose sent to advertise
you, that you instantly hide your selves in some unknown Grove; for that there
are arived to our Cottage some four or five Cavaliers, which with diligence
seek you, who have very grievously wounded my Father, in respect he concealeth
your residence. Therefore delays set apart, it behooves you (if you affect
your tranquillity) to fly: and, beautiful Lady, since the laws of nature and
humanity do bind me generally to aid your Sex, but especially your self, I
will, if you please; through the Woods and Vineyards conduct you; where I doubt
not but you may remain in most assured peaceful security.

Florina storming to see her Fathers cruelty, and yet rejoicing to behold this
Shepherds courtesy, ruminating with her senses which way to wander in this
dangerous accident, at last resolved to follow his advice, and so praying the
Shepherdess to accompany her, along they three hie together, directing their
course to the Seaside, which in two days they attained without being espied of
any: but they were no sooner arived to -- a harbour-Town in the Country of --,
but they were instantly informed, that there was likewise search made for her
apprehension; whereat being almost overcome with wrath, and vanquished with
affection, they immediately without entering the Town ^rost the strand, and
tracing upon the borders of ^he Sea, they at last arrived to a little Creek,
where ^spying an aged Fisherman in his Cock-boat repairing his Nets; they
after having saluted him with a good morrow, asked if he would transport them
for pleasure a League on the Sea: the Fisherman demanding what recompense he
should have for his pains, well-liking their proffer (and seeing his Boat
afloat) thereunto agreed; so with a merry gale, which blew the Sail from the
bending Mast, to Sea they went, where delighting to see the aged Father take
store of Fish, as also to see the Boat dance lavolta's on the azured Seas, they
in such fort deluded the time, till night being come, and then again returned.
But before Florina resolved to put foot on shore, she to the ancient Fisherman
demonstrated her estate, and likewise prayed him (with tears standing in her
eyes) to assist her in this her miserable calamity; and for her better
assuranc^ to convey her every day on the Sea: the old man pitying her estate,
and being authentically instiga^ted by the motives of her liberality, soon to
her so reasonable request voluntarily condescended; which course they many
days observed, with as much joy of Florina, as if she had been now triumphing
(...) her former dignity; till at last, Fortune resolvin^ to add more misery
to her calamity, caused he unexpected (and sure unmerited) to fall within the
labyrinth of a greater ensuing misfortune; for they so long time daily went to
the Sea, till (...) length, being some two leagues from the sho^^ they were
espied by a Pinace, which ranged (...) along by the clifts to attrap some
purchase, (...) hoisting their Sails, came directly toward the^ and so making
speedy way, because the wind b^^gan to fresh, did very soon cut their Boat
from the shore, commanding them to the main; which doleful sentence being to
this our weak company so dreadful as the sight of the Wolf to the innocent
Lambs, made them almost dye with grief to think on their disastrous misery; but
especially Florina, from whose eyes distilled many fountains of pearled tears,
which as the perfect messengers of sorrow, did apparently demonstrate her
insupportable grief; but all alas in vain, for there was no remedy to assist
her, nor no undaunted Alcides neerhand to rescue her from their cruelty; but
perforce, they were very rigorously commanded to come aboard, which with a
faint courage and sorrowful resolution they effected, Florina being the last
that entered, whom the Turkish Slaves no sooner beheld, but (reflecting their
eyes upon the sweet object of her angelical beauty) clapping these hands, and
throwing up their Caps, they exceedingly rejoiced in that they had gotten so
sumptuous a prize, to present their Sultan: but all this while, the
comfortless Florina hanging down her head, and diving into despair, thought
she was now on the stage, where the catastrophe of her Tragedy should be acted.
But the Captain of this cursed crew (albeit seldom seen in this o^r Age)
discreetly viewing her beautiful Visage, did from the influence of her constant
eyes and modest aspect immediately conceive that she was some virtuous Damsel,
extracted of honorable Parentage; In respect whereof he discharged the rest,
and retained only perplexed Florina, which he commanded to be entreated with
all benign favor and courtesy possible; And to that effect, forsaking his
Cabin, he charged his Page therein to lodge her, and to attend her with as
great diligence and vigilant curiosity, as his own personage: So that Florina
(to her consolation) might perceive, that as they entertained her courteously,
so they likewise honored her by never presuming to defloure her of her
maidenhood (which she a thousand times esteemed more dea^e then her life.) But
again, remembering her Maedor, she would instantly weep, as if his absent Idea
had a Regal Prerogative to make her water her Plants: Many bitter sighs she
likewise thundered forth to the shrine of his Personage; and cursed the
unfortunate Fates for investing her with this disastrous misfortune: In her
contemplation she delectably ruminated upon his flourishing perfection; but
again pondering upon his absence, and her own present misery, she would
forthwith burst into public exclamation, cursing the inhumane Destinies for
investing the Bulwark of her Breast with such distasteful aggravation. The
which the Captain espying, began most debonairly to comfort her dispairful
courage, adding moreover with the industrious art of his fluent Tongue, that no
disgrace or malefaction should be administered her but such chaste kindness and
modest courtesy (...) should every way correspond with the title of honor.
But alas, sweet Florina, not understanding his language, could reap no applause
by the ana^gram of his speeches; but still most bitterly be^wailed her
misfortune, lying prostrate in her (...) of misery. Where leaving her with the
Captain of the Pinace, which resolved to transport her for Constantinople, we
will commit her to the favorable occurrent of fortune, and a little treat of
Plivio and Mersilva.

PLIVIO being certainly advertised of his Cousins proceedings, and being made
acquainted with the fortunate success which he had received in his Loves,
began instantly to conceive some motion of hope, not doubting but by the means
of Athelia he might obtain his desired Mersilva: Upon the foundation of which
hope, apparrelling himself in a white Suit of Satin, cut out upon black
Damask, (whose color in Blazon display Purity and Sorrow) he hyed himself to
the Court; where enquiring for Mersilva, and being answered, she was in company
of the Queen, Athelia, and other Ladies hunting in the Forest, he immediately
mounted his Courser, and with a gallant pace posted thither; where he was no
sooner arrived, but hearing the shrill cry of the courageous Hounds, and the
loud report of the blasting Horns, he thinking the Huntsmen were on the foot of
the game, being thereof a desirous spectator, but more zealous to contemplate
on the beauty of his Mistress, he with a devout resolution made his Jennet
advance; where traversing the Thickets, we will for a while leave them, and a
^ittle treat of the adventures which befell Mersilva.

Who, as before you have heard, being in the forest with the Queen busily
hunting, it so chanced that the Deer which they chased escaped from their
sight; in respect whereof, the Troops both of Knights and Ladies again
dispersed themselves to attrap him; amongst the rest there was present a young
Cavalier named Blithion, which a long time before burned in love with the
Princess Mersilva, and could never reap any fit opportunity to disclose her
the secrets of his breasts contemplation, who sought by all means possible to
sequester her from the company. At last Dame Fortune (though of Mersilva
undeserved) determining with her Beauty to administer a treacherous accident,
did by her Chamelion-influence cause the harmless Princess to stray from the
sight of her Associates, where ranging discontentedly, as if her courage had
been already vanquished by despair, was at last most unfortunately met by this
tormented Blithion, who being more then exceeding joyful of this (unexpected)
news, giving spurs to his horse, and speed to his courage, in a short space
overtook her, where with these unchaste speeches he impudently saluted her as
follows: MOst fair Princess! I have long since in my conceits endured many
millions of perplexed tortures, which the alone sight of your sacred beauty
has engendered in my tormented contemplation: Therefore, fair Lady, since
Destiny seems so favorable as to present mine eyes with the sweet object of
your excellency, I beseech you to grant my affection the Comble of my ardent
desir^, that is, To let my breast enjoy those heavenly pleasures of your
delicate Vi^ginity, the want whereof has well-neer already acted the
accomplishment of my untimely martyrdom.

Mersilva smiling at these his fond speeches, immediately dying the center of
her Lily-cheeks with a Vermilion-blush, (being altogether ashamed at his
immodest conference) very sharply (as having anger seated in the furrows of her
brow) returned him this bitter Answer.

SIR! If thy vicious self had been ever trained up in the School of Virtue,
thou would have tempered the Preludium of thy speeches with more discretion,
and not so lavi^hly presumed to salute a chaste Lady in such lewd sort: But
seeing thy sottish tongue has already uttered that which may not be recalled,
Know (impudent Villain) that I disdain thy suit, as the utter prejudice of my
unspotted Honor, and detest thy self as the (pretended) inhumane Actor of my
immortal disgrace. Therefore with speed depart, and instantly give a Conge to
thy abrupt folly; otherwise I will advertise the King of thy lascivious
enterprise, and instigate him authentically to reward thy offense with the
deserved execution of thy demerits. Blithian, nothing dismayed at this
thundering Answer, but rather more increasing the flames of his lasciviou^
desire, instantly prosecuted his suit in this ^ort following: WHy Mersilva,
stand not so much on your points of disdain; but rather consider with your
self, where you now are; for at present you are destitute from the Court, and
exempt of assistance; so that your Virginity and life lies in my disposition:
and to advertise you of my resolution, I may not be denied with refusals, nor
deluded with delays; for despite of fortune, I must satisfy my Love, and now
reap the enjoyance of my long desired contentation: therefore consent to my
will, and repleat your tongue with no more coyness, otherwise you will enforce
me, after possessed of my pleasure, to use you with such inhumane rigor as my
nature would scarce proffer to your lovely sex, much less to you, whom in
heart I have ever adored as the divine Image of my breasts delectation.

Mersilva greatly astonished at his pretense, began exceedingly to weep,
because the sequel thereof with sorrow touched her to the quick; still sighing
and raging, as if the Coffin of her breast would immediately rent in sunder
with imminent aggravation, always calling on the goddess Diana, whom
sincerely she prayed to revenge her quarrel, and to shelter her from the rapine
of this imodest Knight: but at last considering that silence was a show of
consent; disdaining ever to stain the purity of her fame with deformity, or the
Noble descent from whence she was extract, with disgrace; making a muster of
her angry Muses, in the valley of her cerebrosities indignation, she very
resolutely with an undanted audacity returned him this sharp Reply.

INhumane Knight, since thou will not be contented with Reason, because
reasonless, nor vouchsafe to permit me to depart in patience without blemishing
mine honor with the spot of infamy; know, that rather then I will once consent
to thy lascivious demand, or ever agree to thy lustful desire I will
voluntarily be the administer of mine own untimely martyrdom. And therewith
unsheathing an inameled knife, which she had pending to her golden girdle, (as
a second Lucretia) with a fatal stroke she resolved to destroy her self: but
the divilish Knight suspecting some such accident, very soon wrestling the
knife from her hand, prevented her purpose; the which having done (setting hold
of the bridle) he immediately alighted her from her horse, whereat being
overcome with fear, she in a dangerous trance fell to the ground, where
metamorphising her cherry taint to a Cynthian complexion, she there lay
speechless, as much trembling as an Infant-prisoner hearing the sentence of
death pronounced against him; the which to arouse, Blithion spoke to her in
this sort.

Fair Mersilva, it is in vain to resist, where there is none to rescue you, and
yet were Hercules himself present, he should not hinder me of my purpose; for
my sensual ardor cannot be extinguished without accumulating the Rose of your
(divine) Virginity. Which having ended, Mersilva arising on her knees most
sorrowfully (with fountains of tears distilling down the soyls of her
Vermillion cheeks) interrupted him in this manner: AH Blithion! pity the
estate of an innocent damsel, and rather pierce the Citadel of my Maiden breast
with thy Rapior, then ravish me of that which I esteem far more precious then
my life; Erect not, I beseech thee, thy Trophies of pleasure in the defloration
of my Virginity, nor build thy golden mountains of solace, in depriving the
inward treasure of my unspotted chastity. But here again the doleful confluence
of her disastrous tears imbathed her faltring tongue in the Acheron stream of
silence, so that the courage of her exterior audacitie not permitting her to
depaint the Physnomy of her inward aggravations, she (overvailing the instinct
of her eyes with the Curtains of perplexity) lay for a while senseless, as if
the valor of her conceits had been smothered up in the antipathy of
disconsolations; when arousing her sorrowful capacity with the contemplation
of imminent fear, she suddenly started up, and most inhumanely tore the
sparkling tresses of her golden hair, wherewith dame Nature had most
gloriously imbellished her; which tragical object, might ( Blithion excepted)
have made the most bloody inhumane Scythian to pity her estate; nay, have
caused the senseless obdurate Rocks themselves to weep, and sorrowfully to
^ake compassion upon the spectacle of her miserable calamity.

But Blithion not passing for her exclamation, but rather burning with
inordinate desire to extenuate the imbers of his unsatiable lust, esteemed
every Court-minute a complete month, before (though to her immortal infamy) he
had made proof of his superdiabolical enterprise; so that accepting of no
Reason for satisfaction, nor accompting of any Imploration for payment, taking
her by her trembling hand, he most viciously began to embrace her. When being
on the point to make shipwreck of her Honesty, and to set her Maidenhood to
sale, lo thitherward unexpected came Plivio galloping amain; the which Mersilva
(to her Nectar-comfort) espying, to him very loudly cried out in this sort: Ah
Plivio! as thou tenderest my Love, and desire mine Honor, assist thy
distressed Mersilva, and revenge the devilish pretense of this unmerciful Tigre
with the merited guerdon of condign punishment!

Plivio perceiving it to be his sweet Mersilva, instantly (as being inflamed
with revenge) made his Courser more swiftly advance then the Jennets of
Jupiter: when leaping from his horse, he with his Rapier drawn approaching his
thrice mortal Enemy, very furiously uttered these words: Ah wretched Villain!
make ready thy sword; for if there were no more men living, thou immediately
dyest. Which words he no sooner pronounced, but in the twinkling of an eye he
lodged his Rapier in his Rivals breast; where receiving his demerit, and
falling gasping on the ground, Plivio first cut off his perfidious tongue which
had so lasciviously pratled and then without prolixity sent his servile soul
to the Republique of Pluto, to tell Tereus and Tarquine, that he went near to
commit a lustful Rape.

The which Mersilva with fearful joy perceiving, ran to Plivio, falling first
to his feet, and then again ^rfing embraced and kissed him; when after having
given him many volleys of hearty thanks (seconded by many millions of
penetential tears) she from point to point recounted him the manner of the
Accident; the which when Plivio understood, he esteemed himself more then
exceeding joyful, in that the Fates appointed him to arrive in so fortunate an
hour. And so having comforted his now even comfortless Mersilva, remounting
her on her milk-white Courser, (posting together) resolved to find out the
Queen; to whose presence being arrived, sitting with her Ladies like Venus with
her Nymphs, closely banqueting under the umbrage of Fig Trees, (whose spacious
leaves kept them from the power of Titans influence) he to them depainted the
manner of the Adventure, which mournful Mersilva testified to be of truth, by
again on fresh shedding many pearled tears, which (like the clarent Dew on
Damask-flowers) destilled on her sorrowful cheeks. Which when the Queen,
together with her daugher Athelia and the rest of the Ladies understood, they
all praising the Almighty, gave likewise incessant thanks to Plivio for his
undanted magnanimity; and exceedingly rejoiced in that the Princess Mersilva
was so fortunately preserved: when rising, they left the Forest, and instantly
returned all to the Court; where they were no sooner arrived, but the Queen
immediately made the King her Husband therewith acquainted; Who greatly
rejoicing that Plivio the Arabian Knight had so valoursly behaved himself, did
after in consideration thereof much advance him to honorable Dignities, in such
sort, that both the name of Thalmo and Plivio (like the Sun of Renown) only
flourished in the Court of Zanfara: which adding more hope to Plivio's desired
enterprise, made him not a little glad of the accidental event of such
fortunate fortunacie: For first he perceived that the King and Queen much
favored him, The Princess Athelia (likewise) far the more, in respect of her
best beloved Thalmo; And again, he beheld his dear Mersilva to reap exceeding
contentation in enjoying the Eden of his desired presence. Whereupon remaining
continually in the Court, he at last in tract of time, found Mersilva solitary
in her Closet; to whom boldly entering, he very amorously saluted her in this
sort: What, fair Mersilva, all alone! Why, a kiss for your thoughts! To whom
instantly she replied, Not alone (Plivio) for my self and I am together; And
for my Conceits, I think on nothing, therefore I conjecture that less then a
kiss may purchase them.

Plivio almost ravished with joy to see her in so pleasant a humor, thought it
now wisdom to strike the Iron being hot; and so by virtue of his supposed
discretion, continued his conference in this sort following: WHy fair Mersilva,
less then a kiss is in effect nothing; and if I deceive not my thoughts;
Maidens will scarce content themselves with the like payment. To whom Mersilva
again replied; I Will prove the contrary; For if I fail not, my Muse tells me, one
may kiss in conceit. I, but quoth Plivio, th^se are shows without substance*
for there is difference betwixt pretense and performance: for the one in reason
is the others contrary, as absolute as a shrewish Wife is a quiet Husbands.
Whereat she very pleasantly smiling, again replied:

Why Plivio, you err from your matter; for Wives and Husbands are not incident
to our Theames. Plivio seeing her merrily disposed, framed her this pleasing
answer:

Surely, Princess Mersilva, you herein prove your self a discreet disputant,
in that you have put me in mind (or at least) in the plain pathway of our
former purpose; for I now remember, a Kiss was our sentence; the which, by
your leave, I mean to prosecute.

And so embracing her slender waste, he gave her (Nectar) lips the impression
of a dainty kiss: whereat she blushing, returned him this sharp answer:

Why Plivio, I little thought you would have proceeded so peremtorily; for had
I but once thereof deemed, my exact absence should have given you a precise
gain-say^ Plivio seeing her patience a little moved, thought to countervaile
the offense with a courteous answer* And so encouraging his Muse with many
amorou^ contemplations, he continued his speech as follows:

Why Princess Mersilva, moved in a manner! or can the fuel of your wrath be so
soon illuminated with a blast of Sunshining! had I thought my enterprise would
have so soon incurred your displeasure, I would (assuredly) have prevented that
which is now happened.

Whereunto Mersilva answered; Nay, I now see this my kindness, which is the
occasion of this distastefull accident. Therefore to avoid the like scandal, I
pray, as you are come, depart; and being departed, arrive when you are sent
for. Whereunto Plivio replied, Fair Mersilva, If the demonstration of my love
have engendered your displeasure, I pray you excuse affection, which was thereof
the chief occasion: and if you please, for reward of my crime, inflict on me
what punishment you think shall be sufficient for the offense. Mersilva hereat
again blushed, but in such amorous sort, as it seemed that both love and
disdain sat in the modle of her chery cheeks striving for supremacy: yet at
last considering she had advanced her speeches so far without his affable
merits, and seeing the subject so small wherein she had grounded the foundation
of her wrath, she, to avoid the humor of future aggravation, instantly
(without bidding Adieu) departed: where poor Plivio, oppressed with love,
remained so much tormented in thought, as that it seemed he had with the Greeks
already seen the like of Capharia, and so the Barque of his hope was on the
point to tear against the flinty-rocks of devouring Charybdis: For sometimes
he would in her Chamber walk, and with his threatening hands menace the gods
with revenge, and likewise reproach dissembling Cupid for ingratefulnesse; then
immediately slumber, and in his drowsy capacity dream of Mersilva's cruelty:
When rising, and premeditating upon the Chaos of his amorous contemplations, he
would forthwith tear his beard for meritorious anger: In which, or the like
fantastical humor he so long remained, till at last Mersilva (little thinking
of him, or at least of his there being) returned; who astonished to see Plivio
there present, forgetting her former wrath, asked him merrily, what wind blew
him thither? Whereat he striving to abolish disconsolation, (fetching from the
concavity of his heart a volley of distempered sighs) very mildly returned her
this tractable answer: AH fair Mersilva! It is your (alone) cruelty which has
engendered my sorrows; and only your coyness which has caused my aggravation:
For since your departure, I have here remained in such discontented sort, as,
if you triumph not of my misery, you would condignly pity my malady. Therefore
delude my suite, I beseech you, no longer with delays; nor contemn not my
love, in laughing to my constancy: but resolve, fair Mersilva, that Plivio
would willingly dye to demonstrate his fidelity, so far forth as the tragedy
of his misfortunes might make Mersilva tractable: Therefore, fair Princess,
attribute my sincere love some affection, and rejoice not to martyr him with
denial, which is ready to sacrifice his life before the shrine of your
beauteous Deity.

Mersilva perfectly noting with what fervent zeal he pleaded for favor, did
instantly as being inspired with affection, return him this applausible answer:
PLivio, thy valor and virtue having combined their charming force in the band
of unity, has long since in the Closet of my breast made way for thy
affection, in such amiable sort, that being conquered by the aspect of thy
blisful magnanimity, I in all honor (in lieu of thy kindness) remain thy
attendant handmaid: and albeit I have hitherto refrained my tongue in
depainting you the fervency of my affection; yet impute it not to the defect of
good will, but rather to the superaboundant zeal which I have had, to make
proof of thy constancy: the event whereof has fallen out so fortunate, that I
now from my heart protest. I adore only the essential pourtraict of Plivio, as
the bright morning Star of my days felicity.

Plivio well noting the fervency of her affectionate zeal, and perceiving into
what strait of love Cupid had now brought her; being in conceit half ravished
with the joyful alarum-bel of this unlooked for news, thinking his tongue
deferred to ^ong time in not congratulating her kindness with ^ome reciprocal
courtesy, very familiarly, at last, ^eturned her this amiable answer.

MOst divine Mersilva! If my tongue could disclose, or my Muse discover the
flourishing (and never dying) fidelity which in heart I have devoted to your
sacred self; I should acknowledge my capacity bound to nature for permitting me
such good fortune, and account my self indebted to art, for enduing me with
such blessedness. But since, sweet Mersilva, that the coyner of my deliverance
cannot sufficiently stamp the interior characters of my cogitations, nor the
discoveror of my secrets enough worthily depaint the Physnomy o^ my affection:
yet Mersilva, I beseech you believe tha^ I have grounded my constancy upon so
sure a foundation, and imprinted my fidelity upon so firm (...) resolution,
that neither the alluring events of pro^sperity, nor the terrifying threats of
misfortun^ can either extenuate by flattering shows, or extin^guish by frowing
substance. And whereas I percei^^ that though long, yet at last you have
banished cru^elty from your breast, and (embracing benignity^ accepted me for
your Servant; know sweet Me^^s^^va, that in recompense of your amity, I prese^^
you with the Comble of my constancy, and (...) that in the Closet of Plivio's
cogitations Mersil^^ shall only sit as triumphant governesse, when my
affection shall serve her, my fidelity enterta^^ her, my love attend her, and
my never waveri^^ constancy pay her the sweet bien venue of terrestr^^^
bli^fulnesse. Mersilva understanding his friendly answer, (...) solacing her
senses with the assurance of his affec^^^on, typping her tongue with the phrase
of favo^ very mildly returned him this sweet answer.

AH Plivio! being hereretofore a prisoner, I am now by the sequel of thy
conference set at liberty, and made free from subjection in swallowing down the
vitalitie of thy speeches: yet when I remember the estate of King Samor my
father, I weep, in that I should so unadvisedly bereave him of a daughter; but
yet the unity of our love has linck'd me to thy affection, and in ruminating
on thy virtues, I infuse his memory in the twists of oblivion: so that sweet
Plivio, condemn me not of disobedience, in being obedient to thy self, nor
impute not the title of inhumane ignorance to my charge, in respect it is only
the image of thy virtue which unites my fancies unto thy affection. And with
that, she from the influence of her eyes rained showers of tears upon the
Alablaster soil of her Lily cheeks, which Plivio perceiving, interrupted her
in this sort: WEep not, fair Mersilva, but let now the radiant aspect of our
amors evacuate the residence of sorrow; let the memory of our tender
affections submerge the waves of discontent, and let the novelty of our
friendship triumph over insinuating disconsolation. What? resolve it is the
gods which seek to sympathize our amity, and fortune her self, which
d^li^hteth to crown our friendship with contentation; Fair Mersilva, despair
is the pathway to destruction, therefore pluck up your spirits, and let a
joyful countenance give sorrow the overthrow: and conjecture not that my
acquaintance shall prejudice your estate, or diminish your dignity, for then
were my suit dissimulation, and my affections folly; for the purity of my
pretense, and the event of time, shall inform you the contrary: therefore
imprint your resolutions upon the foundation of hope, and resolve that Plivio
will live and dye, only to adore sweet Mersilva, as the divine Image of my
felicity, to whom I consecreate the generality of my devotions.

Mersilva sweetly pondering upon his firm fidelity, having almost her amorous
conceits smoothed up in the Lists of applausible contemplation, very
affectionately returned him this gracious Reply.

WEll Plivio, having a confident hope that you will perform no less then you
now promise, I in consideration thereof vow, that none but Plivio shall
possess my person, and only Plivio will I account as the delightful Titan of my
conceit^ from whose radiant brightness I extract the splendant Zephyr of my
souls contentation.

THanks, dear Mersilva, quoth Plivio; And to cor^respond your affection, here
take my hear^ and hand in pledge of my immortal constancy vowing before the
Imperial Throne of Heaven, tha^ my soul shall be first diverted into cinders,
ere withdraw my zeal from serving and honourin^ Mersilva.

Thus having plighted their troths each to other they a long time remained so
lacing their cerebr^^sities within the Nectar Eden of applause; so that that
the night aproaching, it was more then time for Plivio to depart, when taking
his Angelical Saint by the Alabaster hand, and fixing his aspects upon the
divine mirror of her heavenly beauty, he with a sighing voice gave her this
freindly farewell: DEar Mersilva, (and therefore dear because Mersilva) I must
now depart and leave thee to the Chaos of thy ruminating contemplations:
Thereore sweet Minion of my breast, and Mistress of my capacity, I will hie me
to my Closet, and there invent the means for the establishing of our future
tranquillity; so that till I am again made (triple) fortunate by enjoying the
excellency of your divine personage, I in all sympathy of faithful affection
take my sorrowful Conge.

Mersilva hereat painting her countenance with a Cynthian complexion (the tears
standing in her eyes) answered him as follows: SWeet Plivio! as thou
tenderest my love, let thy return be shortly, for fear lest wanting the image
of thy personage, I immediately dye in contemplating on thy absent perfection;
therefore, at my sincere request, satisfy my ardent expectation; and in
recompense thereof as I mean to live in thy gracious favor, so I resolve to
die in thy virtuous ^ffection. Thus, as the ordinance of their conceits ^ad
thundered forth many volleyes of sighs at their ^arewel, Mersilva (erecting
Trophies in her breast) hied her self to her Closet; and Plivio (framing
triumphs in his contemplation) betook himself to converse with his Cousin
Thalmo, to whom he recounted the event of his fortunate proceedings; and the
prosperous conclusions of his amourous enterprises; who being thereof
exceedingly satisfied, asked if his Lady were contented to leave the Court and
travail with him? whereunto he answered, that to the same effect he had
already motioned; whose reply was, she would follow him in weal and woe, in
mirth and misery, in sorrow and sympathy, as far as the confines of the world
would permit, or I desire. Why then, quoth Thalmo, my Athelia's fancies, and
Mersilvas affections are incident to the Idea of one formosity; and has vowed
no more then Athelia could desire to effect. To remain here were folly, in
respect we are absent from our native home; and to acquaint any with the modle
of our affections were unfit: Therefore let us with the ingenious Be return
home in safety, and with the skillful Pilot redirect our course to the Port of
our residence: for peradventure, tract of time may disclose the secrets of our
pretense, and so the prime of our hopes may be by envy crossed in the bloomy
blossoms of their maturity, which to avoid (as before I have demonstrated) let
us with haste return, and so through the woods and Forests convey our Ladies
from the sight of any; for if the report of ou^ departure did but arive to the
Port of King Brilion^ understanding, doubtless he would so rigourous^ly
entreat us, and so severely handle us, that per^^hance our lives, or at least
our liberties should remain as hostages for our misdemeanour.

Plivio attentively listening to his Cousins exhortations, and sounding the
depth of his counsel by the profundity of his own conceits; allowed well of the
Plot which Thalmo had compacted for their retirement; the which, the better to
accomplish, he willed his Cousin to make his Athelia therewith acquainted, as
he prote^ted to do the like to his Mersilva, to the end that when the hour of
departure should be assigned, they might make themselves ready, and fit such
necessaries as might be needful for their journey: upon which resolution, each
departed to his Saint, to whom in the confluence of many amorous terms they
dilated their purposes, and not only discovered the Picture of their noble
births, but also the Pourtraict of their direct names; the wind of which
novelty, they no sooner understood, but being (as it were) smoothed up in the
ecstasy of many delicious contemplations, (the which seemed far the more
pleasant in respect of their innovation) they being completely therewith more
then diviney contented, to their sweet demand (after many hearty
congratulations) very soon condescended.

By this time our two young Princes Plivio and Thalmeno, having apparent proof
of each others affectionate resolutions, and burning with desire to set
forwards their enterprises, instantly appointed that the next nigh^ following
(at the outward Gate, betwixt twelve and one) they would attend the thrice
happy arrivals of their sweet Saints; which warning, though short, yet seemed
so sweet to their Ladies imaginations, that (applause building trophies of
content in their trembling resolutions) they very pleasantly deluded the time
in familiar dalliance; till at last, the hour (as they thought) being come, and
their Princes absent, metamorphosing their mirth to melancholinesse, and their
joy to discontent, they began to blame them for to much (unmerited) constancy;
sometimes condemning them of ingratitude, and then again instantly with a sigh
recalling their speeches, fearing lest the influence thereof might by some
uncustomed accident be transpor^ed to their favorites understanding: sometimes
exclaiming on their own fortunes, in that they saw fortune herself began to
temper the preludium of their loves with distasteful misfortune. But alas,
these amorous Ladies were both deceived! for the Dial of their cerebrosities
told the hour of assignation bfore the horologe sounded, and the clock of their
conceits struck twelve and one, e're the essence of ten, far less eleven, was
in election to be finished; yet in such sorrowful sort they past the time, till
at last (and not unlookt for) their two Princes arrived, giving a shrill hola,
which between this amorous troop served for a watch word; the which the Ladies
to their delight no sooner heard, but instantly (as understanding the sentence
of freedom pronounced to their imprisoned contemplations) giving courage to
their thoughts, and dying their milk-white cheeks with a vermilion blush, they
in their night-apparel descended; the glimpse of whose glorious appearance our
two young Princes no sooner espied, but advancing their pace with exquisite
delectation, they went and saluted them, where so joyful a meeting of divine
sympathy was betwixt them demonstrated, that forgetting their senses, and
almost themselves, I thought they would for that night have made their amorous
demeure upon the Lily incarnate soil of their coralline lips; no words could
they utter, because their tongues were (by love) devoted to silence, and such as
past, were clamorous volleys of sorrowful sighs, which redoubling each on
other, strove which should first unite each others heart with the sympathy of
superabundant affection. But in fine, yea, and in the twinkling of an eye they
heard in the palace a fierce and terrible noise, as if in a manner the whole
Court had been in a seditious uproare, which repleating their senses with fear,
and replenishing their conceit with timerosity, drove them all into a very
effeminate humor of exact despair; in such sort, that they knew not how to save
themselves, nor where to convey their Majestical Ladies from the gurmandizing
jaws of ruthful distress; till at last, Thalmeno knowing their estate fickle,
and perceiving it now stood upon him desperately to cast at all, (I mean either
to lose his own life, or his dear Athelia, which he esteemed far more precious)
refetching the courage of his undaunted magnanimity from the confines of fear,
and arming the interior lincaments of his valorous capacity with animosity, he
to his rembling associates pronounced these speeches.

PRince Palma, it behooves us now to be frolique; therefore with a martial
courage lead forth thy Lady, and if any (though Hercules himself) presume to
stop thy passage, sheath instantly thy Amazon Bracamard in his perfidious
breast, and so without prolixity send his servile soul to the Commonwealth of
Pluto for a more then meritorious sacrifice: And you illustrious Ladies, fear
nothing, for the Physnomy of our persons shall be a sufficient Bulwark for your
preservation. Which said, arm in arm (like Apollo and Diana) along they go,
without finding any to resist them; and seeing the Porter in his Pavilion
asleep, very cunningly took from him his keys of the Palace; when unbolting
the outer gate, they without making any noise issued forth, where they were no
sooner come, but they found their Pages each with their Jennets attending them:
glad of this news they (taking their Ladies behind them) mounted on
horseback, and so as fast as the Steeds of Jupiter galloped through the
streets, where in a shoit time, having past both Town and Suburbs, (the obscure
night still seeming to condescend to their pretense) they at last (having
cherished their Ladies with many comfortable speeches) began to consider what
course to take: So that assuring themselves, the King finding the Princess
lacking, would with all possible celerity make speed for their apprehension,
they finally resolved to gallop through the woods and Forests, the better to
shelter them from the sight of avant-Coureurs (if any such there were which
presumed to follow them) by virtue of which predicted resolution, they m^de
that night such speedy way, that before the morning (or at least ere golden
Titan domineered in the silver element) they found themselves very near twenty
leagues from the Court. Now to make any long discourse of the sorrows which
the Court of Zanfara received, or any ample relation of the Troops of
magnanimous Knights sent to seek the^, I think it needless, at least I omit it,
because in my capacity my Muse terms it superf^uous. But howsoever, our Troop
of lovers were so far, that they now knew themselves out of confines of danger:
And therefore to proceed with their future adventures, the next morning as they
were swiftly riding by a Forrest^ side, they through the branches (which were
apparelled with a Summers vesture) might epsy a very pleasant Cottage; which
both Athelia and Mersilva desirous to enter, requested their Princes to alight,
and accompany them, who glad in any thing that might procure their Ladies
delectation, thereunto condiscended; so leaving their Pages with their Horses,
they enter the Forest, directing their course to the Cottage; whereto they
were no sooner arrived, but thinking to find some shepherdess, instead
thereof beheld a very beautiful young man. (which seeming to be overcome with
sorrow, shadowed the vivacity of his countenance under the wrinckled ma^k of a
discontented visage) sitting very sorrowfully slumbering on a verdant bank,
having a Book, Pen, Ink and Paper close by him; which hearing the sound of
their voices, rousing up his spirits, came, and in this sort saluted them

FAir Knights and Ladies! (for so by the Physnomy of your faces you seem to
be) admire not at my sorrows, nor wonder not at my disconsolation; for it is
powerful fortune which has invested me with this miserable calamity: in
respect whereof, to evacuate his tyranny, and to triumph over his usurpation, I
have here solitarily wi^hdrawn my self into this Grove, of purpose to live
though not so well contented as I could wish, yet so well Pleased as man in my
estate may: my Rural Cottage affords no Cates, but poverty; yet as it is, if
you please thereof to accept, I will account m^ self most fortunate, assuring
you that what there wants, good will shall countervaile. Our Princes and
Ladies perceiving the humor of his benignity, and the nature of his kind
proffers, thinking their capacities far indebted to his bountifulness, very
friendly by the tongue of Prince Palma, returned him this amourous answer.

KInd Sir, the apparitions of friendship which in our travels it has pleased
you to afford us, and the displays of amity which you have now demonstrated us,
does so make the Idea of our gratulatio^s run into instant admire, that we find
our selves so far engaged in the bonds of arreares, as we absolutely hold our
imbecillities such, as our tongues cannot at present repay you with a condign
recompense for your unmerited courtesy; nevertheless, according to the
actions of Reason, and rules of amity (albeit a guerdone far insufficient to
countervaile the motives of your benignity) we return you very hearty thanks
for your proffered courtesy, assuring you that if ever any favorable subject
presents, wherein (in honor) we may partly requite your kindness, you shall
find us generally willing, and so willing, as the effects thereof shall term us
to be no amators of ingratitude, but rather favorers of debonaironesse. Which
no sooner was pronounced, but the stranger taking the two Ladies by the hands,
requested them, as also the two Princes, to enter his hermitage: where in the
best manner he could, he presented them with a dainty collation of dry Figs,
Dates, and Apricocks, with other such fruts as the soil of that Country did
afford; which being ended, he to show the Ladies the more pleasure, demanded if
they pleased to recreate themselves in the Arbor, whereof being surpassing
joyful, they very willingly agreed; and so hand in hand with the Princes the
stranger showing the way, forth they went; where passing through a fragrant
Ally beset with Firtrees they at last attained the entrance of the garden where
they were no sooner arrived, but the two Princesses after having viewed the
treasure of the oderiferous flowers, and perused the wealth of the fragrant
herbs, they to avoid the bright ardor of the splendent Sun (because a
professed enemy to their Angelical beauties) with as much celerity as modesty
could permit, betook themselves to the ^owers, where their beloved Cavaliers
with triplicity of divine kisses failed not (chastely) to pay them their
courteous welcome: the stranger viewing their amorous familiarity, suddenly
wept, as if the object thereof had some Regal prerogative to make him water his
plants; in respect whereof, to smooth up his contemplative sorrows under the
Mask of a merry countenance, he instantly hyed him to the Cottage, and
returning speedily, brought with him a dainty harmonical Lute; the which after
having tuned, (thinking to delight their curiosity with the rurity of his
melodious music) he divinely warbled out a ravishing Lesson, and thereunto
contracting his clarent ^oyce* he sweetly uttered this ensuing Sonnet.

Might I but dye (Ah!) in this mournful state,
Then were my death the Actor of my ease;
For then my death would to the world relate
What Saint was subject to my Breasts disease.
Should death relate (Ah!) no, death must conceal
The dainty Mistress of my earthly joy.
Live then in peace; yet fear still to reveal
The heavenly Actresse of thy Hearts annoy.
Ah! Yet not actresse of thy endless pain,
But the sweet Angel of thy Breasts desire;
Therefore with Love immortally remain,
Within the fuel of her beauties fire.
No sooner had he ended his Sonnet, but he in^stantly began afresh to weep,
and so determining to assuage his sorrows (vailing his Bonnet) he presently
departed, walking aloof from them in a fair Summer House; the which our
amorous troop perceiving, began immediately to conjecture that he was in love
with some cruel Lady, and so her rigorous repulse was the motive of his
diste^pered passion; whereat, weighing his grief by their own malady, and his
disconsolation by their own sickness, they all bewailed his (tragical)
misfortune, and pitied the accident of his distasteful calamity; lamenting
that ever their arrival was the occasion to refresh his (amorous) uncured
wound, and sorrowing that their presence in his capacity ingendered prejudicial
contemplation. Yet at last to bring with Ariadnes thread our history out the
Garden, Athelia and Mersilva rose up, determining to depart* which Thalmeno and
Palma no sooner perceived, but they immediately hyed them to the knots, to
gather each for his Mistress a dainty Nosegay, whose beauty, scent and savor
might best delight the humor of their fancies; the which Athelia and Mersilva
remarking, began once more to make the round of the Garden, and so as fortune
would, passing along by a stately Pyne-tree, they upon the Bark thereof might
epsy the Characters of some Verses to be very curiously incarved, which
desirous to see, thereunto approaching, found this or the like fancy therein
contained.

First Fish shall fly within the Element,
And Ai^ry-Birds live in the Ocean Sea,
Fair Phoebus shall forsake the Firmament,
And scorn to grace the cincture of the Day;
Thetis shall Wander over proud Altas top,
And Nilus cease to water Egypts land;
The Earth into the Skies shall fountains drop,
And Neptune's Face refuse to kiss the strand:
All Ships shall sail upon the massy main,
And Aetna frieze at splendour of the Sun;
Dame Cytherea quite shall lose her train,
And Elepants like Clouds in air shall run:
Lebanus-Cedars shall like thistles spring,
And Hysop-tops aspire into the sky;
From Thule to Gange the Dormouse voice shall ring,
And Gnats shall drink all Brooks and Rivers dry,
Before the Idea of Florina's sight
Shall once have power from me to take his flight.
Which Sonnet perusing, and pondering what this Lady therein mentioned might
be; They immediately went, and thereof advertised Thalmeno and Palma, who not a
little admiring to see the name of Florina there charactered, began to
conjecture that he might be Prince Maedor: in respect whereof to satisfy their
ardent desire, they with their Ladies went toward him, where being entered the
Bower, Thalmeno boorded him as follows.

PAssionate Gentleman! for so your gracious (yet sorrowful) aspect induces me
to term^ you: I beseech you in friendship to certify me whether you are
acquainted with the Princess^ Florina Daughter unto the King of Numidia; and
also whether you know Prince Maedor Son unto the King of Biafard? The stranger
no sooner heard pronoun'd the sacred Name of Florina, but he instantly as being
conquered with too many divine cogitation, (in fainting sort) fell to the
ground; when closing his eyes, one would have thought he resolved as then to
take his last definitive Conge of this Caitiff-world. The which our amorous
Crew no sooner beheld, but (pitying this sorrowful accident) they so employed
their best skill for his assistance, that in short time he recovered; and
elevating himself upon his (as yet) weak legs, banishng silence from his
faltring tongue, he in sighing sort breathed out these speeches: AH Florina!
whose Nectar-name infuseth vitality to my weak senses! And so fetching a deep
sigh, again continued as follows. Know (courteous Knights, and beautiful
Ladies) that I have been acquainted with the Princess Florina; and to be
plain, am that unfortunate Maedor which you enquire for* Unfortunate Maedor, I
may well say, in being absent from Florina, the memory of whose divine beauty
has this forty months been the goddess of my devotions. Therefore, gracious
Knights, if you know any news of the aforesaid Princess, I beseech you in
kindness to make my ^reast therewith acquainted; and to congratulate ^our
courtesies: I will in lieu thereof remain your ^ffectionate Servant.

The which speech he had no sooner uttered, but Prince Thalmeno thinking it
more then time to administer some sovereign dictamnum to his tormented Patient,
instantly returned him this applausible Reply.

THen know, Prince Maedor, that I am Thalmeno Son and heir to Druino King of
Cicilia, and this prince my cousin, Son to -- King of Egypt; who some two years
since, resolving to travel, having united our resolutions with the league of
amity, departed from my Fathers Court, directing our course to overview Africa,
and so landing at -- and journying three days alone, being destitute of a
guide, and unskilful of the Country, by misfortune strayed into an unknown
desert; but fortune willing to intermix our bitter sorrows with some delicious
pleasures, conducted us fortunately to a beautiful Castle, which entering, we
found the princess Florina thereof the desolate inhabitant who having forsaken
her Fathers Court, vowe^ there to remain until the joyful return of you^
princely self; therefore valorous Maedor, if you plea^^ to accompany us, we are
bound for Cicilia, and im^mediately upon our arrvials, God willing, we wi^^
conduct you to the melancholy place of her sol^^tary retirement. Maedor having
his capacity repleated with (...) Zephyr wind of this fortunate news, very
kind (accepting of their proffer) past his word to a^company them; nay, and
with so cheerful^ countenance, that in his dead conceit it seemed the absent
idea of Florina had infused exact vitality; but at last fixing his humane eyes
upon the sweet object of the Ladies beauty, and so pondering upon the rarity
of his sweet Florina, he boldly demanded of Thalmeno what those Ladies were,
and what private occasion induced them to travel? who relating him from point
to point the history of their amorous proceedings, and advertising him likewise
how they were desirous to be transported for Cicilia, he thereupon after having
saluted them with a Princely grace, and made his fluent tongue by an eloquent
Oration display the dexterity of his ingenious capacity, very voluntarily
proffered through the Vineyards and Champion Country to conduct them to the
Seaside; for quoth he, I have traveled these parts, and know the direct
course to Golpho-Del-Rey, where I once Landed. Our Amorous Troop being
divinely pleased with this applausible news, very instantly prepared to
depart, where they were no sooner arrived, but Maedor very fortunately met with
a ship of war of Madagascar, which belonging to Duke Alphonso his Uncle, was
by ^empestuous weather and contrary winds forced ^here to take harbor; glad of
this unexpected ^ewes, and triumphing in that they saw fortune so ^milingly
assist their fidelities, they forthwith swapt bargain with the Master to
transport them, and ^o a favorable wind clearing them from the coast, ^n a
sweet sympathy of heavenly amity, hence they ^ile for Cicilia, where on the Sea
they so long re^ained, that after many tempestuous storms, having past the
Isles of Fenando, the Bay of St. Anne, the Coast of Guenhie, Cape Verd, and the
Isles of Teneriffa, they at last safely attained Gibraltar the entrance of the
Mediteranean straights; and so with joy keeping on their course for the desired
Island of Cicilia being opposite of Marsertis, they were toward the night, at
the appearance of Cynthia, very quietly becalmed, in such sort that their ship
made no way, but only floated upon the face of Neptune, according as the
slacknesse of the current drove her: so that at last keeping good watch, as the
third glas^ was in election to be finished, the Mr. in his Russet Cap, walking
aloft upon the Spare-deck, very apparently heard the noise of Oars plowing in
the intrails of Thetis; whereat astonished, resolving to prevent the worst, he
mounted the main shrows directing still his linced eyes, by his attentive eare^
so long, till at last (right a head in their Fore-foot^ he might e^pie a very
stout Galley, using all possibl^ speed with Oars and Sails, swiftly made
to^wards them; at which unlookt for accident (wit^ a magnanimous courage)
rousing his spiritr, (...) with his silver Whistle thundered forth afresh
ala^rum, whereat the whole Toop of Sea-striplings (a^ if they had been at
unawares surprised) with a ga^^lant courage (quitting their course pavilions
mounted the upper Deck, admiring exceeding^^ what this unaccustomed accident
meant; the whi^^ no sooner they had done, but the Mr. showing the^ the cause,
and they seeing the subject before the eyes, very instantly with heroical
resolution fetched forth their Muskets, and provided ^ hings which might be any
way needful for a co^^bat; amongst the rest the Mr. Gunner burning with desire
to approve some experience of his praisworthy Art, requested the Captain that
he might make some shot or two toward them; whereat condi^cending, a couple of
Demi-Culverings (which lay directly forth in the Prow) were immediately
provided, whereunto giving fire (all the company saying Amen) forth went the
shot, with a divilish fury; which being well aimed, so happily arrived to the
desired mark, that it not only made a massacre amongst the miserable slave^,
but also at so sudden a motione made the Commanders themselves tremble, in
such sort, that finding their welcome not so pleasant as they expected, in went
their Ores, down their Sails, ea^h betook themselves to their guard, not once
presuming to approach more near till the morning; which our Master no sooner
perceived, but knowing that they would linger till the next day, having
appointed each his place, and in his absence given the chief Commanders thereof
the obstrict charge, down goes he to the Cabine to comfort our almost
comfortless troop of Lovers, who alas, lay in a mere exact humor of despair;
For they no sooner heard the thundering report of the Cast-peece, but they
genarally resolved it came from some neere-harbouring enemy: There might you
have seen Thalmeno morn, to see his Athelia lament; Palma sigh, to see his
Mersiva shed tears; and Maedor weep, to see them all so disconsolate: there
might you have heard Athelia almost sighed out her heart, thinking to lose her
Thalmeno; have seen Mersilva on the point to melt into tears, to depart from
her Palma, have perceived Maedor afresh with threats to menace the gods for the
loss of his Florina; and in fine, to have seen all to exclaim of their
miseries, in that the fatal Atrapo^ of misfortune began so soon to cut the
thread of their future contentation. Which the Mr. perceiving, having his breast
penetrated with the clangor of their dolorous exclamations, very froliquely in
the best sort he could, bade them be all of good cheer, adding moreover that
there was no fear in the matter, for that he doubted not but in the morning to
remain conqueror; whereupon our three courageous Princes fell afresh to
comfort their two sorrowful Ladies, within the influence of whose eyes for that
night Morpheus could receive no entertainment; for diving into the conceit of
the masters speeches, and conjecturing they should the next morning enjoy a hot
breakfast, they began to doubt of their own safeties, and to imagine what
bloody stratagem might befall their Princely favorites, the which again and
again imprinting within the Cabinet of their memories cerebrosity, they could
not refrain from bewatering their Damask cheeks with chrystalline tears which
distilled from the conduits of their sorrowful eyes: the which our Princes
perceiving, and seeing that no persuasive arguments or soliciting entreaties
might prevail, o^ once evaporat their sighs with the wind of courage, knowing
that it now stood upon them (in so dangerous a cause) to demonstrate their
valors, as well to prevent their own captivity from the Pirates, as also to
free their Ladies, within whose breasts their affectionate loves, nay lives lay
imprisoned) very resolutely without taking leave, departed the Cabin, and so
thrust themselves amongst the soldiers and mariners, which were already in
using of audacity to their valor, and of valor to their resolutions; whom
most courageously they amated with such undanted applausible exhortations, that
imediately the soldiers, generally protested to sacrifice their lives for the
establishing of their tranquilities. So that when the limits of night was
expired, and that the dawn drew near, Aurora in her silver apparel no sooner
began to look through the Casements of heaven, but our masters and Princes so
ordered the matter, that their flags and streamers were abroad playing with the
wind, their Ordnance and Muskets arang'd and laden, their waste-cloaths
unloosed, their Nettings laced up, their Yards sling'd, their Companies
divided, their Linstocks lighted, the Master upon the poop with his silver
Sword to whease them to the Lee-ward, and the Trumpets ready at a beck to sound
the first onset: On the contrary part, the Gally dighted her self in the pride
of her warlike jollity, and with a valorous resolution came toward them,
making such terrible clamors and outcries, as if they meant to affight Jupiter
himself in the citadel of his impregnable monarchy: when instantly, the wind
beginning to fresh, our Master by the condesent of the three Princes edged very
near; and so being come within Cannon shot, brought themselves by their short
sails, resolving to attend her coming, and with honor to fight it out; the
which the Galley-Slaves espying, began to cry victoria, conjecturing, that they
had already yielded: but alas, they were deceived of their hope; for thinking
to board them, the Ship in a moment powered in their small shot as thick as hail,
and therewithal let fly her whole broadside, which in the Galley made such a
rattling thunder, that their rails, penets, yea hatches and all began
(superbiously) to band with the sky; there might you have seen some dangerously
wounded, which lay gasping their last; some already slain, imbruing themselves
in their fellows blood; and some, whose heads flying from their bodies went to
advertise their friends of their woeful Tragedies. Whereat the Captain and
Commanders of the Galley fuming with rage, in that so unexpected they received
such hot entertainment, disdaining to dye in their debts, bade their Gunners
give fire, where betwixt them was so furious a Combat, that it was hard to
judge on which side victory would incline: But leaving the event thereof, to
the inconstancy of Fortune, we will a little err from the fight, and take a
second survey of our Ladies lamentations, who being destitute of their Lovers,
and looking every minute for unmerited death, making their eyes gush forth
fountains, of tears, and their Breasts volley forth millions of sightes, for
sorrow tearing their gorgeous apparel, and the tresses of their tanslucent
hair, lay imbathing their conceits in the flood of despair, as comfortless as
innocent Lambs in the paw of the Lion: their tongues could utter no speech, but
the n^me of their Princ^s, wher^upon continually ruminating, they infused their
courage within the labyrinth of perplexity. Ah, quoth Athelia, would my breast
might be a Bulwark for Thalmo's preservation! and quoth Mersilva, would my body
might be a countermure for Palma's safety! else, quoth Athelia, I might die in
Thalmeno's arm, to demonstrate my constancy! or quoth Mersilva, I end my days
at Palma's feet, to manifest my fidelity In which doleful manner, they
mournfully remained, as if Thanatos had already assummon'd their senses to pay
nature her due.

But again to our Combatants; who eagerly seeking, did so valorously behave
themselves, that it was impossible yet to judge, which side Fortune did most
favor. But to conclude: as time gives a full period to all terrestrical
accidents; when the fatal day was almost finished, wherein many had their
lives catostrohies most famously signed with the signet of death, the Galley
most dangerously (between wind and water) received despairful shot, in such
pitiful manner, that they all within-board made a pitiful cry: the which our
Princes understanding, instantly conceived some hope of victory; whereupon they
afresh let fly their roaring Canon, whose fiery bullets wrapped in terror, made
such spacious breaches in the side of the Galley, that they seeing no
apparition of hope whereon to rely amaining their sail, immediately yielded,
rendering themselves to the mercy of their mortal enemies: the which our Princes
an company perceiving, for sudden joy shouted amain, triumphing in the conquest
of so famous a Victory; when instantly they hoisted out their Shallop to avoid
the prize: but now when she was replenished sufficiently with men and munition,
if any repulse peradventure should have been offered, our Princes were in a
difficult difference which of themselves should therein go Commander. Thalmeno
he willingly offered his service, and Palma he vowed not to stay behind; but
princely Maedor, whose magnanimous, breast did likewise in harbor a Hectors
courage, seeing his associates in contention, which should first be admitted,
stepped in and furiously protested that they should both stay with their Laides,
and he only would go Master of the Ships: they likewise hearing of his
voluntary resolution, allowed best of his reason, and so gave sentence he
should. Whereupon with a noise of harmonical trumpets, away goes Maedor, and
down goes Thalmeno and Palma to the Cabin. Their even now comfortless Ladies,
being by the Herald of report advertised of the victory, came reciprocally to
embrace them with congratulation of their undaunted magnanimities, where so
joyful a meeting was betwixt them demonstrated, that their conceits which
right then swimmed in the Ocean of despair, did now float upon the blisful
waves of pleasant delectation; for their Cynthian complexions were
metamorphosed to cherry countenances; and their mournful eyes which were
almost submerg'd with brinish tears, did now reflect their beams of splendent
vivacity, as glorious Phaebe being free from the cloudy prison of sable
obscurity, each joyfully joyed in each others presence; either reaped more then
exquisite applause, and (in fine) all received such delectable contentation,
that to be plain, my abrupt pen can no way display thereof the exquisiteness,
because my peevish capacity was never acquainted with the labyrinth of the like
amorous encounters. In respect whereof, leaving their secrecy to themselves,
and the censure thereof to the in dustrious Readers, I will make a brief
apostrophie from their melodious parling, and a little entreat of Prince
Maedors proceedings; who by this time being near the Gally, at last very
resolutely entered his men without finding any to resist them, who seeing they
were all hidden, by sound of trumpet commanded them to make their appearance:
when immediately in trembling sort, out came the prisoners, who seeing their
enemies with their swords drawn in their hands, instantly fell on their faces,
desiring pardon; upon whose submissive prostration Maedor commanded his
Soldiers, that upon pain of death none should hurt them, either in body or
goods; the which the Captain understanding (conceiving some hope of his
liberty) very sorrowfully came forth, desiring his life, which benign Prince
Maedor instantly granted: Whereupon after he had informed him from whence the
Gally was, and to whom he appertained, he to Maedor continued his speech, as
follows: Albeit it greiveth my Valor (courageous Knight) to be conquered by
any; yet since my fortune must needs (because predestined) endure the frown
of Bellona, I again rejoice in that it was my blisfulnes to become tributary to
so benign a Commander, therefore kind Knight, in respect that with such
heroical voluntariness you have afforded us our lives, Know that within this
next adjoining Cabine, there is resident a virtuous Lady, whom fortune has
predestined to be our prisoner: Her parentage I know not; but if outward
gestures may depaint inward qualities, I presume she is some Lady of noble
decent; her behavior (though in adversity) is such, that as she carries her
perplexity with a modest countenance, so she disdaineth to render her self
tributary to the infidelity of Fortune.

Maedor no sooner understood this (unexpected) news, but burning with desire
to know what this Lady might be; very friendly commanded the Captain to bring
him to her presence; where he was no sooner ariv'd, but he might perceive this
doleful Lady as it were imbathing her self in the stream of her tears; having
prostrated her person one the floor, and overvailed her Visage with an obscure
skarf, lying as it were in a Cyatical Lethargy, thinking that the first that
entered was the Harbinger of death, or to be plain, the inhumane administer of
her untimely martyrdom: but lo, it fell out otherwise; for when she thought he
was lodging his Rapier in the cytadel of her innocent breast, why even then he
took seizure of her lily hand, and with an amiable voice uttered these speeches.

Arise fair Lady; for your life and liberty is granted you! Whereat very
instantly, as being acquainted with the voice, she with a commendable grace
started up; and pereeiving (as indeed she thought) that it was her Princely
Maedor which pronounced that melodious sentence; at the hearing thereof, as
being ravished with too many divine cogitations, in a dangerous swound she ^ell
to his feet. Maedor perceiving this tragical unexpected accident, having his
heart penetrated with the Chaos of passionate fancies, failed not to employ his
best endeavor for her recovery; and so thinking to elevate her on her feeble
legs, by chance ruffling the Scarf from her beautiful visage, perceived it to
be his (gracious) Florina; whereat arousing the sincerity of his eyes, and the
vivacity of his contemplations, and making his doubtful conceits run to the
confines of astonishment, he at first preambulated with his curiosity, whether
it were she which so well resembled the physnomie of her beauty; but lastly
having diligently sent the influence of his aspects to make surview of her
personage, and finding her to be essentially his unlookt for Florina, with a
trembleing resolution advancing his space, he with outspread arms most
amorously went and embraced her, where so delightful a meeting was betwixt
them demonstrated, that me thought from so pleasing a solace it was mere
sacrilege to separate them: For if Maedor outwardly rejoiced to possess hie
affectionate Florina, Florina reciprocally in heart smiled to enjoy the
presence of her heroical Maedor. Both sent fort disconsolate sighs in witness
of their undaunted loves; and fair Florina having her conceits tosticated with
too many applausible imaginations, could not (being transported with affection)
refrain from bewatering the crimson roses of her angelical visage with many
pearled tears, which descended the soil of her alabaster cheeks. But in fine,
Maedor giving courage to his faltering tongue, thought to incampe the vantguard
of his speeches; but again reflecting his partial aspects upon the divine
object of Florina's beauty, he so found his conceits devoted to silence, that
the review of her chery-countenance smoothing up his senses in an ecstasy of
contentation, forced him instantly to fall into a despairful trance; the which
sorrowful Florina perceiving, melting as it were into tears for imminent
aggravation, with her Lily-fingers began to corroborate the organs of his
temples, so that the Nectar-balm of her sovereign breath infusing vitality to
his sickly senses, made him again refetch his accustmed co^rage, when inviting
his wandering tongue to display the secrets of his wavering capacity, taking
Florina by the alabaster-hand, he from the profundity of his conceits, and
cabinet of his affections, pronounced her these speeches following. AH fair
Florina! if I might finish the period of my days in the cincture of thy
embracemen^s, or now sacrifice the remainder of my life before the aspect of
thy divine deity, I should not only account my self favored of the Sts. in
affording me such good fortune, but also esteem my enterprises more then
blisful, in being ratified by the Synod of the gods themselves: but sweet
Florina, (and therefore sweet because Florina) since the angelical map of thy
personage, and the sacred Zephir of thy Nectar speeches have so freed me from
the chains of bondage, and unloosed me from the setters of despair, that now
before the shrine of your beauteous benignity, fair Mistress of my thoughts,
and goddess of my conceits! I present you with the gift of my service, the
donation of my constancy, and the consecration of my fidelity, assuring you
that as I have long since remained in the prison of your celestial beauty, so
I resolve to dye in being accouted your ever faithful (and never wavering)
Servant to the end; that when the fatal sisters determine to finish the
catastrophe of my days, unpartial Charon may testify that in the Elizian
plains, my penetential soul only vowed to adore the beautiful image of
Florina, as the bright Cynosure of eternal comfort, to whom I dedicated the
gen^rality of my terrestrial devotions. Which heavenly speeches Florina no
sooner understood, but over-shadowing the center of her lily cheeks with the
damask canopy of a crimson vail; having imbathed the Imps of her tender
capacity in the stream of Love, and the conceits of her maiden resolutions in
the flood of affection, being as it were in a very delectable ecstasy (albeit
sudden conceited joys made her senses, yea self to tremble) she in her Ivory
hand taking her snow-white handkerchiff, and evacuating the pearled tears from
her chrystalline countenance, with a lovely (ye^ sorrowful) voice, she returned
him this pleasan^ reply: AH Princely Maedor! If my capacity were acquainted
with that friendly god which ratified thy freedom, or with that favorable
Saint which reconducted thee to my presence: my sincere congratulation should
before their sight display with what faithful constancy I attended thy coming,
and now with what simpathy of entire amity, I honor thy arrival: therefore
welcome, (nay more then welcome) sweet Maedor to thy sorrowful Florina, and
millions of thanks to gracious Mars, for investing me captive to so fortunate a
conqueror: fortunate I may well say, because in the essence of thy personage,
my absolute (nay only (solace lay imprisoned; and if more may be, more then
fortunate, in being by the enjoyance of thy prospect deprived from the
residence of my accustomable disconsolations. Ah dear Maedor, since thy
sorrowful departure, I have lived mo^^ comfortless; yet in enjoying the
felicity of thy visage, I now wreath up the memory of aggravation in the
cinders of oblivion; love (yea love) because invincible affection has so
captivated my conceits, and conquered my senses, that only (...) now live to
serve sweet Maedor; and maugre the effects of Fortune, resolve to dye in the
amorous league of his desired friendship.

Maedor pondering upon this kind answer, and perceiving his conceits were
exceedingly obliged to her courtesy, straining her most affectionately by her
Lily fingers, and binding his partial aspects upon the Temple soil of her
Ivory incarnate visage, embracing her again within his lovely (nay more then
lovely, because most faithful) arms, he from the concavity of his joyful
breast, shaped her this friendly answer.

AH dear Florina! whose lively sight infuseth vitality to my dead senses;
banish now from thy breast the memory of sorrow, and let only the motives of
contentation flourish in the Commonwealth of thy conceits; for now before the
shrine of thy sacred self, upon the Altar of fidelity, Maedor presents thee
with so complete a portion of undaunted friendship, as you any way can desire,
or the gods themselves distribute: And sweet Florina, sinc^ by fortune it so
falls out, tha^ now contrary to my expectation you are made my blisful
prisoner, know Mistress of my imaginations, and Angel of my delights, that in
most honorable company I am bound for Cicilia, where as soon as Ae^lus and
Neptune shall set me ashore, I will most willingly, if you please, solemnize
the Rites of our Nuptials with the contract of Marriage, and rati^ie my
beautiful Florina to be the sole and supreme Empress of my breasts
expectation. Florina no sooner understood the harmonious ^rymol^gie of these
sacred speeches, but in her breast and capacity sweetly ruminating upon the
sugared Cadenca of their delectable interpretation, assummoning her Maiden
senses in the field of affection, she instantly returned him this kind answer.

THink not, sweet Maedor, that having long since devoted my self thy handmaid,
I will now repent me of my enterprise, and so frustrate thy expectation^ in the
Autumn of their hopes, but rather I pray resolve (at least if my prayers may
gain acceptance in the front of your amity) that Florina esteems the seal of
our Nuptials to be the preamble of her fortunacy, and the uniting of our
affections the very quintessence of her felicity; therefore I beseech you delay
no time, but rather advance thy enterprise, to the end that Maedor receiving
the chief solace of his breast, Florina may reciprocally enjoy the desired
Prince of her immortal delectation. Maedor infusing her applausible resolution
within the affectionate profundity of his competent censure, having his breast
penetrated with more exquisite amity then he ever thought Venus presented to
her wanton Adonis, or Dido to her wavering Aenaeas, sending again the influence
of his aspects to ratify a mutual combination with her Angelical beauty, he
kindly embracing her slender waste, and courteously giving her coral lips the
impresse of a Nectar kiss, with a gracious familiar resolution, framed her
this amorous answer.

WHy then, my fair Florina, make ready for your departure; to the end that I
may advertise my Princely Associats of our blissfulness, and so prosecute our
voyage to Cicilia. To Cicilia! quoth Florina: and therewithal the pearled
tears trickled down her Vermilion cheeks; which Maedor perceiving, and
admiring at her sudden sorowfulness, courageously demanded her the occasion of
her disconsolation. Oh! quoth Florina, since I first heard you repeat the name
of Cicilia, my present joys does afresh put me in mind of my forepast
miseries: for, lovely Maedor, having for thy sake sequestered my self from all
company, and built up my residence in a desolate Castle, thereunto unexpectly
arrived two foreign Knights from Cicilia, who in reward of some small
be^ignity I afforded them, protested very solemnly to re^earch thee out (at
lest if the confines of Africa did con^ain thy personage.) Well quoth Maedor,
and have you ^ot since heard of their adventurous proceedings? No, replied
Florina, whereat I much sorrow, in respect ^hey were amators of my passions,
and favorites of thy af^ections. Thus with most pleasant pratle in amorous
alliance they deluded the time; till at last Prince Maedor shaking himself out
of his delicious dumps, and arousing his senses from their amorous plaudi^^,
very secretly in his breast stamped this resoluti^n; Why Maedor, are thy humane
affections so de^^ted to love, that now in entertaining Cupid, thou ^^vest Mars
a farewell, or in courting Cytherea, thou ^avest Bellona desolate? what, has
the fair aspects Florina (with Circes) so charmed the fuel of thy ^^sire, that
in contemplating on her beauty, thou intombest thy military actions in the
shrine of oblivion? No, no, Maedor: Affections are but fancies, and love does
best resemble the flowers of Syria, which no sooner flourish with the
splendantnesse of Titan, but fade with the obscurity of Cynthia: therefore let
passionate fictions give place to fame, and let amorous conceits stoop to
magnanimity. Which aspiring speeches he no sooner pronounc^d, but instantly his
fair Florina, in the jollity of he^ best attire, rusht from out her Cabinet; at
the sudde^ sight whereof, forgetting his former inhuman conclusions, and now
d^voting his future oraisons to the Altar of her excellency, having lost his
Martia^ courage in the Physnomy of her effeminate countenance, and drowned the
motives of War in the chrystalline Vermilion of her beauty, he resolv^ to
direct his pace toward her; but she perceivin^ his presence, determined to
prevent his purpose and so meeting him half ways, delivered him th^^ lovely
salutation.

COme sweet Maedor, let us here-hence depart, (...) crown our miseries with the
triumphs of co^^tent; Fortune you know is variable, therefore (...) sl^p no
time (in effecting our Nuptials) while op^portunity does present; Only this
before we d^^part, I entreat you that these miserable slaves (...) your
conquering valor made captives, may (with^out prejudice of their substance or
selves) have (...) permission to dep^rt safely. Prince Maedor well liking her
benign nature, and commending her capacity for projecting so charitable a
virtue, very willingly thereunto condiscended, and so taking conge of his
prisoners, and commanding his Shallops to be made ready, (embracing his
goddess Florina in his Princely arms) with his noise of clarent Trumpets most
cheerfully departed; but long he floated not on the surges of Thetis, till a
favorable Zephyr gale reconducted him in safety to his ship, where courageously
entering, and demanding for the Princes, answer was instantly made him, that
they were in the Cabine, playing on the Lute to delight their Ladies; whereupon
leaving Florina (for a whiles) at the door, down goes he to participate of
their exquisite melody; the which Thalmeno and Palma no sooner per^eived, but
laying their instruments apart, each par^icularly with his Lady went and
saluted him, ^sking what news? why none quoth Maedor, but ^nly this, that
instead of a rich prize, I have found ^n inestimable Gem, the valuation
whereof, in my ^onceit, may not sufficiently be numbered by the ^hole
industrious characters of Arithmetiques fa^ulty. No, quoth Athelia and
Mersilva, why then it ^ppeares you have lighted upon the Mint of Mexico, or
^lse fallen foul of the Minerals of Peru. Neither have (...) replied Maedor,
and yet I divinely rejoice in pos^^ssing the tenuity of so sacred a present.
Whereun^^ Palma and Thalmeno answered, It is then like ^rince Maedor, that you
have understood some novelty ^^om your Princess Florina, or at least seen the
resem^^ant Idaea of her beautiful excellency. Maedor hearing the divine name of
his Florina repeated, cold not refrain from producing secret smiles, because
the syllables of her sacred Anagram ravished his senses in an ecstasy of
delectation; whereat Florina advancing her pace, presented her self before the
complete view of the company; at which beautiful object, Thalmeno and Palma
reflecting their linced regards upon the superlative daintiness of her
Angelical Physnomy, presently conjectured her (as indeed she was) to be the
perfect personage of admired Florina; but again, not able to ratify their
suspected assurance with certainty, still contemplating on the rarity of such
exquisit perfection, looking one on the other, durst not presume in adventuring
to salute her; on the other side, Florina binding the influence of her
speculation upon the mirror of their countenances immediately (by the Architect
of their complexions) deemed them to be Thalmeno and Palma; but at last after
many amorous regards sent from the influence of their eyes were evacuted,
Thalmeno refetching the sensibility of his conceits, began to esteem that it
was absolutely fair Florina upon the soil of which applausible resolution,
definitely erecting an assured foundation, he very joyfully stepped, and with ^
lovely kiss saluted her in this sort.

AH sweet Florina! thrice welcome to joyful^ Thalmeno, and millions of thanks
to debonai^ fortune for investing mine eyes with the object o^ such unexpected
blissfulness! Florina hereat blush^ing in the Lily soil of her alabaster
cheeks (to the spectators sight) produced the apparition of crymson Roses; and
so (after having glanced upon Maedors excellency) addressing her speech to
Princely Thalmeno, she very gallantly with a modest grace, returned him this
dulcid reply: Thanks, courteous Prince, for your heroical benignity; and more
then fortunate am I, to be the essential subject of your dilectable
contentation. But here Prince Palma interrupting her speeches, went
majestically, and likewise saluted her; where betwixt these three majesticks of
affection, such joyful plaudities of exquisite amity was repeated, that Athelia
and Mersilva, (of Florina unseen) sitting attentively in a corner admired what
this unlookt for prospect betokened; for first investing the habilement of a
jealous conjecture, they thought this minion of beauty was of purpose come to
frustrate their hopes of expected contentation: but instantly poizing the
fidelity to their Princes by their own affections, and their undaunted loves by
their absolute likings, (repenting themselves for the conceit of such unmerited
inconstancy) they both resolved in familiare amity very kindly to salute them:
but Prince Maedor standing aloof from their presence, and conjecturing by the
mutability of their countenances, that their imaginations were tosticated in
the surges of perplexity, finding a lovely remorse in his affectionate breast,
with a gallent (heroical) resolution went and in this sort, saluted them:

FAir Princesses, (and therefore fair, because embellished by supreme deity)
This beauteous Nymph (if speaking without partiality) which here presents her
self before the influence of your contemplation, is (only) the sweet substance
of my (admired) Florina; Florina I say, whose exquisite pourtraict and dainty
personage I adore as the unique goddess of my capacities felicity. Athelia
and Mersilva swallowing down the Ambrosian sweetness of these sugared speeches,
and infusing in their cerebrosities the unlook't for event of this applausible
accident, demonstrating by the plaudity of their smiling aspects, that their
conceits were raked up in the imbers of delectation, with the sympathizing
unity of one melodious voice returned him this harmonical answer:

Nay then, Prince Maedor, we exquisitely rejoice in that Celestial deity has
Coroniz'd the trinary of our affections with the Garland of content; and much
solace in that the fancies of our conceits are so blisfully confirmed by the
fortunate arrival of your divine Florina! Whereupon Prince Maedor gratifying
their courtesies with thanks, and their curiosities with affection, taking each
by the Lily hand, determined to go and salute his Saint; but on the contrary
part, Prince Thalmeno and Palma conceiving their determination, thought to
prevent their purpose, and so embracing the Lady Florina in their arms, went
reciprocally likewise to meet them, yea, and in such amorous sort, that each
lovely Band advancing there pace, they at last, very affectionately approached
one the other; where on both sides was demonstrated such super-ceremonious
courtesy, that for instant joy me thought my Muse stood silent, as being
ravished with pleasure in the labyrinth of delectable admiration.

To relate therefore the lovely-smiles, affectionate sighs, piercing
countenances, and pleasant prattle which were banded and sent between this
amorous army, were but a meritorious subject to make this my (abrupt) Pamphet
swel into an ample story. Therefore to avoid prolixity, and yet in such
mediocrity, as hoping not to incur the Readers indignation, I will leave to
consider with what fervent desire each wished themselves landed upon the
(esteemed Pactolus) shoares of golden Cicilia, the which the Master of the Ship
perceiving (having his breast penetrated with the consideration of their
tormented amities) failed not to the utmoste of his power to shorten their
Seafaring Voyage; so that hoysting on more Sail, and plowing through the
liquid intrals of Nereus, they at last in a radiant day (when Titan in his
Merid^an thron began with his splendent locks to visit the Western Plains) very
fortunately espied the desired coast of Cicilia; which at first they could not
well make until the Aetna Promontory decided their doubt: which the master
perceiving (throwing up his Cap for joy) went and immediately advertised our
Cyprine t^oop of this fortunate news; which no sooner was by the Herald of
report bruted amongst them, but instantly leaving their amorous (yet chaste)
dalliance, they very cheerfully (being desirous to repleat the influence of
their eyes with so wished for an object) most courageously mounted the upper
Deck, by which time the wind continually freshing, they were almost approaching
the shore: the prospect whereof so revived their sickly senses, that Prince
Thalmeno at last seeing the Ship at an Anchor, very courageously commanded the
Boatsen to set them a-land.

In which mean time the three Princesses hying to their cabinets, did so
gorgeously dight themselves in the pride of their glistering jollity, that they
rather resembled heavenly Nymphs, then humane Paragons, and Sacred Queens, then
Terrestrial Personages: For their Angelical cheeks, which their golden hair
delighted to sport withal; their globy fronts, within whose Alabaster
circumference the Graces range in; their piercing eyes of power, to obscure the
brightness of Olympus; and their Ivory paps, wherein their azured veins make
their Nectar Ampythrite display such a delicate apparition of Paphian
allurement, that I absolutely conjectured Ulysses would have stoopt to
contemplate on the soil of their countenance; and Jupiter himself, at their
delicate sight, to be invested their favorite, would have left fair Ganymede
desolate upon the Downs of Ida. So now the blisful hour of their departure
being come, arm in arm, like Saints of Felicity they rushed forth, presenting
themselves to their Princes; who attending their arrival, received them with
more then exquisite applause; where amongst them past so many millions of
Amazon speeches, that the motives thereof, would have daunted the proudest
enemy of (Angelical) Cytherea: But in fine, they generally taking leave of
the Company, (and the Shallop ready) in most exquisite Heroical manner they
most gallently departed: At whose Ultimum vale, the Master gave such a
thundering volley of Ordnance, that the rebounding Echo thereof drove the
Harboring Cicilians into the affrighting humor of Timerositie; upon which
unexpected Accident, presupposing that some Foreign Enemy was come to invade
them, they in swarms of Martial Troops directed their course to the Seaside;
upon whose obdurate Sands with Drums courageously sounding, and Ensigns
sumptuously displayed, they very valorously attended their Landing. Our Princes
perceiving this unexpected Warlike Assembly, began immediately to doubt the
issue of their Martialll determinations; so that grounding their resolutions
upon the Rock of discretion, and their imaginations upon the Bulwark of
Tranquillity, they afar off commanded a Banner of Truce to be demonstrated; and
so evapourating fear from their courage, and timerosity from their
Countenances, they very audaciously drew near the shore; Which the Cicilians
espying, being desirous to know of what Countery they were, and what this
unaccustomed Alarm meant, in swarms of Martial Troops with magnanimous
resolutions, they advanced, to prevent their landing: But Prince Thalmeno with
the rest of his amorous Associates, not passing for their flourishing
bravadoes, commanded the Boatien to row them ashore; which no sooner was
effected, but presenting their Ladies with many sugared kisses (for their Bien
Venue) each conducting his own beautiful Saint, they very valiantly marched
forwards: The Cicilians conjecturing to have fought some hot skirmish, being
only instead thereof met by this weak company, dragged their Ensigns with
laughter in the dust, whereas heretofore they superbiously displayed them in
the air with doughtinesse. In fine, the chief Commanders of the Regiments,
burning with desire to know what this Martial effeminate, Tragi-Coemedy meant,
with courageous resolutions advanced their spaces to parle with them: whom no
sooner they approached, but first glancing their aspects upon the beautiful
countenances of the Angelical Ladies, they at last making an Apostrophe from
their Beauties, settled their rights upon the bold Complexions of the admired
Knights; so that their (Lynceus) eyes ranging circumspectly upon the valorous
Physnomy of their Heroical visages, they at last very apparently perceived
their Sovereign young Prince Thalmeno to be there present: At which
applausible (contemplative) Object, having their hearts conquered with instant
Trophies of many delectable Triumphs, they casting aside their weapons, went
and submissively prostrated themsemselves to his feet: whlch Prince Thalmeno
perceiving, after having gratified their loyal affectionate humility with
thanks, commanded them to Troop up their Forces, and so to accompany him and
his Princely associates to the Palace: Which radiant celestial news was no
sooner bruted in the Camp, but very sumptuously in Warlike array, the porches
being strewed with Laurel boughs and Roses, they gallantly marched forwards;
whereof the ancient King Druino being certainly advertised, (having his heart
ravished with the applausible news of his Son Thalmeno's arrival) instantly
commanded three superbious rich Coaches to be sent toward them, to convey him
with his Princely companions to the Court, which trampling courageous Coursers,
like the Steeds of Phoebus, made such speedy celerity, that in short time they
drew near the Suburbs of Mesana; which being the capital City of Cicilia, was
so proudly dight in the pride of her warlike jolity, that the multitude of
roaring Canons, and silk ( I^is) Ensigns being planted on the Bulwarks and
Towers, rather mad^ me conjecture it to be famous Troy, then fair (...) The
King his father being certified of his (...) accompanied with his lovely (...)
with a glistering Regiment of (...) Cavaliers, very Majestically issued (...)
them, where before the Port-Royal^ (...) saluted each other, and in (...) as
was either in right due to (...) son (correspondent) (...) likewise with joyful
tears (...) so after having generally saluted as well Prince Thalmeno, as
Palma and Maedor, with their beautiful Ladies, they in pompeous magnificence
rode on to the City; at whose joyful entrance, the Loyal-hearted Inhabitants
caused such a thundering peal of Ordnance to be discharged, that the terrible
rebounding echo thereof not only affrighted Jupiter in his Celestial Diadem,
but likewise made Mars himself tremble in the (sacred) Bulwark of his
impregnable Citadel; the streets also as they past, were beautified with many
sumptuous Pageants, where to demonstrate the Citizens voluntary kindness, this
Royal Troop was feasted with many curious banquets, presented by peerlesse
Virgins of super-excellent beauty: Thus passing the streets in bravery, being
impaled by the warlike young men of the City, they at last arrived to the
dignified Palace; where a double Court of Guard (commanded by the chief Nobles
of the Island) most famously received them. To recount therefore the sumptuous
Feastings, the triumphant Tiltings, (...) majestical Masks, and the
honorable (...) wherewith King Druino admiredly celebrated (...), were (I
think) superfluous to this my (...), and the Readers discreet (...) conjecture
he can more curiously (...) ^ontemplation, then my Infant-Muse (...) it; by
virtue of which (...) ^riefly with our history:

(...) from point to point displayed (...) the manner of his (...) (...) the
virtuous (Princely) disposition of the three Angelical Ladies (but especially
of his Saint Athelia) he being (upon report thereof) desirous to try if the
temple of her senses were adorned with such rare perfections as his Son
affirmed, very privately invited her to a secret conference; where wresting her
with sundry intricate questions, as well of wit as loyalty, Love as Modesty; he
at last found her compleately so virtuous, that comparing her ingenious
qualities with her Princely descent, he accounted himself hapy to be endued
with so gracious a Daughter, and his Son most fortunate in being endowed with
so peerlesse a Paragon; the Queen likewise reflecting a partial eye upon her
modest gesture, and prying into the concavity of her Princely conditions, found
her natural qualities to be so adorned with the affable demonstratives of
debonair benignity, that perioding her capacity with this definitive
resolution, she thought her not only to be a second Diana for modest chastity,
but also a super-excellent Calliope for ingenious curiosity; by virtue whereof,
still seriously ruminating upon the measured Cadenca of her Princely educations,
as also pondering upon the splendant virtues wherewith they saw the Garden of
her glistering cerebrosity to be imbellished, she imediately resolved that no
greater bliss could accidentally befall her Son, then (for his Nuptial
compartner) to be graced with so sweet a Princess; so that the Father being
(applausibly) pleased, the Mother more then divinely contented, and both
triumphing in the conceits of this delectable sympathy, could enjoy no solace
in their estimates, nor pleasure in their contemplation, until they had
assigned the day of desire, wherein the two darlings of Love might enjoy the
fruition of their ardent affection; which was not long prefixing; for their
Princely Parents knowing the frailty of youth, the force of love, the power of
beauty, and the efficacy of temptation, thought whiles occasion did present, to
let no opportunity slip; and therefore, in the plaudity of a pleasant humor,
appointed that the next Festival (which was some twenty days following) their
Nuptial Rites should be solemnized; which sacred divine news Thalmeno and
Athelia no so sooner understood, but having their hopes elevated upon the wings
of contentation, flew as it were aloft, in the Celestial Paradise of eternity;
so, as imbathing their curiosities in the Nectar streams of conceived solace,
with many millions of amorous applauds they attended the hour wherein their
expectations should be crowned with the heavenly Garland of content. But now to
our other Princes and their Ladies, who being by the Herald of report
advertised of Thalmeno's Fortunate proceedings, burn with desire upon the Stage
of Matrimony to be Actors of the like Comedy; the which Thalmeno perceiving,
viewing their languishing sickness by his own tormented malady, went to the
King his Father, and with a trembling Oration (the tears standing in his eyes)
requested that his two Princely companions might likewise under his gracious
favor enjoy their virtuous desired Paragons; which condign process he so
authentically sollici^^d, that the King his Father (with direction) diving into
the concavity of his Sons demand, and finding the subject of their desires to
be extracted from the pure model of chaste affection, presenting pity before
the stage of his eyes, and charity upon the Theater of his contemplations,
(with a debonair aspect) gave sentence, that one day should finish the general
triplicities of their marriages. The Zephir wind of which sweet novelty was no
sooner by Thalmeno transported to the ears of our amorous regiment, b^t Palma
embracing his beautiful Mersilva, and Maedor kissing the coraline lips of his
fair Florina, did in the triumphs of love as it were floate upon the streams
of blisfull applause; so that their lovely conceits fetching a course beyond
the confines of Cynthia, did (without rest) range upon the Paradise of
approaching pleasures. On the other side, whiles these Imps of Venus were with
pleasant dalliance beguiling the time, King Druino was not idle in making
sumptuous preparations for the celebrating of their weddings: and the more to
dignifie that day with heroical triumphs, he through the Carrafours of his
Island (by Gartian his Herald of Arms) commanded a Tournoy and Joust to be
proclaimed; whereunto not only the Nobles of his Dominions should be welcome,
but also all Foreign Princes and Cavaliers (whatsoever) might have free
access: The heroical thundering report whereof was no sooner (by the silver
trump of fame) dispersed through the harboring Nations, but thither (I mean
to Cicilia) came abundantly flocking many valorous Troops of magnanimous
Martialists; so that at the time of assignation, as there want^d not swarms of
prospectors to behold the triumphs, so there needed not innumerable of
Cavaliers to satisfy their expectations. So that the joyful day being come,
which as the ingenious Cicilians did illustrate with terrestrial bravery, so
the gods themselves in the Synod of their resolutions did determine to
stelli^ie with heavenly beauty: for Au^ora no sooner gave the obscure night a
valorous overthrow, but splendant Titan in his fiery Coach began with his
golden rays to embellish the cincture of the day; when the streets being hung
with curious tapestry, the Pageants adorned with glistering ingeny, and the
Pavement strewed with Flora's jollity, by many bands of Kings, Queens, Nobles,
and Ladies, these our (Idalian) Lovers most majestically were conducted to the
Temple; where being by the Ring of matrimony (till the final period of their
lives catastrophe) each firmly united to other, They at last in the plaudity of
amorous contented imaginations returned to the Palace, where with curious
feasts, sumptuous dances, and stately masks, their marriages were so
magnificently solemnized, that the description thereof my eaglet Muse (nay all
the instinct of Parnassus) cannot sufficiently relate: Therefore we will make
an Apostrophe from these dignified braveries, and being overvailed with the
Curtains of obscure night, bring each of these our amorou^ love^s to their
(terrestrial Paradise) B^d-chambers where the doors being shut, and they
entombed within the Ivory shrine of a pair of Lawn-sheets, we will likewise
leave them to their amorous (divine) pleasures, and (praying Venus to guard
them within the lists of her sacred influence) return to the next day, wherein
the Heroical feats of Chivalry were to be accomplished. The morn was fair, the
skies bright, the wind calm, and Phoebus in his radiant pavilion delighted to
grace the cincture of the day with his meridional beauty: therefore the Tilts
being built, the Tents erected, the Cavaliers ready, and the Herald prepared;
let us for a while give Conge to the Court, and with valor direct our History
to the Camp; wherein a Gallery, Theatre-wise, was so industriously built, that
the royal Assembly, and sweet Ladies might it their ease prospect all, and in
safety stand unprejudiced of any, whose glistering divine beauty so gloriously
sparkled admiration to the (astonished) spectators, that the excellent
contemplation thereof was not only of complete power to infuse valor to the
most courageous, but also of exact force to make a mere Dastard prove a doughty
Conqueror. Now to begin with the Articles projected for Til^ing, it was thus
ordained, That the Cicilians should answer all comers: Whereupon by the Kings
command, the Herald sounded to the Combat; when instantly, a Cicilian Knight
gallantly mounted, entering the List, was presently met by a warlike Hungarian,
who at the first encounter lodging his Lance in his Enemies breast, very
valorously unhorsed him, making him (despite his pride) most humbly greet the
ground with his Personage, whereon but even then his horse superbiously
trampled: To revenge whose infamy, another Cicilian saluting the King,
(fetching his cariere) galloped within the Lists; which, as the first, was by
the Hungarian in a moment vanquished: The King astonished hereat, by his
Page-royal sent the Conqueror a Present; and so extolling highly his valor,
commanded two fresh Champions to be admitted; which instantly was accomplished.
But wavering Fortune resolved (for a time) to smile on the strange Cavaliers,
did by the instinct of her Camelion influence continually afford them victory;
so that of twenty Cicilian Champions which ran that day, not one remained
Conqueror, but all to their immortal shame, returned vanquished. The whole
assembly admiring hereat, could not refrain from (blushing) astonishment: the
which the King remarking (instantly) commanded the Triumphs for that day to
break off, and so the general assembly departed. But now as the rumor hereof
was bruted abroad, and almost in the Court no other news walking; our three
young Princes (I mean Thalmeno Palma and Maedor) storming with disgrace to see
their associats so defeated, (tickling their conceits with the consideration of
honor) and fame likewise in their breasts refreshing the embers of magnanimity,
they at last gave this period to their resolutions, that the very next morn
(secretly) in person (maugre the effects of Fortune) they would maintain the
Combat* Upon which resolute determination, they hied to the Kings
Munition-house, and there chose each of them a green Armor of Velvet, imbossed
with fixed Stars and Roses of pure beaten gold: But again, the better to bring
their purpose to pass, they under the mask of disguise, secretly so wrought
with the King, that the next morn, to decide the Combat, there should be of
each side elected three chief Champions, whereof, whosoever remained
Conqueror, should immortally be invested with the Olympian garland of dignified
fame. Whereupon Aurora (having washed her Amber locks in the azured Plain of
Thetis) no sooner with her Cynthian complexion appeared in the purpled sky, but
the Drums traversing the Streets, advertised all (as well natives as foreigners)
of the Kings intended resolution. The Cicilian Knights (not knowing of the
three Princes determination) prepared themselves to the Combat, and so
likewise did the strangers, amongst whom, they elected three magnanimous
Princes, whose names anon shall be at large related. In fine, King Druino, the
Queen, the three Princesses, with the rest of the Nobility, were again seated
in the Theater, inwardly burning with desire to know on whose side (inconstant)
Fortune would incline: whiles thus all things was ready, the Herald no sooner
sounded to the Combat, but three strange Champions entered the Lists, being
gallantly mounted and dight in silver Armor, inameled with Azure, having their
Plumes all white and blew, prefiguring hope: on the contrary part, whiles the
Cicilians were in contention, which three should enter: Lo, even then three
gallant Cavaliers (being Cicilians) unexpectedly arrived, richly mounted upon
snow-white Barbarian Coursers, apparelled in green Armor, having their Plumes
crymson and white, displaying the beauty of their Ladies; the King and company
admiring what these unknown Cicilians (commending their audacious valor and
martial dexterity) commanded them to begin. So the two foremost having made
obeisance, giving Spurs to their Jennets, very valorously advanced; at which
furious encounter, they both so gloriously behaved themselves, that it was
difficult to censure whose side victory did most favor, but at last the
Cicilian making a short turn (as being expert in those martial actions)
planting his Lance in his enemies Crest, very gallanty bore him of the Saddle,
to the no little rejoicing of the whole Assembly, which for ravishing applause
shouted amain. The second stranger, not any thing daunted with his fellows
misfortune, very courageously set forwards; who being by the next Cicilian as
bravely met, were both (at first) very near dismounted: In which triumphant
Combat, having broken their Lances (and sent the shivers in the Air to band
with Mars) they retired; but no sooner were they furnished by their Pages with
fresh Lances, but giving spurs to their Coursers, they again advanced, where
the Cicilian so gallantly behaved himself, that at the next encounter he forced
both horse and man to the ground, yea and with such a terrible fury, that the
whole assembly conjectured he had given the world his (last) fatal farewell;
which the third strange Champion perceiving (as having his valorous courage
inflamed with honor) with an undaunted resolution gave Spurs to his Jennet; so
the last Cicilian Knight perceiving his approach, with a fierce audacity ran to
encounter him, where b^twixt these warlike h^r^^ical Martialists so many
valorus feats of Chivalry were demonstrated, that the whole assembly reaped
exact applause by prospecting the object of so rare a Combat ^ut to conclude,
as the in^^^ence of time gives a full period to all terres^rial accidents, so
in the twinkling of an eye, this strange Cavalier was by the Cicilian Knight
most famously vanquished, to the no little rejoicing of the joyful spectators,
and also to the delicious applause of the King himself, who for this fortunate
victory (erecting Trophies of contentation in the Center of his Capacity) came
himself in Person to gratify these Conquerours with his royal thanks: When
(being unarmed) espying them to be his Son Thalmeno, with the other two Princes
Palma and Maedor, having his conceits elevated within the Eden of delectation,
very courteously went and embraced them, triumphing in the Conquest of their
audacious ma^nanimities. The Queen likewise being advertised of this unlookt
for news, accompanied with the three Princesses, Athelia, Mersilva, and Florina
(together with a glistering troop of Ladies) came likewise to salute them, and
so (after many amorous speeches were past) conducted them in a most triumphant
manner to the Palace; where they were no sooner arrived, but burning wi^h
desire to know what these vanquished Knights were, they so wrought with the
King, that he presently dispatched a Nobleman of his (gallantly followed) to
request them to the Court; when instantly, those vanquished Cavaliers (nothing
daunted with the infidelity of misfortune) accompanied with many Troops of
valorous Knights (with a gallant resolution) directed their pace to the Court,
where passing the silver Hall and golden Gallery, they were conducted to the
dignified Chamber of Presence, where the King, Queen, and Princesses, under a
glorious Canopy of purple imbossed with Diamonds, attended their arrival; at
whose entrance, descending their Thrones of Estate, they advanced to salute
them. But now remark the mutability of fortune; for our three beautiful
Paragons presenting themselves before their Presence (with intent to salute
them) and glancing their eyes upon the physnomy of their complexion,
immediately perceived them to be their (unexpected) natural Fathers; the
sudden sight whereof so daunted their contemplations, that betwixt love and
fear, they prostrateing themselves to their feet, very instantly fell to the
ground, demanding pardon; At which comical accident the Cavaliers prying more
seriously upon their bashful complexions, found them absolutely to be their
only daughters; so that natural affection constraining them ^o rain
fountains of tears from the Conduits of their eyes, being in conceit ravished
with the joyful alarum-bell of this unlookt for news, they elevated them again
on their feet, and so banding their sight each upon others countenances, they
in the plaudity of that heavenly contemplation a long time remained silent; but
at last accumulating their wits before the throne of discretion, and steeling
their tongues with the phrase of joyful acclamation, they in sighing for
breathed out these speeches:

Welcome sweet Daughters to your (once) sorrowful Fathers, and millions of
thanks to celestial deity for investing our eyes with the desired object of
your beautiful personages: Which King Druino with his Queen no sooner
overheard, but perceiving them to be the happy Parents of these virtuous
Ladies, in most affectionatewise graciously went and saluted them, blessing the
divine hour which afforded them the honor of their presence, and exquisitely
rejoicing in that by their arrivals they were made so exceedingly fortunate.
The three Angelical Princesses all this while having their pleasant
countenances metamorphosed to sorrowful complexions, with tears in their eyes
stood trembling for timerosity, fearing least their Fathers would rebuke them
for their disobedient audacity. The which their Fathers perceiving, (but not
supposing that either of them were married) with cheerful countenances
demanded the cause of their disconsolations; who having their senses overvailed
partly with sorrowful fear, and partly with natural affection, dying their
visages with a vermilion-blush, stood merely silent, as trembling to incamp the
avant-guard of their speeches. The which King Druino remarking, very boldly
stepped to their Fathers, and related him, That being married without your
Princely condescents, he supposed they doubted to discover it, fearing lest
they should (deservedly) incur the livery of your indignation. Married! quoth
their Fathers; why, to whom? Surely, quoth Druino, Athelia to Prince Thalmeno
my Son and heir apparent to my Crown; Mersilva to Prince Palma Son to
Blithgora King of Egypt, and Florina to Prince Maedor son to Orlando King of
Biafara. The which these Kingly Parents no sooner understood, but triumphing in
that their Daughters were so honorably matched, they amorously went, and most
sweetly embraced them: King Druino seeing them herewith divinely contented,
determining to add more applause to their ravished conceits, told them likewise
that it were those three dignified Gallants (their Sons in Laws) that so
valorously had conquered them; which again administering more joy to the
plaudity of their pleasant imaginations, did so tickle their conceits with
Nectar applauds, that they desired they might fix their eyes upon the object of
their Sons personages, which immediately was performed; For our Heroical young
Princes no sooner understood the Zephir news of this strange novelty, but
instantly posting to their presence, they very obediently saluted them,
imploring pardon for their audacious enterprises, which with a gracious benign
reply was soon granted them, and so embracing them (in their daughters sights)
with a sweet affectionate sympathy, they in public view generally from their
hearts, ratified that which before was solemnly solemnized. King Druino
perceiving this unexpected Heroical meeting, remarking how these sweet
Martialists of affection were with their sweet Paragons fortunately united,
failed not in most triumphant order to imbellish this dignified Assembly with
sumptuous bravery: So as banqueting these foreign Kings with such Princely
entertainment as was befitting their Majes^ical personages, ^e a long time
retained them in his Cicilian Kingdom, to the no less applause of his
faithful Subjects, then admiration of all foreign spectators; many days were
expired in solemnizing these sumptuous Triumphs, the dignified honor whereof
mounting the skies, will till eternity redound to the Cicilians immortal fame.
The three renowned Kings seeing it now high time to draw homewards, (because
they knew the public affairs of their Kingdoms required their presence)
repaired themselves to depart; and so gratifying King Druino for their Royal
entertainment (as also taking their gracious Conge of the Queen and the
Nobility of Cicilia) they at last (with their Princely Sons and Daughters) most
sumptuously imbarqued themselves: when a favorable Zephir gale blowing them
from the Cicilian coast, did most pleasantly reconduct them in safety to their
own Kingdoms: so as Thalmeno being with his fair Athelia arrived in the
Territories of Zanfara, Palma wi^h his sweet Mersilva in the Country of
Bohemia, and Maedor with his dear Florina in the confines of Numidia, they all
very contentedly there lived in the height of most amorous affection: till at
last death (by the Dart of Thanatos) as summoning the aged Parents to pay
nature her due, and being deprived from the vanity of this earthly Kingdom, to
be invested Saints in the Celestial Monarchy, Our young Princely Martialists of
love were in their stead most triumphantly Crowned, where living in delectable
tranquillity, they along time reigned to their hearts continual comfort, their
souls eternal contentation.

FINIS.
The Authors conclusitive Epistle to the (Gentlemen) Readers.
GEntlemen, having finished the essence of this my peevish Pamphlet, and given
(for a whiles) my Rustical Muse exact Conge (securely) to repose in the vastal
grave of silence; I began to excogitate with my capacity, whether I should
produce this my abortive Else before the Theater of the worlds contemplation,
or else (with the Midwifes of Egypt) make the joyful hour of his projection,
the (untimely) sepulcher of his fatal catastrophe, so that premeditating
seriously in so Tragi-comical a conflict, how to circumference my conceits
within the (desired) Lists of (amiable) unity; I at last in the Chaos of my
distempered cerebrosity, felt the citadel of my thoughts to be very dangerously
assaulted by two martial and mortal Rivals, the one was called Discretion, the
other Nature; which with authentical motives (before the Bar of my capacity)
artificially pleaded for a definitive sentence: first began Discretion, who
with the physnomy of a cheerful countenance, solicited, that in this golden age
of Poetry (wherein Invention has pierced the Air, and is long since
Charactered in the Sky) I should not presume to attribute wings to my Eagled
Muse, but rather nip her audacious Plumes, and so compel her to observe a lower
Climate, which might best correspond with the influence of (...) imbecility: An
ardent desir^ I had to allow of ^is exhortation; but Nature instantly (with
tears (...) her eyes, and her sorrowful hair dandling about (...) ruthful
cheeks) began with penetential sigh^ (...) plead for audience, and so
submissively prostra^ing her self to my feet, spoke as follows: Imbru^ (...)
thy ( Cynthian) hands in the innocent blood of (...) Pamphlet; but rather
cherish him with care, ^roject him to the world, and commit him to his ^ortune.
Which having pronounced, they both in (...) moment vanished, and so left me
desolate to the ^ontemplation of a Legion of restless incumbran^es. Being thus
tostica^ed in the surges of perplexi^y, and almost ingulph'd in the brinish
ocean of my ^ears, I began to ponder on some speedy invention which might free
me from accustomed aggravation: but continually finding my mirth diverted to
misery, and my exhileration to dolefulness, I again (from Cylla to Charybdis)
fell into the dedale of effeminate despair: but at last delicious consolation
(presenting me with the ( Ariadnes) thread of comfort) brought me out of the
labyrinth of perplexity, by falling to this (peremptory) resolution, to betake
my Elfe to the world, thereby to enjoy the Nectar of a future peaceable
tranquillity. So now Gentlemen, by virtue of the premises, I here send you my
Pamphlet, not apparelled in Arcadian suits, nor embellished in Faery ornaments,
but rather wrapped in a threadbare mantle of Simplicity, stich'd with Ignorance,
lined with Illiterature, and faced with Folly; wherein you shall find nothing
(by the (...) polished, but (...) Aphranius) imperfect, and to (...) every Line
wanting the dulcid (stillified) meth^^ of (these our times) ingenius (
Parnassus) curio^^^ty; nevertheless my poor unsavory Poem was ^^^^destinated
to be seen; and therefore, what the (...) impose for a period, I have not
presumed to contr^^dict with denial: Now Gentlemen, having perus^ (at your
leasures) the harsh (discordant) phra^^^ of my Pamphlet, and with unpartial
contemplati^on waded through the Briars of my imbecility* do stand as a
trembling offender before the benig^^ Bar of your favors, fearing lest
meritoriously (...) have incur^d your (choleric) indignation, in pr^^suming to
consecrate my peevish Labors to (...) stately Press; but pardon Gentlemen I
beseech (...) my audacious resolution, and at the sincere impl^^ration of my
Juvenility excuse my fondling (...) for not Charactering finer invention: mean
while ^f I understand you give my Flower of Fidelity (...) the least show of a
gracious acceptance, I will (...) Winter enforce my self to be conversant with
(...) Muses, and compel my quill to quaffe a (Nectar dram at the sacred font of
Castalia, to the (...) that the next ensuing Summer I may present yo^^
capacities with some fine conceited Pamphlet greater demerit.
