TO THE Candid and Cordial READER.
Reader,
A Reflection of four things (the Immutability of God; the Mutability of the
World; the Immortality of the Soul, and the Mortality of the Body) have been
alaruming unto this Essay, and alluring this Narrative of (pale) Death, the
Mistress of Mortals, and Emperess of the Universe: To these distinctly.

The Immutability of God. Man, mutable, but God is immutable. Mal. 3.6.
I am Jehovah, I change not, therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not consumed. The
most of Men, are mutable as the Moon, which (scarcely) abides two days in a
shape; but, God, is immutable. Under all the Changes that are made (by) Man;
yea, under all the Changes that are made (by) God, there are no Changes made
(in) God. He is the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, Jam. 1.17.
neither shadow of turning. He, is the Father of Lights, not of Light. God, is
compared to the Sun, but his Light is much perfecter. The Sun, is the Body of
Light; but, God, is the Father of Lights; of all Light Ethereal; Natural;
Spiritual; Celestial. The firmamental Sun, has its Turnings, and annual
Departures from us; it rise, and set; may be clouded, and eclipsed; but, God
(in some sense) rises not; sets not; Psalm. 145.18.
departs not. He is nigh unto all them that call upon him; unto all them that
call upon him in truth. There is not (only) no turning in God, but (also) not
so much as the Shadow of it, nor the least Imagination of a Shadow.

The Mutability of the World. World, is a Mass of Mutabilities; every Man;
every State; every Thing, is (as it were) a Planet, whose (spherical
Revolutions) are some of a (longer,) and some of a (shorter) continuance. That
Cardinal was an ( Atheist, Cardinal
as well a Papist) who preferred his part in Paris, to his part in Paradise.
The World, is a Fools Paradise, and its Motto is, This Something, is Nothing.
Hoc aliquid, nihil.
Will thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make
themselves wings, they fly away as an Eagle toward Heaven. Prove. 23.5 Luther.
The whole Turkish Empire (says one) is but a crum, that the Master of the
Family casts to a Dog. Who but the Alexanders, and Caesar's of the World, the
Nebuchadnezzars, and Nimrods of the World, the Pharoahs, (...). 1 These. 6.17.
and Pompeys of the World, that have been (ordinarily) the Lords of the World?
Riches, are uncertain. Trust not in uncertain Riches: In the Uncertainty of
Riches; Eccl. 5.10
so the Greek. Riches, are unsatisfying. He that loves silver shall not be
satisfied therewith, Pro. 11.4.
nor he that loves abundance with increase. Riches, are unprofiting. Riches,
Aut deserunt, aut deseruntur.
profit not in the day of wrath, but Righteousness delivers from death.
Riches, either leave us, or are left by us: They are not Food, but Fuel to
Desire: They are like Saltwater, the more we drink, Dulce Venenum. Bern.
the drier we are. Riches, are like the Apples of Sodom, more in show, than in
substance, and if touched, they crumble to sulphur. Riches (says one) are a
sweet poison. The World, and the Soul, must part, or Christ, and the Soul, will
not meet. The two Poles will (sooner) meet, than the Love of Christ, and the
Love of the World.

The Immortality of the Soul. In (this) World, Body was first, and then the
Soul, but in Heaven, the Soul is first, and then the Body. Origin.
If the World (says one) be the Book of God, then the Soul is the Image of
God. Plato.
Another (calls the Soul) the Glass of the Trinity. The Soul, is worth more
Worlds than (this) world has Souls in it. The Soul, is precious. The precious
Sons of Sion. Precious Sons, Lam. 4.2.
having precious Souls. And, as the Soul is precious, so the Redemption of the
Soul is precious. Psalm. 49.8.
Oh how highly did Christ prize it, when his Veins were breathed, and his
Vitals let out to redeem it! He became obedient to Death, even the Death of the
Cross. Phil. 2.8.
The Soul, is the Breath of God; the Beauty of Man; the Wonder of Angels; the
Envy of Devils. The Body is but the Cabinet, the Soul, is the Jewel, and this
is immortal. Eccl. 12.7.
Then shall the Dust (that is the Body) return to the Earth as it was, and the
Spirit (that is the Soul) unto God who gave it. Christ, and the converted
Thief, do go from Cross, to Crown; from Earth, to Heaven. To day shall thou be
with me in Paradise. Luke 23.43. Mark 8.37.
The loss of the Soul, is a considerable loss; a comprehensive loss; an
irreparable loss; What can be given in Exchange for the Soul? The Loss of the
Soul, is a kind of an infinite loss, for it is the loss of an infinite God,
Psalm. 145.9.
and this God a God of infinite Love. The Lord, is good to all, and his tender
mercies are over all his works. The Soul, is a Blossom of Eternity, and has a
Stamp of Immortality. Man, has a Soul, Matthew. 10.28.
which Death it self despaireth how to kill. Fear not them which kill the Body,
but are not able to kill the Soul.

The Mortality of the Body. Man, Mortal, and not a Match for Death. Zach. 1.5.
Our Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever? To be a
Man, is to be a Sinner, and to be a Sinner, is to be Mortal. As it is true,
what Man is he that lives, and sins not? It is as true, what Man is he that
sins, and dies not? What man is he that lives, and shall not see death?
shall he deliver his soul from the power of the grave? Man, is but a Wink of
Life: Psalm. 89.48. Oculus apertus, and oculus clausus.
The Heathens Emblem for Life, was an eye open, and for Death an eye shut; as
if there were no material difference between the living and the dying, Job 30.23
but the Twinkling of an Eye. Death, is the Circumference of the Universe, and
every man's Line meet in this Circumference. May not every Individual say, as He
did? I know that thou will bring me to Death, and to the House appointed for
all living. Ab Vtero, ad Sepulcrum.
From the Womb, to the Tomb, is the Motto of Infant-Man.

Reader, a Reflection upon these things (together with Gods Glory, thy Good,
and my Good) have encouraged unto this work, though I be the Benjamin; the
Least; the Last of my Fathers House. The work, is good, though the workman be
bad. The Subject, is Death; wonder not, for no sooner did we begin to live, but
we began to die, and shall continue dying, until we be swallowed up of Death.
We dwell in Clay-Houses, and our Bodies are Clay-Builts. The Schoolmen say,
Gratia infusa; effusa; diffusa.
that a good Thought, is Grace infused; a good Word, is Grace effused; a good
Work, is Grace diffused. I would not out-bid my self, neither would I know any
thing by my self, but my sin; but, second Thoughts, and Reviews, may better the
first, if not be better than the first. Many (with my self, though not so much
as my self) may see, Emendata, are Emendanda.
that what is mended, needs mending, and what is bettered, needs bettering;
yea, the best (sometimes) not good enough, to be called good. It could never be
said of any one) but that only One, Christ Jesus) that he did all things well.
Luke 23.4, 41.
I find no fault in this man; this man, has done all things well; this man
has done nothing amiss. I am not altogether insensible, that my Thoughts are
very short of Things, and that my Words, are far short of my Thoughts; I dare
not (therefore) be so peremptory concerning (this) Writing, as Pilate was
concerning (his) when he said, John 19.22.
What I have written, I have written. To give a penny, is below an Alexander;
he will give a City. To give Farthings and Fragments, is below the Majesty, and
Magnificence; the Grandeur, and Glory, of Princes, and Potentates: Araunah (as
a King) gave unto David. But, Reader, a penny, to Me, may be as much as a pound
to Another: Had I more, thou should have it. Goats hair, contributed to the
Erection of the Tabernacle; and the two Mites (which made a Farthing) received
a welcome into the Treasury. I have formerly sent (through importunity) two
little-little Tracts into the World; the one entitled ( Love to the Life) the
other ( A Paternal Gift:) The Author, and Actor of Grace (Christ Jesus the
Lord) by his Blessing, has made way for them into the Hands, and Hearts of
many; Glory to God in the Highest; which has (among other things) encouraged
the sending of this third Tract, as a Modicum, and Morsel, and Mercy, into the
world also, which is Man's last Scene, in the acting (whereof) he goes off the
Stage; not altogether despairing, but hoping, that this (also) through the same
Blessing, will meet with the like Entertainment, and Welcome, from those who
are acquainted (with) Christ, and acquitted (by) Him.

Reader, Earl of Marlborrough to Sir Hugh Pollard: Dying, and dead men's dying
words. p. 2.
it was the saying of an Earl (not long before his death) in a Letter of his to
a Knight, as follows; There is a certain thing going up and down the world,
called Religion, that (how dressed soever) loses not its Being; the great, and
good God, has not left it without a witness, more, or less, sooner, or later,
in every man's Bosom, to direct him in the pursuit of it. Bullinger.
The Truth of Religion (says one) is not to be judged by the Prosperity, or
Aversity, of the Professors of it Most (if not all the Learned men in the
world) have found, that the Notion of God, and Religion, is the first engraven
(in) and the last defaced (out) of the Minds of Men. Earl of Leicester.
A great person, left this Testimony behind him concerning Christian-Religion,
that the (sincere) profession of it, had in it Sweets, and Joys, that Courts
were Strangers unto. Basil.
The reason (says one) why Julian and all other Apostates) slight Religion,
is, because they do not understand it. Religion, is a persons Interest; Rolls
rebuilding of the City. p. 177.
a Nations Interest, how infatuated soever persons of worldly Grandeur, and
Glory, may be. This, is the Religion of the Papists; He, that shall assassinate
a King (in Zeal for their Religion) shall be canonized for a Saint. Ah
Religion! ever to be abhorred, and dreaded, by those that are not of it; as
being resolved to propagate it self every where, by (secret) Plots, and (open)
Violence; by Fire, and Sword; Per Fas and Nefas.
by Fraud, and Force. But, what have I to do with those blind, and bloody
Papists? with those children of Belial? with those children of Blood? Is this
Religion of God, which has no other way to promote and propagate it self but
by Fire, and Massacre? Is not the Religion of the Papist Rebellion? Is not the
Faith of the Papist Fancy? Is not the Mercy of the Papist Murder? Those (born
in England) are born (says one) in the Region of Religion; in the Land of
Goshen; Mr. Ness, Christians walk and work.
in the Valley of Vision: Now, Religion, is the Beauty, and Bulwark of a
Nation; It is to a Nation, as the Palladium was to Troy, which could not be
destroyed, so long as that was possessed: It is like Sampsons Lock, which
(while he retains) he retains his Strength, and is invincible. Men, differ not
so much from Beasts in Reason, as in Religion; Religion, is the highest Reason:
What can be more rational, than for the supreme Truth to be believed? the
highest Good to be embraced? the first Cause of all things to be owned, and
feared? and for those who were made (by) God, and live wholly (upon) him, to
improve all (for) him, and live wholly (to) him. It was the will of God, that
the Body of Moses should be interred in a secret place unknown to any man, to
prevent Superstition, Verse 9. of Judes ep.
and Idolatry, among the Jews: Now, as the Angel, and the Devil, strove for the
Body of Moses when he was dead: And, as seven Cities contended for Homer when
he was dead, though they cared not for him while he lived; thus, it fares with
Religion: Is it not (now) made a mere Echo? Do not men now speak of it, Vox
and praeterea nihil.
as of the Lacedemonian-Nightingale, a Voicc, and nothing more? Many contend,
and contest, for the Carcass, and Skeliton of it, few contend for the Life, and
Substance of it, which consists in Works, not in Words. We should rather be
Agents, than Disputants in Religion. The Vanity of the Head, is to argue much,
but the Sincerity of the Heart, is to act much Look but into the Divine Mirror,
and there read such multitudes of Truths, and so precious, as will take up a
man's time were he to live as many Years, as Methuselah did Days. It is not the
(subtle) Head, but the (sincere) Heart, that shall go to Heaven. That Man, is
under a prodigious Deception, and Delusion, who hopes to save any thing by his
Religion, but his Soul. He that sets up Religion, to get any thing by it more
than the Glory of God, and the Salvation of his Soul, will make a bad Bargain
of it in the Close. It is said of One, that he would have Religion along with
him, Andronicus.
so far as it lay in his way. Religion, is like cold weather, good for those
that are sound, bad for those that are unsound. Differences (also) about
Religion, should not make men careless to have any, but careful to have the
best. Julian.
That wicked Apostate, loved the worst Religion best, and was a professed
Friend to all Foes of Goodness. One (being convinced of an Heathenish Custom)
thought, Monica.
that Religion was not so poor, as to borrow Rites from Pagans. The Polanders
are said to be of all Religions: It is said, if a Man has lost his Religion,
he may seek it in Poland, Poland.
and he shall be sure to find it, or he may conclude that it is vanished out of
the world. May not the same be said of England, that was said of Poland?
Galeacius, to the Jesuit.
Let that Religion (said one to another) be cursed for ever, which shall wed
men to the World, and divorce men from God. Men, may differ in Religon, and yet
be of the same Religion; for every Difference in Religion, is not a differing
Religion. Have a care not (only) of the Profession of Truth, but (also) of the
Truth of Profession, lest (bare) Profession, ends not in (blessed) Possession.
It is not enough to act a part, or personate Religion, but a man must be a
religious person. He (spoke like Himself) who said, Clarks Mirror, p. 39.
that Religion did but effeminate men's minds, and unfit them for noble
Enterprises. But, why do I harp upon this string so long? I shall (only) add
this, and so close. Be of that Religion which the Protestant spoke of, who
(being asked by a Papist) where his Religion was before Luther, wittily
answered, in the Bible, where (thy) Religion never was.

Now Reader, Deuteronomy. 33.27.
that the Eternal God may be thy Refuge, and underneath thee everlasting Arms;
That Grace may be opened to thy Heart, and thy Heart unto Grace; that the
Blessing of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob may be upon thee; that the
Eternal Spirit may be with thee, that thou may distinguish between Light,
and Darkness; Life, and Death; Truth, and Error; Gold, and Dross; Silver, and
Tin; Flowers, and Weeds; Corn, and Chaff, is the Breathing of his Soul, who
(through Grace) more than desires (as for Himself, so for Thee) that thou
may not live to die, but die to live, and (dying) see the Death of Death, in
the Death of Jesus.

THE DEATH of CHRIST THE DEATH of DEATH.
Section. I. Whether there be a Natural, or Corporal Death, the Circumference
of the Universe.
THE word (Death) is capable of a various Acceptance in the Sacred Scripture.

There is an Universal Death. But of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil,
thou shall not eat, Genesis 2.17. Moriendo morieris. (...) Obnoxious eris morti,
tum Corporis, tum Animae. Joh. 14.6.
for in the day thou eatest thereof, dying thou shall die. So the Hebrew, and
Junius. Thou shall surely, and suddenly die; so Ainsworth. Thou shall die the
Death; so the Septuagint. Now this is (if I mistake not) both the first, and
the second Death; so Pool, in his Synopsis: It is temporal, and eternal Death;
together with the Causes, Signs, Antecedentes, Consequents, and Effects of it,
whatsoever; so that all Dangers, Difficulties, and Deaths are implied in this
Judgment threatened for Disobedience. Dying, thou shall die: That is, thou shall
Die (this) way (that) way (every) way, if Christ (who is (the) Way (the) Truth,
and (the) Life) interpose not between Thee and Death.

There is a Judicial Death, He that believes not, Joh. 3.18.
because he believes not in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. The Man,
is (under) the Judgment (before) the Judgment; the Man is already cast; the
Sentence is past, 12 Verse of Judes Epistle.
only there is a suspension of the Execution. We read (in Jude) of those who
are Twice dead; Dead spiritually for want of a principle of Life, and dead
judicially, under the Wrath of God. They were obnoxious to the (first) death by
original corruption, and obnoxious to the (second) death by actual
transgression. They were dead (say one) in respect of their natural Condition,
Jenkins in ^lo. pool in loc. Piscator.
and dead in respect of their final Declension. Twice dead, altogether dead.
They were obnoxious to the (first) Death by Nature, and to the (second) Death
by Sin. These men, were alive naturally, Quest.
though dead spiritually; how (then) were they twice dead?

They were judged twice dead, Sol.
either

Because, spiritual Death, is so great a Death, that it may well go for two
Deaths. One spiritual Death, is worse than a thousand natural Deaths. Or

They are said to be twice dead, Habit of Grace, Caryl in loc. p. 553.
and in regard of an external Act of Grace.

There is a spiritua! Death. Saint; to the Sinner.

To the Saint. Saint is dead.

To the Law. dead.

To the Ceremonial Law. If ye be dead with Christ from the Rudiments (or
Elements) of the world, Col. 2.20. A majore ad minus.
why as though living in the world, are ye subject to Ordinances? It is an
Argument from the greater to the less: Ye are freed from the Rites, which God
himself prescribed; freed from worldly Philosophy, or Judaical Ceremonies; Pool
in loc.
therefore freed from (new) Rites (by men invented) or from (old) Rites (by
humane Authority revoked) as one says upon the place.

To the Moral Law. I, through the Law, am dead to the Law, Gal. 2.19
that I might live to God. I have no Commerce with the Law: I (through the Law
of Faith) am dead to the Law of Works; I (through the Law of Christ) am dead to
the Law of Moses: That I might live to God; that I might live according to the
Precept of Christ; live according to the Gospel of Christ.

The Saint is dead to the world. Gal. 6.14. Contemptus est a me
save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified
unto me, and Romanus Fervor, and Furor.

I unto the world. The Apostle (here) speaks of the World, as Luther did of
Rome; I contemn the Heat and Fury of Rome. Thus did the Apostle; I contemn the
world, and the things thereof; the world, and the things therein.

The Saint, is dead to Sin. worst death; so to be dead (to) sin, is the best
Death. How shall we that are dead to sin, Romans 6.2.
live any longer therein? To be dead (to) sin, is to be freed from the
servitude of sin; to have the Force and Power of sin killed. It is a metaphor
taken from Death, because Death is the privation of Life, and of Actions.

To the Sinner. Now, the Sinner is dead (in) sin. Saint, or Soul (in) Christ is
dead (to) sin; so the Sinner, or Soul (out) of Christ is dead (in) sin. And you
who were dead in trespases and sins: Ephesians. 2.1.5.
Has he quickened; these words are not in the Greek. The sense (here) is
imperfect; but this is supplied in a verse following; Even when we were dead in
sins, has quickened us together with Christ: made alive together with Christ;
so the Greek.

What he had touched upon in the first verse, he repeats in the fifth verse,
and that to this end.

To show the Generality of the Condition. dead; dead (in) sin.

To show the Certainty of it. We may believe it, unbelieving about it.

To show the Corruptibility of our Nature. dead; yea dead (in) sin, yet it is
connatural unto us to be unwilling to take notice of it.

There is an eternal Death. Is the (first) Death, amazing? so amusing? what is
the (second) Death then? Is the (first) Death ( The King of terrors) to a
Christless Soul? who (then) is able to say what the (second) Death is to this
Soul? There is the second Death, as well as the first Death. He, or She, that
overcomes, shall not, (...) Rev. 2.11.
not (so the Greek) be hurt of the second Death. There is a twofold Death, both
of the Body, and of the Soul. The (first) Death of the Body, is the Separation
of the Soul; the (second) Death of the Body, is the Torment of Eternity. There
is (also) a twofold Death of the Soul; Separatio Animae.
The (first) Death of the Soul, is Sin; the (second) Death of the Soul, is a
casting out from the Face of God, Cruciatus aeterni.
and that for an Eternity. Hell (as some fancy) is not Mount Aetna; Peccatum.
nor yet Purgatory, according to the conceit of the blind, and bloody Papist.
Hell, must needs be a dismal place, Profectio a facie Dei, in aeternum.
a Dungeon of Darkness, for the Sunshine of Gods presence never comes there. To
the damned (says one) the Loss of Heaven is more grievous, than the Torment of
Hell. Heaven, and Hell, are the greatest Opposites, Estius. Matthew. 11.23.
or remotest Extremes. And thou Capernaum, that art lifted up to Heaven, shall
be thrown down to Hell. The (second) Death, is Hell, and the punishment
thereof, the punishment of Sense, and of Loss.

There is a corporal, natural Death. Moses, my servant, Josh. 1.2.
is dead. How (great) soever, and (good) soever, Moses was, he is dead now; he
is gone off the Stage now; he is gathered to his Fathers now; he is gone into
an Eternity now. Moses, is dead, and God preach his Funeral Sermon: Joh. 11.32.
Moses, my servant, is dead. Lord (said Mary) if thou had been here, my
Brother had not died. This is natural, or corporal Death, which is the
following Subject.

SECTION II. What this Natural, or Corporal Death is, which is the
Circumference of the Universe.
BUT what is Natural, Quest. Sol.
or Corporal Death?

I shall not pretend to a Definition (which relate to the Nature, and Essence)
but present a Description (which relate to the Properties, and Effects.)

Natural Death, Descriptio.
is the Deprivation of natural Life. Death, is no Essence, nor Substance, but
Privation. Death, is the Disunion, between the Soul, and the Body. A man (then)
dies, when the Body for a time (and but for a time) is separated from the Soul;
or, the Soul takes leave of the Body. Death, is but departed Death from lifened
Dust. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Psalm. 104.29. Mors, a morsu,
which our first Parents tasted. Isa. 2.22. Mors, a mora, which yet tarrieth for
us All. Genesis 35.18 Omne Ens, est Bounm, and omne Ronum est Ens.
thou take away their breath, they die, and return unto their dust. When our
Breath goes out, our Life goes out; when we cease breathing, we cease living;
our Breath going, our Life goes; our Life, is but a Breath; but a Blast. Man's
Breath is in his nostrils. God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.
Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for, wherein is he to be
accounted of? Unless Breath goes forth, we die, and Death, is nothing else but
a going forth of the Breath. Life, is a going forth of the Breath by
Respiration; and Death, is a going forth of the Breath by Expiration. It is
said of Rachel, And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died)
that she called his name Ben-oni; that is, The Son of my sorrow; but his Father
called him Benjamin; that is, The Son of the right hand. God, that made all
things, saw, that all things which he made, were very good. Every Being, is
good, and every Good, is a Being; therefore, Lord (says one) seeing thou have
not made Death, suffer not that which thou have not made, to reign over that
which thou have made. Death, is a Fall, August. Omnes eramus ille unus Hemo.
Romans 5.12. (...)
which came by a Fall; Adam, sinning, fell; he falling, all his posterity fell
(in) him, and (with) him. It was not Man, but Mankind, that fell. By one man,
sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men,
in whom (so the Greek) all have sinned. Nature (when she was young) caught a
fall (as Mephihosheth did) whereof she has halted ever since. Breath
(departing) is (dying) and departed (Breath) is (Death.) Death, is not a
Creature, but the Grave of Creatures. Jam. 1.15
Who ever was the Father of Death, Sin was the Mother of Death, if the Apostle
may be credited. Sin, when it is finished, brings forth death. The (first)
and the (second) Death, are the products of sin. Sin, Lex naturae; Tributurn
mortalium. Plato. Visibile Verbum.
is that unhappy Womb, that have been productive of the (first) and (second)
Death. Death (as one calls it) is the Law of Nature, and Tribute of Mortals. It
is the municipal Law of the Earth to die once; of Heaven, to live for ever; of
Hell, to die for ever. We may call Death, a Visible Word.

I am writing of (natural) Death; it is as natural to die, as to live; yet when
we say, a man dies naturally, we seem to speak improperly, for a Man dies not
as a Beast dies, through the Annihilation of Nature, but from the Appointment
of God. It is once appointed unto man to die, Heb. 9.27.
and after death the Judgment. The word (once) say some, is not to be referred
to die, as if there were some suspicion that man could die twice; but the word
(once) is referred to appoint; it was (once) appointed, and that (once) shall
stand. It is enough that God has (once) appointed Death; but after (this) the
Judgment. Some, understand this of a (particular) Judgment which God passes
upon the Soul immediately after death; but (if I mistake not) we may (with
once) interpret it of the (general) Judgment, Estius; Pool in loc.
which will be a (solemn) Promulgation, and (total) Execution, of the Sentence,
Once for All.

SECTION III. Whether Natural, or Corporal Death, be the Circumference of the
Universe.
DEath is the Circumference of the Universe, Death's Motto, is, Nulli cedo.
and every man's Line meet in this Circumference. To be a Man, is to be mortal,
for to be a Man, is to be a Sinner. To be unwilling to die is to be unwilling
to be a Man; for to be a Man, is to be mortal. Luther; Cedo nulli.
As one said in the matters of God, and Faith, I give place to none; so says
Death, I give place to none. As it is true what Man is he that lives and
sins not? Eccles. 7.20. Ps. 89.48. (...), Homo.
There is not a just man upon earth that does good, and sins not. It is as
true, what man is he that lives, and dies not? What man is he that lives,
and shall not see death? that is, shall not die: What Man? What Man or Woman!
The Greek, and the Latin words for (Man) comprehend both Sexes. What Man? so
the English, and Junius. What strong Man? so Ainsworth, and the Hebrew. Mi
Geber.
Mi Geber. Geber, a Man; so called from his power and strength: A strong man;
or a man in his strength: It is (properly) one, who is neither a Boy, nor an
old Man. What strong man (or man in his strength) is he that shall not see
death? that shall not die? Shall he deliver his soul (or Life) from the hand
(or power) of the grave? From this (long) Text, there is this (short)
meditation, That man is mortal. Every man, and woman, is mortal, and not a
match for Death. All men, and women (may) die; yea (must) die. What man is he
that lives, and shall not die? what man! that is, no man. Who shall lay any
thing to the charge of God's Elect? Romans 8.33, 34.
That is, none shall. Who is he that condemns? That is, not one. Thus, here;
what man? what strong man? That is, no man; no strong man: Not Caesar, nor
Pompey; though the one could not endure a Superior, nor the other an Equal:
Not Sampson, or Scaliger, though persons of strength; not Gustavus, or
Huniades, though persons of conduct, and courage: Not Alexander, or Ajax,
though persons of Terror: Not Gideon, or David, though persons of valor: Not
Peter, or Paul, though the one the Doctor of the Jews, and the other the Doctor
of the Gentiles. All the Apostles died; yea, all the, Apostles (save John who
had such intimacy with Jesus) died violent deaths, and laid down their Blood on
this side the Grave; concerning which, Luther was so troubled, that he did not.
Death is the way of all flesh; the way of all men; the way of all the world.
Death, is a Tribute due to Nature, and every man must pay this Debt, what Debts
soever he leave unpaid. Death is the way of all men. This way, Genesis 47.28, 31.
Genesis 35.29.
Jacob went: He bowed himself upon the Beds-head; that is, he died. This common
way, did Isaac go; He gave up the Ghost, died, and was gathered unto his
people; being old, and full of days. Though Isaac was old, and full of days,
yet he died. This common way, Abraham went, He gave up the Ghost, Genesis 25.8
and died, in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered
unto his people. Though Abraham lived to a good old age, yet he died. He died
in a good old age, an old man, and full: The Hebrew goes no farther, He died
full: Full of what? Our Translators (to fill up the sense) add (by way of
Explication) full of years. This way, Methuselah (also) went; Genesis 52.7.
His days, were nine hundred sixty and nine years, and he died. This man, was
long-lifted indeed; would not a man (living in his time) have thought that he
had been immortal? But, he was mortal: Though he lived to be very gray, yet he
died at last. If the Majesty of Heaven, call him upon the stage, this is the
last Act, wherewith the Commedy ends; Et mortuus est.
And he died. Methuselah, is his name, which is by Interpretation, He dies.
And He died, is the Epitaph for every Individual. Death, periods the days of a
long-lifed Methuselah; And He died. Though he had lived so long, yet he died at
last. Though he had lived so many days, yet there came a time when he had not
a day longer to live. Though, he had lived so long in the world, yet there came
a day, when his Time went into Eternity; And, He died.

All, Object.
have not died. All, have not been graved. All, have not had a Pillow of Dust
for their Head. All, have not passed under the (first) Death.

All, Solu.
have died, or been translated; All, shall die, or be changed. To these
distinctly.

All, lived, have died, or been translated. I read but of two men, who made a
leap over the Grave, and did not see Death; Now these two, were Enoch, and
Elijah.

Enoch. (taught, as the word signifies) walked with God, Genesis 5.24.
and was not, for God took him. Enoch, was so (little) like the world, that his
stay was little (in) the world. Enoch, was so like God himself, that God takes
Enoch, unto himself. He was not, for God took him. Not that there was an
Annihilation of him, but a Translation of him; he was personally translated,
Soul, and Body, were translated to Heaven. Enoch, walked with God, and he was
not; And not He, so the Hebrew. He was (says one) translated from the society
of men. Junius.
This is a difficult Scripture, but the Apostle gives a full, Heb. 11.5.
and unerring Comment upon it. By faith Enoch was translated, that he should
not see death, and he was not found, because God had translated him; for before
his translation, he had this testimony, that he pleased God. Here, is One, that
never went to the house of the Grave. As God, had (before) translated him out
of a State of Sin, into a State of Grace; so Enoch was such a proficient (in)
Grace, that God translated him from Grace, to Glory, without so much as looking
into the Grave. Genesis 4.17. Jude ep. v. 14.
There was an Enoch (in the Hebrew, Chanoch) who was the (third) from Adam; and
who was the (immediate) Son of cursed Cain; But, this Enoch, or (Chanoch) was
(according to Jude) the seventh from Adam. And Enoch also the seventh from
Adam. Enoch, was so the seventh from Adam, as that both Adam, and Himself, must
be computed to be Two of that Number. Enoch, was not so the seventh (from) as
to be the seventh (after) or the seventh that came of Adam. The like expression
there is in Matthew: Mat. 1.17.
All the generations from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations. Into
which, Abraham, and David, themselves, must be taken, to make them up fourteen.
Enoch (also) was not so the (seventh) person from Adam, as that there were no
more than seven persons begotten, from the time of Adam, to Enoch, for all
those six Patriarchs (mentioned before Enoch) are said to beget Sons and
Daughters; but, Jenkin in loc.
Enoch is called the seventh from Adam, because he was exactly (in that
particular direct Line) the seventh, from Adam, to Him. Ainsworth
This Enoch (after (says one) he had lived so many years upon the Earth, as
there be days in the Year of the Sun) was translated from Earth to Heaven,
next after Adams death, seven Patriarchs remaining Witnesses of his Translation.

Elijah. Elijah (a strong Lord, Elias, who (in prayer, Jam. 5.17, 18. 2 King.
2.11, 12.
prayed) so the Greek, that it might not rain, and it did not rain; that it
might rain, and it did rain. This Elijah had his Rapture, and his Rapture was a
Type of Christ's Ascension: He went up by a whirlwind into Heaven; Elisha,
seeing it, cried, my Father, my Father; the Chariot of Israel, and the horsemen
thereof.

All, that do live, shall die, or be changed. Behold, That is, 1 Cor. 15.51, 52.
we shall not all die. Now, that by sleep, he means Death, the whole Discourse
of that Chapter, makes evident. What shall become of us then? This, is answered
in the words following, but we shall be changed. There shall be a corporeal,
and numerical Resurrection, if Job may be credited: Though worms destroy his
body, Job 19.26. 27.
yet in the flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self; and mine eyes
shall behold, and not another, though my reins be consumed within me. Every man
shall have a Resurection out of his (own) Dust. The dead in Christ, 1 These.
4.16. 1 C^^ ^5 53, 54.
shall rise first. These shall be raised into a state of Incorruption. This
corruptible, must put on incorruption, and this mortal, must put on
immortality. Now, those (then) living (having Christ for their Life) shall not
die, but be changed, into the (same) state of Incorruption, Col. 3.4.
and Immortality of (those) that shall have a numerical Resurrection given
them, by the power of God, and the God of power.

SECT. IV. Why Natural, or Corporal Death, is the Circumference of the Universe.
THat Man is Mortal, and not a match for Death, has appeared; why Man is
mortal and not a match for Death, will appear by these following Reasons.
Reasons.


Man has sinned, man is mortal, and must die. Sin, is that wretched womb
wherein Death lay. Romans 6.23.
The wages of sin is death. All sorts, and kinds of Death; whether violent,
natural, spiritual, or eternal, they are the stipend of sin. Sin, is the most
mischievous thing in the world, for it begins in turning the Heart from God,
and ends in turning God from the Heart; Psalm. 9.17.
now, is not (this) man like to be turned into Hell? Sin, is that unhappy womb,
that have been productive of all the (penal) Judgments, that have been in the
world; the (first) and the (second) Death; Fire and Famine; Poverty and Prison;
Plague and Pestilence; the Rack, and the Stake; binding and banishing; bleeding
and burning, they are the products of sin. Oh my soul! Nil nisi peccata timeo.
Chrysostom. So Anselm.
all thy cares and crosses; all thy fears and frowns: all thy sorrows and
sufferings; all thy tears and troubles; all thy trials and travels, they are
the monstrous, and prodigious Births and Effects of sin. Wonder not that one
said, I fear nothing but sin. Sin is the Mother; Death, is the Daughter. Romans
5.12.
By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed
upon all men, in whom all have sinned. Sin, is like Pandora's box, which (being
opened) was full of all evils; filling the Earth with Diseases, and all other
Calamities. What is said of War, Bellum est malum complexum.
may be said of Sin, it is a complex, and complicated Evil. Sin, is Evil; only
Evil; all Evil; always Evil; altogether Evil. We cannot speak worse of Sin, than
it is, nor of Man (being a Sinner) than he is. As God, is (that) Good, in whom
is (all) Good, Bonum, in quo omnia sunt bona.
and (no) Evil; so, Sin, is (that) Evil, wherein is (all) Evil, and (no) Good.
Death, is the product of Sin. Let the great Doctor of the Gentiles speak, who
had a great command of Oratory: 1 Cor. 15.21. Vorstius.
By Man (Adam the first) came death: That is, by the Sin of Man, came the Death
of man; by the Sin of man, came the first, and the second death (upon) man. By
man came death. Not (only) Mortality (as one says) but (also) eternal Death.
When the Jews are under a (severe) stroke, they say, This is part of the
Golden-Calf. That is, this suffering, is (for) our sin, The Mother of Nero,
concerning him.
and (from) our sin. Is it not pity, that any man should say of his sin, as she
did of her Son? Let me die, so He may live. Do thou say, let my sin live,
though I die, and be damned? then I say, thou seem to me to be within a step
of Death; within a step of Damnation. Do thou say to thy sin, as God did to
Joshua? I will not fail Thee, Josh. 1.5.
nor forsake thee: Then, I say, thou art in danger of Hell fire, and it is
mercy (to) a wonder; yea, mercy (above) wonder, that thou art out of Hell. All
men that live, must die, and all that die, are bound for the grave, that is the
next stage. When sin came into the world (and that came in by cating) Death
came in with it. Well may we cry, Ah Sin! Sin! Sin! thou have dug all the
graves, and made all the funerals, that have been in the world. It was (once)
said of the goodly Buildings of Rome, that the sins of the Germans (meaning the
money, got by the Popes Factors, for sin-pardons, granted the Germans) have
built these. Thus, when we see those goodly Buildings (the bodies of men, cast
(unto) the ground; yea, cast (into) the ground, we may truly say, the sins of
men have unbuilt, have pulled down their Bodies.

Man, Reas. 2.
is formed out of the dust, therefore man is mortal, and must die. As our
Bodies dwell in houses of clay, Job 4.19.
the foundations whereof are laid in the dust; so our Bodies are but
Clay-builts, and they cannot stand long. We were reared (at first) our of the
dust, and we are making to our Center every moment. Bodies are but Clay-builts,
though some be painted, and decked, and beautified more than others, yet all
are dust, and that makes to its Center. Soul, as thy Original was, so shall thy
Conclusion be; as thy beginning was, so shall thy endi^ be. Though Man (now)
seem to be somewha^ better than dust, yet to dust, shall he return. Body
alive, are but living dust. Man, is dust (while) he lives; returns to the Dust
(when) he dies, and (...) turned into dust (after) Death. It was said to Adam
(and in him to all Mankind) not (only) as a curse, but (also) as a command;
Genesis 3.19.
In the sweat of thy face shall thou eat thy bread, until thou returnest to the
ground; that is, until thou die; for dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou
return. Phil. 3.21.
As thy Alpha was, so shall thy Omega be. Hence the Body of man, is called
vile. 1 Cor. 15.47.
Who shall change our vile body, and make it like his glorious body. The Body
of the first Adam^ was formed out of the Earth, and is said to be of the earth,
earthy. And, as in the (first) Body, so in the bodies of (all) men, Earth is
the (predominant) element; our bodies, are vile, the (chief) Ingredient o^
their mixture being the Earth, which (comparatively to those (higher) and
(nobler) elements) is but vile. Genesis 18.27.
Abraham writes himself, Dust and Ashes. Dust, is Earth made by the Heat of the
Sun; Ash^s, Earth made by the Heat of the Fire. They, Amos 6.4
who now lie upon beds of Ivory, must lie down in a bed of Earth, and rest
their Heads upon a pillow of Dust. Most sleep in the Dust (while) they live,
but all must sleep in the Dust (when) they die. He (only) who has laid up his
Heart in Heaven, Eccl. 12.7.
can (comfortably) think of laying down his Head in the Dust. Then shall the
Dust (the Body) return unto the earth as it was, and the Spirit (the Soul) unto
God who gave it. Man's Body, is Dust materially (while) he lives, and Dust
formally (when) he is dead.

God, has appointed Death, Reas. 3. Heb. 9.27. Ps. 31.15.
therefore Man is mortal, and must die. It Is (once) appointed for Man to die,
and it is enough that it is appointed once. As the Statute is past, that Man
must die, so how (long he shall live, and (when) he shall die. Isa. 57.15.
My times are in thy hand. He (who inhabits eternity) is also the Lord of Time.
Some, live, as if they were Masters of Time, and could appoint out their own
Term; Isa. 28.15.
as if they had made a Covenant with the Grave, and an Agreement with Death;
they speak, as if their Tongues and their Time, were their own. To morrow shall
be as this day, Isa. 56.12
and much more abundant. That rich Caitiff, looked upon his Time as his own:
Soul, take thine ease, Luke 12.19, 20.
thou have goods laid up for many years; but God said, Thou Fool, this night
shall thy soul be required of thee. The Psalmist, does not speak himself the
Master, but the Servant of Time. My times are in thy hand. That is, all my
Times; my times of Health, or Sickness; of Joy, or Sorrow: of Truth or Triumph;
of Light, or Darkness; of Life, or Death; all my times are in thy hand. It is
well, that our Times are in Gods hands; Man is not wise enough to use the Time
that God sets him, much less is he wise enough to set his (own) Time. God
appoints Death; all manner of Deaths; Jer. 15.2, 3.
four kinds of Deaths, says the Prophet. Death is Heavens Statute, and who can
reverse that? was not that to be reversed by man, Esth. 8.8.
that was sealed with the Kings Ring? Who (then) can reverse Death? the Law of
Nature? the Statute of Mortals? the Circumference of the Universe? Death is the
House appointed for all living. Job 30.23. Job 19.25.
I know that thou will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all
living. As I know that my Redeemer lives; so I know, assuredly know, that I
shall die, and go to the Grave of Silence. Death, bring us back to what we once
were, and show us what we are. It is true (as I have written) that some have
lived, and not died, and that some shall live, and not die; yet those few
Exceptions do not infirm, but rather confirm the Truth of the general Rule,
which is, That all must die, because none escape, but upon some (special)
Exception. Death, is called a Change: If a man die, Job. 14.14.
shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait until my
change come. Death, is natural, but we die by a Law; we die by Apointment; the
house appointed for all living. Some, say of Malefactors (who are put to death
for crimes against the Law) that, They are slain by the Law. We may say of
every man, He is slain by a Law; the house appointed for all living. Thou
turnest man to destruction, Psalm. 90.3.
that is, to Death; the destruction of all men as to their (corporeal)
constitutions, and (external) enjoyments: But what then? And say, Return ye
children of men. God, having turned man to Death, says presently, Return ye
children of men: That is, go back into what ye were; return to the Dust.

SECT. V. The Brevity of Life.
IF the (first) Death, Fui, and nihil amplius.
be the Mistress of Mortals, and the Empress of the Universe, reflect (then)
the Brevity of Life. I have been, and that is all, said Saladine the Great, who
was Conqueror of the East. The longest liver, has but a handful of Days,
and Life it self is but a Circle, always beginning where it ends. Dan. 7.9.
Hodie mihi cras Tibi.
With the Ancient (of) Days, there are (no) Days, and Time will be, when Time
shall no more be. The Child, born in the morning, is old enough to die before
night. To D^^, to Me, to Morrow, to Thee, is Deaths Motto, When Jacob (was
asked by Pharaoh) How old art thou? or (according to the Margent) How many are
the days of the years of thy life? Genesis 47.8, 9.
His answer, was, Few, and evil, have the days of the years of my life been,
etc. A great Physician say, that Art, is long; Life, is short. Ars longa, Vita
brevis. Hippocrares. Oculus apertus, and clausus. Job 14.1. Margent.
The Heathens Emblem for Life, was an Eye open, and for Death, an Eye shut; as
if there were no other difference between the living, and the dying, but the
Twinkling of an Eye. Man that is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of
trouble. Job scarce thinks Himself worth the naming, who does not speak of
himself in his (own) name; Man, that is born of a woman. But, what of this man?
he is of few days (short of days) and full of trouble. Few days, and many
troubles, make up the Character of Man. We use to say, short, and sweet; Multum
in parvo.
but, here, it is short, and sewre; yea, short, and bitter. As some speak (Much
in a Little) much matter, in a little Discourse: And, as some do (Much with a
Little) much Good, with a little Talent; so all suffer (Much in a Little) much
Trouble, in a little Time; many Sorrows, in a few Days. The days of man are
few, compared with the days that man lived before the Flood; then man lived to
six, seven, eight, nine hundred; almost a thousand years. They are few (also)
compared to the days of God. As the days of God cannot be counted, because
they are so many, so the days of Man can scarcely be counted, because they are
so few. Psa. 39.5.
Mine Age (says the Psalmist) is as nothing before Thee. All Time is as
Nothing, compared to Eternity; what a Nothing (then) is the Age of one Man unto
Eternity? Some things ( created and finite) are so great above others, that
they are nothing unto them: What is the Ant unto the Elephant? what is the
Shrimp to the Whale? what is the whole body of the Earth, to the body of the
Heavens? It is but a point, say Naturalists. As one part of the Earth, is but a
point to the whole, and the whole Earth, but a point to the Heavens; so one
part of Time, is but a moment to all Time, and all Time is but a moment to
Eternity; especially, to the Eternity of God. What is Finite unto Infinite? The
Brevity of man's life, will yet appear (beyond all modest contradiction) by the
expressions wherewith it is clothed; by the metaphors wherein it is emblemed,
and by the Things whereunto it is compared. For instance.

The Life of Man, Shuttle. Job. 7.6.
My days are swifter than a Weavers Shuttle. A Weavers Shuttle, is an
Instrument of a very swift, and sudden Motion; this passes the Loom, or Web,
with such speed, that it is grown to a Proverb, for all things quick and
transient.

The Life of Man, compared to an Handbreadth. Psalm. 39.5.
Thou have made my days as an Hand-breadth. That is not long, which is no
longer than the Breadth of an Hand; not long, in the largest Extent.

The Life of Man, compared to a Tale that is told. Psalm. 90.9.
We spend our days as a tale that is told. That is, suddenly, and swiftly. A
Discourse (from) the mouth especially (in) the mind, out-runs the Sun, as much
as the Sun out-runs the Snail. The Thoughts of a Man, will travel the world
over in a moment.

The Life of Man, compared to a Vapor. What is our Life? Jam. 4.14
it is even as a Vapor, which for a while appears, and then vanishes away.
Though all a man has, is short of Life, yet this Life of Man, soon evaporates,
and expires.

SECT. VI. The Certainty of Death.
OUR Bodies are but (living) Graves; no sooner did we begin to live, but we
began to die, and continue dying, until we be swallowed up of Death. As every
Man had his Genesis, his beginning, or coming into this world; so, every Man
shall have his Exodus, his ending, or going out of the world. 1 Chr. 29.28.
Oh soul! flatter not thy self, and thy soul, with an undiable state. David
(was a man after Gods own heart) and yet concerning him it is said, That he
died. Though he lived to a good old age, full of days, riches and honor, yet
he died, and Solomon his Son reigned in his stead. Anaxagoras, Scio me genuisse
mortalem.
Deaths seizure is without surrender, and from her sentence there is no Appeal,
When News arrived at one concerning the death of his (only) Son, he seemed not
to be over-concerned, but to reply without Regret, I know that he was begotten
mortal; I know the Son is mortal as well as the Father. Genesis 5.5, 8, 11, 14,
17, 20, 27, 31.
Those long-livers (recorded in the sacred Scripture, and transmitted to
posterity) died. They lived long, but they did not outlive Death. They lived
long in the world, but (at last) they left the world. They lived long, but a
day came, when they could not live a (day) longer. Death is the obscurest thing
in the world. The Grave is a gloomy place, and filled not (only) with natural,
but (also) with metaphorical Darkness.

SECT. VII. The Uncertainty of the Time of Death.
THough Death be certain, yet the Time of Death is uncertain. Death, is
certain, but the Day, or Hour of Death, is uncertain. Little did Julian think,
that Death had been at the Door, before he was wounded by an unknown hand,
Vicisti Galilaee vieisti. 1 Kings 22.27. 1 Samuel 15.32, 33.
and blasphemed; Thou have overcome, oh Galilaean! Thou have overcome. Little
did Ahab think, that the day of Death had been so near dawning, when he gave in
charge concerning Micaiah; Put this fellow in the Prison, and feed him with the
bread of Affliction, and with the water of Affliction, until I come in peace.
Little did Agag think of being hewed in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal, when
he said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. Pharaoh, stood upon even
ground with God, little thinking, Exodus 5.2. Exodus 14.27. Isa. 36.13.
that the Sea should be his Sepulcher, when he said, Who is the Lord that I
should obey his voice, to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I
let Israel go. Little did Sennacherib think that he stood upon the Brink of
Eternity, Isa. 37.38.
when these words were spoken by his servant, Hear ye the words of the great
King, the King of Assyria; when he seemed to stand upon higher ground than God.
Little (also) did Herod (the Mount of Pride, according to his name) think, Acts
12.21, 22.
that his Grave had been digging, when he so charmed his Auditory with his
Oratory, that they gave a shout, It is the voice of a God, and not of man. The
Manner, and Time of Death, is uncertain. Some (indeed) have predicted the
Manner of their Death; thus Ridley; that he should be burned, and not drowned:
Thus Jewel; he (long before his Sickness) predicted the Approach of it; And (in
his Sickness) predicted the precise day of his Death. But this is rare, very
rare.

What is prayable, Object. 1.
is attainable, but the knowledge of the length of life, is prayable.

To pray for a Physical, Sol.
or Literal knowledge of our End; that is, what Year, or Day, our Lives shall
end, Caryl, Vol. 1. p. 355.
is a sinful Curiosity, and presumptuous Intrusion into the (secret) Will of
God; but to pray for a metaphysical or spiritual knowledge of our End; that is,
how we may end any day of the year, or hour of the day, in an holy Duty, and
humble submission of our selves to the (revealed) Will of God, this is
warrantable.

But, Obj. 2. Isa. 38.5.
Hezekiah, had fifteen years added to his days, and therefore he knew how long
he should live, and when he should die.

This, Sol.
is such a Favor, as that we read not of the like, indulged any other of Gods
Servants, though very high in Favor with him. This (Great) and (Good) King, is
indulged, and assured, a Lease of his Life, fifteen years longer; well (now)
may this be ushered in with a Note of Attention, and serious Consideration,
Behold, I will add unto his days fifteen years: It is sealed (also) being an
unusual Grant, with an unusual Miracle; Behold, I will bring again the shadow
of the degrees, Isa. 38.8.
which is gone down in the Sun-dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward; so the Sun
returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down. As we are to reflect
the Brevity of Life, the children of men being (many times) of as short a
continuance as Jonahs Gourd, which came up in a night, and perished in a night:
And, as we are to reflect on the Certainty of Death, this being a Tribute due
to Nature, and a Debt to be paid, by every Individual; so, we are to reflect
the Uncertainty of the Time of Death, which comes to many persons as a Thief in
the night, suddenly, silently, unexpectedly.

SECT. VIII. The Impartiality of Death.
DEATH, is common to All. Pallida mors pulsar Regum turres, pauperumque
tabernas. Zach. 1.5.
Death (when she marches her Rounds) knocks at a Palace, as well as at a
Cottage; at the Princes Palace, as well as at the Peasants Cottage. The King,
as well as the Beggar, may die, must die: The persecuting, as well as the
persecuted, may die, must die. The man in his Robes, as well as the man in his
Rags, may die, must die. Your Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do
they live for ever? The Hebrew Proverb is, That in Golgotha are Skulls of all
sizes, as well as of all sexes. Death, knows no difference, no distance. Death,
is like the Sword of Alexander the Great, (...), Heb. 11.13.
that knew not how to make a Difference. The Apostle (in the Book of Martyrs
epitomized) speaking of those Worthies (of whom the world was not worthy)
says, These all died in Faith; or (according to the Greek) according to Faith:
All these died naturally, though they died believingly. There is not a man in
the Charter of mankind, but he is obnoxious to the (common) and (equal) Law of
Death. There are no Sons of Zerviah too hard for Death; though a Sampson, this
great Leviathan Death, account him but a straw. One (being asked by another)
where he had been, answered, Diogenes, to Alexander the Great. Job 3.19.
I have been comparing the Skulls of Princes, with the Skulls of Peasants, the
Skulls of the mightiest, with the Skulls of the meanest; the Skulls of the
richest, with the Skulls of the poorest; the Skulls of the highest, with the
Skulls of the lowest, and I find no difference. The small, and the great are
there, and the Servant is free from his Master. The small, cannot escape the
Hands, or slip through the Fingers of Death, because they are little; the
great, cannot rescue themselves from the power, or break out of the hands of
Death, because they are big. Death, is impartial; from the Threshold to the
Throne.

SECT. IX. Directions concerning Death, the Tribute of Nature, and Law of
Mortals.
This Section, has a double Aspect, and looks to a Soul (out) of Christ, and
to a Soul (in) Christ.

Chap. 1. To the Soul (out) of Christ.
ARt (out) of Christ? day of Death. Directions
There is a wicked Proverb, I thought no more of it than I did of my dying day.
As if a man should not concern himself with the Thoughts of Death. What became
of that French King (when) he died, Lewis the 11th.
that would not think of Death (while) he lived? He prohibited (upon pain of
Death) to speak of Death in the Court. There is Deaths day, Non putaram.
and this is not to be put far away. This, is the Fools motto, I never thought
of it. The Master, say to the Servant, Is this done? Is that done? The Servant,
say to the Master, I never thought of it. Mark 16.16. Luke 13.3.
Oh (say Christ to the Soul) why did thou not believe, and repent? for He, or
She, that believes not, shall be damned; and except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish: Oh (say the Soul to Christ) I never thought of it! Oh, say
Christ, why did not thou love me? 1 Cor. 16.22.
for, If any man love me not, let him be Anathema Maran-atha; a curse to the
coming of the Lord, to pass the definitive Sentence: Oh, say the Soul, I never
thought of it! Oh, say Christ, why did thou not Ark in me, and Anchor upon
me, Joh. 14.6.
when I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life? Oh, say the Soul, I never thought
of it! Oh, say Christ, why did thou not get Oil in thy Vessel against a dying
hour; and a wedding garment against a judging hour? Oh, say the Soul, I never
thought of it! Oh Soul! if thou hastary love to thy self, love to thy Soul,
take heed that ^^ou do not lay under that black Brand (as to Death) that they
did as to Judgment) Y^, Amos 6.3
that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near.
Oh Soul! take heed thou speak not of Death, as one did of Hell, Demonax.
who being asked what Hell was, profanely said, stay until I come there, and I
will send thee word from thence. Hell, is not a place to be sported with. There
are many, that have not (only) a name to live, but (also) the nature of life,
that sometimes tremble at the Thoughts of shooting this Gulf. That saying, Isa.
56.12.
had too great a Tincture of Atheism, To morrow shall be as this day, and much
more abundantly.

Art out of Christ? Direct. 2.
Take heed (also) of taking Gods work, out of Gods hand. God, who gives life,
may call for it when he pleases, but man must not. Genesis 22.2.
God imposed upon Abraham an Oblation of Isaac; it had been Murder for the
Father to have killed the Son, had not God imposed it. God, is the Being of
Beings, and does all things well. Some Romish Parasites have flattered the Pope
into this divine privilege, which is peculiar (to) God, and the prerogative
(of) God. God, is so high, that he cannot look above himself, but looks below
himself, and has none to whom he is to give an Account of his Actions. Behold,
he takes away, Job 9.12.
who shall turn him away? who may say unto him, what do thou? yet the blind,
and the bloody Papists, have slattered the Pope into this divine privilege; no
man must question him, do what he will; if he carry thousands to Hell with him,
no man must say unto him, what do thou? I kill, and I make alive, I wound,
and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand, is a Dialect
becoming a God, but unbecoming a man. Gods work, is not to be taken out of Gods
hand. Might not the consent of Paul, to the Death of Stephen, lay near Paul's
heart, so long as he lived? Act. 22.20.
When the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by
consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. Oh Soul!
take heed of breathing their Veins, and letting out their Vitals, unto whom
Death is stingless. Take heed of having a hand in (their) Death, who (through
grace) see the Death of Death, in the Death of Christ. If those (who are
actually Christ's) die a natural Death, God takes notice of it: Moses my servant
is dead: Josh. 1.2. Psalm. 116.15.
But, if they die a violent Death, God takes especial notice of it. Precious in
the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his Saints. If a Christian (of Christ's
making) goes bleeding to Heaven, or burning to Heaven; if he lays down his
Blood on this side the Grave, this goes near the heart of God.

Art out of Christ? Direct. 3.
tremble (then) for in a moment thou may die, and be damned too. They spend
their time in mirth, Job 21.13. Anxius vixi, dubious morior; Oh ens entium
miserere mihi! Sed, etc. Arist. Job 18.14. Caryl, in loc.
and in a momeut go down to the grave. Death (by the Philosopher) is called of
all formidable things the most terrible. These were some of the last words of
that great Philosopher; I have lived anxiously, I die doubtfully; Oh Being of
Beings have mercy upon me! but, now, it is too late for me to call for mercy.
Death, is called by Bildad, the King of Terrors. This, is a very strange Title.
We have read of many Titles, which have been given the Kings of the Earth, as
most Serene, most Christian, most Sacred, etc. but (if at all) rarely of such a
Title as this, King of Terrors. For a man to be brought to the King of Terrors,
is for a man to be brought to death, or to his last end. The Philosopher (in
this sense) called Death the King of Terrors, when he called it the most
terrible of terrible things. Death, is terrible upon a threefold consideration;
Antecedents, Nature, Consequents.

Death, terrible, if we consider the Antecedents of it. 2 King. 4.18, 19, 20.
The Forerunners, or Harbingers of Death, are Pains, Diseases, Sicknesses, and
these are terrible. The Shunamites Son was taken sick when he was with the
Reapers, crying to his Father, My Head, my Head; being carried home, he sat on
his Mothers knees until noon, and then died.

Death, terrible, if we consider the Nature of it. Death, Mors Sceptra
Ligonibus aequa.
is a Disunion. All Disunions are troublesome, but some are terrible. Death
(according to the Poet) is the greatest Leveller in the world: Death levels
Scepters, and Plow-shares; it makes all alike. The Disunion that Death makes
between Husband and Wife, is terrible; but Death makes a Disunion between them
that are nearer than Husband and Wife, even between Soul and Body: Eccl. 12.7
Husband and Wife, are one flesh, but Soul and Body, are one person. Then shall
the Dust (the Body) return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit (the Soul)
unto God.

Death, is terrible, reflect the consequents of it. I have said to corruption,
thou art my Father, Job 17.14. Nativitas mala; Vita pejor; mors pessima.
and to the Worm, thou art my Mother, and my Sister. Now, soul, art out of
Christ? what is thy Death then like to be? It may be said of a person living,
and dying out of Christ, that his Birth is bad; his Life is worse; his Death is
worst of all. Some, are so sick, that they cannot live, and yet so sinful, that
they cannot die; their Cry is, Oh Lord, we cannot die! Oh Lord, we must not
die! O Lord, we dare not die! Oh Lord, we will not die! Rev. 9.6.
We read of some that shall seek death, but shall not find it, and shall desire
to die, and death shall flee from them. Others there are that Death seek, but
they would not be found; and that Death desire to have, but they flee from it.
A great person, hearing the Verdict which the Physicians brought in against him
that he must die, cried out, Let me live, though it be the Life of a Toad under
a Threshold. Art out of Christ? tremble (then) and realize a state of Death. Do
not (only) read of Death, but (also) realize Death. Do not look upon Death as a
Physical Notion, and a Mathematical Conclusion; be much in the reflection of
this Text and Truth; Luke 16.22, 23.
It came to pass that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into
Abraham's bosom; the Rich man also died, and was buried, and in Hell he lifted
up his eyes, being in torment. Here is Death and Damnation too. Thou may
die, and be damned too.

Art out of Christ? go (then) to Christ, Direct. 4.
in whose Death, is the Death of Death. To be Christless, is to be Godless, to
be Graceless, to be Gloryless; go (then) to Christ. Art in a state of Sin? go
(then) to Christ for Grace. Art in a state of Darkness? go (then) to Christ for
Light. Art in a state of Death? go (then) to Christ for Life. Art in a state of
Damnation? go (then) to Christ for Salvation. Isa. 53.3.
Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your souls shall live. Paul, was
a great Orator; a great part of his Oratory was to persuade men to come to
Christ, and be saved. He that wins souls is wise. Art Christless, and
Godless; Graceless, and Spiritless? May not I say to thee with the Alteration
of a word, Acts 13.36.
as was said to the stock of Abraham? To thee is the word of this salvation
sent.

But there is a Lion in the way; an Adder in the path.

But what is this coming to Christ? Quest. 1.
this going to Christ?

A coming, Sol. Joh. 6.40.
or going (to) Christ, is a believing (in) Christ. As Faith is the Souls Eye,
He that sees the Son, and believes on him, has eternal life: And, as Faith
is the Souls mouth; Joh. 6.54.
Whosoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life: And, as Faith
is the Souls Ear; Joh. 5.24.
He that hears my Word, and believes on him that sent me: And, as Faith is
the Souls Hand; Joh. 1.12.
To as many as received him, to them gave he privilege to become the Sons of
God, even to them that believe on his Name: So, Faith is the Souls Foot; Joh.
6.35.
He that comes to me, shall never hunger, and he that believes on me, shall
never thirst.

But, Quest. 2.
is there an indispensible Necessity of going to Christ for Salvation? Can
Salvation be had no where else? Is he not only (a) Savior, but also (the)
Savior?

That Christ is (a) Savior, Sol. Luke 2.11
is evident. Unto you is born this day in the City of David (a) Savior, which
is Christ the Lord. That Christ also is (the) Savior, is as evident. Now we
believe, not because of thy words, Joh. 4.42.
for we have heard him our selves, and know that this is indeed (the) Christ
(the) Savior of the world. I remember the time when if I could have gone to
Heaven by my Education, Civility, Forms of Prayer of mine own making; or by my
Fathers Copy, I would not have made use of Christ; but (at last) I found that
there was Salvation in no other; Act. 4.12. Isa. 51.12.
and ( sailing by the gates of Hell in my apprehension) I also found that no
Voice but the Voice of Christ, would still the Voice of Desperation. There is
no Paradise without this Tree; no Light without this Sun; no God, no Glory, no
Heaven, no Happiness, without this Christ, in this world.

But am I called to go to this Savior for Salvation? Quest. 3.


Called thou art, therefore go. Look unto me, Sol. Isa. 45.22
and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none
else. Here is not only looking, but looking for Salvation. and Salvation upon
looking. Look unto me, and be ye saved.

But if going unto Christ be imposed, Quest. 4.
shall I be welcome if I go unto him for Salvation?

Come, and welcome. Sol. Joh. 6.37. (...)
All that the Father gives me, shall come unto me, and he that comes unto me,
I will in no wise cast out. All that the Father gives me, shall come unto me;
All that are chosen (in) me, shall be called (by) me; All that were given
(unto) me, shall believe (in) me; All that were mine (before time) by eternal
Donation, shall be mine (under time) by effectual Vocation: Is here all? No;
And he that comes unto me; that is, He, or She that believes in me, I will in
no wise cast out: or (according to the Greek) wherein there are two Negatives,
I will not, not cast out of doors. Soul! Christ will not shut the doors upon
thee when thou come, nor cast thee out of doors when thou art come. Oh
infinite mercy!

Oh but I am a lost Soul, and in a lost state! Now, Quest. 5.
may a lost Soul in a lost state, go unto this Christ for Salvation?

A lost Soul, in a lost state, Sol. Luke 19.10.
may go to Christ for Salvation. The Son of Man is come to seek, and to save,
that which was lost. Christ came that he might seek; and sought that he might
save that which was lost.

What, go to Christ! Quest. 6.
Is not an impossibility imposed upon me? Can there be going without drawing?

He that commands going, Sol. Joh. 6.44.
concerns himself with Soldrawing. No man comes unto me, except the Father
which has sent me draw him.

But, if going (unto) Christ, be believing (in) Christ, Quest. 7. (...)
can a man (without) Christ, believe (in) Christ? Faith, is (the) work; the
work of works.

It is true, Faith, is (the) work of works. Sol.
When they called upon Spira to believe, Hic labor; Hoc opus.
he told them, it was as possible to drink up the Sea at a draught: You call
upon me (said he) to believe, I tell you, I cannot; oh now I cannot! It is (as)
possible, yea (more) possible, to keep the Moral Law, than to believe; for it
is natural to work for life, but supernatural to believe for life. Faith, is an
outlandish Plant, and of a divine Extract; it is not a slip growing in our
Gardens, but a heaven-born Grace. Faith, Ephesians. 2.8.
is not a Native, but a Donative; it is the Gift of God; it is the Work of God.
Now, though there cannot be a believing in Christ (without) Christ, Col. 2.12.
yet there may be a believing in Christ (through) Christ. Phil. 4.13. Heb. 12.2.
I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. Christ, is the
disposer, and dispenser of all Grace; he that calls thee to go, can cause thee
to go; that calls thee to believe, can cause thee to believe.

What, Quest. 8.
go to Christ for Salvation! what manner of Savior (then) is Christ?

My Line will not sound this Depth; Sol.
what is a Muscle-shell to empty an Ocean? Is it not much more easy to say
what Christ is not, than to say, what Christ is? But, take a Taste.

Christ is a merciful Savior. Mercy, is the Element of Christ; Duty, should be
the Element of a Christian. Christ is a merciful and faithful High Priest in
things pertaining to God, Heb. 2.17.
to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. Christ delights rather to
write in Honey, than in Gall, and to draw lines of Love than of Wrath: His Grace
is a larger Territory than man's Sin; and his Mercy, than man's Iniquity. The Law
entered that the offense might abound, Romans 5.20
but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound. Man, is not so unworthy,
as Christ is worthy; not so sinful, as he is merciful.

Christ is a meek Savior. passion running in his Veins. Number. 20.10. Psalm.
116.11. Job 3.3.
Meek Moses, had his passion: Hear now ye rebels; must we fetch you water out
of this Rock? David, had his passion: I said in my haste, all men are liars.
Just Job, had his pettish humor: He wished the day to perish wherein he was
born; though his passion was buried under his patience, and his infirmity under
his Grace. Jam. 5.11
Ye have heard of the patience of Job. Jonah (a Dove, as the word fignifieth,
and Doves (they say) are Gallless) was not without his passion: Jon. 4.9.
Jonah (says God) do thou well to be angry? And he said, I do well to be
angry, even unto death. As if he had said, I am angry, and I do well to be
angry, and I do well to be ever angry. Should Man (thus) speak to God? Though
Blood ran in Christ's Veins, yet passion did not run there. Learn of me, for I
am meek, Mat. 11.29
and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls. Learn of me; what
to do? Aug.
Not (says one) to create the World; not to walk on the Water; not to raise
the dead: Learn of me, there is the precept; for I am meek, and lowly in heart;
there is the president: The one requires our Obedience, Praeludium Coeli.
the other our Conformity: And ye shall find rest for your souls; there is the
promise. Ye shall have repose of mind, and peace of conscience, which is an
Anticipation of Glory: Heaven here.

Christ is a free Savior. Christ cannot be valued to his worth, yet he may be
had without money. What is freer than Gift? Christ, is a Gift. Joh. 4.10.
He is the Fathers Gift, and the Father in giving Him, gave like Himself. If
thou knew the gift of God. He is (also) his own Gift, Tit. 2.14.
and in giving Himself, he gave like Himself. Who gave himself for us. He gave
his Soul, his Body, his Life, which show the willingness of his Death. Though
Christ be a pearl, yet he may be had without a penny. Though Christ be the
pearl of great price; of greatest price; able to enrich a Beggar, that is worth
nothing; yea a Bankrupt, that is worse than nothing, yet he may be had without
money, and without price.

Christ, is a desirable Savior. Desire, motion of the Soul, after any
apparent, or promised Good. The desires of man are vast as his thoughts;
Bloyse, Modern Policies.
boundless as the Ocean, says one. There is a threefold Desire; of Nature; of
Grace; of Glory.

Of Nature. This will be content with a little.

Of Grace. This will be content with less.

Of Glory. This is insatiable.

It is much the Moad, to be in the Optative Mood. The most of men are for
wishings, and wouldings. He, that is nothing but Desires, shall have nothing
that he desires; but he that adds good Endeavors unto his good Desires, can
desire nothing that is good (if for his good) but he may have it. It is a Maxim
in Philosophy, All things desire good. Christ, is the Desire of Nations. Hag.
2.7.
I will shake all Nations, and the Desire of all Nations shall come. The desire
of the Righteous (as Righteous) is only good, Bonum, in quo omnia sunt bona.
and always good; for, as they desire Christ (above) all, so they desire Christ
(in) all, in whom is all good, and nothing but good. Ask a convinced Soul; a
Soul convinced of the exceeding sinfulness of sin; and ask a deserted Soul; a
Soul tossed with tempest, and not comforted, what they desire above all things
in the world, and they will tell you a Christ above all; a Christ in all; a
Christ under all; a Christ after all. Psa. 73.25 Genesis 30.1.
Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire
besides thee. A Child, or I die, said the woman; a Christ, or I die, say the
Soul, and am damned too.

Christ is a delectable Savior. Hypocrite delights not in God, nor the things
of God. It is an Axiom in Nature, that things are so much delightful, as they
are seasonable: This is confirmed by more than (humane) Authority. Marg. Prove.
25.11.
A word fitly spoken (spoken upon his wheels) is like Apples of gold in
pictures of silver. Jonathan delighted much in David. A Christian (of Christ's
making) delights much in Christ, the Son of David; the Lord of David. To
delight in Christ is a Christians Duty. Psalm. 37.4.
Delight thy self also in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine
heart. To delight in Christ, is a Christians Mercy. Psalm. 94.19.
In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul. If we
delight notin Christ only, we delight not in Christ at all. As it is true, it
is the spirit of sinfulness to delight in sin; it is as true, it is the spirit
of godliness to delight in God. As Christ is the Object of the Fathers delight:
Behold my servant whom I uphold, Isa. 42.1.
mine elect, in whom my soul delights; so, Christ is the Object of their
delight who are the Fathers. Cant. 2.3.
As the Apple Tree among the trees of the wood; so is my Beloved among the
Sons; I delighted and sat down under his shadow, and his fruit was sweet unto
my taste, or palate. What was said of Titus Vespatian to be the delight of
Mankind, is infinitely more true of Christ; he is a delectable Savior, and the
Object of their delight, who are actually his.

Christ is a faithful Savior. faithful witness. Rev. 1.5.
One man will be faithful to another, so long as the Sun of Peace, and Plenty;
the Sun of Profit and Prosperity, shines upon him; but when the cold and
nipping Frosts of Affliction and Adversity come; of Exigency and Indigency
come, then look to thy self. But it is not thus with Christ, for he is most
near, when the Christian has most need. Socrates. Plato.
Oh my Friends (says one) I have not a Friend. A Friend (says another) is a
mutable creature. Summer-Friends are not worth the owning; but Winter-Friends
are worth their weight in gold. Husband and Wife are one flesh; Soul and Body
are one person; but Friend and Friend are (as it were) one Soul. 1 Samuel 18.1.
Prove. 20.6
The soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him
as his own soul. No flatterer can be a true Friend. A faithful friend who can
find? was the complaint of Isreal's Sage. He was (never) a Friend, that is not
(ever) a Friend. A friend loves at all times, Prove. 17:17.
and a Brother is born for Adversity. Such a Friend, and such a Brother, Christ
is; if (once) a Friend (ever) a Friend. This was the Motto of Valentinian; An
old Friend, is the best Friend. Amicus veterimus optimus. Prove. 18.24. Matthew.
8.24, 25, 26.
Such a Friend Christ is; he was (thy) Friend, when thou wast (his) Foe. If
Soloman may be credited, There is a Friend that sticks closer than a Brother.
Such a Friend Christ is. Christ, was in the Ship, when the winds did rise, and
the waves did roar; charming the winds which were prodigious, and calming the
waves which were impetuous. That Bottom is not like to sink, where Christ is.
Dan. 3.24, 25.
When the three Children were in the fiery Furnace, Christ gave a meeting, and
made up that blessed Mess. Christ, and the Christian, in the Ship together; in
the Shop together; Christ, and the Christian, in the Field together, in the
Fire together. Oh immence mercy!

Christ is a fruitful Savior. Cedar tree, has fruit on it at all times of the
year. Seneca.
A Heathen could say, I had rather be dead, than live dead. Christians, are to
be fruitful, and (by their bringing forth much fruit) God is glorified. Joh.
15.8.
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be my
Disciples. There is no plant in Gods Vineyard, but he will have glory (from) it
by its bearing, or glory (upon) it by its burning. Psalm. 1.3.
The tree planted by the Rivers of waters, brings forth fruit in season. I
have read of an Isle in the Carthaginian Sea, situated between Syria and
Cilicia, so fruitful, that it was called the happy Isle. Certainly, that Soul
is the happy Soul, which is fruitful; for, if the fruit be unto holiness, Romans
6.22
the end is everlasting life. To be fruitless, is to be useless; and to be
useless, is (in a sense) to be essenceless. We are as if we had no being, while
we reach not, at least while we reach not after the Ends of our Being. Job 6.21.
Job's Rhetoric goes a degree farther, and denies that he has been, for he is
as if he had never been, a mere nothing. For now ye are nothing. Hos. 14.8.
Psalm. 87.7.
The Christians fruit is from Christ. From me is thy fruit found. A Christians
growing, depend upon Christ's watering. All my springs are in Thee. A Christians
running, depend upon Christ's drawing. Cant. 1.4.
Draw me, and we will run after Thee. A Christians bearing, depend upon Christ's
blessing. Joh. 15.4.
As the branch cannot bear fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine, no
more can ye, except ye abide in me.

Christ is an incomparable Savior. Christ, is a Savior without compare; Aut
Caesar aut Nihil.
yea, a Savior without a Competitor. Caesar would not have a Superior, nor
Pompey an Equal. Christ has no Competitor, and will endure no Corrival.
Christ, will be All, or nothing at all. Isa. 40.18.
To whom will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? To whom
will ye compare Christ? He is a Beauty without a spot. Cant. 5.10
He is white and red, the Armor-bearer among ten thousand. White and red, as
they are the best Temperature of Man, so they are the (natural) and the
(native) Badges of Beauty. Isa. 49.6. Hos. 13.4.
I will give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou may be my salvation
to the ends of the Earth. Christ, has no Competitor in Salvation. There is no
Savior besides me.

Christ, is an invincible Savior. weak! weak as water! But, Soul, 1 Samuel
15.29. Margent.
Christ is strong; strength it self. The strength of Israel will not lie, nor
repent. The strength of Israel; the Eternity, or Victory of Israel. Oh (say the
Soul) I am not a match for those Temptations without, nor for these Corruptions
within! But, Soul, Christ is a match for both. Thou art Peter, Mat. 16.18.
and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not
prevail against it.

Thou art Peter; thou art but a Fisherman; Super hanc Petram, not super hunc
Petrum. 1 Cor. 10.4.
at best but a Fisher of Men: Not upon this Peter, but upon this Rock: It is
not called a Rock of Peter, but he is called Peter of a Rock; as we call
Christians from Christ. The Church is not built upon Peter, but upon Christ,
the Rock of Ages. They all drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and
that Rock was Christ. Upon this Rock will I build my Church, 1 Cor. 1.24.
and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it: All the Power, and Policy
of Hell, shall not prevail against it. Christ, is not (only) the Power of God,
but (also) the God of Power. All Power in Heaven and Earth is devolved upon
him. But, take a Taste of the Power of Christ.

Christ has engaged the world, and overcome. Jo. 16.33.


Christ has engaged the Heart, and overcome. Acts 16.14.
that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul. Paul was the
Preacher, but Christ was the Opener; Paul, preached to the Ear, but Christ
opened the Heart.

Christ has engaged Hell, and overcome. Rev. 1.18.
and behold I live for evermore, and have the Keys of Hell, and of Death. The
Keys are an Emblem of Power; a metaphor either taken from Stewards, who have
the Keys of the House, to let in, or keep out whom they please; or from
Conquerours, who (having entered a City) have the Keys delivered up to them in
token of Conquest.

Christ has engaged Heaven, overcome. Christ, has cancelled the Bond; has
crossed the Book; has discharged the Debt; has given a plenary and perfect
Satisfaction to Divine Justice, by his active and passive Obedience. Christ,
was Man, that he might suffer, and God, that he might satisfy; God being
offended with Man, He, who was God and Man, 1 These. 1.10.
satisfied God for Man. And to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom he raised
from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come. Now, did
Alexander the Great say (when his Army was low) for how many do ye reckon Me?
May not Christ then say (when Zion is reduced unto an astonishing Ebb) for how
many do you reckon Me? Christ is so Many, that he may well stand for All. No
Arithmetic upon Earth will reach Christ; he is a match for the Universe; he is
invincible.

Christ is a full Savior. Christ is a Fountain, and that is full; (...), Col.
2.9.
always full. In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead personally;
really; substantially. Though the stream should be cut off, yet the Fountain is
full; though the Chanel should be empty, yet the Ocean is full. There is (in)
Christ, for those that (are) Christ's, Joh. 1.14. Non Specie, sed Gradu.
a fullness of Grace. Christ is full of Grace and Truth. Grace, is such a pearl,
that the Universe is not able to weigh against, and yet Christ is full of
Grace. Grace differs nothing from Glory but in name, and in degree; it is the
same state in another stature. Grace, is Glory militant, and Glory is Grace
triumphant. That there is a fullness of Grace in Christ, is evident, and that
this fullness of grace in Christ is for those who (are) Christ's, Joh. 1.16.
Plenitudo Abundantiae and Redundantiae.
is as evident. Of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace. There
is in Christ not (only) a fullness of Abundance, but (also) of Redundance; there
is an overflowing fullness in Christ Jesus. Grace for Grace: A cumulation of
grace; grace upon grace: As the Paper from the Press receives Letter for
Letter; or as the Wax from the Seal receives Print for Print; or, as the Glass
from the Image receives Face for Face; so Christians receive from Christ Grace
for Grace. There is in Christians in some measure and proportion, a grace
answerable and agreeable to the same in Christ. Thus generally: but now
particularly.

Christ (for those who are Christ's) a fullness of Power. All power in Heaven, is
given unto Christ. He is the Object of the Angels adoration. He has the Angels
at his Command, and can send them forth as an heavenly Host, to assist his
people. Mat. 26.53.
Peter (says Christ) think thou not that I can now pray to my Father, and
he shall give me more than twelve Legions of Angels? The Roman Army consisted
(ordinarily) of twelve Legions; such an Army of Angels could Christ have had,
and this had been a vast Army. A Legion (they say) is six thousand armed
Soldiers; but here are more than twelve Legions; it may be a definite number
put for an indefinite; more than twelve Legions of Angels seem to import an
infinite number of Angels. But, as Christ has power in Heaven, so on Earth: As
he is the Object of the Angels adoration, so of the Saints admiration. Christ
has power over the Princes and Potentates of the Earth, how magnificent and
mighty soever they be in their own eyes, or in the eyes of others: Rev. 17.14.
He is (therefore) styled King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Christ (also) has
power over Hell. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, Phil. 2.10.
both things which are in Heaven, (Angels, and the spirits of just men made
perfect) and on Earth (Saints and Sinners) and under the Earth (infernal
spirits.) As Christ is the Object of the Angels Adoration, and of the Saints
Admiration, so of the Devils Consternation.

Christ (for those that are Christ's) a fullness of pardon. Sin is evil; all
evil; always evil; the pardon (therefore) of sin must needs be a singular, and a
signal mercy; a precious, Luke 5.20. John Tecelius; the first part of Clark's
Eccl. Hist. p. 227.
and a plural mercy. It was Christ that said to the Palsical man, Thy sins are
forginen thee. The Popes pardon is not worth a penny, whatsoever that John
thought, who bringing Indulgences into Germany to be sold, said, that he had so
large a Commission from the Pope, that though a man had deflowred the blessed
Virgin, yet (for money) he could pardon his sin. The pardon of sin, is a great
thing; what would not a condemned Malefactor give for a pardon! No voice but
the voice of Christ, will still the voice of Desperation. It was Christ that
said to the City-Sinner, Thy sins are forgiven. Luke 7.48.
The barbarous and murderous Papists say, that a doubting of the pardon of sin,
is not an Infirmity, but a Virtue: But, has not doubting cost the soul dear?
Now Christ (in a fourfold respect) pardons sin.

Christ pardons sin in respect of his Deity. is God, Mark 2.7.
and therefore pardons. Who can forgive sins but God only?

Christ pardons sin in respect of his Dignity. is exalted, and therefore
pardons. Him has God exalted with his right hand, Act. 5.31.
to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance unto Israel, and forgiveness
of sins. There have been many Princes (besides) Christ, but never was there a
Savior (besides) Christ, that could give repentance, and remission of sin.

Christ pardons sin in respect of his Mercy. doubting and drooping; Prove. 18.14.
desponding and despairing; therefore Christ pardons. A wounded spirit is an
intolerable burden. A wounded spirit who can bear? Suffer Spira to speak; The
hand of God is out against me, not for Correction, but for Condemnation. Let
Bilney and Glover (also) speak, if Desertion be not a Hell within.

Christ pardons sin in respect of his Merit. did; yea died, therefore
pardons. Make no mixtures of the blood of Hales, and Becket, with the blood
of Christ, though they (by Italy) were canonized for Saints. Every forgiven
soul may say, my Merit is the Mercy of my God. The Apostle (speaking of Christ)
says, Romans 6.10, 11. D. Mocr, upon the 7 Epist. to the 7 Churches; p. 129.
In that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he lives, he lives unto
God: Likewise reckon ye your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto
God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. The payment of popish Merits is not
current, but copper Coin, which will not go in Heaven, but will certainly be
turned back to Hell again. The Sacerdotal Absolution (says one) among the
Papists, is the most hideous, the most dangerous, and the most perfidious Cheat
of Rome, that ever she could light on, in order to the damning of poor
(credulous) souls, that thus superstitiously depend upon the vain Breath of
their Priests, for the security of their salvation.

Christ (for those that are Christ's) a fullness of Light. A dark state, is a
dismal state; Mal. 4.2.
a dungeon state, is a dreadful state. If Christ ( the Sun of Righteousness)
do not shine in our Horizon, we are in the dark; yea, we are darkness (...)
self in the very Abstract. For ye sometimes were darkness, Ephesians. 5.8.
but now are ye light in the Lord; walk as children of light. There was
darkness upon the face of the whole earth, until God said, Let there be light.
Genesis 1.3.
Now, that the Habit should come out of the Privation, Light out of Darkness;
Life out of Death; Joy out of Sorrow; Peace out of Trouble, these are the
wonderful works of God. Christ calls himself the Light of Life. Joh. 8.12.
He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life. As the firmamental Sun is the worlds light, so Christ is the Churches
light: As the Eye, is the light of the Body, so Christ is the light of the
Soul. Oh Soul! under all thy doubts, and darkness; Isa. 50.10.
when there is the greatest Film upon thine eye; when thou art in darkness and
have no light, then thou have a Christ to go unto, in whom there is a fullness
of light for His. Did a Job say, I was eyes to the blind, feet was I also to
the lame? What may a Jesus then say?

Christ (for those that are Christ's) a fullness of Love. The Love of Christ,
that is a sweet Monosyllable indeed; that is a sweet morsel indeed. 2 Cor. 5.21.
Love, that is a sweet Dish indeed: Did I say a Dish indeed? I may say a Feast
indeed. Did ever one live, as Christ lived? for he lived and sinned not: Did
ever any one love, as Christ loved? for he loved, Rev. 1.5.
and washed from sin in the blood of himself. Christ loved His, as he loved
Himself; yea, he seemed to love His above Himself, for he loved them, and out
of love gave himself to death for them. Gal. 2.20.
Who loved me, and gave himself for me. Christ's feet were washed with Marys
tears, such was (her) love to Him; but Marys heart was washed with Christ's
blood, such was (his) love to Her. Who loved us, and washed us from our sins in
the blood of himself. Gen 44.30. 2 Samuel 18.33. 2 Samuel 1.26.
There have been great Lovers in the world; what a love had Jacob for Benjamin!
Kill the Son, and the same grave may serve for the Father. What a love had
David for Absalom! The Father would have a pillow of Lust, that the Son might
have a pillow of Down. What a love had Jonathan for David! Thy love to me was
wonderful, passing the love of women. But, what (...) a Feather to a Mountain?
what is a Spark to the Furnace? what is a Drop to the Ocean? such is the love
of Man, to the love of God-man. Christ (infinitely) out-bids all; Psalm. 30.5.
Chajim, Psalm. 63.3.
out-vies all. In his favor is life; yea life's; so the Hebrew. Because thy
loving kindness is better than life; than life's; so the Hebrew. Christ's Looks,
were Loves; his Life, was a life of Love. Was he not born into the world rather
to love, than to live?

Christ (for those that are Christ's) a fullness of Wisdom. Satan, is subtle; The
children of this world are wiser in their generation, Luke 16.8. 2 Samuel 15.31.
than the children of light; but Christ is ^iser than all; wisest of all: He,
can turn their wisdom into folly, and outshoot them in their own Bow. The
Wisdom that man has, is a poor pittance; a poor moity; but in Christ are hid
all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Col. 2.3. 1 King. 4.31. 2 Samuel
14.20. 1 Cor. 1.24. Ch^chmot, Prove. 9.1.
Soloman was a Sage in his day; He was wis^r than all men. David (according to
the woman's judgment) was wise as an Angel of God: But, Christ, is wise as God;
yea, he is the Wisdom of God; yea, he is the God of Wisdom. Wisdom ( Wisdoms,
so the Hebrew) has builded her house. Christ, the supreme Wisdom; the Wisdom
of God; yea, the God of Wisdom, has builded her house (prepared him a Church;)
he has hewn out his seven pillars; (Patriarchs, Prophets, Seers, Apostles,
Evangelists, Pastors and Tea^hers;) or (by seven) may be understood the
manifold gifts of the Spirit; for it is ordinary in Scripture, to take seven
for a perfect number; Pro. 8.14.
for a number of perfection. Is not that a (lofty) as well as a (lovely)
strain, when Christ thus speaks of himself? Counsel is mine, and sound Wisdom;
I am Understanding, I have strength. Oh Soul! though the best, and wisest of
men, have too little of that wisdom from above, which is first pure, Jam. 3.17
and then peaceable, yet there is in Christ (for those that are Christ's) a
fullness of Wisdom.

Christ (for those that are Christ's) a fullness of Righteousness. He is styled
Jesus Christ the righteous. Little children, 1 John 2.1
I write unto you that ye sin not: Whatsoever ye do, or suffer, do not sin; ye
had better be sick than sinning; better be suffering than sinning; better be
dying than sinning; better be dying (for) a Christ, or dying (in) a Christ,
than sinning against (a) Christ: Little children, I write unto you that ye sin
not; but if any one sin (so the Greek) whether Jew, or Gentile; whether man, or
woman; It Is.
We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Christ is not
(only) righteous, but (also) Righteousness: Jer. 23.6.
In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is
the name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our righteousness.

There is in Christ a twofold Righteousness, imputed, and imparted; an imputed
righteousness, in order to Justification; an imparted righteousness, in order
to Sanctification. Both these are together legible; Who is made of God unto us
wisdom, 1 Cor. 1.30.
righteousness, sanctification and redemption. That there is a fullness of
righteousness in Christ, is evident, because he fully answered what the Law
could challenge of those that are His; now the Law required of these a
threefold righteousness; habitual, practical, passive.

Habitual; that is, Conformity of our Natures to the Holiness of the Law. Now
this was found in Christ, in whom there is a fullness for his. 1 Pet. 1.19.
He was a Lamb without blemish, and without spot. Christ, was free from all
sin; without blemish, and spot; without original, and actual sin; he was sound
within, and without.

Practical; Conformity of our Wills to the Edicts of the Law. This (also) was
found in Christ. There was not the least Aberration in his works, words, Joh.
14.30
or thoughts. The Prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me. Christ
had no Corruption, that might be sewel to his Temptation; though tempted (unto)
sin, yet was he not tempted (into) sin.

Passive; Conformity of our sufferings to the Threats and Curses of the Law.
This (also) was found in Christ, in whom there is a fullness for His.

But what did the Law threaten? Quest. Sol.


The Law threatened a privation of Comfort, and an instiction of Torment.

A privation of Comfort. omission of good. Time was when Christ was deprived of
that Comfort and Influence, Mark 15.34.
which (at other times) he had from the Deity, so far as to cry out, My God, my
God, why have thou forsaken me?

An infliction of Torment. commission of evil. Luke 22.44.
This (also) was found in Christ, in whom there is a sulness for His. Time was
when Christ lay under torment, and sense of wrath, which caused him to sweat
water and blood. Thus, is the Law (exactly) answered by the fullness of Christ's
righteousness.

CHAP. II. To the Soul (in) Christ.
ART in Christ? then (through Christ) for the (first) Death. Directions
It is a solemn work to die; we had need (therefore) prepare to do that work
well, which is but once to be done. In this world we pray often; and preach
often; and hear often; in this world we meditate and mourn often; discourse and
dispute often; yea (which is worse than all) in this world we sin often, but we
shall die but once. Caesar Borgia.
I have read of one (who being sick unto death) said, when I lived. I prepared
for every thing (but) Death; now I must die, and am unprepared (for) Death. It
is our prudence to die well, because we can die but once. A man had need to do
that wisely, which he can do but once. An error in Death, is like an error in
War; ye cannot commit it twice. All the time we live is but a passage (unto)
Death, and therefore should be a preparation (for) Death. It is said of David,
1 Chronicles. 22.5.
that (before his death) he prepared abundantly for the house of the Lord. It
is the Duty and Dignity; the Prudence and Property (of those who are actually
Christ's) before their death, to prepare abundantly for their death. What is
true of Judgment, is true of Death; Amos 4.12. Not, Vi, and Armis.
but this is true of Judgment; Prepare to meet thy God oh Israel! The Israel of
God, is to meet the God of Israel, in the way of his righteous Judgments, by
Prayers and Tears, not by Sword and Spears. Heart-work is hard work, and yet
this is imposed. 1 Samuel 7.3
Prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and he will deliver you out of the hands of
the Philistines. Ezekiel. 18.31. Ezekiel. 36.26.
God impose upon man the making of a new heart, and he might as well have
imposed upon him the making of a new Heaven; but what God impose upon man in
one place, he promise to do for man in another place. Make ye a new heart: Pro.
16.1.
A new heart will I give them. God impose upon man the preparation of the
heart, when the preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue,
is from the Lord.

But what course shall I now steer, Quest.
and by what compass shall I now sail, that I may prepare for Death?

Make (through Christ) Mortality thy Meditation. Sol. 1.
Meditate death; Bern.
be much in the Meditation of Mortality. Nothing (says one) so revokes from
sin, as a daily Meditation of Death. The Heathen could say, that the whole life
of man should be nothing else but a Meditation of Death. One presented
Antipater (King of Macedon) with a Book treating of Happiness, but his answer
was, I have no leisure to read it. Days of Grace, have their Dates; take heed
(therefore) of saying to morrou^, to morrow. As a man must not say to Christ,
so a man must not say to Death, as a penurious and parcimonious man say to an
indigent person, come to morrow, Sine mora. Heb. 4.7. Diem perdidi. Vespatian.
Mane.
I am not at leisure now. Without delay, was the Motto of Alexander the Great.
To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. The present time, is
man's time. The good Emperor, not hearing a Cause, or doing some charitable Act
in the day, would complain at night unto his Courtiers, Sirs, I have lost a
day. 2 Cor. 6.2. Hoc Nunc, nullum habet crastinum. Aug.
Delays are dangerous; yea Delay is the Mother of Danger. Delay, is almost as
bad as Denial. There is a word, which is the Lords Adverb, and the Devils Verb:
Early, say God; stay, s^y the Devil. Now is the accepted time; behold, now is
the day of salvation. This Now (says one) has no to morrow. Take heed of
playing the Courtier with thy Soul; the Courtier do all things late; he rises
late; dineth late; goes to bed late, and repents late. Henry the fourth
asked the Duke de Alva, if he had seen the great Eclipse of the Sun which had
lately been; no (said the Duke) I have so much to do upon Earth, that I have no
leisure to look up to Heaven. Let thy Thoughts be taken up with Death. Ambrose.
I have not (says one) so lived, that I am afraid to die, or ashamed to live
longer. Death is a Theme, worthy the most serious, and solid; the most
spiritual and sanctified meditation.

Be much (through Christ) in prayer. Christ, that Heaven may be thy Haven; that
Paradise may be the Port for thy Soul. Prayer is the (first) and should be the
(last) Dish. If ye be Christ's, ye must Pray (while) ye live, and Pray (when) ye
die; ye must live, and die, Acts 7.59.
praying. Thus Stephen did; They sloned Stephencalling upon the name of the
Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. Yea, thus a greater than
Sephen, Luke 23.34.
the Lord and Life of Stephen the Lord Jesus Christ did; Father forgive them
for they know not what they do. When the Heart-blood of Christ was coming
forth, then was the heart-prayer of Christ also coming forth; Rev. 8.3, 4.
Genesis 48.16.
Father forgive them for they know not what they do. We read of an Angel that
stood at the Altar: The Angel is Christ; the Angel that redeemed Jacob from all
evil; the Angel of the Covenant: The Altar, is Himself, who sanctifies prayer,
as the Altar did the Gift: This Angel (which is Christ) had a golden Censer;
his own Body: Mal. 3.1.
To him was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all
Saints or, (that he should add to the prayers of all Saints) upon the golden
Altar which was befere the Throne. Christ (by his Intercession) perfumes the
prayers of his, being the only High Priest of the New Testament: And the smoke
of the Incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, ascended up before
God out of the Angels hand. It is such a prdyer that I intend; a pure prayer; a
Gospel prayer: a prayer that passes a Christ; that passes out of the Angels
hand; that passes through the hand of the Son, 1 Samuel 1.15. Romans 8.26.
to the heart of the Father. Now, what is this Prayer, but a pouring out of the
Sonl to God? what is (pure) prayer, but a breathing (out) that before God,
which was first breathed (in) by the Spirit of God? As Fear is so principal a
Grace, that it is sometimes put for (all) grace: Now I know that thou fear
God, Genesis 22.2.
seeing thou have not withheld thy Son, thine only Son. And, as Faith is so
principal a Grace, that it is sometimes put for (all) Grace; Heb. 12.2.
Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith; so Prayer is so
principal a part of Worship, that it is sometimes put for (all) worship: Mat.
21.13. Luke 18.1. 1 These. 5.17.
My house shall be called an house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of
thieves. Pure Prayer is imposed, therefore incumbent. Christ, spoke a Parable,
that men ought always to pray, and not to faint. To pray always, is not to
faint in prayer. Pray without ceasing. Pray, there is the Act; without ceasing,
there is the Duration of that Act. As it is the duty of a Christian (of Christ's
making) to pray, so it is the property of this person to pray. A living Child,
is a crying Child: Until the Child come out of the womb, it cannot cry, but
when it come into the World it cry. So long as a a man is in the womb of a
natural state, Gal. 4.6.
he cannot cry Father, Father. Because ye are Sons, God has ^sent forth the
Spirit of his Son into your hearts, Act. 9.11.
crying Father, Father. Was Paul ever said to pray until converted from his
Pharisaical state? Go, for behold he prays. He, who was a Persecutor before,
is a Prayer now. Soul! if God design thee for Heaven, he will put thee upon
prayer; yea, Mat. 6.6.
upon closetprayer. But thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet. It Is
death to a living man long ^o hold his breath. If we breath, we live; if we
breath not, we die. Thus, it is death (as it were) to a truly gracious soul long
to be kept from (inward) and (intimate) converse and communion with God, and
Christ; with God (in) Christ. A declining of this Duty, will prove a drawn
Flood-gate unto great Iniquity. Where is that man like to stop, who declines
this Duty? Ephesians. 6.18.
Praying always; there is the Duty; with all prayer and supplication in the
Spirit; there is the Direction. If we would prepare for death, we must be much
in prayer. To this end reflect the Income of prayer, and Influence of prayer.

Be much in the reflection of the Income of prayer, Christ, would not lose his
Incomes of prayer for a world; for a thousand worlds, if there were so many. Oh
what have thy Tears, and thy Triumphs, been in a Closet! Oh what have thy
Sighs, and thy Sights, been in a Closet! O what have thy Shines, and thy Smiles
been in (private) prayer! Oh how melted have thy Soul been, and mortified have
thy sin been, when thou have been engaged, and enlarged in (private) prayer!
Have not thy Soul been sent away with more of the sanctifying, and with more of
the sealing work of the Spirit too? David's Incoms of prayer, were great, and he
valued them greatly. I love the Lord; why? because he has heard my voice, Psa.
116.1, 2.
and my supplications; because he has inclined his ear unto me, therefore will
I call upon him so long as I live. What an estimate is set upon the Income of
Prayer?

Be much in the reflection of the Influence of Prayer. has a great Influence;
for instance.

Pure Prayer (through Christ) had an Influence, Command, over the four
Elements; Air; Fire; Earth; Water.

Over the Air. (which was Elijah) praved earnestly (in prayer he prayed, Jam.
5.17, 18.
so the Greek:) That is, he prayed earnestly (for the ingemination has this
force) that it might not rain, and it did not; that it might rain, and it did.

Over the Fire. mercy, and thus it had in a way of Judgment.

Thus it had in a way of Mercy. 1 King. 18.37, 38.
and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust,
and licked up the water, that was in the trench.

Thus (also) it had (...) way of Judgment. (also) prayed, and fire came down
from Heaven; 2 King. 1.10, 11, 12.
consuming the two first Captains of fifties, with their fifties.

Over the Earth, Moses prayed, and the earth opened, Number. 16.31, 32.
with all that appertained unto them.

Over the Water. Moses (also) prayed, Exodus 14.16, 21.
and the waters were divided. Thus, to the Elements.

Prayer (through Christ) had an Influence and Command over the Prision. Acts
12.4, 5.7.10.
When Peter was immured within Prison walls, prayer (without ceasing) was made
by the Church unto God for him, so that his chains fell off, and the Iron Gate
opened of its own accord.

Prayer (through Christ) had an Influence and Command, over the great
Luminaries, the Sun, Josh. 10.12, 13.
and the Moon. Joshua prayed, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon
in the Valley of Ajalon; and they did so.

Prayer, had an Influence upon Christ. Centurions prayer, engaged Christ to
heal his Servant: Mat. 8.6, 7, 8, 13.
I will come and heal him: But the Centurions faith occasioned Christ's staying,
to heal his Servant without going; Speak the word only, and my Servant shall be
healed. Thou art God, and need not to go; do but send; yea, do but speak;
speak the word only: A word from a God, will reach him, and raise him: Jesus
said unto the Centurion, go thy way, and as thou have believed, so be it done
unto thee; and his Servant was healed in the self same hour. Genesis 32.28.
What an Influence upon Christ had the prayer of Jacob! Thy name shall be
called no more Jacob, but Israel; why? for as a Prince have thou power with
God, and with men, and have prevailed. Jacob, had power with God, for he had
power with Christ (who is the Angel here, and who is God manifested in the
flesh:) He had (also) power with men, for he had power with his Uncle Laban,
and his Brother Esau.

Prayer (through Christ) has an Influence upon God himself; the God of Gods.
Pure prayer, God out of Heaven: Act. 7.34.
I have Jeen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I
have heard th^^^ groaning, and am come down to deliver them. I have seen; I
have seen; i. e. I have surely seen: But what had God to see? nothing but their
Affliction. Gospel-prayer has (as it were) a shadow of Omnipotency instamped
upon it. Ask me of things to come concerning my Sons, Isa. 45.11
and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me. Though men cannot command
the least thing of God, yet (upon the Entreaty of his people) he is as ready to
do, as if he were at their command; Command ye me. If ye come unto me under
this Notion, that ye are my Sons, and the work of my hands, there is a Law upon
me; I cannot deny you; Command ye me. Oh what infinite Condescension is here!
As if God had said, No Servant shall be (so) ready to serve his Master; or Son
to serve his Father, as I will be ready to serve you; it is but asking and
having; Command ye me.

Would ye prepare for Death? (Christ) imbitter sin. Sin, is a bitter thing, and
it will be bitterness in the End. Ier. 2.19.
Know (therefore) and see, that it is an evil thing, and bitter, that thou have
forsaken the Lord they God, and that his fear is not in thee. Evil, and bitter;
evil, in it self, and bitter in its Issue. Though sin should seem sweet in the
palate (stolen waters are sweet) yet it is bitter in its Issue; yea,
bitterness in the End. May not I write concerning Sin, 2 Samuel 2.26.
as Abner spoke to Joab concerning the Sword? Shall the Sword devour for ever?
Know thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? Iniquity, is
grown from a Mist, to a Mystery; from Ignorance, to Arrogance; from Nescience,
to Negligence; as if too much light, had made men blind. Sin, is a Cup of
poison; drink not of this Cup. Look upon Sin as a Monster; as a Mountebank;
look upon it as Deformity it self; as Defilement it self. I believe that Monk
was very much out, Isidore.
who vaunted that he had felt in himself no motion to sin forty years together.
If this be true, then Sin and his Heart were great Strangers: But I (rather)
think that he was a great Seranger to his (own) Heart. If ye would prepare for
Death, ye must (through Christ) imbitter Sin. Pro. 20.9.
Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? Then God
remembers Sin against a Person, or against a People, when he leaves that
Person, or that People, without the remembrance of Sin. Ah! what is? yea, what
is not that Sin, which had not a Being (from) God? which cannot have a Being
(with) God? which (also) strikes at the Being (of) God? But (heartily) suffer
a distinct discussion of these things.

Sin, had not a Being (from) God. Sin, own; his (own) Birth; his (own) Babe;
his (own) Brat. Psa. 94.23
He shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their
own wickedness. Though Satan be the Father of Temptation, yet the Heart is the
Mother of Corruption. Jam. 1.14 Posse peccare; posse non peccare; non posse non
peccare.
Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and entised. As
there is Original Sin, so there is the Original of Sin, which may be a
Possibility (of) Sinning; a Potentiality (to) Sin. There was a Possibility of
Sinning, and this was in a Paradisical state. The woman gave unto me, and I did
eat. There is a Possibilty of (not) Sinning, and this is in a Spiritual state.
In all this Job sinned not. Genesis 3.12. Job 1.22.
There is an Impossibility of sinning, and this is in a Celestial state: Those
( arrived at Heaven) are arrived at perfection: The Sprits of just men made
perfect. Every Man, Heb. 12.23.
and Woman, may say to (his) or (her) Sin, thou art mine, and shall not this be
imbittered?

Sin, cannot have a Being (with) God. Sinner in Heaven; no Sinning in Heaven; 1
Cor. 6.9
no Sin in Heaven. The unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. The
unrighteous (as) unrighteous; the unrighttous, in a state of unrighteousness,
shall not inher it the Kingdom of God. Heaven is sinless, and all there are
sinless: As is the Place, so are the People; as is the City, so are the
Citizens, sinless.

Sin (also) strikes at the Being (of) God. would not (only) un-saint a Saint,
Psa. 137.7.
but (also) unchrist a Christ, if it were possible. Remember, Oh Lord, the
children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, who said, raze it, raze it, even to
the Foundation thereof. As it is true in a Physical, so in a Metaphysical
sense; what would not Sinners do against the Fabric, and the Foundation too?
against the Christian and Christ too? Sin, would un-god a God, if it were
possible. Is not this the Dialect of Sinners? Cause the holy one of Israel to
cease from before us. Isa. 30.11.
If (now) we would prepare for death, we must (then) imbitter Sin; and if we
would imbitter Sin, we must (then) look upon Sin as a cursed Inmate, and as a
cursed Makebate.

Would ye imbitter Sin? Sin as a cursed Inmate. Romans 7.17, 20. Reliquiae
peccati.
Though Sin had not a Being (from) God, yet it has a Being (in) Man: But Sin
that dwells in me. Though Sin (for) a Believer be perfectly covered, yet Sin
(in) a Believer is not perfectly cured; there are still the remainders of Sin
within, which must be mourned over, and turned from.

Would ye imbitter Sin? Sin as a cursed Makebate. It is so between God and Man;
between Man and Man; between Man and Himself.

Sin is a Makebate between God and Man. and Man (at first) were One, but Sin
has made these Two. Sin, has set God at an infinite distance from Man, and
Man, at an infinite distance from God. Isa. 59.2.
Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your Sins have
hid his face from you, that he will not hear.

Sin, Makebate between Man and Man. There was War between Jeroboam and Rehoboam
all their days. From whence come all those animosities, differences, discords
and distances among Men? come they not from their Sin? As Sin is the Makebate
between the Men of the World; Benhadad and Ahab were two: 1 Kings 20.1, 2. 1 John 3.12.
And as Sin is the Makebate between the Wicked and the Righteous; Cain rose up
against his brother Abel, and slew him, because his own works were evil, and
his brothers righteous. So, Sin is the Makebate between the righteous
themselves. From whence come Wars, and fightings among you? Jam. 4.1.
come they not hence, even of your lusts, which war in your members?

Sin, Makebate between Man and Himself. None can Sin at a cheap rate. How dear
do the dead (who died out of Christ) pay for Sin? The damned, pay dear for Sin.
How dear have Sin cost the living? Yea those who had Christ for their Life?
witness Bilney, Glover and Spira; who (for a time upon Earth) were like living
men in Hell. Psalm. 6.6. Margent.
May David (though dead) speak? I am weary of my groaning; all the night, or
(every night) make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. Oh the
fears and tears that Sin has cost! Psalm. 38.3.
I have no soundness in my flesh; why? because of thine anger; neither have I
any peace for my bones; why? because of my Sin. Oh the sorrows, and sufferings!
the Trials, and Troubles, that Sin has cost! Oh the wearisome Days, and
Nights! the Pains of Body, and Pangs of Soul, that Sin has cost! If now we
would prepare for death, we must imbitter (this) Sin, which is such an Inmate,
and Makebate.

Would ye prepare for Death? Grace and Glory. Eternal life, is made up of
Grace, and Glory; but to these distinctly.

Endear (through Christ) Grace. Grace, Pebble, but a Pearl. Oh set a greater
Estimate upon Grace! Lay up, and lock up this Pearl in thy Cabinet, for it is
of great price. The Toyaz of Ethiopia, and the Riches of both the Indies, are
but a Pebble to this Pearl. Grace (in) God; Yea, Grace (from) God, is a Pearl.
Grace entitles Glory: Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. Heb. 12.14.
Joh. 4.14.
Grace entails Glory: The water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well
of water springing up into everlasting life. One dram of Grace, is worth a
world; a thousand worlds; tenthousand worlds, if there were so many. Grace, is
of such worth, as that it cannot be valued to its worth. Grace, will go into
Glory, when Time goes into Eternity; and is not this to be endeared? If there
be any Discourse in Heaven, as there is upon Earth, it is a discourse of
free grace, not of free will. The two Poles will as soon meet as free will, and
free grace, in the justification of a Sinner before God. Grace, is so pure,
that there is no sin in it: As there is no Grace in Sin, so there is no Sin in
Grace. The Heart, that is the Soil; Grace, 1 Pet. 1.23.
that is the Seed, and this is incorruptible. And, as Grace (from) God. is so
pure, that there is no Sin in it, so Grace (in) God is so precious, that the
stress of salvation is laid upon it. By grace ye are saved. Is not this a
blessed Parenthesis, without which we cannot be blessed? The whole Alphabet of
Salvation, from the Alpha to the Omega thereof, is legible in free grace; By
grace ye are saved. The bottomstone, Gratia non est gratia ullo modo, nisi sit
gratuita omni modo. Aug. 1 Cor. 15.10.
coner-stone, and top-stone of Salvation, they are all laid in free grace. It
is Grace (says one) no way, unless free every way. Every step in Salvation,
from the Cell of Nature, to the Chair in Glory, is of free grace; now, shall
not (this) grace be endeared? By the grace of God I am that I am. By Sin, I was
what I was, but by Grace I am that I am; I am what I am. May it not (now) be
the wonder of the world, if those (who are gracious) should not be found
endearing of Grace?

Endear (through Christ) Glory. Grace, so the more ye endear Glory, the more ye
prepare for Death. The Life of Glory, is the grace of Life. Greenham
There is (says one) a (huge) and (heavy) weight of Glory. Glory (from) God,
is the Object of Hope; and Glory (with) God, is the Object of Hope. Tit. 1.2.
In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promised before the world
began. As the Person (of) Christ is the Object of Faith; Romans 3.26. Col. 1.4.
That he might be just, and the justifier of him that believ thin Jesus. And,
as persons (in) Christ, are the Objects of Love; Since we heard of your faith
in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the Saints: Romans 5.2.
So Heaven is the Object of Hope. And, rejoice in hope of the Glory of God. In
hope of eternal life; now, eternal life, is made up of Grace, and Glory. Life,
would be little better than Hell, were it not for the hopes of Heaven. I had
rather (says one) enjoy Christ in a Chimneycorner, Bernard.
than to be in Beaven without him. I had rather (says another) be in Hell
(with) a Christ, than to be in Heaven (without) him. Heaven, is the presence of
all Good, and the absence of all Evil. Read mihi vitam aeternam quam debes.
That Monk died like himself, who said, Lord, pay me Heaven which thou owe
me. Heaven, is a Flower of Salvation blown out; the Saint (here) is in the
Suburbs of Heaven. Heaven, is the Inheritance of those unto whom Christ is
Life, and unto whom Death shall be gain.

If Heaven be the Inheritance of these, Quest.
what manner of Inheritance (then) is Heaven?

Heaven is a free Inheritance. Sol. 1.
Would it not puzzle all the Saints on Earth, and Angels in Heaven, to bring in
the worth of Heaven? and yet this is a Donat^^e. Many Inheritances here (below)
are bought, but (this) Inheritance is given. Here, men buy Inheritances, and
pay to the worth of them; Luke 2.32.
but Heaven (though it cannot be valued to its worth) yet it is given. (...)
Fear not little-little Flook (there are two diminitives in the Greek) for it
is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. The word translated
(Flock) signifies a (little) Flock; but Christ (to show the exceeding
littleness of it) adds another word, little: Fear not littlelittle Flock.

Heaven is a full Inheritance. Ahasuerus, Territory; he reigned from India unto
Ethiopia, over 127 Provinces: A man would have thought that 127 Provinces, had
been enough for 127 persons, and yet this (large) Territory was a (poor)
pittance. Many, have large Inheritances here below, and cannot live upon them;
but Heaven is an Inheritance thou may live upon; if possessed of this
Inheritance, thou shall never want more. Heaven, is a perfection of Felicity,
without intermission and amission: If once possessed of this Inheritance, then
thou will say with Jacob, It is enought Thou will (as one reads it) make known
the way of life, satiety of joys before thy face; Ainsworth Psa. 16.11
pleasures at thy right hand to perpetuity.

Heaven, is a living Inheritance. Heaven, living Inheritance, but (also) an
Inheritance of Life. Death, is legible in the face of the Earth, but Life is
legible in the face of Heaven. I am come that ye might have life; Life here,
life hereafter. Mutability, and Mortality, Rev. 2.10.
are written upon all things here below, but Heaven is called a Crown of Life.
Be thou faithful unto death; there is the precept; and I will give thee a Crown
of life; there is the promise.

Heaven, is a lasting Inheritance. Inheritance will last, so long as the Heir
last. Into what a time of Debauchery are we fallen? and how short-lifed are
earthly Inheritances? How long soever the Fathers were in getting them, the
Children are not long in spending them. An (earthly) Inheritance may be spent,
but this (heavenly) Inheritance cannot be spent. Though those (who are actually
Christ's) may lose all at Sea, and all (...) Land; all in the Ship, and all in
the Shop; all within doors, and all without doors; yet they cannot lose Heaven;
this is a lasting Inheritance; yea, this is an everlasting Inheritance. The
Apostle (having imposed a making of the calling and election sure) subjoyns
this, For so an entrance will be ministered unto you abundantly, 2 Pet. 1.10, 11.
into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. This
Kingdom, is the Kingdom of Glory, because styled an everlasting Kingdom. It is
called the Kingdom of Christ, because given to him as a reward of his passions.
It is an (everlasting) Kingdom, because the Union between Christ and a
Christian, is everlasting. As Christ (on earth) is the Christians Medium of
Reconciliation, and Communion, so Christ (in Heaven) is the Christians Medium
of Vision and Fruition. There are (among other things) these six things, which
those (who are actually Christ's) can never lose.

The Soul cannot be lost. Soul is a Blossom of Eternity; has a stamp of
Immortality; now Death it self (though the Mistress of Mortals, and Empress of
the Universe) despairs how to kill this. Fear not them which kill the body,
Luke 12.4.
and after that have no more that they can do. Men. may kill the Body, but they
cannot kill the Soul. Those (who assert without blushing) the Mortality of the
Soul, seem (at least) to stand upon the Brink of Atheism. Though the Body
return unto the Dust, yet the Soul to Hell, or Heaven. Luke 23.43. 1 Pet. 1.5.
(...), Peccare, not Perire.
Though the Veins of the penitent Thief were breathed, and his Vitals let out,
yet his Soul goes to Heaven. To day shall thou be with me in Paradise. To day;
is not this emphatical? and does not Christ promise more than the Thief asks?
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation: Who are kept;
the Greek word, is a military word, taken from Soldiers; they are safely kept;
kept as a Garrison in time of War against the Enemy. Though a Soul (actually in
Christ) may sin, 1 John 3.9
and do sin, yet not unto Death; not unto the second Death. He that is born of
God sins not, not to condemnation.

The Savior cannot be lost. Once and Ever, Motto. Though yesterday some were
not; Semel and Simul. Heb. 13.8.
to day some are, but to morrow these may not be; yet, yesterday, to day, and
for ever, Christ is the same. Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to day, and for
ever. The same yesterday, before his coming in the flesh: The same to day;
while in the flesh: The same for ever; Heb. 9.24
after his Ascension (unto) and Admission (into) the Kingdom of Heaven, now to
appear in the presence of God for us. Art actually Christ's? then, though thou
may lose thy Lands; lose thy Limbs; lose thy Liberty; lose thy Life, yet
thou can not lose thy Love; lose thy Christ.

The Grace of Christ cannot be lost. may decay, but it cannot die; it may be
abated, but it cannot be abolished; it may be shaken (in) the Soul, but it
cannot be shaken (out) of the Soul. Grace, 1 Pet. 1.13.
is incorruptible seed: Which were born, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible. Grace, is the Seed; the Heart is the Soil. Gold may be lost;
Goods may be lost; Grandeur may be lost, but Grace cannot be lost; this must go
into Glory, when Time goes into Eternity.

The Spirit of Christ cannot be lost. Body is without the Soul (Lifeless and
Loveless) that the Soul is without the Spirit, and yet this Spirit cannot be
lost. What Wheels are to the Chariot, and Oil to those Wheels, that the Spirit
is to the Soul, and yet this Spirit cannot be lost. What Sails are to the Ship,
and Wind to those Sails, that, (yea infinitely more than that) is the Spirit to
the Soul, Joh. 16.14.
and yet this Spirit cannot be lost. I will pray the Father, and he shall give
you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.

Interest (in) Christ cannot be lost. is a great thing, and will not lie.
Interest, some way other, at some time or other, bias persons. As (Thou) have
Interest in Christ, so Christ has Interest in (Thee,) Joh. 17.12.
and this cannot be lost. All that thou have given me I have kept, and none of
them are lost. A Being in Christ cannot be lost.

Inheritance (with) Christ cannot be lost. Christ? then, though thou may
(leave) the Earth, yet thou shall not (lose) Heaven, To an Inheritance
incorruptible, 1 Pet. 1.4.
and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in Heaven for you.

Would ye prepare for Death? reflection of Eternity. Time passes; Eternity
stands: Eternity, is a fixed Now. Of Eternity there is no Finis. Xeuxis.
Aeternitati pingo.
A famous Painter (being asked why he was so curious, and long in drawing his
Lines) answered, I paint for Eternity. Thus, what we do, we should do for an
Eternity; we should meditate, and pray for an Eternity; we should preach, and
hear for an Eternity. Should any one ask me what Time is, might I not answer,
it is nothing else but a meditation of Eternity? Psa. 27.13 Job 10.22
There is a Land, which is called the Land of the living: so, there is a Land
which is called a Land of darkness, as darkness it self. There is a twofold
Eternity, that of the Blessed; that of the Cursed: There is a twofold life
after death; a life in eternal Triumph, or a life in eternal Torment; a life in
eternal Gain, or a life in eternal Loss. Mat. 25.46.
And these (the Goats) shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the
righteous (the Sheep) into life eternal. It is prudential (therefore) in (this)
short life, to think upon (that) life which will be endless. Trismegistus.
Plato. Drexelius, of Eternity. p. 3, 4. Ex hoc momento pendet Aeternitas.
The Soul (says one) is the Horizon of Time, and Eternity. What another says
of God, that I may say of Eternity; what God (is) that I know not; what God (is
not) that I know: So, what Eternity (is) that I know not; what Eternity (is
not) that I know. It is good in Time (while we are sailing) to have an Eye
still upon our Compass, and think upon Eternity. Cast but an eye upon some
Dials, and you may find this Inscription, Upon this Moment hangs Eternity. Our
Glass is running; our Time will go into an Eternity; be (therefore) much; yea
much more in the reflection of an Eternity.

Would ye prepare for Death? Spirit. As the Soul is the Life of the Body, so
Christ is the Life of the Soul, and his Spirit the Soul (as it were) of our
Souls. Light, is in the Air, but dwells in the San; Good if (Christ be thine)
is in the Flesh, but dwells in the Spirit. It would argue great power to
convert Clay into Gold, and a Pebble into a Pearl; a greater change is wrought
in the Soul, and requires greater power. It is as great a Miracle to see Grace
growing in the carnal, and corrupt heart of man; in the dark, and dead heart of
man; in the treacherous, and timpanious heart of man; in the wanton, and
worldly heart of man, as to see the Stars growing upon the Earth, and yet this
the power of the Spirit does. The Spirit is the principal Verb in the Sentence;
be much (then) in the improving of (this) Spirit.

But what (manner) of Spirit is (this) Spirit? Quest. Sol.


There are three Divine Subsistences, in one Divine Essence, Father; Son;
Spirit: As there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit, and the
Water, 1 John 5.7, 8.
and the Blood, and these three agree in one; so there are three that bear
record in Heaven, the Father; the Word; the holy Spirit; and these three are
one. They are not three Gods, but one God. A Trinity in Unity, and an Unity in
Trinity, looks like the Mystery of Mysteries. It Is called the eternal Spirit.
Heb. 9.14.
Who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God. It Is
(also) written, The Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, 2
Cor. 3.17.
there is Liberty. I am writing of this Spirit (Officially,) and the Offices of
(this) Spirit follow.

It Is an enlivening Spirit. (Naturals) are dead; dead in Sin. Persons (in red
Letters) while they live in the Region of depraved Nature are dead; they are at
(most) and at (best) but imbalmed Jacobs, and Joseph's, lifeless, and loveless;
motionless, and actionless. There may be an (artificial) Motion, but there
cannot be a (natural) Motion, without natural Life. Joh. 6.63.
A Watch may go; a Clock may go; a Jack may go; but these go not as a man goes
It is the Spirit that quickens.

It Is an enlightening Spirit. As God, and Christ, Things of God and Christ, are
out of the Viow of a person Godless, and Christless. It is the Spirit of God,
that unmasks, and unveils God; that discovers the things of God. The Apostle
(speaking of those things which were invisible, inaudible, and inconceivable)
connects, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10.
and connexes this: But God has revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the
Spirit searches all things; yea the deep things of God. In these words, there
is an Assertion, and the Reason for that Assertion.

The Assertion.

The Reason for that Assertion. Conclusion, and the Comment.

The Conclusion. metaphorical; taken from such as search in Mines for Gold and
Silver; they will dig deep; (...)
they will break the several Clods, and Clots of the Earth all to pieces, to
find out the Golden Ore.

The Comment. Depths of God, (...)
so the Greek. Some men are born (naturally) blind, but all men are born
(spiritually) blind, and cannot see the Depths of God, without the Spirit of
God.

It Is a bearing Spirit. Spirit, is not a (barren) but a (bearing) Tree; Gal.
5.22, 23.
it bears Variety. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no
law; no law of Condemnation.

It Is a Witnessing Spirit. He that believes, has the witness in himself.
Evidences quoad extra. 1 John 3.24. Romans 8.16.
He that has the Fruit, has the Tree; that has Faith, has the Spirit, for
Faith is a fruit growing upon (this) Tree. There are many things
(subordinately) evidential, but the Spirit is (primarily) and (principally) as
well as (infallibly) evidential, as to interest in Christ. By this we know that
he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given us. The spirit himself
witnesses together with our Spirits, that we are the children of God.

It Is a sanctifying Spirit. Abel, differed not from Cain; Abraham, from
Absalom; Isaac, from Ishmael; Jacob, from Esau; Simon Peter, from Simon Magus;
James (the Lords Brother) from Judas (the Lords betrayer) in respect of their
Substance, but in respect of the Spirit, which the (one) had, but the (other)
had not. It is the Spirit that sanctifies. 2 These. 2.13.
God has chosen us to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit, and
belief of the truth.

It Is a sealing Spirit. After ye believed, Ephesians. 1.13.
The use of a Seal is twofold, and consists in two things.

In the Nature of it. In this sense Christ was sealed. Joh. 6.27.
but for that which endures unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man shall
give, for him has the Father sealed. To Seal a thing, is to stamp the
Character of the Seal upon it.

In the Use of it. This is twofold.

To ratify. A Seal, is to ratify any Grant, Conveyance made in writing. A
writing (sealed) is authentic; this confirms the Testimony that is given by
any one of the Truth of any thing: Such was the manner among the Jews. Joh.
3.33.
He that has received his testimony, has set to his seal, that God is true.
Thus, by way of Ratification.

To Appropriate. A Seal is to appropriate, or keep safe. Rev. 7.4.
In this sense are the Servants of God sealed. I heard the number of them that
were sealed, and there were sealed an hundred forty and four thousand, of all
the tribes of the Children of Israel. Thus, by way of Appropriation. Thus the
Spirit of God is a sealing Spirit; it confirms, and assures the Soul of the
love (of) God; of life (from) God; of life (with) God. And grieve not the holy
Spirit of God, Ephesians. 4.30.
whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemption. The Spirit here (according to
the Greek Text) is set forth with very great Energy, and the Text may be thus
read; Grieve not (the) holy (the) Spirit of (that) God. Not (a) Spirit, but
(the) Spirit, not holy, but (the) holy; and not of God, but of (that) God.

Would ye prepare for Death? Christ, and lay the Stress of Obedience upon Him.
Obedience is, or ought to be, the White in a Christians eye, at which he should
level every arrow. Obedience is better than Sacrifice, and harkening than the
fat of lambs. A man truly gracious, had rather (with one) have Grace to be
obedient, Luther.
than Power to work Miracles. Obediene, is twofold, active and passive, and
the stress of both to be laid upon Christ; but to these distinctly.

Active. stress of Doing (for) a Christ (upon) a Christ. Acti agimus.
Active Obedience, is a Doing what God imposes; now, being acted, we act. Not
that we (we Apostles; we Disciples; we accounted Cedars in Lebanon, not Shrubs
of the Valley;) are sufficient of our selves, 2 Cor. 3.5
to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God. Were they
so? what are we then? If insufficient as to thinking, what are we then as to
acting? To do (what) we ought (when) we ought, and (as) we ought, is from
Christ.

Passive. stress of Dying (for) a Christ (upon) a Christ. Passive Obedience, is
a suffering what God inflicteth. Passive Obedience, brings as much Glory to
God, as active Obedience does. Luther, was troubled, that he did not lay down
his blood on this side the grave, and pass through a violent death, as all the
Apostles but John did. Art (actually) in Christ? then (possibly) thou shall not
(long) live his Servant, but die his Sicrifice; now Passion, as well as Action;
dying, as well as doing; bleeding, or burning, as well as believing, is from
Christ, Phil. 1.29.
and the Grace of Christ. To you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not
(only) to believe, but (also) to suffer for his sake. Suffering-work, is Noble
work; the Noblest work; Mat. 6.10.
for, though Saints be inferior to Angels, as to Action, yet they are
superior to Angels as to Passion; for they are Spirits, and incapable of
suffering. 1 Timothy 5.21. 6. Verse of Judes Epist. Psa. 37.24 2 Pet. 2.4.
The Apostle speaks of (elect) Angels; These, fell not from their estate. As
the (elect) Saints cannot finally fall; Though he fall, yet shall he not be
utterly cast down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand; so the (elect.)
Angels did not foully fall: Now, Suffering was the Consequent of Sinning. And
spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell. True Obedience
may be known three ways.

By the Sincerity of it. My rejoicing is this, 2 Cor. 1.12.
and godly simplicity etc.

By the Universality of it. Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect
unto all thy Commandments. Psa. 119.6
We must not (only) respect all Gods Commandments, but (also) respect them all
alike, and give them all the like respect. Obedience, must be Universal.

By the Constancy of it. Obedience must be sincere, and Universal, so constant.
1 Cor. 15.58. (...) Col. 3.11.
Be ye steadfast unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. If we
would prepare for Death, we must lay the Stress of Obedience, whether active or
passive, upon Christ, for he is All and in All: or (according to the Greek) All
things, and in all things. It may be understood of Persons, as well as Things.
Christ, is All (from) the Father; All (to) the Father; All (with) the Father;
but to these distinctly.

Christ, is All (from) the Father. (life here, Joh. 10.10
and life hereafter) and that ye might have it more abundantly. The life of
Grace and of Glory, they are by Christ.

Christ, is All (to) the Father. I am (the) Way, Joh. 14.6.
no man comes unto the Father but by me. Every word here has its Article in
the Greek. Christ, is (the) Way wherein (the) Truth, whereby, and (the) Life
whereunto we walk. Christ, is (the) Way without Error; the Truth without
Falsehood; and the Life without Death. Truth, lies between Way and Life, as if
the Way to Life were through Truth.

Christ, is All (with) the Father. (...). Mat. 3.17.
has Gods Ear at all times. Christ, is (at) Gods right hand; yea, Christ, is
(as) Gods right hand. Christ is the Object of the Fathers delight. This is my
Beloved Son in whom I acquiess; so the Greek. It is an emphatical word, and
signifies an infinite Affection.

DIRECTION II.
ART actually in Christ? Direct. 2: Sen. Artem been vivendi, and moriendi.
study then (through Christ) the Art of Dying well. May a Heathen speak? When I
was young, my care was to live well; I then studied the Art of Living well:
when Age came upon me, and gray hairs appeared here and there, my care was to
Die well; I then studied the Art of Dying well: He says (also) thou shall die,
Summum Bonum. Ars optima est vivendi, discere Artem been moriendi.
not because thou art sick, but because thou live. The Heathens hold Death to
be man's chiefost Good. The Covenant of the Grave, is showed to (no) man, but
the Watchword is given to (all) men. The Physicians exclaim, that Life is
short, and Art is long; but Divines teach, that the best Art of Living well, is
to study the Art of Dying well. Is it not pity, that men should not know unto
what they were born into this world, until they are ready to go out of this
world? Who knows, but to live, is to die? and to die, is to live? Life, is a
thing that few understand but those that are ready to leave it. A person (in a
dying hour) shall wish himself not a Man, that has not been a good Christian.
One (speaking of himself) that he had lived well, another said, I wish thou
may die well; being asked the reason why he said so, answered, because we
live to die, and die to live. 2 Cor. 5.10.
As Death leaves thee, Judgment will find thee: Death, goes before; Judgment
follows after. As the tree falls, so it lies. We must all appear before
the Judgment seat of Christ. This Art of Dying well, may be studied; must be
studied.

But what course shall I steer, Quest.
and by what compass shall I sail, in studying the Art of Dying well?

Would ye Die well? Sol. 1.
then (through Christ) Live well. The right way to Die well, is to Live well.
The way to die the death of the righteous, Qualis vita, Finis ita.
is to live the life of the righteous. Such a Life, such a Death, mostly. Live
well, and Die well, are in conjunction; are in connection; they are like
Rebecca's Twins, going hand in hand. Live well, and Die well, they are like the
two Temples of Virtue and Honor, that were so contiguously built, that none
could go into the Temple of Honor, that did not (first) pass through the
Temple of Virtue. There is (little) if (any) probability of dying well, if
there be not a living well. That Death is not to be sported with; that a
(strict) and (serious life) is not the humor of some conceited and singular
persons in the world, witness Balaam the Prophet, so much courted by Balak the
Prince; Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his.
Number. 23.10.
Here is the most knowing man in the East, who was not for living the life of
the righteous, and yet was for dying the death of the righteous: But, as the
Way is, so is the End like to be; and as the Work is, 1 King. 4.29, 30, 31.
so is the Wages like to be. Solomon, the Sage of Sages; one wiser than all
men; whose understanding was as the sand of the Sea shore; this most knowing
man in the world, Eccl. 1.14.
writes upon all vanity and vexation of spirit. Living well, is praevious unto
dying well. Mark the perfect man, Psa. 37.37
and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace. Whatsoever his
Beginning was, his End is peace. Though he had not peace (in) Life, yet he
shall have peace (in) Death; and though he should not have peace (at) Death,
yet he shall have peace (after) Death. Better is the beginning of a thing, than
the end thereof, to a Soul (out) of Christ; but better is the end of a thing,
than the beginning thereof, to a Soul (in) Christ, for the end of that man is
peace. I have fought a good fight; 2 Timothy 4.7, 8.
I have finished my course; I have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me
a Crown of Righteousness, etc.

Would ye die well? die daily. Let both ears be laid to the Apostle here: By
your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily: Or, as the
day. 1 Cor. 15.31.
Those words (I protest) are not in the Greek. As the day I die, or I die
daily: I expose my self daily to death for the Gospel, and the Conversion of
the Gentiles; but, as I am (daily) dying, so I am (dying) daily.

But unto what are those (who are actually Christ's) to Die daily? Quest.


These are to die unto Self and unto the world. Sol.


Unto Self. Self a Monster? a Mountebank? the Antichrist within? The civil Rule
is so defaced, that many (if not most men) are Compounds of Self. Let a
Minister, or Member, or Neighbor sink or swim, it is all one to them: It is
become proverbial, Every man for himself: A Maxim drawn in Hell, and ushered
into the world by the Prince of Darkness. Now, there is a six-fold Self, unto
which those (who are actually Christ's) are to die.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto sinful Self. sin, or sin will kill
Us. It is a taking Prospect to see Sin die, Romans 6.2.
while we live. How shall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto lawful Self. (where there is no law,
there is no transgression) yet those (actually Christ's) are to deny themselves
in lawful things, and to die unto lawful self. It may be it is but a
peccadillio, a little thing and lawful in it Self; 1 Cor. 6.12.
but if this should offend thy Brother, deny thy self (in) it, and (die) (to)
it. All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient; all things
are lawful unto me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto natural Self. die to their Arts and
Parts; Gifts and Reason; natural Acquirements, and Accomplishments. 1 Cor.
12.31.
Covet earnestly the best gifts, and yet I show unto you a more excellent way.
One Dram of Grace is better than a Pound of Gifts; one Drop of Grace is better
than a Sea of Gifts, one Mite of Grace, is better than a Mountain of Gifts.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto moral Self. die unto gross, and
enormous sin, but (also) to the least Immorality. Let none of you suffer as a
murderer, 1 Pet. 4.15.
or as a thief, or as an evil doer, or as a busy body in other men's matters.
Those (actually Christ's) should be so far from bebeing murderers, or thieves,
or evil doers, that they should not be (according to the Greek) Bishops in
another Diocese, and Priers into other men's matters.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto relative Self. Relations. Am not I
better to thee than ten Sons? 1 Samuel 1.8.
and and yet these must be died unto. Wives, are near, and dear Relations:
Though Adam was Emperor of Eden, and had all the creatures to serve him, yet a
Consort must be cast in as the Complement of his external Felicity. Genesis 2.18.
It is not good that man should be alone; I will make an help meet for him.
But, how near, and dear soever Wives are, 1 Cor 7.29.
they must be died unto. It remain, that they who have wives, be as though they
had none.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto religious Self. A man must have a
Righteousness of his own: Mat. 5.20. Phil. 3.9.
Except your Righteousness: And yet (this) Righteousness must not be his own,
but Christ's. Paul, dies to his own Righteousness: Not having mine own
Righteousness, which is of the Law.

Unto the World. die unto Self; so unto the World. Gal. 6.14.
God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. Thus generally, but
now particularly.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die to the Worship of the World. Joh. 4.24.
Col. 2.8, 20.
if they worship not a false God, yet they worship a true God falsely; for, He
is a Spirit, and must be worshipped in Spirit, and in Truth. According to the
Truth of the Rule, and in Truth of Heart. Is is not connatural unto man, to
worship a God of his own making, rather than the God that made him?

Those (actually Christ's) are to die unto the Wisdom of the World. As the
Friendship of the World, Job 28.28
is Enmity with God, so the Wisdom of the World, is Folly with God. The fear of
the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil, that is understanding. The men
of the world think themselves very wise; Prove. 26.12.
but, see thou a man wise in his own eyes? there is more hope of a fool, than
of him. The men of the world think themselves, and are thought by others, Jer.
4.22.
to be very wise, but they are wise to do evil, to do good they have no
knowledge. Worldy wisdom, or the wisdom of the world, is the greatest folly
(in) the world: To be witty in sinning; to make a mock at sin; and to make
wickedness our work, is the greatest folly in the world.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die to the Mode of the World. Proverb, as good
out of the World, as out of the Fashion. But, were there ever such Fashions in
the World, as are (now) in the world? Do not Men look like Monsters? Do not
Women look like Harlots? Are we not the Apes of the false French? As obedient
children, not fashioning your selves according to the former lusts in your
ignorance. 1 Pet. 1.14.


Those (actually Christ's) are to die to the Manners of the World. dying to the
Debauchery and Prophanity; to the Adultery and Sodomy; the Idolatry, and
Iniquity of the Times. It was once (sinfully) said, Act. 14.11.
Gods are come down to us in the likeness of men; but, may it not (now) be
said, that Devils are come up unto us in the likeness of men? Do not some men
account Oaths their greatest Rhetoric? Cheating, the greatest Ingenuity?
Atheism, their greatest Art? Rebellion, their greatest Religion? Sin, their
greatest Safety? He that departs from Evil, Isa. 59.15.
makes himself a prey; is accounted mad; Margent.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die to the pleasures of the world. spend, and
end their days in sinful pleasures. They spend their time in mirth, Job 21.13
and in a moment go down to the grave. That word, (If any man will not work,
neither let him eat.) seem to be vanishing now; and most men seem to read it
thus, (If any man will not play, neither let him eat.) Gaming, is much the
Mode; and as men live (in) their sins, so they live (upon) their sins. All the
Income that many have, is their Gaming.

Those (actually Christ's) are to die to the profits of the world. men of the
world, make the world their Business; Prove. 28.22. Jer. 17.11
it is their Element; they make baste to be rich: But, he that gets riches,
and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end
shall be a fool.

DIRECT. III.
ART actually in Christ? Direct. 3. Non mori, sed damnari metuo. Mortem optare
malum, timere pejus. Jer. 20.3.
be not surprised (then) with a (Pannick Fear, concerning the Arrests of the
first Death. I am not afraid to die, but I am afraid to be damned; I am not
afraid of the pains of Death, but I am afraid of the pains of Hell. It was the
word of Henry the fifth, to wish death, is not good, but to fear death is
worse. No man should be afraid to die, but he that is ashamed to live. Thou art
(in) Christ, and do thou fear death? If a soul (in) Christ fear death, what
(then) may a soul (out) of Christ? If a soul (in) Christ dread the shooting of
this Gulf, then a soul (out) of Christ may be a Magor-Missabib; fear round
about. Shall thou fear death, when Christ is thine? consider what he is; He is
a Father, and a Friend; a Foundation, and a Fountain; a God, and a Guide; a
Guard, and a Good; a Rock, and a Portion; to these distinctly.

Fear not Death, for Christ is thine, Father. He is styled the Father of
Eternity. Isa. 9.6.
Whither should the Child go but to the Father? Whither should the Christian go
but to Christ?

But, if Christ be a Father, Quest.
what manner of Father then is Christ to his Children?

What good soever is in any Creature, Sol.
is more eminently in Christ. All the dispersed Excellencies that are
throughout the Universe, meet in Christ, Psalm. 94.9.
and concenter in him. He that planted the Ear, shall not he hear? and he that
formed the Eye, shall not he see? He that gives Ears to others, must needs be
all Ear himself; and he that gives Eyes to others, must needs be all Eye
himself. Take now the Characters, Properties.
and Properties of a (natural) Father, and see how Christ (infinitely)
out-bids, and out-vies such (a natural) Father.

A natural Father pitieth the Child. natural affection, is a sin against
Nature. 2 Samuel 18.5.
A Father pitieth his Child; yea, then most pitieth him, when he stands in
most need of pity. The Father (then) take the greatest Care, when there is the
greatest Cause. When the Child is sick, and weak; under amazing pains, and
amusing pangs; when sickness, and weakness, are (upon) the Child, then there is
the greatest paternal pity, and affection (unto) the Child. Thus, yea
(infinitely more than thus) Christ (as a Father) pitieth his Children. Though
Christ as man (had) a Father, yet Christ as God (is) a Father. Psalm. 103.13.
As a Father pitieth his Children, so Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.

A natural Father provideth for his Child. feeds, 2 Cor. 12.14. Psa. 84.11
and clothes the Child; he takes care of the Child at present; and takes care
of the Child for the future. Thus Christ; He gives grace, and glory; he
provideth for the Soul here, and hereafter: And no good thing will he withold
from them that walk uprightly. He provideth also for the Body.

A natural Father teaches his Child. I know Abraham, Genesis 18.19.
that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall
keep the way of the Lord. Churches, are taught by Christ. As Christ is the
Churches Priest, Mat. 5.1, etc.
and Prince, so Prophet. Christ is the Prophet of Prophets. Christ sat down,
and taught his Disciples.

A natural Father leads his Child. Children need leading; Prove. 8.20
yea, all very (young) Children stand in need of leading. Christ, is the Leader
of the Christian. I lead in the way of righteousness; in the midst of the paths
of Judgment. Though a Child of Nature may go without leading. yet a Child of
Grace cannot. David, was as good as others at going, Psa. 31.3.
and yet he cries for leading. Thou art my Rock, and my Fortress, therefore for
thy names sake lead me, and guide me.

A natural Father counsels his Child. consulteth the Father, 1 King. 2.1, 2,
3.
and is counseled by the Father. When the days of David drew nigh that he
should die, what grave, and gracious counsel did he give to Solomon his Son!
Thus Christ; it is a Dialect becoming a Deity; Isa. 46.10.
My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. Apollo, was the Oracle
of the Heathen, but Christ is the Oracle of the Christian, and he consults
(him) as (his) Oracle.

A natural Father hears his Child. hear a Stranger; hear a Servant; Genesis
22.7, 8. Psa. 34.15
but especially a Son. If Isaac speak, Abraham hears. Thus Christ; the eyes of
Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.

A natural Father loves his Child. Jacob a great love for Benjamin, Genesis
44.30. (...), Romans 8.5.
when the life of the Father was bound up in the life of the Son? But, as a
Feather to a Mountain; as a Spark to the Furnance; as a Drop to the Ocean, so
is the Love of Man, to the Love of God-Man. In due time; or (according to time)
Christ died for the ungodly.

A natural Father corrects his Child. He that spares the rod, hates the
Son, Prove. 13.24. Isa. 57.17.
but he that loves him chasteneth him betimes. Thus Christ For the iniquity of
his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him. Where is the Child but (sometimes)
needs the Rod?

A natural Father prefers his Child. The Son; Servant, has the preferrence.
Mal. 3.17. Cant. 5.2. Voces amatoriae.
I will spare them as a Father his Son that serves him. Thus Christ; He calls
the Church his Love. Open to me my Sister my love, my dove, my undefiled. Are
not these (lofty) and (lovely) Strains of Love? Do not these drop (like
Honey-combs) sweetness of Affection? Is not the Son (next) unto the Father?

A natural Father pardons his Child. Absalom conspireth against David, 2 Samuel
14.33. Luke 7.48.
but the Father pardons the Conspiracy of the Son. Thus Christ; He said to
the City-sinner, Thy sins are forgiven. Sin, must be pardoned, and Christ must
be the pardoner.

Fear not Death, for Christ is thine, Friend. As Christ is the (worst) Foe,
Cant. 5.16.
so he is the (best) Friend. This is my Beloved; and this is my Friend oh
Daughters of Jerusalem.

But, what manner of Friend is Christ? Quest. Sol. 1.


Christ, is a rich Friend. Who can empty the Ocean with a Muscle-shell? It
would (pose) Men, yea (puzzle) Angels, to bring in the riches of Christ. Ephesians.
^.8.
That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
They are not unsearchable in point of seeking, but in point of finding. There
are in Christ deep Riches that cannot be sounded, and rich Deeps that cannot be
exhausted. Christ, is a Mine of Mercy.

Christ is a righteous Friend. Weed in his Garden; no Seam, in his Coat; no
Dross, in his Gold; no Rubbish, in his House; no Leaven, Heb. 4.15
in his Heart. Though he was not temptation-less, yet he was corruption-less;
though he was not sorrow-less, yet he was sin-less.

Christ is a real Friend. Coin. There is a Friend which sticks closer than a
Brother. This, is most true of Christ. Husband and Wife, are one Flesh; Soul
and Body, are one Person; but Friend and Friend are (if I may so write) one
Soul. The Soul of Jonathan was knit with the Soul of David. David had some
(real) Friends, as Jonathan; Hushai, and Ittai; but such Friends (now) seem to
be gone in Pilgrimage, and their Return is very uncertain; Now Christ is a real
Friend. Rev. 1.3.
He is (the) true and faithful witness.

Christ is a ready Friend. ready to give and forgive.

Christ is ready to give. 1 King. 3.5.
Ask what I shall give thee. It is but asking and having; yea sometimes having
without asking. Oh infinite Mercy!

Christ is ready to forgive. Psalm. 86.5.
Christ is a (present) Help; a Help at Hand. Christ is most near, when the
Christian has most need. Thou Lord art good (says the Psalmist) and ready to
forgive.

Christ is a strong Friend. Strength of Israel. He is strong to deliver, and
strong to destroy.

Christ is strong to deliver. Zach. 2.5.
And I says Jehovah will be a wall of fire: not of Mud, though that may be
strong; nor of Brick, though that may be stronger; nor of Stone, though that
may be strongest; but of Fire; a wall of Fire round about her, and of glory in
the midst of her. What Force, or Fury, can be a match for (that) Christ, who is
the Friend of a Christian?

Christ is strong to destroy. and his Host, are drowned, if not damned. The
enemy said, Exodus 15.9, 10.
I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be
satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them: They
say, but God do: Thou did blow with thy wind; the Sea covered them; they sank
like lead in the mighty waters.

Christ is a loving; yea, everloving Friend. Prove. 17.17.
A Friend loves at all times, and a Brother is born for adversity. Such a
Friend is Christ, who as he can as soon cease to be God as cease to be good, so
he can as soon cease to live, as cease to love. His Essence and Attributes, are
of the same continuance, and will not admit of termination.

Christ is a lasting; yea everlasting Friend. Men, mutable, and mortal, Rev.
1.8, 11.
but Christ is an immutable, and immortal Friend. He is Alpha and Omega;
Beginning and End; First and Last.

Fear not Death, for Christ is thine, Foundation. A Foundation is the Basis,
and Bottom of the Fabric. The whole Stress of the Fabric lays upon the^
Foundation. Behold, Isa 28.16. Quest. Sol. 1.
I lay in Sion for a Foundation a stone; a tried Stone etc.

But what manner of Foundation is Christ?

Christ is an ancient Foundation. Christ, may plead Antiquity. He was (before)
the World, Pro. 8.23.
for he (made) the World. The World was made by him. I was set up from
everlasting.

Christ is a perfect Foundation. Christ must needs be perfect, for he is the
Persecte^. Heb. 10.14.
He is the Finisher, as well as the Author of Faith; of all Grace. By once
offering of himself, he has for ever perfected those that are sanctified.

Christ is a suitable Foundation. Bread suitable for the hungry? is not Water,
suitable for the thirsty? Christ is the Bread of Life, and Water of Life. Is not
that a mighty word? Col. 2.10.
Ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality, and power.

Christ is a Safe Foundation. He, Christ for Foundation, shall dwell on high;
Isa. 33.16.
his place of defense shall be the munition of rocks; bread shall be given him,
and his Waters shall be sure

Christ is a lovely Foundation. Chrict, Can. 5.10.
is a Beauty without a Spot, Absalom, was a Black to this Beauty. He is White
and Red.

Christ is a precious Foundation. Christ was sold for thirty pieces of Silver,
Prove. 3.15
yet he was invaluable. He is more precious than Rubies.

Christ is a living Foundation. He, that has the Son, 1 John 5.12.
has life, but he that has not the Son of God, has not life.

Christ is a lasting Foundation. Foundations, of material Fabrics, may rot and
decay, Rev. 1.18.
but (this) Foundation will not; cannot. Christ is a lasting, yea, an
everlasting Foundation. I am he that was dead, and am alive and live for
evermore.

Christ is a tried Foundation. tried to purpose; tried to the Life; tried to
the Death. He was obedient unto death, Phil. 2.8.
even the death of the Cross.

Christ is the Sole Foundation. Other foundation can no man lay, 1 Cor. 3.11.
than that already laid, which is Jesus Christ.

Fear not Death, Christ is thine, and he is a Fountain. With thee is the
Fountain of Life. These words are metaphorical, and may not the Psalmist (here)
allude unto One, or All these three things? Waters; Metals; Veins.

Waters. flow from a Fountain. There is the Fountain, 1 John 5.11.
and the Stream; the Stream, is fed by the Fountain; flow, from the Fountain.
Thus Life, flows from Christ. This life is in his Son.

Metals. Fountain, or Veins of Life's. All Mineral Veins; the Veins of Gold, and
Silver; the Veins of Lead, and of Iron; they lay (as it were) in Bank; in the
Bosom, and Bowels of the Earth. Col. 3.3.
Thus, Life, lies hid in Christ. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
Christ in God.

Veins. Veins of the Body (as so many Rivers) derive their Blood from the red
Sea in Man, which is the Liver of Man. Thus, Christ, is the Ocean of Life, and
All that live, are filled with Life (from) Him. Col. 3.4.
When he who is our life shall appear, then shall we (also) appear with him in
glory. Thus, Christ is Life.

But what manner of Fountain is (this) Christ? Quest. Sol. 1.


Christ, is a living Fountain. Many, complain of their deadness, and all have
cause enough so to do: Oh (says One) I am dead in the Country! dead in the
City! Oh (says another) I am dead in the Church! dead in the Closet! Soul,
Christ is the Fountain of Life, and (this) Christ is (thy) Christ. They have
forsaken the Lord, Jer. 17.13
the fountain of living waters.

Christ is a loving Fountain. Christ is the Fountain of Life, so of Love.
Christ's Love is a Loadstone; 1 John 4.19.
it has in it a magnetic and attractive Virtue. His Love, is the Cause of
Ours; Our Love, the Effect of His. We love him, because he first loved us. We
cannot love, until loved.

Christ is a lighting Fountain. Fountain of Life, and of Love, so of Light. In
thy light shall we see light. As the Firmamental Sun, so the Sun of
Righteousness is (purely) seen in his own Light. Oh (say the Soul) I am in the
dark concerning promises! in the dark concerning providence! But, Soul, Christ
is the Fountain of Light, and (this) Christ, is (thy) Christ. Joh. 8.12.
I am the light of the world.

Christ is a pure Fountain. Water, Fountain, is pure; purely pure. Christ, must
needs be a Fountain pure, for he is a Fountain set open for the impure. In that
day; what day? The day of the Messiahs coming into the world; In that day,
Zach. 13.1.
there shall be a fountain opened to the House of Jacob, and to the Inhabitants
of Jerusalem, for sin, and for uncleanness. Or, for sin, and for separation
from uncleanness.

Christ is a peaceable Fountain. Christ is the Fountain of Life and Love; of
Light and Purity, so of Peace. Joh. 16.33.
If a man would have peace of Conscience (which is an Anticipation of Glory) he
must go to Christ for it. In me ye shall have peace. How prodigious soever the
winds be, and impetuous soever the waves be, yet in Christ (for those who are
Christ's) there is peace. Oh (say the Soul) my life is Chequer-work! I have my
Tones of sorrow, with my Tvnes of joy; but, Soul, sorrow not as one without
hope, for thou art Christ's, and in (him) there is peace for (his.)

Christ is a free Fountain. Wine, and Milk, may be had without Money, and
without Price. Is this thy Cry? Oh that one would give me a crum of the Bread
of Lift! Rev. 21.6.
a drop of the Water of Life! I will give to him that is ^thirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely. What freer than Gift?

Christ is a full Fountain. Christ, water for Quality and Quantity, Col. 2.9.
is ever the same. In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead personally.

Christ is an invisible Fountain. Fountain is not for every eye; Heb. 11.27.
it is only for the eye of Faith. Thus Moses saw him who is invisible.

Christ is an immutable Fountain. Men, are not the same, but Christ is. Herod,
hears John, and yet beheads him. Heb. 13.8
Saul, courts David one day, and seeks to kill him the next; but Christ is the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever.

Christ is an incomparable Fountain. Christ, had the perfection of Grace as
God, and the perfection of Nature as Man. Isa. 46.5.
To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be
like? Christ has not his second.

Christ is an inexhaustible Fountain. Ore, is never goldless; this Sun, is
never lightless; this Ocean, Ephesians. 3.8.
is never waterless. That I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable
riches of Christ.

Fear not Death, Christ is thine, and he is a God. What of a Christ is not
called into Question? That Christ is God, I shall endeavor to evince from
plain and positive Texts and Truths; from gracious, and glorious Appellations,
and Titles; from probable, and promising Arguments, and Reasons.

From plain, Texts, and Truths. Thy Throne (oh God) is for ever, Psa. 45.6.
Heb. 1.8.
and ever. That this is spoken of Christ, is evident: But unto the Son he
says, Thy Throne (oh God) is for ever and ever. Let this mind be in you which
was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God: (...), Phil. 2.5, 6
The word here (Form) signifies an essential, and substantial Form: Christ was
in the form of God; i.e. he was in the Nature and Essence of God: or, in the
Glory, and Majesty of God: And thought it not Robbery to be equal with God.
Once more; My Lord, Joh. 20.28.
and my God. These places are unanswerable proofs of the Deity and Divinity of
Christ.

From gracious, and glorious Appellations, Titles.

Christ is called I AM. Before Abraham was, But what is this I AM? Joh. 8.58.
This is one of the names of God, this is proper to God, and with this name was
Moses sent to the children of Israel. I AM, has sent me unto you. Exo. 3.14
Now this name I AM, takes in all time past, present, and to come, which
speaks Christ to be a God.

Christ is called the chiefest (or Standard Bearer) among ten thousand. Cant.
5.10
Now Standard-bearers are choice men; Elect of the multitude.

Christ is called a great God. Looking for the blessed hope, and glorious
appearing of the great God, Tit. 2.13.
and our Savior Jesus Christ. Not (only) God, and great God, but also (the)
great God.

Christ is called the true God. This is the true God, and eternal life. Not a
false, but a true God; 1 John 5.20.
not an Impostor, as the Jews call him; nor a less Prophet than Mahomet, as the
Turks call him; nor a feigned God among the Gentiles, as the blind, and the
bloody Papists call him; but (the) true God, and eternal life; being the Author
of it, and the Donor of it; the God of it, and the Giver of it.

Christ is called God over all. Romans 9.5. Oecumenius; (...)
who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. Christ, is over all; over Angels;
over Saints; over Devils. Is not this a (pregnant) proof for the Deity, and
Divinity of Christ? Blush (said one) for shame, and be thou confounded (oh thou
wretched miscreant Arrius) when thou hear Christ (by the Apostle) glorified
with the Title of God, in the singular number, and with the Article Ho (the)
God, (that) God, and yet denyest his Deity: who is over all (the) or (that)
God, blessed for ever. Amen. What more legible than the Deity of Christ in this
place, with many other places?

Christ is called a mighty God. Gi^d thy Sword upon thy thigh oh most mighty!
He is mighty; Psa. 45.3.
yea (most) mighty. There comes one after me mightier than I. Jesus, was
mightier than John? What is a Pharaoh? a Sennacherib? a Mounsieur to this
(mighty) Christ? Psa. 89.15
All Nations unto him are but as the drop of a bucket. What is Man to God? I
have laid help upon one that is mighty. Yea, Christ is an Almighty God. Rev.
1.8.
I am Alpha and Omega, The beginning, and the ending, says the Lord: which is,
and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

Christ is called the only wise God. 25. Verse of Judes Epistle.
Christ is wiser than men; wiser than Angels; the wisdom of Men; the wisdom of
Angels; the wisdom of God; the God of wisdom.

Christ is called the End of the Law for righteousness. Romans 10.4.
He is the End of the Law for righteousness to every one that believes. Thus
he is in respect of Nation, whether Jew, or Gentile; in respect of Sex, whether
Man, or Woman; in respect of Age, whether Green or Gray; in respect of Degree,
whether a Man in his Rags, or a Man in his Robes.

Christ is called the Image of the invisible God. Christ is exactly like unto
God. Col. 1.15.
Who is the Image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature.

Christ is called the Desire of Nations. Nation, Hag. 2.7.
that is the Desire of (every) Nation? Christ is the Desire of all that are (
actually) his in all Nations. I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all
nations shall come.

Christ is styled the Savior of the World. 1 John 4.14.
Now, who below a God can save a Man?

Christ is styled King of Saints. Rev. 15.3.
thou King of Saints. Christ, has a Kingdom (in) this World, though his
Kingdom be not (of) this World. Christ, has a Kingdom, and his Saints are the
Subjects of (his) Kingdom.

Christ is King of Kings, Lord of Lords. The Kings of Tarshish, Rev. 17.14.
Psalm. 72.10, 11.
and of the Isles, shall bring presents; the Kings of Sheba, and Seba, shall
offer gifts; yea, all Kings shall fall down before him; all nations shall serve
him. As Christ is King of Saints, and of Sion, so he is to be King of Nations.

Christ is the Father of Eternity. (as God) is from Eternity, and the Father of
Eternity. Abi Gnad. Isa. 9.6.
His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the
Everlasting Father, (the Father of Eternity, so the Hebrew) the Prince of Peace.

Christ is (the Bread of Life. is not (only) Bread, and Bread of Life, Joh.
6.48.
but (also) by way of Emphasis (the) or (that) Bread of Life

Christ is (the) Water of Life. Rev. 21.6.
of the fountain of the water of life freely. Now, is not he God, who is the
Bread of Life, and Water of Life?

Christ is called the Rock of Ages. (was) the Rock for Old Testament Saints, 1
Cor. 10.4.
and Christ (is) the Rock for New Testament Saints. They all drank of that
Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.

Christ is called Emmanuel. (and yet with child) shall bring forth a Son, Mat.
1.23.
and his name shall be called Emmanuel, which (being interpreted) is, God with
us. As God (for) Us, so God (with) Us.

Christ is called Jesus. Mat. 1.21.
This name ( Jesus) is originally Hebrew, and it is a sweet word; a word
sweetly sweet. Had it not been much better for Thee, and for Me, not to have
had (a) Name, than for Us not to believe in (this) Name? This Name is Honey in
the Mouth; Music in the Ear; a Jubilee in the Heart.

Christ is called Jehovah. great, and a good Name? What Mortal (though the
greatest Rhetorician) is able to express the greatness and goodness of (this)
Name? Jer. 23.6.
In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is
the name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our Righteousness. Now, do not
these various Titles speak Christ to be a God?

From probable and promising Arguments and Reasons.

He (from whom Salvation is) must be God, Salvation is, therefore Christ is
God. Psalm. 68.20.
He that is our God, is the God of salvation, and unto God the Lord belong the
Issues from death. Salvation is a sweet word to a dark, and doubting soul; to a
desponding and despairing soul, and (this) Salvation is from Christ. There is
salvation in none other. Say unto my soul, Psalm. 35.3.2
I am thy salvation.

He (who is the Object of Faith) must be God, Christ is the Object of Faith,
therefore Christ is God. Let not your hearts be troubled, Joh. 14.1.
ye believe in God, believe also in me. Not that Christ commands, or approves a
Stoical Apathy, as if his Disciples should put off natural affection, and be
troubled at nothing; but he would not have their hearts like water muddied, and
stirred; not full of vehement commotion, and perturbation, as the Greek word
signifies: Let not your hearts be (thus) troubled; ye believe in God, believe
(also) in Me. Romans 3.26.
The person of Christ, is the Object of Faith. That he might be just, and the
justifier of him that believes in Jesus.

He (who is the Life of His) must Himself needs be God; Christ is the Life of
His, therefore Christ is God. Joh. 11.25
I am the Resurrection, and the Life. The life of Nature, of Grace, and of
Glory, are from Christ; Col. 3.4.
When he who is our life shall appear.

He (who is Life to Himself) must be God; Christ is Life to Himself, therefore
Christ is God. I am he that was dead, Rev. 1.18.
and am alive, and behold I live for evermore. God (as Father) has
communicated unto Christ (as Son) his whole Essence. Joh. 5.26.
As the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life
in himself.

He (that can turn Water into Wine, heal with a word) must be God; but thus
Christ did, therefore Christ is God. Satan (may) work wonders, and Magicians
(by the help of Satan) (did) work wonders, but miracles are out of the sphere
of Satan. A miracle is a rare work; John. 2.9, 11. Joh. 4.50, 54.
apparently wrought by the power of God, far above Nature, and all (natural)
causes. Christ turned Water into Wine, and this is called a miracle. Christ
(also) healed with a word; for he said unto the Nobleman, Go thy way, thy Son
lives: This (also) is called a miracle. Now, is not this Christ a God?

He (that was before all things) must be God; Christ was before all things,
therefore Christ is. God. I was set up from everlasting. Pro. 8.23.
In (time) Christ ^vas sent out, but from (everlasting) was Christ set up. He
is before all things, Col. 1.17.
and by him all things consist.

He (that is Gods Fellow) must needs be God; Christ is God's Fellow, therefore
Christ is God. Awake, oh sword, against my Shepherd, Zach. 13.7
and against the man that is my fellow, says the Lord of Hosts; smite the
Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. (...). Proximum meum.
My Fellow; my Citizen; so the Septuagint. My nearest; that is next unto Me; so
Junius. Thus, Christ is; he is nearest unto God; his Session is at the right
hand of God: He is next unto God; Father, and then Son. Mark 14.27.
That this place is (principally) to be understood of Christ, is evident by the
Evangelist; For it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall
be scattered.

He (who gave a Resurrection to Himself, God; but Christ gave a Resurrection to
Himself, therefore Christ is God. Joh. 2.19, 21.
Christ (told the Jews) that he would give himself a corporal, and numerical
Resurrection; Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up; but
he spoke of the Temple of his body. When (therefore) ye read that God raised
him from the dead (as ye often may) ye may (then) understand it of the Deity.
Christ (also) seems to insinuate this, when (speaking of his Life) he says, I
have power to lay it down, Joh. 10.18.
and I have power to take it up again.

He (that can give a Resurrection to others) must be God; but Christ can give a
Resurrection to others, Christ is God. Lazarus, come forth, Joh. 11.43, 44.
and he that was bound came forth. That Christ (did) raise, is evident; that
Christ (will) raise, is as evident: This is the will of him that sent me, Joh.
6.40.
that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting
life, and I will raise him up at the last day.

He (that made all things) must be God; Christ made all things, therefore
Christ is God. All things were made by him, Joh. 1.3.
and without him was not any thing made, that was made. None can create but God
only. Though Christ be less than the Father in respect of his Humanity, yet he
is equal unto the Father in respect of his Divinity, Jer. 10.11
for all things were made by him. The Gods that have not made the Heavens and
the Earth, even they shall perish from the Earth, and from under these Heavens.

He (unto whom divine Adoration is due) must be God; Christ divine Adoration is
due therefore Christ is God. Mat. 4.10
This Doctrine, Christ hims;elf preached to Satan; Thou shall worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shall thou serve. As if Christ had said, Satan, thou art
not God, therefore I must not worship Thee to get all the world. Acts 14.13,
14, 15
And, as Satan must not, so Man must not be worshipped: Not Magistrates; not
Ministers; Paul and Barnabas would not be worshipped. Rev. 22.8, 9.
And, as Men must not, so Angels must not be worshipped: They are
fellow servants;

He (who is Omniscient) must be God; Joh. 21.17.
but Christ is Omniscient, therefore Christ is God. Lord, thou know all
things. Christ knows all things, as if he had but one thing to know. He
knows all things done in Romish-Conclaves, and in English-Cabals. Come, Joh.
4.29.
see a man that told me all things that ever I did, is not (this) the Christ?

He (who is Omnipotent) must be God; Christ is Omnipotent, Matthew. 28.18.
therefore Christ is God. All power in Heaven, and in Earth, is devolved upon
Christ. Christ is the power of God; yea, the God of power. The Lord God
Omnipotent reigns. Rev. 19.6.
This power can overpower all power.

He (who is Omnipresent) must be God; Psa. 139.7 Hic and ubique, (...), Ephesians.
4.10.
but thus Christ is, therefore Christ is God. Whither shall I go from thy
Spirit? or, whither shall I flee from thy presence? Christ (as God) is Here,
and every where. He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all
Heavens: To what end? That he might fill, or fulfill all things; for the Greek
word signifies both. He is ascended far above all visible Heavens, into that
Heaven which is invisible to us on Earth: But to what end? In order to the
filling of Heaven and Earth with his presence; in order (also) to a fulfilling
of all the Prophecies concerning Himself.

He (who is All in All) must be God; Christ is All in All; therefore Christ is
God. Col. 3.11.
Where there is neither Jew, nor Greek, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but
all things, and in all things, Christ. Thus, Christ is the way (from) the
Father, and the way (to) the Father.

Christ is the way (from) God to the Soul. Isa. 49.6.
that thou may be my salvation to the ends of the earth.

Christ is the way (for) the Soul to God. Joh. 14.6.
no man comes unto the Father but by me. If Christ be thus, then he is God.

He (that shall come from Heaven waited by Angels, 2 These. 1.7. (...)
and whose Voice shall raise the dead) must be God; but (thus) Christ shall
come, and (do) at his coming. He shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty
Angels. The Angels of his power; Greek. And (that his Voice shall raise the
dead) is as evident: Marvel not at this, Why? Joh. 5.28, 29.
for the hour is coming, and new is, when all that are in the graves shall
hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good to the
Resurrection of life, and they that dave done evil to the Resurrection of
damnation.

He (who is all Eye) must be God; Christ is all Eye, therefore Christ is God.
Christ is all Eye, Bernardus non vidit emnia. Joh. 1.48. Act. 9.11.
and sees all things, as if he had but one thing to see. When thou wast under
the fig tree I saw thee. Man sees not all things, but Christ does; He is light
of life, and life of light: As he saw Nathaniel under the Fig Tree, so he saw
Paul in the Closet: Go, for behold he prays. Bernard had a film upon his Eye,
but Christ has none; he sees all things at once.

He (who is all Ear) must be God; Ear, therefore Christ is God. This poor man
cried, Psalm. 34.6.
and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. Though Christ
be in Heaven, he can hear thee in a wood; hear thee in a wilderness; hear thee
in the Church, or in the Closet; hear thee in the City, or in the Country; hear
thee upon a Common, or in a Cottage. Psalm. 34.15.
The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their
cry. Christ is all Ear, and hears all things, as if he had but one thing to
hear.

He (that can forgive sin) must be God; Christ can forgive sin, Mark 2.5.
therefore Christ is God. Who can forgive sins but God only? Pardon of sin, is
a singular mercy of the plural number, Aug. Psa. 103.3
to a convinced and converted soul; to a desponding and despairing soul; to a
distressed, and deserted soul. Lord (says one) here beat me, or buffet me;
here break me, or banish me; here bleed me, or burn me, so thou will
(hereafter) save me. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities.

He (that shall judge the world) must be God; but Christ shall judge the world,
Christ is God. The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to
the Son. Joh. 5.22.
Ah! how amazing, and amusing, how confounding, and consternating, will that
Day be, when He who is another Savior, shall be thy Judge? He has given him
authority to execute Judgment also, Joh. 5.27.
because he is the Son of Man. Christ, is such a Judge, as that the power of
the powerfullest cannot daunt; the wealth of the wealthiest cannot bribe; the
wit of the wittiest cannot delude. Christ, is such a Judge, as that there is no
appealing (from) his Sentence, nor repealing (of) his Sentence. I charge thee
therefore before God, 2 Timothy 4.1.
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, at his
appearing, and his Kingdom. Now He (who is Judge) is God, but Christ is Judge,
therefore Christ is God.

Fear not Death, Christ is thine, and he is a Guide. Christ, is a person of the
greatest Conduct, and those (actually his) are under his conduct, from Earth to
Heaven; from Grace to Glory. That Christ is the Leader of his, Joh. 10.3.
is evident: He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. That
Christ is the Leader of his from Earth to Heaven; from grace to glory, Rev.
7.17.
is as evident: The Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them to living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes. In Heaven there are Triumphs without Tears, and Tunes of
Joy without Tones of Sorrow. Psa. 73.24
Thou shall guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.

But what manner of Guide is Christ? Quest. Sol. 1.


Christ is an incomparable Guide. Some have been excellent for conduct: for
conduct at Sea; for conduct at Land; but Christ exceeds, and excels all. No
wonder (now) ye have that negative precept; Trust ye not in a friend, Mich. 7.5.
put ye not confidence in a Guide; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that
lies in thy bosom.

Christ is a careful Guide. careful of Souls, as Christ was. Oh how careful was
he of the Jews! Why will ye die oh house of Israel? Is it not enough that (I)
die, but will (ye) die also? Let me die, that ye may live; let me be crucified,
that ye may be crowned; let me be made a curse, that ye may have a crown. Why
will ye die, oh house of Israel? Oh how careful was Christ of the man that fell
among Thieves! Luke 10.33, 34, 35.
He bound up his wounds; poured in Oil and Wine; set him upon his own Beast;
brought him to an Inn; paid his Reckoning; took care of him at present, and
(also) for the future.

Christ is a gracious Guide. leads not in a way of sin, but in a way of grace;
not in a way of unrighteousness, but in a way of righteousness. Prove. 8.20
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of Judgment.
Christ leads in foul, as well as in fair ways, and in foul, as well as in
fair weather.

Christ is a gentle Guide. Gentleness in a Mother, to lead a sick, and a weak
child, that there is in Christ to lead a sick, and a weak Christian. He shall
feed his flock like a Shepherd: is here all? Isa. 40.11
No, He shall gather the Lambs with his arm: is here all? No, He shall carry
them in his bosom: is here all? No, And shall gently lead those that are with
young.

Christ is a peaceable Guide. leads in his own ways, and they are ways of
pleasantness; and in his own paths, and they are paths of peace. Luke 1.79.
Christ came to give light to them that did sit in darkness, and in the shadow
of death, and to guide their feet into the way of peace. Christ leads (unto)
and (after) Himself, and He is the peace of His.

Christ is a profitable Guide. leads the soul (unto) the Gates, Psalm. 23.1,
2. Marg.
and then passes the soul (through) the Gates into the City. Christ leads by
(still) waters, unto (fresh) pastures. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not
want: He makes me to lie down in pastures of tender grass; he leads me
beside the waters of quietness.

Christ is a desirable Guide. Titus called the Desire of Mankind? Psa. 73.25
what may a Jesus then be called? Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is
none upon Earth that I desire besides thee. There is nothing in Christ but what
is truly desirable, and there is nothing truly desirable but what is in Christ.

Christ is a delectable Guide. Voice has a mighty, yea an almighty Influence.
Christ did but speak for Matthew, Mat. 9.9.
and he had him. He saw Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto
him, Matthew, follow me; And he arose, and followed him. If Christ calls to
come, he causes to come.

Christ is a prudential Guide. David was wise as a Man, Pro. 8.14.
but Christ is wise as a God. Solomon was wiser than all men, but Christ is
wiser than all Angels. Is not that a (lofty) as well as a (lovely) Strain? I am
Understanding.

Christ is a gradual Guide. Growth in Grace, is emblem'd by the waters of the
Sanctuary, and Christ leads in Sanctuary-waters. Ezekiel. 47.3, 4, 5.
The waters were first to the Ancles; then to the Knees; then to the Loins;
then a River that could not be passed over. Now, those (actually) Christ's, are
under a gradual leading of Christ from one degree of grace to another.

Christ is a regular Guide. Christ leads rightly; yea in a way of Rightness.
The Serpent led^eth a wrong way, but the Son leads a right way. If Christ
leads to binding; to bleeding; to banishing; to burning, yet he leads (his)
a right way; for he leads them into Heaven. If Christ leads through the Red
Sea, and through the wilderness, yet he leads a right way; for he leads
(his) into Canaan. Though Christ leads by the Cross, yet he leads unto the
Crown; and though he leads through a Cottage, yet he leads unto a Palace;
unto a Paradise. God did not lead the children of Israel through the way of the
Land of the Philistines (though that was near) but he led them about through
Exodus 13.17, 18.
the way of the wilderness of the red Sea; and yet he led them a right way,
This was (Gods) way, and (his) way, is a right way. Hos. 14.9.
As the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them; so Christ
leads a right way; for though he leads (his) unto the Grave, yet he leads
(his) unto Glory.

Christ is a continual Guide. lead thee yesterdey? he will lead thee to day:
Does he lead the to day? he will lead the for ever; for yesterday, to day, and
for ever, he is the same. Many persons imbitter their sweets; add to their own
Burdens; dig their own Graves, by (anticipating) providence, and not
reflecting that truth; Mat. 6.34.
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. Oh (says one) what shall I do
when Poverty and Prison come? Oh (says another) what shall I do when the Sword
and the Plague come? Oh (says a third) what shall I do when Fire and Famine
come? Oh (says a fourth) what shall I do when the Rack and thee Stake come?
But, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof: He that (now) leads, will
(then) lead, if these things come before thou go off the Stage. Isa. 58.11.
Marg.
The Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy Soul in drought; and
make fat thy bones; thou shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of
water, whose waters (lie, or deceive) not.

Fear not Death, for he is thine, and he is a Guard. (so Junius and the Greek,
and the Hebrew.) Zach. 2.5.
And I (says Jehovah) will be a wall of Fire round about her, and of Glory in
the midst of her. Who will adventure upon a wall of Fire; Psa. 125.2
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem (to fortify and defend that) so
Jehovah is round about his People (to fortify and defend them) from
henceforth, and for ever.

But here are two Questions ( How and Why) Christ is a wall of Fire, Quest.
or Security, unto his Church?

But how is Christ a wall of Fire, or Security, How.
to his Church and People?

In a twofold respect; his Justice, and his Mercy. Sol.


In respect of his Justice. It is Justice to give every man his due, or his
own. Justitia est, suum cuique tribuere. Act. 1.25.
Hell, is a Sinners own; this He has merited: The wages of sin is death; The
first, and the second Death. Judas went to his own place. And, as He^ is a
Sinners own, so Heaven is a Saints own; this Christ has merited. I give unto
them eternal ase. Eternal life is made up of Grace, and of Glory; this life
Christ gives as his Mercy, Joh. 10.28
and as his Merit. Persons are (variously) bound; some (through grace) are
bound for Heaven, but most (through sin) are bound for Hell; now, it is a
righteous thing with Christ, to send persons to (various) ports, according as
they are (varionsly) bound. Mat. 25.46.
These (those on the left hand) shall go into everlasting punishment, but the
rightcous (those on the right hand) into use everlasting. Justice is one of
Christ's Attributes, and he is infinite in Attribute, as well as in Essence;
Now, if he should lose one Attribute, might he not lose every Attribute, and so
cease to be God? 2 These. 1.6.
It is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to those that
trouble you. It is most agreeable to Justice, that the persecuting) should not
go unpunished; and that the (persecuted) should be righted in (another) world,
who suffer, and can have no right in (this) world.

In respect of his Mercy. is more merciful, than His can be sinful. The Mercy
of Him is a larger Territory than the Iniquity of His. Romans 5.20, 21.
The Law entered, that the Offense might abound; but where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound; That as sin reigned unto death, so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Mercy, as it
is (Man's) Mirror, so it is (Christ's) Motive, Mich. 7.18.
and Element, for he delights in Mercy. If his children forsake my Law, and
walk not in my Judgments; If they break my Statutes, and keep not my
Commandments; Psalm. 89.30, 31, 32, 33.
what then? must they lie down in sorrow now? must they go to Hell now? No:
Then will I visit their transgression with the Rod, and their iniquity with
stripes; Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor
suffer my faithfulness to fail. Christ, had rather draw Lines of Love, than of
Wrath; and write in Honey, than in Gall. Christ's Mercy, is as aged, and
long-lifed, as Himself. The mercy of Jehovah is from eternity, to eternity,
upon them that fear him, Psalm. 103.17.
and his righteousness unto childrens children. Now, if ye reflect the Justice
of Christ, or the Mercy of Christ, he is a wall of Fire, or Security, to the
Church of the firstborn, whose names are written in Heaven. A wall of Fire,
round about her.

Why. But why is Christ a wall of Fire, Quest. 2.
or Security, to his Church, and People?

Because it is his pleasure so to be. Reas. 1. Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro
ratione voluntas.
That is too lofty a Strain for any below a Christ; As I will, so I command; my
will, shall stand for a Law. Christ, is God, and his will is his Rule. Is not
that a high, as well as a holy Strain? Father, I will, that those which thou
have given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou
have given me. Is not this a Kingly Strain? Father, I will. Joh. 17.24. Mat.
8.2, 3, 4.
The Leper comes to Christ, and says, Lord, if thou will, thou can make me
clean: Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will, be thou
clean: And immediately his Leprosy was cleansed.

Because, it is his promise to be so. Christ, promised to keep his Church, and
he will keep his promise. Ia that day, Isa. 27.2, 3
cry ye to her a Vineyard of red Wine; I Jehovah do keep it, I will water it
every moment; ^est any hurt it, I will keep it night and day. Not, super hunc
Petrum, but super hanc Petram. Mat. 16.18.
All time, is divided into Night, and Day; Night, and Day, comprehend all Time.
For Christ then to keep his Church Night, and Day, is, for Christ to keep it
constantly; continually, and without intermission. Thou art Peter; thou art a
Fisherman; at best, but a Fisher of men; and upon this Rock; not upon this
Peter, but upon my Self, will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell (all the
power and policy of Hell) shall not prevail against it. Here, is promise, as
well as pleasure.

Christ, will be a wall of Fire to His, Jewels. Will not a man (that is not
defective in his prudentials) secure his Jewels? Mal. 3.17.
They shall be mine in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will spare them
as ^ Father his Son that serves him. If an House be on Fire, the Owner of it
will first take care of his Wife, and Children; then of his Jewels, and last of
all, of his Lumber, and Rubbish. Christ, Psa. 135.4
secures (first) his people, for they are his Jewels; the world, is but Lumber
and Ruhbish. As Christ has a People, and a Treasure, so it is a peculiar
People, and Treasure. For the Lord has chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel
for his peculiar Treasure.

The Relation between Christ, Church, call for this, and carry the reason of
it. Christ, and his Church, are inwardly, and intimately related; therefore
will he be a wall of Fire round about her. He that sanctifies, Heb. 2.11.
and they who are sanctified, are all one; of one piece, of one pedigree; of
one family; having one and the same Father. Go (said Christ to Mary) and say to
the Brethren, Joh. 20.17.
I ascend to my Father; and your Father; to my God, and your God.

The Appellations of Christ, Church, call for this, and carry the reason of it.

1. Church is Christ's Love, and Christ is the Churches Beloved. That the Church
is Christ's Love is evident: I have forsaken mine house; I have left my
heritage; Jer. 12.7.
I have given the Love of my Soul (so the Margent) into the hands of her
enemies. That Christ, Cant. 2.10
is the Churches Beloved, is as evident. My Beloved spoke, and said unto me,
rise up my Love, my fair one, and come away.

Christ, Head, and the Church is the Body. For the Husband is the Head of the
Wife, Ephesians. 5.23.
even as Christ is the Head of the Church. And, as Christ is Head, so the
Church is Body. Ephesians. 1.22, 23.
Has given him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body,
the fullness of him that fills all in all. It is not the Prince, nor the Pope,
but Christ that is Head of a Church Evangelically constituted.

Christ, Foundation, and the Church is Fabric. 1 Cor. 3.11. Psa. 23.6.
That Christ is Foundation, is legible. Other Foundation can no man lay, than
that already laid, which is Jesus Christ. That the Church is Fabric, is as
legible. I will dwell in the House of the Lord for ever.

Christ is the Husband, Church is Spouse. That Christ is Husband, Isa. 54.5
is apparent. Thy Maker, is thy Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name, and thy
Redeemer the holy One of Israel, the God of the whole Earth shall he be called.
That the Church is Spouse, is as apparent. Come hither, Rev. 21.9.
and I will show thee the Bride, the Lambs Wife. Now, is Christ the Lover, and
will he not secure his Love? Is Christ Head, and will he not secure his Body?
Is Christ Foundation, and will he not secure his Fabric? Is Christ the
Husband, and will he not secure his Wife? Will he not be a wall of Fire round
about his Church, and People?

If any shall Object, Obj.
is Christ a wall of Fire to Christians, when Christians burn to Ashes in the
fire? This, is strange, and it is a Paradox indeed.

As it is true, this is a Paradox, it is as true, Sol.
that it is an Orthodox-Paradox. Though Christ be not always a wall of Fire
about the Bodies, and Baskets of His, yet he always is about the Hearts and
Souls of His. Blessed Bainam (that Maryan-Martyr) in the midst of the Flames,
called, Oh ye Papists, ye look for Miracles; here is one; though half my Legs,
and half my Arms are burned, yet (in this Fire) I feel no more pain, than if I
were in a Bed of Down, and it is unto me as a Bed of Roses. Now, though those
(actually Christ's) may be banished, yet not damned; though burned, yet not
damned. Romans 8.1.
There is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.

Fear not Death; for Christ, is Thine, Good. The Lord is good, his Mercy is
everlasting, Psa. 100.5.
and his Truth endures from generation, to generation. Now, Christ, is Lord.
The Lord said unto my Lord. Luke 17.5.
The Father said unto the Son. The Apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our
Faith. Praise ye the Lord, for the Lord is good. Or according to the Hebrew;
Praise ye Jah, for Jehovah is good; or Goodness. Now, Christ, Halelu-jah ki tob
Jehovah. Psa. 135.3 Jer. 23.6.
has this name of Jehovah also. In his days, Judah shall be saved, and Israel
shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah
our Righteousness. Christ, is good; very good; a great good; the greatest good.

But what manner of Good, is this good Christ? Quest. Sol. 1.


Christ, is a substantial Good. He* who is a Soul Good, must needs be a
substantial Good; but Christ is a Soul Good, and the Soul of every Good. He,
who is All (from) the Father; (to) the Father, and (with) the Father, must
Himself be a Soul Good; but thus Christ is. Mat. 3.17.
This is my beloved Son, in whom I acquiesce. Creatures, are good, as they come
(from) God; are enjoyed (with) God; are improved (for) God; but, these lesser
and lower things, these dirty, and drossy things, are not a Soul good,
abstracted from Christ. Christ, is not a shadowy, but a substantial good. The
Psalmist (speaking of some that had a full Table, and a full Cup; that had an
Affluence, and Confluence of these poor, and perishing things) call them happy:
Psalm. 144.12, 13, 14, 1^.
Happy is the people that is in such a case: This is a kind of happiness, and
this goes for happiness, with those that cannot see through this world, and
graciously take a prospect of that within the Vail; but then there is another,
and a better happiness opposed, and interposed. Yea, happy, or (blessed) is
that people, whose God is Jehovah. The other, is the shadow of Happiness; the
shell of Happiness; the show of Happiness; this, is a real, and substantial
Happiness; our Felicity, is bound up in our propriety in God, and Christ; in
God, through Christ.

Christ, essential Good. Christ, is good as God, Bonum complexum. Psa. 136.2
Mat. 19.19.
for He is God. Christ, is a complex Good, a complicated Good. Christ, is God;
yea, the God of Gods. O give thanks unto the God of Gods! for his mercy
endures for ever. Now, God, is (so) good, that he (only) is said to be good.
Why cal^est thou me good? there is none good but one, that is God. If thou do
not acknowledge me to be God, why call thou me good? for, God is essentially
good; originally good; the Original of good.

Christ, impartial good. Christ, is no respecter of persons; Acts 10.34, 35.
but in every Nation, he that fears God, and works Righteousness, is
accepted with him. Christ, has not any distinguishing kindness, but for those
(for) whom he died, and (within) whom he lives. Christ, has as great kindness
for him that sits upon the Threshold, as for him that sits upon the
Throne. The Peasant, has as much kindness from Christ as the Prince.
Circumcise the foreskin of your hearts, and be no more stiff-necked: why? for
Jehovah your God, is the God of Gods, Deuteronomy. 10.16, 17.
and Lord of Lords; a great God, mighty, and terrible, that regards not
persons, nor takes reward.

Christ, is an universal Good. Christ, some, but not to All; they will smile
some, but frown others; they will do good to some, but do evil to others; but,
Christ is good to All; He causes the Sun to shine upon the good, and bad, and
the rain to fall upon the j^st, and unjust. As Christ is an universal Good in
Himself; He was made sin for us, 1 Cor. 5.21. Psa. 145.9
who knew no sin (by Himself) that we might be made the righteousness of God in
Him; So he is universally good to others. The Lord is good to all, and his
tender mercies are over all his works.

Christ, is an unchangeable Good. changes soever are made (by) Christ, there
are no changes made (in) Christ. I am Jehovah, and I change not; Mal. 3.6.
therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not consumed. Christ, is always of one and the
same mind, and that is a mind to do good by all that he does, or suffers to be
done, to his believing ones; to his beloved ones. Times, may be changed; men,
may be changed; but Christ changes not^ Jesus Christ, yesterday, to day, Heb.
13.8
and for ever the same.

Christ, is a suitable Good. Christ, adequate good to the Soul, and nothing
below a Christ, will suit, and serve the Soul: The Soul, must have that which
will quadrare with it, and be an adequate good to it. The Soul, is an excellent
piece; is an excelling piece; it is the Breath of God; the Beauty of Man; the
Wonder of Angels; the Envy of Devils: Now, all below a Christ, is below this
Soul. All, short of a God in Covenant, of a God in Christ, will not suit, and
serve this Soul, if thoroughly awakened. The Soul, is such a Jewel, that no
thing can be given in exchange for it. Mark 8.37.
What can be given in exchange for the soul? The Soul, is so noble, that it is
below a gracious Soul, to live upon any thing below a Christ. This Soul, may
look upon the Stream, but it lives upon the Fountain; may look upon the Water,
but it lives upon the Angel; may look upon the Cabinet, but it lives upon the
Jewel; may look upon the Field, but it lives upon the Pearl. Christ, is the
object of the Saints Desire, and Delight. Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? Psa.
73.25 Bonum, in quo omnia sunt bona.
and there is none upon earth that I desire besides Thee. Christ, is that Good,
in whom is all Good, and nothing but Good. He, that can answer the desires of
the heart, must needs Himself be a suitable good; but this Christ can do. Psa.
37.4
Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thine
heart. Heart-desires, are great desires; are greatest desires; are the best
desires: Now, it is Christ's Prerogative Royal to give the Desires of the Heart.
A Master, may give much; a Father, may give more; these may give Bags, and
Barns; House, and Land; Silver, and Gold; but they cannot give Grace, and
Glory; they cannot give Christ; more of a Christ; more of the Grace of Christ;
and more of the Spirit of Christ. It is time (now) to distinguish between our
Goods, and our Good; between our Goods, and our God.

Christ, seasonable Good. As there is a season for every thing; so every thing
is beautiful in its season. To every thing there is a season, and a time for
every purpose under the Heaven. Now, Christ, as he is the Author of good, so he
is the Timer of good; and, if he be the Timer of good, then certainly he must
needs be a Timely-good. The season of a mercy, greatly accents the mercy. Genesis
22.13.
For a Lamb to be caught by the Horns in a Thicket, when the Knife was in the
hand of the Father, to slay the Son, was in season. Exodus 14.16. Dan. 3.24, 25.
For the Waters to divide, and Sea become Land to the Israelites, when the
Egyptians were in the pursuit of them like so many armed Furies, was in season.
For the three Children, to be in the Furnace, and for Christ then to appear
with them, and make up that holy Mess, was in season. For a Soul to be
afflicted, Isa. 54.11
tossed with tempest, and not comforted; and for Christ (then) to say, I will
lay thy Stones with fair colors, and will lay thy foundations with Saphires;
is not this in season? For the Soul to be dark, and for Christ to enlighten it;
for the Soul to be dead, and for Christ to enliven it; for the Soul to be
doubting, and for Christ to resolve it; and for the Soul to be distressed, and
for Christ to relieve it, is not this in season? In my distress, Psa. 120.1
I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me. For a Soul to be hard, and for Christ
to soften it; for a Soul to be haughty, and for Christ to humble it; for a Soul
to be tempted, and for Christ to succor it; and for a Soul to be wounded, and
for Christ to heal it, is not this in season? I, even I, am he, that comfort
Thee. Isa. 51.12.8.


Christ, is a satisfying Good. A Wooden Loaf; a Silver Loaf; a Golden Loaf,
will not satisfy a hungry man; the man must have Bread. The Dainties, and
Dignities of the World; the Grandeur, and Glory of the World; the Plenty, and
Prosperity of the World; the Puff, and Popularity of the World, will not
satisfy a soul sailing by the Gates of Hell, and crying out of the Depths; it
must be a Christ. Children, or I die, was the cry of the Woman; a Christ, or I
die; a Christ, or I am damned, is the doleful Ditty, and doleful Dialect, of a
despairing, or desponding Soul. He, that loves silver, Eccl. 5.10
shall not be satisfied therewith, nor he that loves abundance with increase.
It is a good observation, that the World is round, but the Heart of man is
triangular: Now, all the Globe of the World, will not fill the triangular Heart
of man. What (of) the World, and (in) the World can give quietness, when Christ
(the Sun of Righteousness) goes down upon the Soul? The Heart is a
Three-square, and nothing but a Trinity in Unity, and an Unity in Trinity, will
satisfy this. Not Riches, nor Relations; not Barns, nor Bags, will satisfy a
convinced, and deserted Soul: Abite hinc; abite long.
This person can say concerning his Bags, as a great person upon a sick (if not
upon a dying) Bed did concerning his Bags, Away, and away for ever; though
there be Bag upon Bag, yet they are altogether insignificant in a dying hour;
these Bags, they are but as so many ciphers (before) a figure, or (without) a
figure. This is the cry of despairing, and desponding Souls; Oh satisfy us
early with thy mercy, Psa. 90.14
that we may rejoice, and be glad all our days!

Christ, is an incomparable Good. Christ, chiefest Good. As he is the Gift of
Gifts: Summum Bonum.
If thou knew (the) Gift of God: So, Christ, is the Good of Goods. Joh. 4.10.
He is much fairer than the Sons of Adam. Christ, as God, had the perfection of
Grace; and as Man, Psa. 45.2.
had the perfection of Nature. All, are Blacks, to this Beauty. Publius
Lent^lus, President in J^dea, in the days of ^^erius Caesar, wrote an Epistle
to the Senate at Rome, concerning Jesus Christ, and says (among other things)
that for his singular Beauty he surpassed the Children of men.

Christ, eternal Good. Things below, are mutable, and mortal; mutability, and
mortality, are stamped upon, and legible in the face of all things here below.
Riches make to themselves wings. Ye shall not need to send them away, they will
go away without sending. Places, are wasted: What is Nineveh, Jo^. 4.11.
that great City, wherein were more than six score thousand persons, that could
not discern between their right hand, and their left? It is reduced to a small
Village. What shall we say of Jerusalem, the City of God? the perfection of
Beauty? the Joy of the whole Earth? Not one stone was left upon another. Its
true of persons, as well as places. The Patriarchs are dead; the Prophets are
dead; the Apostles are dead. Zach. 1.5.
Our Fathers, where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever? But
Christ, is an eternal Good. Consider Christ as God, and so Eternity is his
Mansion, and his Measure.

Consider Christ as God, Eternity is his Mansion. Isa. 57.15.
Thus says the high, and lofty one that inhabiteth Eternity, whose name is
holy, etc.

Look upon Christ as God, Eternity is his Measure. Psa. 90.2.
From Eternity, to Eternity, thou art God.

Fear not Death, is thine, and he a Rock. Lead me to the Rock that is higher
than I. Psa. 61.2.
Though David was high, Christ was higher; though David was King of Israel, yet
Christ was Rock of Israel. As Christ was the Rock of Old Testament Saints, so
he is the Rock of New Testament Saints. They all drank of that spiritual Rock
that followed them, 1 Cor. 10.4. Quest. Sol. 1.
and that Rock was Christ.

But, what manner of Rock is this Rock?

Christ, is, a high Rock. Material Rocks, and Mountains, are high. This was
given in charge to the Children of Israel, to destroy all those places, Deuteronomy.
12.2.
wherein the Nations served their Gods upon the high Mountains. This Mistical
Rock, Christ, is high; very high. The Heavens, are high, but Christ is higher.
He is holy, and harmless, Heb. 7.26.
separated from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens. This Rock (Christ)
is higher than fallen Souls; higher than unfallen Spirits.

This Rock Christ is higher then fallen Souls. higher than Absalom, and Agag;
Judas, (...)
and Demas, but (also) higher than the Church, for he is Head of the Church;
yea, (the) Head of the Church, not (only) by way of Emphasis, but (also) by
way of Exclusion. Col. 1.18.
And himself is (the) Head, of (the) Body (the) Church. So, the Greek.

This Rock (Christ) is higher than unfallen Spirits. Christ, is not (only)
higher than the Kings of the Earth, but (also) higher than the Angels of
Heaven. He, that is higher than the highest regards, Eccl. 5.8.
and there be higher than they. Angels, are higher than the highest of Men, but
Christ is higher than the highest of Angels, for he is Head of the Angles; yea
(the) Head of the Angels; not (only) emphatically, but (also) exclusively. Col.
2.10.
And ye are complete in him, who is the Head of all principality and powwer.
Christ, is highest.

Christ, is, a strong Rock. Material Rocks, strong; very strong. Job 39.28.
It is said of the Eagle (the Princess of Birds) that she abides upon the
Rock, the crag of the Rock, and the strong place. The Crag of the Rock, is the
Tooth, or Edge of the Rock, which is most inaccessible. This mystical Rock
(Christ) is strong; very strong; stronger than Men; stronger than Angels. Oh,
says the Soul, I am weak! and not (only) weak, but (also) weakness it self! and
not able to weather another storm! But, Soul, Christ, is strong; strength it
self. 1 Samuel 15.29.
The strength of Israel will not lie, nor repent* What is a Goliath in the hands
of this David? Christ; is not (only) the Power of God, but (also) the God of
Power; who strengthens (against) sin, and who strengthens (unto) service.

Christ, the Rock of His) strengthens (against) sin. Christ, is strong;
stronger than the strong man armed, and can cast him out (when) he please, and
(where) he please. 1 John 4.4
Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. Oh, says the Soul,
these Achans within! these Goliahs within! these Saul's within! But, what are
these to Christ, the Rock of His?

Christ (the Rock of His) strengthens (unto) service. He, strengthens His, unto
Action, and unto Passion; unto doing, and unto dying; but to these distinctly.

Christ (the Rock of His) strengthens (his) unto Action. A Little is too much
for Us; A^, is but Little to Christ. Phil. 4.13
I can do all things: is not this a lofty strain? but how? through Christ. I
can do all things through Christ which strengthens me*

Christ (the Rock of His) strengthens (his) unto Passion. Suffering work, is
noble work; bleeding, and burning work, the noblest work, that ever the Sons of
Adam, were engaged in. Saints (indeed) are inferior to Angels as to Action,
but superior to Angels as to Passion; for they are spirits, and so impassible:
Now, Christ, the Rock of His) strengthens His, unto Passion, as well as Action,
and unto dying, Phil. 1.29.
as well as doing. It is given unto you in the behalf of Christ, not (only) to
believe, but (also) to suffer for his sake. Such a Rock Christ is.

Christ, firm Rock. Material Rocks, are firm Rocks; flinty Rocks, are firm
Rocks. God, speaking of Jacob, Deuteronomy. 32.13.
that is (the Sons of Jacob) says, He made him suck Honey out of the Rock, and
Oil out of the flinty Rock. Christ (the Rock of His) is a firm Rock. He stood
(until his hour was come) all the combined Furies, and Forces of Hell, and
Earth. They sought to take him, Joh. 7.30.
but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. Christ (the
Rock of His) was firm in Action, and in Passion.

Christ was firm in Action, did well. I have finished the work which thou
gave me to do. Joh. 17.4.


Christ, firm in Passion, and died well. He, was obedient to death, Phil. 2.8.
even the death of the Cross.

Christ, ancient Rock. Material Rocks, may plead Antiquity. Exodus 15.5, 6.
Jehovah said unto Moses, I will stand before thee there upon the Rock in
Horeb. Rocks, were befere Men, Dan. 7.22
but Christ was before Rocks. He, is styled, The Ancient of Days. Christ, may
plead Antiquity, in a twofold respect; Generation, and Regeneration.

Christ, may plead Antiquity, Generation. Christ had a Hand, in making the
first man. Genesis 1.26
Come, let us make man.

Christ, may plead Antiquity, Regeration. (...) Ephesians. 2.10.
As nothing was done in the first Creation without Christ; so nothing was done
in the second Creation without Christ. We are his workmanship (his work, so the
Greek) created in Chrift Jesus unto good works.

Christ, is an accommodating Rock. Material Rocks, accommodate with Water.
Deuteronomy. 8.15.
He brought them forth water out of the Rock of flint. Christ, the Rock of His,
accommodates His; out of him goes water, living water. If thou knew the
gift of God, Joh. 4.10.
and who it is that says unto thee, give me to drink, thou would have asked
of him, and he would have given thee living water. Christ, accommodates freely,
and fully.

Christ (the Rock of His) accommodates freely. Joh. 7.37.


Christ (the Rock of His) accommodates fully. Ch is it is a (free) so a (full)
Rock: here thou may fill thy pitcher up to the very brim. If thou come to
Christ, thou come to a Fountain, and in a Fountain, water, for Quantity, and
Quality, is ever the same. Rev. 21.6.
I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life
freely. Here is giving, that is freely; and of the Fountain, that is fully.

Christ, is an advantaging Rock. Material Rocks, commodious. Job says, Job
28.1.
There is a Vein for the Silver, and a place for the Gold. Gold, has its
place; has its Rock. Col. 3.11.
Christ (the Rock of His) is very advantageous unto His, for he (is) All, and
(in) All.

Christ, (the Rock of His) is All between God, Them. He, has crossed the Book;
cancelled the Bond; discharged the Debt; Heb. 10.14.
for ever perfected them that are saustified. His Garment, is large enough to
cover His.

Christ (the Rock of His) is All between Them, God. He, is concerned with the
performance, as well as the person, and with the Service, as well as the Soul.
Christ, is not (only) All between God, and Them, in a way of Satisfaction, but
(also) All between Them, and God, in a way of Service. He is a merciful, Heb.
2.17
and a faithful High Priest, in things pertaining to God, to make
reconciliation for the sins of his people.

Christ, secure Rock. Material Rocks are secure places. Prove. 30.26. Joh. 17.12.
Solomon speaks of a feeble Folk; yet make they their houses in the Rock.
Christ, the mystical Rock, is able to secure his for an eternity. Those that
thou have given me, have I kept, and none of them are lost. Christ (the Rock of
His) secures two ways.

Under Danger. Peter, was in great danger of drowning, but Christ secured him,
and kept his Head above water. Dan. 6.22
Daniel, was in great Danger, when cast into the Den of Lions, to take up his
Quarters; but Christ secured him there, stopping the mouths of the Lions.

From Danger. delivered (in) the Fire, is a mercy; but, to be delivered (from)
the Fire, looks like a greater mercy. Psa. 59.10
To be delivered when down of the Plague, is a mercy; but to be delivered from
falling down of the Plague, looks like a greater mercy. The God of my mercy
shall prevent me.

Christ, durable Rock. Material Rocks, they are durable. Job 19.24. Romans 6.9.
Job, wishes, that his words were graven with an Iron Pen, and Lead, in the
Rock for ever. Thus, Christ (the Rock of His) is a durable Rock. Christ, being
raised from the dead, dies no more; death, has no more dominion over him.
Now, Christ, is a durable Rock, in respect of his Life, and Love.

In respect of his Life. dying, he ever died. In that he died, Romans 6.10.
he died unto Sin once, but in that he lives, he lives unto God.

In respect of his Love. dying, he ever lives; Joh. 13.1.
So once loving, he ever loves. Having loved his own which were in the World,
he loved them unto the End.

Fear not Death, Christ is Thine and he is a Portion. Christ, is the Portion of
a Christan: that Jehovah is, is evident; that Christ is Jehovah is as evident.

That Jehovah is the Portion of a Christian, Thou art my Portion, Jehovah, Psa.
119.57.
I have said that I would keep thy words. Jehovah is my Portion says my Soul,
therefore will I hope in him. The Gold, and Silver, which I had in my House,
Lam. 3.24
are gone into Captivity, but my Gold, and Silver in Heaven, are not gone into
Captivity; Jehovah, is my Portion still. They, who have Jehovah for their Gold,
and Silver, are happier, and richer, than Good and Silver can make them.
Jehovah, is my Portion, says my Soul.

That Christ, is Jehovah, is as evident. Jehovah is my Shepherd, I shall not
want. Psa. 23.1.
Shall the Sheep want, so long as the Shepherd has it? In his days, Judah
shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely, Jer. 23.6.
and this is the name whereby he shall be called Jehovah our Righteousness.
Christ, is Jehovah, and so the Portion of a Christian.

But, what manner of Portion is Christ? Quest. Sol.


Though this be a (good) Task, yet this is a (great) Task; a Task too great for
me; but, though I cannot sound this Bottom, yet, suffer me to let down my Line.

Christ is a necessary Portion. Martha (say Christ) One thing is needful. But
what is this One thing? (...)
It is the written Word; So Ambrose; Calvin; Chrysistom. But what is the Word,
without the Spirit? Luke 10.42.
without Christ? it is but as the Instrument without the Hand. If this one
thing be not Christ, I am sure it is not without, Christ. But, what of this one
thing? It is needful. There is Need or Necessity of one thing; So the Greek.
Not been esse, but esse.
There is One thing not (only) needful, and useful; but (also) needful above
all things; useful above all things; and that, not (only) to the well-being,
but (also) to the very Being of a Christian; A Man, or a Woman, cannot be a
Christian without it; be satisfied without it; be sanctified without it; be
saved without it. Are there not many things without which a person may be, and
yet live well? and do well? die well? but, if this person be without Christ;
and the Grace of Christ; and the Spirit of Christ; and the Gospel of Christ, he
cannot live well; and do well; and die well; but perishes for ever; is undone
for ever; is damned for ever. Tria sunt omnia. Vnum est necessarium.
It has been said, Three things, are, All things; but, here, One thing, is,
All things. There is a necessity of One thing. God (at first) gave ten
Commandments; but, lest these should be too many, for Man's Memory, Christ,
reduces them to Two, Love to God, and our neighbor. Yea, here, All, is reduced
to One; There is a Necessity of One thing. 1 John 5.11.
Christ, perfectly knew man's Memory to be predigiously treacherous, and
(therefore) reduces All, to One; There is need of One thing. Now, certainly,
if this One thing be not Christ, yet it cannot be without him: For, this is the
record, etc. and this life is in his Son.

There is an indispensible Necessity of him as a portion in a twofold respect;
to suffer All (for) Thee, to do All (in) Thee.

To suffer All (for) Thee. God is angry with sinners every day: I cannot
appease Divine Wrath: What are thousands of Rams, and ten thousands of Rivers
of Oil? Can I give my firstborn for mine iniquity? or the seed of my Body, for
the sin of my Soul? No, Soul; thou can not satisfy for (one) Sin; but Christ
(can) satisfy for All; has satisfied for All: He has paid thy Debt (if thou
be his) and not left thee a penny to pay in a way of merit, John 19.30.
but in a way of duty. It was Christ that said it, and God heard him when he
spoke it; It is finished. As Christ, is a Christians Lord, and Lawgiver; so,
he is a Christians Sovereign, and Surety.

To do All (in) Thee. Christ as I should! serve Christ as I would! Oh, I cannot
Ark in a Christ as I should! nor Anchor upon a Christ as I would! The Velle, as
well as the posse.
what though I have the Habit of Grace, what shall I do for the Act of Grace?
Soul, Christ, is Actor, as well as Author of Grace. When the Apostle imposed a
working out of Salvation, he might as well have imposed the making a new
Heaven, and a new Earth; Phil. 2.12, 13.
but this is subjoyned; It is God that works in you both to will, and to do.
Christ, is God: Now, the Desire, as well as the Deed, is from Christ.

Christ, is a Soul-portion. The Body, Cabinet, the Soul, is the Jewel. What is
the Body, without the Soul? it is loveless, and lifeless. What is the Body,
without the Soul? it is (at best) but an imbalmed Carcass, that no Spectator is
taken with: Now, as the Soul is the Life of the Body; for the Body without the
Soul is dead; so, Christ, Jam. 2.26
is the Life of the Soul: Because I live, ye shall live also. The Life of
Saints, is not in their private hand, but in Christ, their public head.
Because I live, Joh. 14.19.
ye do live; yea, and ye shall live. To have a portion for the Body, is a
mercy; but to have a portion for the Soul, and Christ this portion, who has
Rhetoric enough to express this mercy? Now, Christ, is a Soul- portion, under
a double notion; as he is Meat to the Soul, and Medicine to the Soul.

Christ, is the portion of the Soul, Meat of the Soul. Can the Body be without
Bread? Is not Bread that one thing, without which a man would not long be? Yea,
that one thing, for which a man would part with any thing, rather than long be
without? Christ, is Meat to the Soul; He, Joh. 6.55.
is the Bread of Life. His flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed.
As Christ said, I have meat to eat that the world knows not of: So may the
Christian say (who has Christ for his portion) Christ, is meat to my Soul,
which the world knows not of.

Christ, is the Portion of the Soul, Medicine to the Soul. He, that is Meat to
the Soul, and Medicine to the Soul too; that is Food for the Soul, and Physic
for the Soul too, must needs be a Soul Portion, but thus Christ is. The
Wilderness-Manna, was Meat, but not Medicine; Food, but not Physic: If an
Isralite had been Sick, that Manna could not have cured him; if an Israelite
had been Stung which the fiery Serpents, Number. 21.9.
that Manna could not have healed him. There was a Serpent of Brass lifted up
upon a Pole, that whosoever was bitten, might look up unto, and be healed. Now,
this brozen Serpent, was an emblem of Christ, and shadowed him out. Joh. 3.14,
15.
As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Man
be lifted up, that whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have
everlasting Life. As Aron lifted up the Sacrifices at the Altar, so Christ, the
Son (the Substance of all Sacrifices) was lifted up.

Christ, satisfying Portion. An Affluence, and Confluence, of these lesser, and
lower things, will not satisfy without a Christ, but a Christ will satitsfy
without an Affluence, and Confluence of these lesser, and lower things. The
Eye, is not satisfied with seeing, but could see a thousand times more than it
does; Eccl. 1.8
not the Ear filled with hearing, but could hear a thousand times more than it
does: Now, if the Eye, and the Ear, cannot be satisfied, how then should the
Heart of Man (which is the vastest thing in the world) be satisfied without a
Christ? A man may have a Crown upon his Head, and a Scepter in his Hand, and
not be satisfied; but, if a Soul has Christ, he cannot be unsatisfied. It is
enough (said Jacob) that Joseph is. It is enough (said Simeon) that Jesus is:
Lord, now let thy servant depart in peace; why? for mine eyes have seen thy
salvation. Simeon, had lived long enough, having lived to see Christ. Eccl.
5.10 Jer. 31.25 Psa. 107.9
He that loves silver, shall not be satisfied with it, nor he that loves
abundance with increase. It is Christ that satiateth the weary Soul. It is
Christ that satisfies the longing Soul, and fills the hungry soul with
Goodness. Now, there are two things (at least) that contribute to the
constituting of a right satisfaction; the suitableness, and sufficiency of the
Object.

Christ, satisfying Portion, in respect of the sutableness of the Object. There
must be a sutableness in the Object, to satisfy the Subject. Had there been a
Will in Christ, and not a Power in Christ, there had not been sutableness, nor
sufficiency, in the Object, to satisfy the Subject. There can be no
satisfaction without sutableness. It is not Dirt, but Bread, that s^^ts the
Body. There is not any thing so suits the Body, as Christ suits the Soul. Is
the creature a Sinner? Christ is a Savior. Was it man that sinned? it was
Christ that suffered, and that as man. By man came Death, 1 Cor. 15.21.
by man also came the Resurection from the dead. He that suffers for man, must
come in the Nature of man; thus, Christ did. He, took not upon him the Nature
of Angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Or thus; Heb. 2.16
He takes not hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham he takes hold. So
that here was sutableness.

Christ, is a satisfying Portion, sufficiency of the Object. There must be a
sufficiency, as well as a sutableness in the Object, for the Subject, in order
to satisfaction. Had there been a propensity in Christ, and not a sufficiency
in Christ, this would not have satisfied; but, now, as Christ was Man, that he
might suffer; so he was God, that he might satisfy; here is sutableness, and
sufficiency. There is a sufficiency in Christ, in order to salvation. He is
able to save to the utmost all that come unto God by him. Heb 7.25 1 Cor. 1.2
And, as Salvation, so Sanctification, in order to Salvation, is from Christ.
Sanctified in Christ Jesus.

Christ, is a durable Portion. Christ is a Portion, last for ever. Other
Portions may be wasted, but this cannot: other Portions may be spent, or lost,
but this cannot: other Portions, whether in our own hands, or in the hands of
others, may be lost; a Fare may come, and Houses may be made heaps. The more a
man spends of a worldly Portion, the less he has; he may beggar himself; yea,
bankrupt himself; but the more a man spends of this Portion, the more he has.
Christ, is a Portion, that will last as long as the Soul lasts, Psalm. 73.26.
and yet the Soul has a stamp of Immortality upon it. My flesh, and my heart
fails, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. Worldly
Portions, are transient, but this is permanent; others fleeting, but this
abiding; others temporal, but this eternal. Christ, is not (only) the
Christians Portion here, but (also) hereafter. But, consider the Duration of
this Portion, under a double Notion; in respect of his Life, and in respect of
his Love.

In respect of his Life. As the Father has life in himself, Joh. 5.26.
so has he given to the Son to have life in himself. Christ (once) dying (no
more) dies.

In respect of his Love. lives for ever, so he loves for ever. Jer. 31.3.
I have loved thee with an everlasting love. As the Essence, so the Attribute.

Christ, seasonable Portion. According to the timing of a Deliverance, is the
greatness of the Deliverance, many times. The timing of a Mercy, greatly
accents the Mercy, many times. The timing of Daniels Deliverance out of the
Den, and of the three Childrens out of the fiery Furnace, did greatly accent
their Deliverance, and cause Heaven, and Earth, to ring with it. When Man was
so poor, that he had beggared himself, and was worth nothing; yea, so poor,
that he had bankrupted himself, and was worse than nothing, then Christ became
his Portion. When man (by his sin) had stripped himself naked, and to cover his
nakedness, had Fig Leaves upon his Loins, then Christ, became his Portion. Romans
5.6, 8.
In due time, Christ died for the ungodly. While we were yet sinners, Christ
died for us. Ah! what a poor pittance a Christless soul has; though he has a
Kingdom before him; an Empire before him. Who (for the most part) have been the
Princes and Petentates of the world? the Dons and Emperors of the world, but
the Nero's, and Nebuchadnezzars of the world? the Pharoahs and Pilates of the
world? Had a man as many Kingdoms; yea, could a man have as many worlds, Esth.
1.1.
as Ahasuerus had Provinces ( who reigned from India, to Ethiopia, over 127
Provinces) yet, if without Christ, he would be but a Beggar; be but a Bankrupt.
Is not Christ (then) a seasonable Portion? But, consider, the season of this
Portion, under a twofold notion; in reference to the work, and in reference to
the wages.

In reference to the work. was the work; now, this was a desperate work; a
dangerous work; a damnable work. Sin, is a darkning of the Glory of God; a
defacing of the Image of God; a murdering of the Son of God; a grieving of the
Spirit of God, and a wronging of the Soul of man: Is not Christ (now) a
seasonable Portion? Adam (says God) have thou eaten of the Tree whereof I
commanded thee that thou should not eat? Genesis 3.11.12.
And then the man said, the woman which thou gave to be with me, she gave me
of the Tree, and I did eat. Here, is the work, and that is sin; now, sinful
work, is sad work.

In reference to the wages. Sin, was the work; was the wages. In the day thou
eatest thereof, Romans 6^.23.
dying, thou shall dye. The wages of sin, is death. All manner of deaths; the
first, and the second death. Sin, pays all its servants in black money.

Christ, is an incomparable Portion. liken Christ? Is he not without compare?
Was Absalom a Beauty without compare among the Sons of David? Certainly Christ
is among the Sons of God. Absalom, was a Beauty in Body, but a Black in Soul;
Christ, was a Beauty without a Spot; a Substance without a Shadow; an Ocean of
Sweet, without a Drop of Gall. Jer. 10.16
The portion of Jacob is not like them. Was it ever said of any one, but that
only One, Christ Jesus, that he was all Desires; But, so, Can. 5.16. Ainsworth
Psa. 86.8.
Christ, is. His palate, sweetnesses; yea, he is all Desires. Among the Gods,
there are none like unto thee, Jehovah; neither, are there any Works like unto
thy works. Take, now, a prospect of the Incomparableness of Christ in a twofold
respect; his Person, and his personal Excellency.

Christ, is an incomparable portion, person. Christ, was God, and Man, and
herein he was without compare. Now, this person of his (as God-man) is the
Object of Faith. Joh. 8.24.
If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. If ye believe not
that I am God; as well as man, ye shall die (in) your sins, and be damned (for)
your sins.

Christ, is an incomparable Portion, Excellency. As the person of Christ, is
the Object of Faith; so the personal Excellency of Christ, is the Object of
Love. Soul! do but look upon Christ, and thou can not but love him; such are
his personal Excellencies. Suffer a Taste, by way of Instance.

Reflect his Love. Did ever any one love, Christ loved? He loved his enemies, 1
Pet. 3.18.
and (for those) was bled to Death (by whom) he was bled to Death. He, suffered
for sins, the just, for the unjust.

Inspect his Life. Life, was a mirror of Holiness. (As, he is a principle (in)
His; so, he is a president (for) His. Heb. 4.15.
No blot in his Scutcheon; Sin, in his Soul. In all points tempted like us, yet
without sin. Though Christ, was tempted (unto) sin, not (into) sin.

Reflect his Kindness. kind, as Christ was? Luke 8.26, 27.
he sets sail for the City of Gadara, to dispossess (one) man (at most) two
men, possessed with Devils, and that dwelt in Tombs. Luke mentions but one man;
Mat. 8.28.
and Matthew mentions two men, possessed with Devils, coming out of the Tombs.

Inspect his Obedience. fulfilled (to a punctilio) the whole will of God. Jon.
17.4.
I have finished the work which thou gave me t^ do. Christ, fulfilleth the
Righteousness of the Law (for) His, and fulfilleth the Righteousness of the
Gospel (in) His.

Reflect his Humility. humble, as Christ was? Joh. 13.5.
He left his Fathers bosom, for his Mothers womb; a Throne, for a Manger;
Heaven, for Earth. Quericus; Leigh, in Loc.
He washed his Disciples feet; not their head, but their feet. One, upon a
consideration of this example, cried, thou have overcome me, oh Lord! thou have
overcome my pride; this example has mastered me.

Inspect his Sympathy. Hos. 11.8.
how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me; my repentings
are kindled together. When Christ strikes His, every stroke goes (as it were)
to his own Heart: when he is about to strike, he is (as it were) unresolved
whether he shall strike or no; and, when he has stricken, he does (as it were)
repent, that ever he did strike. Do not all these motions of Gods Heart appear
in the highest strains of passionate Rhetoric?

Reflect his Mercifulness. merciful as Christ? Luke 10.30, 31, 32, etc.
witness the man that sell among Thieves between Jericho, and Jerusalem; the
Priest, and the Levite, passed by, but the Samaritan had mercy.

Inspect his Muteness. mute, as Christ was? Isa. 53.7.
He was brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearers
is dumb, so opened he not his mouth.

Reflect his Meekness. Moses, compare with Christ for Meekness. Say we not
well, Joh. 8.48, 49.
that thou art a Samaritan, and have a Devil? Jesus answered, I have not a
Devil, but I honor my Father, and ye do dishonor me. Is not his Meekness a
Mirror?

Inspect his Mindfulness. mindful as Christ was? Go, tell the Disciples, Mar.
16.7.
and Peter. Be sure ye tell Peter. Peter has been sining, and may now be
unbelieving; tell the Disciples, and Peter. Peter has been denying, and now
may be doubting; be sure (therefore) ye tell Peter. Peter has been denying
before the Crucifixion, and may now be hesitating about the Resurrection. Go,
tell the Disciples, and Peter.

DIRECT. IV.

get then (through Grace) Assurance of (another) Life (after) Death; for there
can be no Assurance of (this) Life (against) Death. To this end, suffer a
concise Discussion of these following Queries.

But, Quest. 1. Sol. Joh. 20.28.
is Assurance attainable in (this) Life?

Yea, I dare be peremptory, and positive herein, that Assurance is attainable
in this Life. My Lord, and my God. Mine and Thine, are words of propriety.
These Pronouns, Me; Thee; Mine; Thine; My; Meum and Tuum. Luth.
Thy; they are strains of Love, and drop (like Honey-combs) sweetness of
Affection. The sweetness of the promises (as says one) is couched and lodged in
Pronouns; My; Thy; Me; Thee; Mine; Thine. Thomas, Job 19.25.
was assured; my Lord; and my God. Thus, Job; I know that my Redeemer lives,
and that he shall stand in the latter day upon the Earth. This knowing, is
knowing upon great certainty; knowing, without all wavering. As if he had said;
my judgment is fixed, and my Faith confirmed in this thing: It is as clear to
me that Christ is my Redeemer, and that (this) Redeemer of mine lives, as if I
had already seen him alive: My Faith, makes this as evident to me now, as my
experience shall hereafter. Thus, David; The Lord is my Rock, and my Fortress,
Psalm. 18.2.
and my deliverer; my Rock; in him will I trust; my Buckler, and the Horn of my
salvation, and my high Tower. Thus Paul; I am persuaded; the word signifies an
assured Confidence; I am assiredly confident; (...)
but of what? that, not Death; Life; Angels; Principalities; Powers; things
present; things to come; height; depth; nor any other creature, shall be able
to separate us from the Love of God, Romans 8.38, 39.
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Places might be multiplied, in order to the
evincement of this Truth, that Assurance is attainable in this Life. May the
Church speak? My Beloved is mine, Can. 2.16.
and I am his; he feeds among the Lillies. That their hearts might be
comforted, Col. 2.2.
being knit together in love, and to the full assurance of understanding.
Hereby we know that we know him, 1 John 2.3.
if we keep his Commandments. To know that we know, is assuredly to know;
infallibly to know. The barbarous, and bloody Papists, deny an infallible
Assurance, and grant only a conjectural one, the reason they give, is the
mutability of man's will; but the Salvation of a Soul, depends not upon the
mutability of man's, but upon the immutability of Gods will. I am Jehovah, and I
change not, Mal. 3.6.
therefore ye Sons of Jacob are not consumed.

But, what is this Assurance, Quest.
that is attainable in (this) Life?

Soul- Assurance (or evidence for Interest in Christ) is that internal and
infallible Certainty, Descr.
which a believing person has of Salvation, through free grace, written with
the Blood of a crucified Christ.

In this Description (for I dare not pretend unto a Definition) six things fall
under Discussion; the matter; the manner; the subject; the object; the motive;
the medium; but to these distinctly.

The matter. This is Certainty. Assurance, Evidence, for Interest in Christ) is
a certain thing; Hoc aliquid nihil.
a real thing: and an assured Soul can realize this thing. The world, is a
cheat, and its motto is; This Something is Nothing. The world, is a mass of
mutabilities; a mass of uncertainties; Oxen, and Sheep; Asses, and Camels to
day, but none to morrow; but now Assurance is a certainty. I have read of one
who said, Lord, I am assured of thy Love, Mrs. Bretterg.
and so certain am I of that, as I am certain that thou art the God of Truth.
Assurance, is not a Physical notion, or a mathematical conclusion; it is not
conjectural, but real. The Soul, that has passed through the sealing work of
the Spirit, can say as Jacob did to Joseph; I know it, my Son, I know it. Genesis
48.19.
I am not under a mistake concerning the Lads; I know what I do. Thus, those
(who are assured) can say, God, is theirs; and Christ, theirs; and Grace,
theirs; and Glory, shall be theirs* We are always confident, knowing, that
while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by
faith, 2 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8.
not by sight: We are confident, I say, and wiling rather to be absent from the
body, that we may be present with the Lord. If the Soul goes down to the dust
with the Body, what presence have we with God when we die? we are confident,
and this is doubled; yea, we are always confident.

The manner. matter, which is certainty; so there is the manner, of this
certainty, which is internal, and infallible; but to these distinctly.

Internal. Heart, and Soul of man is concerned here. Assurance, is a work
within; a work upon the Heart. Romans 10.10.
With the Heart man believes, and with the Tongue confession is made unto
Salvation. The Heart, is the happy, or unhappy soil, for good, or evil. All
good, or evil, begins in the Heart. The Soul is invisible, and so is this work
of Assurance upon the Soul. The word of Assurance, is, my Redeemer. My Father,
and your Father; my God, and your God, is the Dialect of the Gospel. And Mary
said, Luke 1.46, 47.
but what did she say? she says this; My soul does magnify the Lord, and my
Spirit does rejoice in God my Savior.

Infallible. external, so it is invisible, and infallible. Assurance, is an
internal, and invisible Certainty; for it is from the Spirit of God, and who
may charge the Spirit of God with fallibility, and fallacy? In Cathreda.
Shall the proud Pope pretend to Infallibility (when) and (while) in the Chair?
and shall the Spirit (when the Lord is that Spirit) be charged with
fallibility, and fallacy? The Spirit is the Tree, upon which grows all that
fruit that is brought forth to God. The Spirit, is that infallible Testimony
within. Our Gospel, came not to you in word only; 1 These. 1.5.
it came in word, but not in word only; it came also in power, and in the holy
Spirit, and in much assurance.

The Subject. believing person. This Assurance (or Evidence for Interest in
Christ) is that Internal, and infallible Certainty, which a believing person
has. It is a believing person, whether Jew, or Gentile, whether man, or woman,
that launch forth into this great deep. It is a believing person, that is able
to engage a Lion, and a Bear, and doubts not but to make a Conquest upon a
Goliath also. Though there may be Grace, where there is no Assurance; yet there
can be no Assurance, where there is no Grace. Though there may be Faith, where
there is no Assurance; Heb. 10.22.
yet there is no Assurance, where there is no Faith; for it is an Assurance of
Faith. Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith.

The Object. This is Salvation. matter, the manner, and the subject; so the
object; and this is Salvation. This Assurance, is an internal, and infallible
Certainty, which a believing person has of Salvation. Is not Salvation a great
thing? it is made up of Grace (here) and Glory (hereafter.) Is not Salvation a
great thing? it is Grace, and that is. Glory in the bud; it is Glory, and that
is Grace in the flower. Is not Salvation a great thing; it is Grace, and that
is Glory militant; it is Glory, and that is Grace triumphant. Salvation, is the
object. We believe, Acts 15.11.
that through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as
they.

The Motive. This is free grace. This Assurance, Certainty, which a believing
person has of Salvation, through free grace. By grace, ye are saved. There is
no reason to be given of Grace, but Grace. There is not any other motive with
the God of Grace, but the Grace of God. As, free grace, is man's mirror; so it
is Gods motive. The Argument, that prevailed with the God of Grace, was the
Grace of God. So God loved the world; so; there is the Emphasis, and it is an
Emphasis (unto) wonder; yea, an Emphasis (above) wonder. So God loved the
world, Joh. 3.16.
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.

The Medium, or Means. The meritorious cause, Blood of Christ. The moving cause
of Salvation, is the Grace of God, but the meritorious cause of it, is the
Blood of Christ, 1 Pet. 3.18.
who suffered without the gate: Who suffered for sin, the just for the unjust.
In that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he lived, he lived unto
God: Likewise reckon ye your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, Romans 6.10, 11.
but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So that Soul Assurance (or
Evidence for Interest in Christ) is that internal and infallible Certainty,
which a believing person has of Salvation, through free grace, written in the
Blood of a crucified Christ.

It is true, Assurance may be reduced to three heads; Civil; Corporal;
Spiritual.

Civil. Assurance for Fields; Lands; Houses, Jer. 32.9, 10.
etc. The Prophet bought a field of his Uncles Son; subscribing the evidence;
sealing it; taking witnesses; and weighed him the money in the balances.

Corporal. Thy life, shall hang in doubt before thee, and thou shall fear day,
Deuteronomy. 28.66.


Spiritual. To the full assurance of hope unto the end. metaphor taken from
Ships, which have all their Sails up, Heb. 6.11
and all these filled with wind. This, is the Assurance, I have described.

But why is Assurance attainable in (this) Life? Quest. 3. Sol.


If we reflect Precept, President, and Promise, Assurance is attainable in this
Life.

Precept. Prescribed, is attainable, but Assurance is Prescribed. Wherefore the
rather, Brethren, (...)
give diligence; the word signifies Study, and Diligence: As if the Apostle had
said, be Studious, 2 Pet. 1.10.
and Diligent; or, be Studiously Diligent: But about what? About your Calling,
and Election. Make your Calling and Election sure. Vocation, is a Comment upon
Election, and Evidential to Election. No man can know that he is Elected, until
he be called; but being effectually called, he may know that he is eternally
elected.

President. exemplified, is attainable, but Assurance is exemplified. If ye
turn over the leaves of the blessed Bible (that Book of Books) from the
beginning of it, to the ending of it, ye shall read of some persons, in all
Ages, that have been assured. As there is a distinguishing favor, a favor
proper, and peculiar to the Saints and Servants of God; so these Saints, and
Servants of God, have been assured of this proper, and peculiar Favor. That
there is a distinguishing Favor, is evident. Romember me, Oh Lord, Psa. 106.4
with the favor thou bear unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation!
That the people of God have been assured of this Favor, is as evident. Psa.
41.11
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy does not triumph
over me.

Promise. What is Promised, is attainable, Assurance is Promised. As God has
Promised to keep his People, so he will keep his Promise. Isa. 61.1, 2, 3.
As Christ has Promised to assure his People, so he will assure his People by
a Promise. The Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to the Meek; to
bind up the Brokenhearted; to comfort them that mourn, etc.

But, unto what, is Assurance attributed, Quest. 4.
and ascribed, which is attainable in (this) Life.

This Assurance, is attributed to the Spirit. Sol.
Assurance, and the sealing work of the Spirit, are Synonoma's. In whom, after
ye believed, Ephesians. 1.13.
ye were Sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise. The nature of a Seal, is to
make things sure. A writing (when Sealed) is firm among men; men (also) set
their Seals on things, to note their Propriety in the things that are Sealed.
As Faith, may be (without) Assurance, so it is always (before) Assurance.
There is the Faith of Affiance, and the Faith of Assurance. There is the direct
act of Faith; this is an assenting, and consenting, that Christ is the Sinners
Savior, and for the Sinner to cast himself at the feet of this Christ for
Salvation; this, is Faith; and the Soul that (thus) believe, shall not perish,
for he that comes unto Christ he will not, Joh. 6.37.
not cast out: There is (also) the reflect act of Faith; for the Soul to say,
this Christ, is (my) Christ; my Savior; my Surety, my Sacrifice; this, is, the
Assurance of Faith; this, is, the sealing work of the Spirit. Grieve not the
Spirit of God, Ephesians. 4.30
whereby ye are Sealed to the day of redemption. The Spirit (here) is set forth
with very great Energy, and it can hardly be expressed fully, according to the
Greek. Here are three words, which have three Articles; each word, has its
Article: And grieve not (the) holy (the) Spirit, of (that) God. This, is not
spoken properly, but tropically; for the Spirit is incapable of Grief; but we
are said to grieve him, when (by sin) we obstruct his Operation.

But what course shall I steer for this Assurance, Quest. 5.
which is attainable in (this) Life?

Would ye be assured? Sol. 1.
Be much (then) in private prayer. Is ever thy Heart more in consort, than when
thou art in a Closet? Psa. 51.4.12.
Against Thee, Thee only have I sinned. According to the Dimension of the
Person, is the Dimension of the Transgression, against whom we trespass. But
what course does he now steer? He sets upon prayer. Restore unto me the joy of
thy salvation; uphold me with thy free Spirit.

Would ye be assured? (then) at Wisdoms Gates, Cant. 7.5.
and wait in her Galleries. The King, is held in the Galleries. The King, is
Christ; and these Galleries, are those things wherein he takes his Turns. The
Ordinances of Christ, are the Galleries of Christ; Christ, is not (only) met
there, but (also) had there; yea, held there.

Would ye be assured? (then) a greater conformity to Christ. Had Zimri peace,
who slew his Master? Have thou peace in thy Slips, and Trips? In the sliding of
thy Foot, and backsliding of thy Heart? A want of conformity, interrupts
communion. The more Grace thou have, the more Peace thou are like to have. The
more thou art in a way of conformity (to) Christ, the more communion thou art
like to have (with) Christ. Isa. 32.17.
The fruit of Righteousness, shall be peace, and the effect of Righteousness
quietness, and assurance for ever.

Would ye be assured? Christ (then) the Object of your Trust, and live upon
Grace in him. He that has not a Rock to stand upon, and a Christ to trust in,
will be a Magor-Missabib; fear round about, when buffeting, and banishing come;
when fire, and famine come; when bleeding, and burning come. Is not a Horse? or
a House? or a Shop? or a man? Isa. 26.4:
a vain thing to trust in? Trust ye in Jehovah until Eternity, for Jah Jehovah
is a Rock unto Eternity. And, as the Object of your Trust, must be Christ; so
(if ye would be assured) ye must live upon Grace in him. 2 Timothy 2.1.
Thou, therefore, my Son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ.

Would ye be assured? assured. Christian Conference, often prove Christian
Comfort; Christian courage, and Christian confidence. 2 Cor. 1.^
Who comfort us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them
that are in any trouble, by the comforts wherewith we our selves are comforted
of God.

Would ye be assured? Spirit for Assurance. Look not so upon men, and means, as
to overlook the Spirit. Look not so to the Instrment, and Institution, as to
overlook the Spirit. Romans 8.16
The Spirit himself bears witness, together with our spirits, that we are the
children of God.

But, Quest. 6.
what motives are there to endeavor this Assurance, which is attainable in
this Life?

Would ye not be Staggering at the Promise? Sol. 1.
Endeavor (then) through Christ, evidence for interest in Christ. This, was
the Character, and Commendation of Abraham, Romans 4.20, 21.
He Staggered not at the Promise through unbelief, but was strong in Faith,
giving Glory to God; being fully persuaded, that what God had promised he was
able to perform. Fully persuaded; a Metaphor taken from Ships coming into a
Port with Top, and Top Gallant (according to the Dialect of Seamen;) with all
the Sails spread, and filled. Thus, Abraham; there seems not a Sail of his Soul
but was filled with the Gales, and Gusts, of Assurance.

Would ye face Death under the severest Complexion? evidence for interest (in)
Christ. 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.
It is the assured Soul that will look, and laugh, Death in the Face; Saying,
and Singing, Oh Death! where is thy Sting? Oh Grave! where is thy Victory?

Would ye be eminently spirited, eminent Service? endeavor (through) Christ
evidence for Interest (in) Christ. Will a Coward come under the cutting of the
Sword? 2 Cor. 32.7, 8.
the pricking of the Spear? the roaring of the Cannon? It is the Soul that has
Evidence for Interest in Christ, that will face Danger; Difficulty; Death. 2 Chronicles. 32.7, 8.
There are more with us, than with them, for God is with us; and for how many
will ye reckon Him?

Would ye be ready, rigged for an Eternity? endeavor (through Christ) evidence
for Intrest (in) Christ. We know, that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
were dissolved, 2 Cor. 5.1
We have a Building of God, an House not made with hands, Eternal in the
Heavens.

Would ye find every bitter Cup sweetened? evidence for Interest (in) Christ. Ye
may look for the water of Marah; for a bitter Cup; yea, for a Cup of
Bitterness; for a Cup of Blood; but Sights of Christ; the Loves of Christ;
Phil. 1.21.
Evidence for Interest in Christ, will sweeten all. To me to live is Christ,
and to die is gain.

Would ye dwell in the Suburbs of Heaven? Evidence for Interest (in) Christ.
Assurance, is (as it were) a Heaven upon Earth. To be laid in the Arms, lodged
in the Bosom, and locked up (as it were) in the Breast of a crucified Christ,
is Assurance; and is not this a Lesser, and a Lower Heaven? Psa. 30.6.
a Heaven upon Earth? In his Favor, is Life; yea, Life's; so the Hebrew. Get
(now) Assurance of (another) Life (after) Death; for there can be no Assurance
of (this) Life (against) Death. That Assurance is attainable; what this
Assurance is, and why it is attainable; unto what this Assurance is attributed,
together with the Directions and Motives, about attaining it, have been though
(weakly) discussed, which leads to the following Direction.

DIRECT. V.
A At actually in Christ? Direct. 5.
Reflect (then) those things that (through Christ) may sweeten the Thoughts of
Death. There is a Beauty even in Death it self, to a Soul actually in Christ.
It is said of a godly man in Death, Job 5.26.
Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of Corn comes in,
in his season. A happy death is the close of temporal happiness, and the
beginning of eternal. A happy death, stands between Grace, and Glory, like the
Baptist between the Law, and the Gospel, and is the connection, or knitting of
both. A happy death, is the Result of a holy Life. It is written, 1 Samuel 15.35.
that Samuel came no more to see Saul, until the day of his death. Though Saul
saw Samuel, and Samuel afterward saw Saul (accidentally) but Samuel went not
(intentionally) to see Saul; at lest (as formerly) to direct, 1 Samuel 19.22, 23,
24.
and assist him in the affairs of his Kingdom, until the day of his death.
Thus, Soul, if thou will decline duty; if thou will not stand upon the pinnacle
of duty; if thou will not steer a right course, and sail by a right compass,
thou may lose sight of Christ, and see him no more until the day of thy
Death; yea, thou may go down to the Grave in sorrow, and die in a cloud: If
(therefore) thou would sweeten the Thoughts of Death, be (through Christ) in
a right Reflection of Death, and the Promise; of Death, and what it is not, as
to Terror, and Trouble; of the Promise, and what it is, as to greatness, and
preciousness.

Be (through Christ) in a right Reflection of Death, and what it is not as to
Terror, and Trouble. I am now writing of a person actually in Christ, and of
the first Death: Now, there is no Terror, and Trouble, in (this) Death, to
(this) person, for these Reasons.

Because (this) Death is stingless to (this) person. Reas. 1.
Oh Death! where is thy sting? If Death, has no sting, then it has much honey
for (this) person. Christ Jesus, Judge. 18.8, 9.
the true Sampson, has slain (this) Lion, and brought a honeycomb out of the
carcass, to (this) person. Christ, has been the Death of Death for (this)
person; and why should that have Terror in it, which has no Life in it? We
say, the living Lion is not so terrible as he is painted; what terror (then) is
there in a dead, or in a painted Lion?

Because (this) Death, break the Bond of the Covenant between God, and (this)
person. Though the House of this person be not so (with) God; 2 Samuel 25.5.
though the Head of (this) person be not so to study (for) God; though the Hand
of (this) person be not so to work (for) God; though the Heart of (this) person
be not so to lodge (a) God; and though the Foot of (this) person, be not so to
run (to) a God, and (for) a God; yet, he has made with him an everlasting
Covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. The Covenant of God, Mat. 22.32.
is with (this) person, though he dies. I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob: They were dead, when God spoke this: Exodus 3.6.
Now, says Christ there, God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
All, are alive to him; even the dead are alive to him: As their Souls are alive
to him; so their Bodies, are as living Bodies to him; though ( rotting in their
graves) he owns them as much as when flourishing in stately Structures. The
Relation of God to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, was as strong when they were
dead, as when they were alive.

Because (this) Death, Sleep to (this) person. What Terror is there in Sleep?
What Trouble in going to Bed? weep not (says Christ) concerning the Maid, Luke
8.52.
she is not dead but sleeps. It was Christ (also) that said, Our Friend
Lazarus sleeps, Joh. 11.11
but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. Now sleep is sweet; especially
the sleep of a laboring Man.

Because (this) Death, going, or gathering to Fathers, for (this) Person. Thus
Abraham died and was gathered unto his People. Genesis 25.8.
Thus Jacob (also) died, and was gathered unto his People. Genesis 49.33.
But, as Death is a going, and a gathering to our earthly Fathers, so, it is a
going to our God, and a gathering to our Heavenly Father.

Because (this) Death is called a Rest to (this) Person. sleep is a short
Death, so Death is a long sleep; And, as Death is a sleep, so it is a Rest. We,
usually say, when a Man goes to sleep, he goes to Rest; yet Rest, is more than
sleep; for sometimes a man sleeps when he does not Rest; Job 3.13.
his very sleep being troubled, and he troubled in his sleep; but when Rest is
joined with sleep, it is perfect sleep. Job, cursing his Conception and
Production, says, Now should I have lien still, and been quiet; Isa. 52.7.
I should have slept, then had I been at rest. This Life, is a Day of working,
and Death, is a Night of resting. Hence, the Grave, is called a Bed. The
righteous, shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their Beds. When the
righteous man dies, or is taken away, he is but gone to Bed. (...), Dormitorium.
We (therefore) call those places where the dead are laid up, and buried,
Dormitories, or sleeping places. Both the Greek and Latin words, meet in this
Signification.

There is a fourfold Rest, Obtained by Death.

A Rest, from Labor, and Travel. Eccl. 9.10.
There is no workring in the Grave. There is no work, nor device, nor Knowledge
nor Wisdom in the Grave, whither thou go.

A Rest, from Trouble and Oppression. No Wars, Battles in the Grave. What is
said of Babylon, may be said of the Grave; Isa. 14.4.
How has the Oppressor ceased?

A Rest, from passion. No Sorrow, Grief in the Grave. There the wicked cease
from troubling, Job 3.17.
and there the weary be at Rest.

A Rest, form Sin. This, is the last, best. There is (in the Grave) no Law of
the Members, warring against the Law of the Mind. He, Romans 7.23
that is dead, is freed from Sin.

Because (this) Death, break the Union between Christ, and (this) Person.
Christ, and those that are Christ's, are one. That they may be one, Joh. 17.21,
22, 23.
as thou Father art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us: That
they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may
be made perfect in one. Though, Death, may break the Union between the Soul,
and the Body, yet it cannot break the Union between the Soul and Christ; For,
as when Christ died, Death did not break that hypostatical Union, between the
Divine and the Humane Nature; though Death disunited the Soul, and the Body of
Christ, yet it did not disunite God and Man, in Christ. So, though Death
triumph over the natural Union of the Soul, and Body, it can never break the
mystical Union between Christ, and the Soul: The Union between Christ God-man,
and those actually His, is inviolable; this Union out-lives Death.

Christ) in a right Reflection of the promise, in respect of the greatness, and
preciousness of it. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
promises. 2 Pet. 1.4.
Exceeding great; greatest; so the Greek. In which pure, and precious Text, and
Truth, (...)
ye have something implied, and something expressed. 1. Implied. This, is the
Giver, and this is Christ. As he is the great promise; so he is the great Giver
of the premise. As he is the great Gift; so he is the great Giver. Given. 2.
Expressed. Now, herein, ye have, 1. The Gift. Promises. These, are great
things; they are the Churches Stock; they are a Believers Patrimony. 2. A
Description of these Promises. 1. By their greatness; exceeding great; or,
greatest. 2. By their preciousness. And precious. Given exceeding great, and
precious promises. 3. The persons concerned in these exceeding great and
precious promises. 2 Pet. 1.1.
Us. Given unto us. But, who were these? They were those that had obtained
precious Faith. 4. The Medium, through which were given these greatest, and
precious promises, whereby. Through the power of God, and Christ, in the
Dispensation of the Gospel. Whereby, are given unto us exceeding great and
precious promises. That is (says one) Gifts spiritual, and eternal, of old
promised by the Prophets. Gerrard.
The promises are divine conveyances of Consolation; they are the Veins of
Christ, whereby his Blood is carried into all his Body. The promises run with
the sweetest stream^, when Satan rages with the sharpest storms. The Promises
are the Armory of Faith. The Promises, are full Breasts, and Christ delights
that Faith should draw them; but, Promises (out of Christ) are mere
speculations. 2 Cor. 1.20.
They who have no propriety in the Prince of Life, have no propriety in the
Promise of Life; for, All the promises of God, in Christ, are yea, and in him
Amen. Providential mercies may fall upon other creatures, but the promises of
Life, and Life in the promises, is settled upon the Church as her Dowry. To
Abraham and his seed (his believing seed) were the promises made. Gal. 3.16.29.
And, if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise. Those ( actually Christ's) are not to judge of the Fidelity of God,
according to his providence, but according to his promises; nor to measure the
Heart of God (toward) them, by the Hand of God (upon) them. But, suffer an
innocent Enquiry after the greatness of the promises, and in the greatness of
them, read the preciousness of them. There is a threefold promise, Civil;
Religious; Divine; to these distinctly.

Civil. This, is a word (from) man (to) man. Civil promise, is a word passed
(from) man (unto) man, concerning the performance of some lawful thing, as in
Contracts, and in other Affairs. Thus Laban made promise to Jacob, to give him
his Daughters. Thus, Saul, made promise to David, that he would not hurt him;
nor hunt after his Soul, to take it. Thus (also) Jonathan made promise to
David. Saul, spoke unto Jonathan his Son, and to all his Servants, to kill
David: Jonathan delighting much in David, 1 Samuel 19.1, 2, 3.
intimates this unto David, and advisith him to abscond until the morning,
promising him to commune with his Father, and what he should see, to tell him.

Religious. This, word passed (from) man (to) God. A Religious promise, is a
word passed (from) man to God, concerning some Duty relating to his Honor.
This, is called a Vow. I will go into thy h^use with burnt-offerings; I will
pay thee my Vows, Psalm. 66.13, 14.
which my lips have uttered, and my mouth has spoken, when I was in trouble.

Divine. This, word passed (from) God (to) man. A divine promise is a word
passed (from) God (to) man, concerning the performing of some Good, or removing
of some Evil, Spiritual, or Corporal. Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who
is devoted to thy fear. Remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou
have caused me to hope. Psa. 119.38, 49.
Now, they are divine promises I am engaging: That some promises are divine, is
evident; for they are (of) God, and (from) God. If the Inheritance be of the
Law, it is no more of promise, Gal. 3.18.
but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Take (now) a Taste of divine promises,
and read the preciousness of them, in the greatness of them.

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers Expressions. Man, is vast in
expression, but divine Promises are vaster, Isa. 36.13.
than the Expressions of man. Did Rabshakeh say concerning Sennacherib, Hear ye
the words of the King; yea, of the great King, the King of Assyria? what then
may be said concerning Jehovah? Thus says Jehovah, the great God; the greatest
God; the God of Gods. Man's saying, is but saying; Gods saying, is doing. A
Writing may speak when man cannot; when man may not; yea (which is worse than
all) when man is not. Man, may express a promise, but the promise it self is
above expression. Some, have expressed the greatness of persons, and the
greatness of places; yea, some have pretended to express the greatness of the
Sun, and Moon; but, who can express the greatness of the Promise? Was not Paul
(next unto Christ) the greatest Orator that ever was concerned in Evangelical
work? and yet when he comes to concern himself with the greatness of the
Promise, he seems to me to be (as it were) at a loss. This profound Orator
(seems to me) to be (as it were) puzzled, 2 Cor. 4.17.
and posed. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us
a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory. Here, is glory; yea, a
weight of glory; yea, an eternal weight of glory; yea, an exceeding, and
eternal weight of glory; yea, a more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory;
yea a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. But, so far as I can
English it (according to the Greek Text) thus; For our forthwith light
affl^ction, works for us as it were Excellency into Excellency, eternal
weight of glory. Here are (1.) The Subjects; Affliction, and Glory. (2) The
Kind of these Subjects. Affliction, is light; Glory is a weight. (3) The
Continuance of these Subjects; the one, is for a moment; the other, is eternal.
Here is no parity; all is to demonstrate, that in this comparison, all degrees
of comparison are exceeded: Here is Hyperbole upon Hyperbole; which emphatical
Graecism (because other Tongues, cannot word by word express to the full) they
are forced to use words, and phrases, which exceed all comparison. May not
(now) the preciousness of the Promise, be read in the greatness of the Promise.

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers Conceptions. Man, is said to be
vaster in conception, than in expression; but, divine promises are so great,
that they are not (only) above the Tongue of man, but (also) above the Heart of
man; they do not (only) out-bid the Oratory, and Expression of man, but (also)
the Intellectuals, and Conception of man. Solomon (Isreal's Sage) says, The
Eye, Eccl. 1.8.
is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear filled with hearing. The Eye, may
see great things; the Ear, may hear greater things; and greater than those
seen, or heard, may enter into the Heart: Oh! but there is that couched, and
wrapped up in the Promise, which Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, nor Heart
conceived. Let the Apostle speak, who was graciously read in these things. Eye
has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither has it entered into the Heart of man the
things that God has prepared for them that love him; but God has revealed
them unto us by his Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.9, 10.
for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the depths of God; so the Greek.
But, what are these Depths of God? They are the Promises, together with the
Grace, and Glory, couched in the Promises. Divine Promises, are Divine Depths.
Is not (now) the preciousness of the Promise, legible in the greatness of it?

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers wants. The wants of Believers, are
many times great; very great; exceeding great. Sometimes, they want outward
Mercies. Oh, says one, my Barrel is empty! my Cruse is empty! I have Bread for
to Day, but none for to Morrow: Oh, says the Widow to the Man of God, 1 Kings
19.12.
I have but an handful of Meal in a Barrel, and a little Oil in a Cruse, and
behold I am gathering two Sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me, and my
Son, that we may eat it and die. Ah, poor Woman! Little did she think that by
Sustaining the Man of God, her Self should be Sustained by the God of Man. I go
to dress this for my Self, and my Son, and eat it, and die. As if she had said,
when this is eaten, we have no more to eat, but must die; when (this) is gone
(all) is gone, and we must go into an Eternity. The outward wants of Believers,
are sometimes great. Oh, say the Soul! I live in a Cottage; live upon a Common,
and have short Commons: But, Soul, Evangelical promises, are greater than thy
External wants. Psa. 34.10
The young Lions shall lack, and suffer hunger; but they that fear the Lord,
shall not want any good thing. If any Creatures in the World can preserve
themselves from Hunger, Lions can; if they do but roar, the Beasts will fall
down as a prey before them; but yet (says God) These, even these, shall rather
perish for hunger, than any one that fears me, shall want. But, as Believers
(sometimes) want outward Mercies, so (many times) want inward Refreshments. Oh!
say the Soul, I am like a Pelican in the Wilderness, and like a Dove in the
Valley, mourning until I can mourn no more, for the Sun of Righteousness; M^l.
4.2. 2 Cor. 4.6.
for a light of the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.
But, Soul, divine Promises, are greater than thy inward wants. Phil. 4.19.
My God shall supply all your need, according to his riches in Glory by Christ
Jesus. Here is a supply, and that from God; but of what? of need; yea, of all
need. But, says the Soul, if all outward wants should be supplied, yet there
are inward; and if all inward wants should be supplied, In terminis, and
totidem verbis. Psa. 84.11
yet there are outward. It is true, yet (in so many words) a supply for
internal, and external wants, is laid under Promise. Jehovah God, is a Sun, and
a Shield; Jehovah will give Grace, and Glory: Here is Grace, and Glory; a
supply of all inward wants: Is here all? no; if here be not enough, ye shall
have more; a supply of outward wants, is laid, and left, under promise also. No
good thing will be withhold from them that walk uprightly. God, will supply his
with (all) good, that is (for) their good.

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers weaknesses. There are few Believers
that are strong in every Grace; yea, few Believers, but are weak in every
Grace. It is true, some Believers, are stronger in some Graces, than other
Believers are; yea, stronger in some Graces, than Themselves are in other
Graces; for, as there is the master-sin; so there is the master-grace in every
Believer; thus, Faith, was the great Grace of Abraham; Meekness; of Moses;
Patience, of Job; and Love, of John; but weak Grace, may be true Grace; a spark
of Fire, is true Fire, and the Furnace is no more; a drop of Water, true Water,
and the Ocean is no more. It is pity that a Believer should be weak in Faith
(for if that Grace be weak, no Grace is strong) and yet weak Faith, is true
Faith. Romans 14.1
Him that is weak in the Faith receive (not reject) but not to doubtful
disputations. I am this day weak (says David) though I be anointed King. Oh!
says the Soul, I am this day weak, though I am in Christ: Oh! says the Soul,
I am weak; weak as water: The pulse of my Grace does not beat, or it beats so
weakly, that I can scarcely tell whether I be alive, or no. But, Soul, divine
Promises, they are greater than thy weaknesses. If we believe not, yet he
abides faithful, he cannot deny himself. This, 2 Timothy 2.13.
is not spoken of an unbelieving man, but of a man that has much unbelief; if
we believe not; though Faith be at ebb, and Unbelief at flood, yet Christ
abides faithful, and cannot deny himself. Though Peter deny Christ, yet Christ
does not deny Peter. It is said of an Emperor, that he never minded to do what
he promised; Tiberiu^.
but this cannot be said of Christ; for he cannot deny himself.

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers Fears. The Fears of Believers are
many times great; very great; exceeding great. A Pannick Fear, is a cursed
weed; but is not he a Miracle among men, that has not sometimes a pang of
forbidden Fear? When the Corpse of a Scottish Minister was put into the Grave,
an Earl (being there) said, here lays the Body of one, Mr. Knox. Earl of Murray.
who (in his life) never feared the Face of any man. But, can this be said of
every Member of Christ? Nay, of every Minister of Christ? It was (also) a great
word of another; Athanasius
Though an Army should encamp me, yet will I not fear. The Fears of Believers
are many times great, very great, exceeding great; so great, that they may
reach the Heart; and Heart-Fears, are the greatest Fears; but, now, there is
enough in one promise to dissipate the cloud of a thousand Fears. Oh! says one,
I shall one day fall by the hands of this Saul; of this Goliath of Gath; but, if
I do not fall by the hands of man, I shall fall by the hands of God. Oh! says
another, I fear my carcass will fall in the wilderness; I fear I shall die by
the way; I fear I shall not enter into the Land of Promise. Oh! says a third,
Presence.
I fear that I shall be impoverished, or imprisoned; that I shall be banished,
or burned. But, Soul, the Promise, Propriety.
in the greatness of it, out-bids, and outvies the greatness of Fear: Fear not;
why? for I am with thee; Isa. 41.10.
there is presence: Be not afraid; why? for I am thy God: Is here all? No: I
will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee, with the
right hand of my righteousness. Promise.
But, what says a third? Oh! my fears are great; it is night now, and I fear it
will never be day more: Oh! the Sun is gone down upon my Horizon, and I fear it
will never rise more. But, Soul, there is enough in the promise to scatter this
Fear. Mal. 4.2.
Unto you that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing
in his wings, and ye shall go forth, and grow up as Calves of the stall. Is not
the firmamental Sun as constant in rising, as in setting? and is not the Day as
constant as the Night? Oh! says a fourth, my fears are great; my Neighbors
have left me; my Familiars have left me, my Relations have left me; yea, my God
has left me, and that is a sad leaving indeed. Isa. 49.14.
The Lord has forsak^n me, my God has forgotten me. I am not (only) out of
the Hand of God, but (also) out of the Hear of God: I am not (only) forsaken,
but (also) forgotten; God, is not (only) gone, but (also) for (ever) gone: I am
left by a God, and it is better to be left by all the world, than to be left by
God. But Soul, there is that laid and lodged in the Promise, that will weigh
down this Fear. Is there such another Promise, which (according to the Greek;
for there are five Negatives in it) may be read thus? For he has said, I will
not, Heb. 13.5.
not leave thee; I will never, not, not forsake thee. May not (now) the
preciousness of the Promise be read in the geatness of it?

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers Faith. Faith (if I may so write) is
mighty, and can do mighty things. What cannot Faith do? Faith, can do more than
Force. As it is true, to believe, is very difficult; it is as true, unto him
that believes all things are possible. Heb. 11.30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.
Read but that Scriptural Martyrology, which is the Book Martyrs epitomized,
and there you may find the noble Acts of Faith. It is Faith that overcomes the
world. This is the victory that overcomes the world, 1 John 5.4.
even our Faith. Yea, it is Faith, that makes a Conquest upon the God of this
world. Resist the Devil, Jam. 4.7.
and he will flee from you. But, how shall he be resisted? In the Faith. Whom
resist steadfast in the Faith. 1 Pet. 5.9.
Oh the mighty power of Faith! But I dare assert, that you are not to take the
Act of Faith, without Christ, the Object of Faith. What can the Instrument do
without the Hand? Indeed, the Faith of Believers, can do much; but Faith can do
nothing unless it be laid in the Bosom, and Bowels of the Promise. Abraham's
Faith was exceeding great; He, was very gray, and so was his Consort; but what
made his Faith so strong? He had the promise of a strong God, and this gave
strength to his Faith. He staggered not at the promiso through unbelief, Romans
4.19, 20, 21.
but was strong in Faith, giving glory to God: And being fully persuaded, that
what he had promised, he was able also to perform. Is there not now a greatness
in the Promise? and is not the preciousness of it, legible in the greatness of
it?

Divine Promises, greater than a Believers Corruptions. Consider the evil of
Sin, and that will appear to be exceeding great. Sin, has Evil; all Evil, and
nothing but Evil in it. Sin, is only evil; altogether evil; always evil. Romans
7.13
That sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful: or, that Sin, by
the Commandment, (...)
might become hyperbolically sinful: or, that Sin, by the Commandment, might
become a Sinner to a wonder; a Sinner above wonder; beyond comparison. Sin, is
a darkening of the Glory of God; a defacing of the Image of God; a crucifying
of the Son of God; a grieving of the Spirit of God; and a wro^ging of the Soul
of man. There is Evil enough in Sin to undo all the world. Is not Sin the cry
of the damned in Hell? and should not Sin be the cry of the dead upon Earth? Is
there not a world of Sin within Thee? and within Me? yea, a world of Sin within
Thee, and within Me, not yet seen by Thee, and by Me? Now, though Sin be so
great an Evil, that nothing is so great, yet the Greatness, and Goodness of God
wrapped up in the Promise, Isa. 1.18.
is greater than Sin. Though your sins be as Scarlet, they shall be white as
Snow; and though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool. This Promise
is great, and precious as well as great.

Divine Promises, great as divine Commands. The Commands of God are great;
exceeding great. Acts 16.31.
Is not Faith a great Command? Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Spira, sound
it so, who said, Ye call upon me to believe, I tell you I cannot believe: Oh!
how fain would I believe, but I cannot: It is as possible to keep the Moral
Law, as to believe; for, it is natural to work (for) Life, but supernatural to
believe (for) Life. Faith, is a great work; Joh. 6.29.
but, now, he that wills it, works it. This, is the work of God, that ye
believe in him whom he has sent. Faith, is (the) work; the work that God
esteems in stead of all works. But, Faith, is not (only) a work so esteemed
(by) God, Col. 2.12.
but it is (also) the work (of) God. It is called a Faith of the Operation of
God. God, commands the making of a new heart, and a new spirit; and might he
not as well have commanded the making of a new Heaven, Ezekiel. 18.31.
and a new Earth? Make ye a new heart, and a new spirit; for why will ye die,
oh house of Israel? But, what God commands (his) to do in one place, he
promises to do (for) his in another place. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27.
A new heart will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I
will cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgments and do
them. I will give you Legs, and lead you too: I will habituate the Soul with
Grace, and actuate Grace (in) the Soul, and (for) the Soul. As the Habit, so
the Act of Grace shall be from me. May not (now) the preciousness of the
Promise be read in the greatness of it?

Promises are as great (if not greater) than Divine Threatenings. Has God
threatened the Unbeliever with Darkness and Death? He has promised to the
Believer light, and life. Romans 5.21.
Has God threatened the Unbeliever with Damnation? he has promised unto the
Believer Salvation. Does Sin reign unto Death? the second Death? Grace reigns
(thorough righteousness) unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Is the
wages of Sin, Death? the first, and the second Death; all manner of Deaths; the
portion of a Christless Soul, is nothing else but Death; Romans 6.23. Exodus 20.5,
6.
his whole estate lies in the valley of the shadow of death. But, now, though
the stipend of sin be death, yet the gift of God is eternal life, thorough
Jesus Christ our Lord. Has God visited Iniquity to the third, and fourth
Generation? He shows mercy unto thousands of Generations. preciousness of the
Promise be read in the greatness of it? Jer. 10.6.


Divine Promises, they are like unto God Himself. God is great; exceeding
great. There is none like unto thee, Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is
great in might. Now, whatever is great in God, he has made it over (by
promise) unto Believers. Taste.

His Power. The Lord can do whatsoever he will, though he will not d^
whatsoever he can: His Power has no Patent, but ^s Pleasure. Power, belongs
to God. God, is as much acted in making a Fly, as in making an Elephant. The
Power of God, is greater than the power of Sin; Nah. 1.3.
than the power of Men; than the power of Devils. The Lord is slow to Anger,
and of great Power, and will not at all acquit the wicked. Now, the Power of
God, Jer. 39.18.
is made over by promise unto the People of God, who make him the Object of
their Trust. I will surely deliver thee, and thou shall not fall by the sword,
but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee,

His Presence. As the power, so the presence of God, is made over by promise
unto the People of God. What would the Joys of Heaven be (were it not for the
presence of God there) but as a Funeral Banquet, Psalm. 16.11.
where there is much provision, but no meat? In thy presence is fullness of joy,
and at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. To be with the Lord for
a moment, is a Heaven upon Earth; but to be with the Lord for ever, is the
Heaven of Heavens. The presence of God, is the Heaven of Heaven; the Joy of
Heaven; the Life of Heaven, and of All that shall arrive there. Now, the
presence of God, Isa. 43.2.
is made over by promise, to the People of God. When thou passest thorough the
waters, I will be with thee; and thorough the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee; when thou walk thorough the fire, thou shall not be burnt, nor shall
the flame kindle upon thee. God, is with his in the fire, and in the water,
(though these be amazing, and amusing elements) and his presence is more than
deliverance. If God be with his, though all evil be upon them, yet no evil
touches them. The presence of the chief Good, is banishment to all evil.

His Pardon. of Sin, is a singular mercy, of the plural number, if a convinced
or deserted Soul may speak. The Pardon of Pope Alexander the Sixth, Heb. 8.12.
was for Thirty thousand Years; but this Pardon (notwithstanding the prodigious
length of it) was not worth the having; worth the hearing; for God (only) can
forgive Sin. I will be merciful unto their unrighte^^ (...), their sins, and
their iniquities, will I remember no more. Here are three words,
unrighteousness, sins and iniquities; to indicate, and intimate, that God will
forgive all kinds, and degrees of sins. Ex. 34.7.
The number of words, imply the number of sins. The Scripture (in propounding
Gospel-Immunties) sometimes uses three words; Jer. 31.34.
forgiving Iniquity, Transgression, and Sin: sometimes, two words; I will
forgive their Iniquity, Jer. 33.8.
and will remember their Sin no more: sometimes, but one word; I will cleanse
them from all their Iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will
pardon all their Iniquities whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have
transgressed against me.

His Providence. works of God, are distinguished into two sorts, of Creation,
and Providence. It is not good to outrun Providence, Perkin' s Golden Chain.
Acts 17.28. Isa. 43.1, 4.
and it is as bad to loyter, and lag behind it. God's Providence (says one) is
either General, which extends it self to the whole world; in whom we live, and
move, and have our Being: or, Special, which he shows toward his Church; Oh
Jacob, and Israel! Fear not, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine; I
will give men for thee, and people for thy life. All Creatures, have a teaching
Voice, and read us Divinity-Lectures of Divine Providence. Is not that a true
Axiom in Divinity? Genesis 22.14.
Providence is a Creation continued. Abraham called the name of the place
(where the Ram was caught) Jehovah-jireh (the Lord will see, or provide;
noting, the special Providence of God in Distresses) as it is said unto this
day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. Now, this Providence of God, is
his most wise, just, Descriptio.
and powerful discerning, disposing, and preserving of all things, and persons,
according to his eternal, and immutable knowledge, and will, for such ends, as
himself has purposed from everlasting. Mat. 10.29, 30.
Are not two Sparrows sold for a Farthing? (the tenth part of a Roman Penny, and
(of our Coin) an Halfpenny Farthing;) and not one of them shall fall on the
ground without your Father: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
The hairs of our heads are innumerable to Us, but they are numerable to God.
These words, at once intimate, God's Care of all, and Satan's Malice against
all. God, will have an Account of every Hair: The Enemies cannot pull off a
Hair, but God will call them to a Reckoning for it.

The Efflux of his Spirit. As the Power, presence of God; the Pardon, and
Providence of God, so an Efflux of the Spirit of God, is laid, and left, Isa.
44.3.
under promise. I will pour water upon the thirsty, and floods upon the dry
ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
offspring. Is not deadness of Spirit the Grave (as it were) of many Graces?
The Spirit of God, is not the light within every man, God the Father, Son,
Faldo 's Key, etc. p. 85.
and Holy Spirit, without distinction, as a Generation of a late Edition, not
(for want of Ignorance, or being too much proselited, and become the Spawn of
the Romists) assert. The Soul, without the Spirit, and its Gales, is like a
Ship without Sails, and Wind. Now, Joel 2.28
a greater dimension, and efflux of the Spirit, is laid, and left, under
promise. And it shall come to pass, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all
flesh.

His Goodness. is good; very good, and does good. Psalm. 27.13.
He is abundant in goodness, and truth. I had fainted, had I not believed, to
see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Had not the goodness of
God, been laid under promise, how should it have been believed? For, as the
Precept, is a Rule for Obedience, so the Promise, is a ground for Faith. The
goodness of God, is unto wonder, and this is the matter of the Psalmist's
wonder. Psalm. 31.19.
Oh, how great is thy goodness, which thou have laid up for those that fear
Thee; which thou have wrought for them that trust in Thee, before the sons of
men!

His Faithfulness. is unfaithful, but God is faithful. 2 Timothy 2.13.
Though we believe not, yet he abides faithful, he cannot deny himself. This,
is not spoken of Unbelievers, but of persons that might be very unbelieving:
Though our Faith be reduced to a low ebb; though Fear has taken the wall of
Faith; though Fear be at flood, Pontius Centurio. Clark' s Mirror, p. 206.
and Faith at ebb; yet he abides faithful, he cannot deny himself. One of
Caesar's Captains, taken by Scipio, had his life proffered him, with an
honorable place in Pompey's Army, if he would leave Caesar, and serve Pompey;
but he answered, I will rather dye, than falsify my Faith to Caesar. Did man
(thus) say? Psalm. 89.33.
What may God (then) say? As God is faithful, who has promised, so God has
laid his faithfulness under promise. I will not suffer my faithfulness to fail;
or lie.

His Counsel. Spirit, and G^odness, Consilium malum, Consultori pessimum.
and Faithfulness, so his Counsel under promise. Counsel, is the Spirit, and
Quintessence of Reason; Reason drops out, and distills it self into Counsel. It
is an old Adage, or Proverb, That bad Counsel, is worst to the Counselor.
Princes (formerly) used to have learned men about them, whom they called
Remembrancers: Themistocles, had his Anaxagoras; Alexander, his Aristotle;
Scipio, his Panaetius, and Polybius; but, David (in all his straights) asked
counsel of the Lord, Psalm. 119.24.
and consulted him as his Oracle. Thy Testimonies also are my delight, and my
Counselors: or, the Men of my Counsel. Orator said, Men of Counsel, are to a
Commonwealth, Margent.
as the Mind, Reason, or Understanding, is to any particular man. Young men's
Counsels, Cicero. Descriptio.
are very dangerous; Jeroboam lost ten Tribes by following them. Counsel, is
good Advice given, and (ought to be taken) about things to be done. The
Grecians (in matters of great importance) did resort (in respect of Counsel) to
the Temple of Apollo. Ex. 18.26
The small matters were judged by the Heads of the People, but the hard Causes
were brought unto Moses. God, did speak by a M^ses, but now he speaks by a
Messiah, Heb. 1.2.
whom he has appointed Heir of all things. Of old (also) they enquired of
Abel. 2 Samuel 20.18.
They plainly spoke in the beginning, saying, Surely they will ask of Abel, and
so make an end. Abel, was a City; the Inhabitants thereof (in former times)
being reputed just, and p^udent, were (in affairs of weight) resorted unto for
Counsel; whence it grew into a Proverb, That they who needed Advice, should ask
at Abel. Others, think, that this City-Matron, puts Joab in mind of the old
Law, which commanded, Deuteronomy. 20.10, 11.
that a City should be summoned, before besieged, and a Cessation of Arms, upon
embracing Conditions of Peace. But, to a Christ, should the Soul now go for
counsel, and him should the Soul now consult as an Oracle, who infallibly thus
speaks; Counsel is mine, Prove. 8.14. Luke 12.10, 11, 12
and sound wisdom; I am understanding, I have strength. The highest, and the
holiest counsel, is laid, and left, under promise. When they bring you unto
Synagogues, Magistrates, and Powers, take ye no thought how, or what thing ye
shall answer, or what ye shall say; for the holy Spirit shall teach you in the
same hour, what ye ought to say.

His Conduct. As God has laid his Counsel, Conduct under promise. He shall
feed his flock like a shepherd: There is feeding; but, is there all? no: Isa.
40.11
He shall gather the Lambs with his Arm: There is gathering; but, is here all?
no; He shall carry them in his Bosom: There is carrying; but, is here all? no;
there is leading also, and that gently, those with young; or that give suck.
Oh, says the Soul, the way to Hell is so much beaten, and the way to Heaven is
so little beaten, that I know not how to go, without leading! Oh, says
another, the way to Hell, is down-hill, but the way to Heaven, is up-hill, that
I know not how to go without leading! But, Soul, leading is laid, and left
under promise. I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, Isa. 42.16.
I will lead them in paths that they have not known.

Himself. has laid himself under promise. Ye shall be my people, Ezekiel. 36.28.
and I will be your God. Who is able to say what God is? One, being asked what
God was, answered, He, must be a God, that can give a Solution to this
Question. Now, God Himself, has laid Himself under promise. 2 Cor. 6.18.
I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons, and daughters, says the
Lord Almighty.

Thus, there are four things, recorded, and transmitted to Posterity in the
preciousness of them.

There is a precious Soul. Redemption of the Soul is precious; so the Soul,
that is redeemed, is precious. The precious sons of Sion, comparable to fine
gold, Lam. 4.2.
how are they esteemed as earthen Pitchers, the work of the hands of the
Potter? These, are precious in the eyes of God, but vile in the eyes of the
world.

There is precious Faith. is a precious Plant; an outlandish Plant; a Plant of
God's own planting, and of a divine Extract. Faith, is not a Native, but a
Donative; it is Heaven-born, and not a Slip growing in our own Garden. 2 Pet.
1.1.
To all that have obtained like precious faith.

There is a precious Christ. are precious. Christ, is (a) Pearl; yea (the)
Pearl; the Pearl of great price, of greatest price. It would puzzle and pose,
Lam entius.
not (only) all the Saints, but (also) all the Angels, to bring in the worth,
and the weight, of this Pearl. He can never dye a Bankrupt, (worse than
nothing) nor a Beggar (worth nothing) that has this Pearl. 1 Pet. 2.7.
Unto you therefore which believe, he is precious: Or, Honor; Greek. One
thinks, (...) for (...)
that the Abstract, is put for the Concrete, Honor, for honorable, and precious.

There is a precious Promise. 2 Pet. 1.4
So that, here is a precious Saint, thorough precious Faith, closing with a
precious Christ, in a precious Promise.

DIRECT. VI.
ART actually in Christ? Direct. 6.
Drink (then) of the Brook by the way, and lift up thy head. Blessed are the
dead which dye in the Lord, Rev. 14.13.
yea, from henceforth says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors,
and their works do follow them. In this Bundle of Myrrh; in this Text, and
Truth, so sweetly-sweet, there is the Subject, and the Predicate.

The Subject. Blessing. Blessed. The word seems to signify greatly blessed,
(...)
and happy.

The Predicate. referrible to two Heads; the Pronunciation of it, and the
Amplification of it.

The Pronunciation of it. Blessed are the dead, which dye in the Lord, yea,
from hencesorth, says the Spirit. Wherein, there are these things.

The Persons. (without Heart) so the Greek, (...). Primum vivens, ultimum
morien^. Arist.
for, as Life begins, so Death ends in the Heart: One, therefore, calls
the Heart, the first living, and the last dying. The Dead; blessed, are the
Dead; or, the without Heart.

A Description of these Persons, Christ Jesus the Lord; in the Faith of Christ
Jesus the Lord. Which dye (in) the Lord, or (for) the Lord; for the Lord Jesus;
for the sake of the Lord Jesus; so Beza, and Mede; that pass thorough a violent
death; that suffer death for Christ, and lay down their Blood on this side the
Grave: But, I rather understand it with others, which dye (in) the Lord; in the
Faith of the Lord Jesus, (...) Heb. 11.13.
for the One is blessed as well as the Other. All these dyed in Faith.
According to Faith, so the Greek; that is, these dyed in the Faith of the
Person of Christ, that was to come; but Believers now dye in the Faith of the
Person of Christ that did come; that had his Veins breathed, and his Vitals let
out upon the Cross.

The Blessing pronounced upon these described persons. dye in the Faith of
Christ, are blessed.

The timing of this pronounced Blessing, persons. From henceforth. (...)
From this time, so the Greek. The Soul of a person living, and dying in a
Christ, goes not to Purgatory, but to Glory, when Time goes in to Eternity.
Luke 23.43.
To day shall thou be with me in Paradise; and that Paradise the Heaven of
Heavens.

The infallible Testimony concerning the blessedness pronounced upon these
described persons. Spirit.

The Amplification of it. That they may rest from their labors, and their
works do follow them. Now, this Amplification, falls under a twofold Notion,
Rest, and Reward; to these distinctly.

Rest. That they may rest from their labors. rest from the labor of their
particular Callings; from their Afflictions, and Persecutions; from their Sins,
and Sorrows; from their Temptations, and Tribulations; from their Distresses,
and Desertions. The Grave, is the House, and Bed of the Body, to all that dye;
Heaven, is the Rest, and House of the Soul, to all those who dye in the Lord.
Psalm. 19.11.
Saints (here) have a Rest (in) their labors; in the keeping of them, there is
great reward; but, Saints (hereafter) shall have a Rest (from) their labors,
that they may rest from their labors.

Reward. And their works do follow them. Debt, but in a way of Grace; not in a
way of Merit, but in a way of Mercy. Their works follow them, go with them, for
the words (says one) well weighed, sound so. Leigh, in loc.
Works (here) are put metonimically for the wages, and reward of their works;
which reward is not in a way of merit, but in a way of mercy. Every one shall
receive according to what he has done, whether it be good, or bad. 2 Cor. 5.10.
They shall follow their works no more, who are followed by their works. And
their works do follow them. Not in kind; the very same individual works (which
they have done here) follow them not (for they are transient Acts, and have no
subsistency) but the Blessing which lie in the promise for such works, when
Believers die, their works follow them (thorough free grace) in glorious
rewards; when Unbelievers dye, their works follow them (thorough divine
Justice) in everlasting torments. Mariners, carry Glasses of Spirits along with
them, in their dangerous, and difficult Voyages. Art actually in Christ? Then
the Cross is the way to the Crown, and the Wilderness is the way to Canaan;
thou art (for ought I see) going back into the Wilderness, take (therefore)
these comfortable Cordials along with thee, in thy progress to the Holy Land.

Art astually in Christ? Cordial I. Phi. 1.21.
Triumph (then) for thou shall be no loser, but a gainer by Death. To me to
live is Christ, and to dye is gain. A Soul (in) Christ, is a great gainer by
Death, but a Soul (out) of Christ, is a great loser by Death; he loses these
lesser and lower things; we brought nothing into this world, and it is as
certain we can carry nothing out; this man loses his company; a carnal, and a
cursed crew; a drinking and a damning crew; this man takes leave of all his
Relations at once, Father, and Mother; Wife, and Children; yea, this man (
living, and dying out of Christ) loses his Soul, Matthew. 16.26.
and that is a considerable loss; an universal loss; an irreparable loss; a
kind of an infinite loss, for it is the loss of an infinite God, and this God a
God of infinite love. Saul, dying, lost his Kingdom, and (I fear) his Soul too:
Hered, dying, lost his Crown, and (I fear) his Soul too: But, now, a Soul
living, and dying in Christ, is a greater Gainer, than Loser by Death; for
Death will be an Outlet to Sin, and an Inlet to Glory.

Art actually in Christ? Death will be an Outlet to Sin. Sin, is a fatal
Monosyllable. As Grace is the best, so Sin is the worst Monosyllable; as Love
is the best, so Lust is the worst Monosyllable; now, will it be any loss, but a
gain, to lose sin? where is the Soul that would keep it, who knows that every
thing less than Hell, is less than Sin? A Soul (living, and dying in Christ)
leaves his Bags, Romans 6.7.
and his Barns; his Friends, and Relations, but he leaves his Sins also, which
is a greater Gain, than the other a Loss. Death, gives, a Bill of Divorce to
Sin. He that is dead, is freed from Sin. The Body sins not without the Soul.
Here, every Soul in Christ, cries out of one Sin, or another: Oh the pride of
my Heart says one, and the passion of my Heart says another! Oh the darkness
of my Heart says one, and the deadness of mine says another! Oh the trea^hery
of my Soul says one, and the tympany of mine says another! Oh the wantonness
of my Spirit says one, and the worldliness of mine says another! But, there
will be no complaining in the Grave, when thy Head has a pillow of Dust. As
there will be (no working in the Grave) so there will be no sinning in the
Grave; when the Soul takes leave of the Body, then Sin takes leave of the Soul,
and of the Body too, and that for ever.

Art actually in Christ? Death will be an Inlet to Glory. If Christ be thine,
and thou be Christ's, then Death to thee will be the beginning of life. Thou
layest down one life, to take up another; and that which thou take up, is far
better than that which thou layest down. Phi. 1.23.
Lend an ear to the Apostle, I am in a straight between two, having a desire to
depart, and to be with Christ, (...)
which is far better. For I am in a strait; the word is very significant, and a
metaphor, not (only) from the straitning of the Body by diseases, but (also)
of the coangustation, or straitning of a City, on every side besieged; a
metaphor taken from the straitness of places, where we are intercepted by an
enemy, Leigh Cri. sac. in loc.
shut up, not finding an issue. Yea, it signifies also (the) straitning, and
perplexity of the mind, when one knows not what to do, and whither to turn
him; As if the Apostle had said, I am drawn diverse ways; this way, with the
desire of Christ; that way, with the love of the Brethren, for whom my life in
the flesh is necessary. I am in a strait, having a desire; a vehement, earnest,
and continued desire: Having a desire to depart; to dye, and to be with Christ:
Death, of it self, should not be desired, because this desire crosses nature;
the grand desire to dye, should not be to be out of the world, but to be with
Christ; which may confute the error of those who dream, that the Soul (
separated from the Body) does sleep. Which is far better. It is very
significant in the Original; far much better; or, much more better.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial II.
Triumph (then) for Death will strip thee of thy Rags of Mortality. Queen
Esther, appears before King Ahasuerus in her Royal Apparel. If Joshuah appears
before an Angel, he must have change of raiment. Could not he appear before an
Angel in his own Rags? How then shall a Soul appear before God, without
Christ's Robes? There is no appearing before God in the Rags of Mortality, nor
in the Rags of Morality. Self-righteousness, is a Rag; yea, a menstruous Cloth.
Morality, is but old Adam, in another Dress. Phi. 3.7, 8, 9.
What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ; yea, doubtless,
and I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, (...) quod
canibus exponitur.
and do count them but dung (Dogsmeat, so the Greek) that I may win Christ; And
be found in him (in him here, and in him hereafter) not having mine own
righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is thorough the faith of
Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith. Death, is a putting off the
Rags of Mortality, and Morality, that the Soul may be decked, and diessed, with
the Robes of Glory.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial III.
Triumph (also) whether living, or dying, thou art Christ's. Blessed are they
that live in the Lord, and blessed are they that dye in the Lord. There are
many that live not in the Lord, and dye not in the Lord; that living, and
dying, are not the Lords; but while thou live, and when thou dyest, thou art
the Lords, for thou art Christ's. Romans 14.7, 8.
None of us lives to himself, and no man dies to himself; for, whether we
live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord; whether
we live (therefore) or dye, we are the Lords, Now, to have a Christ in Life,
and a Christ at Death, is not this a comfortable Cordial? Art the Lords in
Life, and the Lords at Death? Go (then) from a Reflection of this Truth, as
Hannah did from Eli, and let thy countenance be no more sad, at the thoughts of
Death. Do men say, the Nations are angry? they are consulting, conspiring, and
confederating against Christ, and those that are Christ's; and thou may go
bleeding out of the world, or burning out of the world; true, says the Soul,
but Christ is mine (while) I live, and will be mine (when) I dye. Does
Conscience say, Winter is coming? a Storm is at Hand; we may be near a shower
of blood; the winds are like to rise, and be prodigious; the waves are like to
roar, and be impetuous; true, says the Soul, but Christ is mine (while) I
live, and will be mine (when) I dye. Does Satan say, thy Life is uncertain, and
thy Death is certain? Man is mortal, and not a match for Death; true, says the
Soul, but whether I live, or dye, I am the Lords. It is said in the Life, and
Death, of a worthy Minister, Mr. Jessey.
That he passed unto Glory triumphing, rejoicing under the very stroke of Death.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial IV.
Triumph (also) for Death will arrive, and anchor thee in a desirable, and
delectable Harbor, and Haven. Ah poor Soul! it may be thou have (as it were)
been at Sea ever since thy new Birth; thy second Birth; and have met with
winds, and waves there; with storms, and tempests there; it may be thou have
been without Sun-light there; without Moonlight there; yea, without Starlight
there; but, when Death arrests thy Body, it will arrive thy Soul at a
desirable, and delectable, Harbor, and Haven; yea, at a Harbor, and Haven, of
desire, and delight. The Navigator meets with hard things at Sea; there is
(often) nothing but difficulty in view; danger, in view; yea, Death in view;
but, he forgets these, when he comes within sight of the Harbor; within sight
of the Haven: But, Soul, what Harbor like unto Heaven? what Haven like unto
Heaven? when thou art landed at this Port, at this Paradise, thou will then
forget thy Trials, and Troubles, and Travels; thy Sicknesses, and Solitudes,
and Sufferings. Luke 23.43.
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shall thou be with me
in Paradise. This Text, is like a bundle of myrrh, and being so sweetly-sweet,
I shall touch upon the Meditations flowing from it.

That (unto the worst) has Christ showed mercy (at last.) Meditat.
Thou; Thee. Verily I say unto Thee; Thou. This man had been very bad, for he
had been a Thief, and Theft is a great Sin, for it is the breach of the great
Command, of the greatest God. This man had sinned, and this man was to suffer
for his sin; yea, to suffer death for his sin; and yet Christ had mercy upon
him. Though this man had lived to his last day, and (possibly) to a little part
of that day, yet Christ said unto him, To day; It is very emphatical, Mat. 20.9.
To day shall thou be with me in Paradise. The Savior promises, more than the
Sinner asks. He, that came into the Vineyard, at the eleventh hour, had his
penny, had his pay.

That Christ was God, flesh. Shall; Thou shall. This Text, and Truth, prove the
Deity, and Divinity of Christ; Thou shall. Had not Christ been God, he would
not have spoken thus; and had not Christ been God, he could not have thus
spoken; 1 Timothy 3.16.
Thou shall. Great is the mystery of Godliness, God was manifest in the flesh.

That words of Assurance, Christ's words. No Soul, has a word of Assurance for
Heaven, until Christ speaks it. John 6.63, 68.
The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life. To day
shall thou be. If Christ be a Mute, the Soul is in doubt. I that speak unto
thee am he. If Christ be a Mute, the Soul is in a maze. If Christ be silent,
the Soul is sad. A word of Assurance is from Christ. Whither should we ge, but
unto thee? thou have the words of eternal life. No voice, but the voice of
Christ, will still the voice of Desperation. If the Soul be comforted, Isa.
51.12.
and assured, Christ must be the Text, and the Preacher too. I, even I, am he
that comfort thee. Not I, with another; not I, or another; but I, and no
other.

That Paradise is under promise for Converts. Glory, is entailed upon Grace;
Happiness, is entailed upon Holiness, and the Crown is appointed for the
Converts Head. Thou. That this person was convinced, appears in the Context:
Luke 23.40, 41, 42
Do not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we
indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man has
done nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me, when thou come
into thy Kingdom. That this person (also) was converted, appears in the Text,
or Christ would not have laid Paradise under promise; 1 Cor. 6.9
for Paradise is for none but Converts of his own making: Thou shall be in
Paradise. The unrighteous, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. The
unrighteous (as) unrighteous, and in a (state) of unrighteousness, Mat. 18.3.
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Except ye be converted, and become as
little children, ye shall not, not (so the Greek) enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven. Persons, must be converted, as well as convinced; and changed, as well
as called, or they cannot be passed thorough the Gates into the City. Ye shall
not, not, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Not, not; two Negatives, strengthen
an Affirmative.

That, which makes Paradise, a Paradise indeed, Christ there. With me: Thou
shall be with me in Paradise. What would a Paradise be, without Christ? What
would Heaven be, though Angels be there, and the Spirits of just men made
perfect be there, if Christ were not there? Whom have I in Heaven but thee? As
if the Psalmist had said, Heaven, would not be a Heaven to me, were it not for
thee. Christ's being with the Soul (here) makes a Heaven (here) and the Souls
being with Christ (hereafter) makes a Heaven (hereafter.) Would not Heaven be a
Baca, a valley of tears? A Bochim, a house of mourning, if the Soul were not to
find Christ there? John 14.1, 2, 3.
Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me; in my
Fathers house are many Mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you, I go
to prepare a place for you; And if I go, and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto my self, that where I am, there ye may be also.

That the Soul of a Convert is a Blossom of Eternity, Stamp of Immortality. As
the Mortality of the Body, so the Immortality of the Soul, is legible in this
Text, and Truth. Thou shall be with me, and that in Paradise. Though thy Body
dye, yet thy Soul shall live; yea, live with me. Fear not them which kill the
Body, Mat. 10.28.
but are not able to kill the Soul. Though the Body dies, the Soul lives.

That when Time goes into Eternity, then the Converts Soul shall go into Glory.
Thou art upon earth to day, and thou shall be in Heaven to day. Thy Body, is
upon a piece of timber this morning, but thy Soul shall be in a place of
Triumph before night. To day. To be in Paradise is much, but (to day) to be
there, is more: The time, accents the mercy. For Christ to speak in the Future
Tense, to a graceless Soul, is not so amazing, and amusing, as for Christ to
speak in the Present Tense: For Christ to say, He that believes not shall be
damned, is sad; but to say, Thou Fool, this night shall thy Soul be required of
thee, this is sadder. For Christ to say, He that believes, shall have
everlasting life, is much; but for Christ to say, To day shall thou be with me
in Paradise, is much more. Though thou have been sinning to (this) day, yet
after (this) day, thou shall never more sin. All persons, are bound for Hell,
or for Heaven, for there is no Purgatory, but what is in the foolish fancy of
the blind and bloody; of the barbarous, and butchering Papists. This cruel
Crew, cast all men into three Ranks.

Some, are Apostles, and Martyrs; persons, eminently godly; immediately to
Heaven.

Some, are Apostates, and Persecuters of the Faith; these (they say) go
immediately to Hell.

There is a middle sort, of ordinary sinners, that immediately (after death) go
neither to Heaven, Hell, but to Purgatory; where (they say) they must bear the
punishment of their sins, until they be prayed out. Luke 16.22, 23.
But, all Souls are bound for Heaven, or Hell. The poor man dying, arrived at
Heaven; the rich man dying, arrived at Hell. The Soul of this Convert, was to
be, where the Soul of Christ was to be, and did not his Soul go into Glory?
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, Luke 24.26.
and to enter into his Glory? Was not the Soul of this Convert in Heaven,
before his Body was in the Grave? Stephen dyed in this Faith, that the Soul of
a Convert goes into Glory, when his Time goes into Eternity, or, he would not
have prayed, Acts 7.59
Lord Jesus receive my Spirit. They stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and
saying, Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial V.
Triumph (also) for Death will grave (and that at once) all thy Cares, and
Snares; all thy Fears, and Tears; all thy Temptations, and Tribulations.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Cares. Martha, was careful,
and troubled, about many things: As it is said, Luke 10.40. (...). Luke 10.41.
(...).
She was cumbred about much serving; cumbred: The Greek word to cumber, or be
cumbred, signifies to be drawn, or wried round, and round about; so it is said,
Martha, Martha, thou art careful, and troubled, about many things. Martha,
Martha; she is named twice, and the name signifies Bitter; as if Christ had
said, Bitter, Bitter. 1. Bitter to her self, in making her self a Drudge, and
neglecting the Word. 2. To her Sister, in chiding, and accusing her. Thou art
careful; The word signifies excessive, and sinful, Care, (...)
and Solicitude. And troubled; The word seems to signify, anxiously to be
wreathed, with the difficulty of a thing to be accomplished. Martha, was
excessively, and forbiddenly careful, and thoughtful; yea, anxiously wreathed;
she had too much Care, and Trouble, when she was upon earth, but she has no
care upon her now she is in Heaven. Is not this the cry here? Bread, for the
day; Bread, by the way. Is not this the Cry here? Bread, for me, and Bread for
mine: A little meal in my Barrel, Eccl. 9.10
and a little Oil in my Cruse. Oh (says the Widow) I am going to bake this Cake
for me, and my Son, and then to dye. But, now. Soul, Death, will grave all thy
Cares; for, there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the
Grave. whither thou go. This life, is a day of working, but death, is a
night of resting: This life, is a continued motion, but death, is a continued
rest.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Snares. There is a Snare
cast in all our ways; Hos. 5.1.
there is a Snare on Mizpah, and a Net spread upon Tabor. These, were two
Mountains; the first signifying a Beacon, or Watchtower; the last signifying
Housing, or Purity. Soul, there is a Suare cast in the Country, and in the
City; a Snare cast in the Church, and in the Closet. Gideon, made an Ephod,
after which Israel went a whoring; Judge. 8.27.
which (also) proved a Snare to Gideon, and to his house. There is a Snare in
the Ship, and a Snare in the Shop (here,) but there shall be no Snare
(hereafter.) Saul, gave unto David, Michal his daughter, that she might be a
Snare unto him, 1 Samuel 18.20, 21.
and that the hands of the Philistines might be against him. But, though she
might be a Snare (while) he lived, she was no Snare (when) he was dead.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Fears. Is not that Christian
a miracle amongst men, that is without Fear here? but no Christian shall have
Fear hereafter. David, feared a falling into the hands of Saul here, and while
Saul was, but he fears not to fall into the hands of Saul, where Saul is, or
Himself is. One man, may fear another, while his Enemy, and Himself lives, but
he fears not his Enemy, when his Enemy, and Himself, 1 Cor. 15.26.
are dead. The last Enemy that shall be destroyed, is Death.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Tears. Now, Tears stand in
the eyes of those that are Christ's, and their eyes are like a Limbeck,
continually dropping: The precious Sons of Zion (comparable to fine Gold) are
mourning between the Porch, and the Altar; mourning, until they can mourn no
more; mourning, like Doves in the Valleys, for their own iniquity, and the
iniquity of their own; for their own iniquity, and the iniquity of others; but,
there shall be no mourning hereafter; The Grave, Rev. 21.4
and Heaven, are not Bochims (places of weeping;) not a Tear shall be shed in
either of those places. There is to be a State upon Earth (under the
Personality of Christ's Reign) when all Tears shall be wiped from the eyes of
those who are (actually) Christ's.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Temptations. Now, Satan
follows thee from the Closet, to the Church; and from the Church, to the
Closet; but this shall not be hereafter. Oh, how many, and mighty! how great,
and grievous! how horrid, and hideous, are Satanical Suggestions, and
Solicitations here! but, there shall be none hereafter. Satan, being (once)
cast out of Heaven, is (ever) cast into Hell. Rev. 20.10.
The Devil that deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire, and brimstone,
where the Beast, and the false Prophet are, and shall be tormented day, and
night, for ever, and ever.

Art actually in Christ? (then) will grave all thy Tribulations. Here, thy
sorrows, and sufferings, come like waves; here, Deep cries unto Deep; here,
thou art often in the mouth of Lions, but, there shall be nothing of this
hereafter. Here, thou art fighting with the Beasts of Ephesus; here, thou art
hunted like a Partridge upon the Mountains, but there shall be nothing of this
hereafter; Death, will grave all these things. There the wicked cease from
troubling, and there the weary be at rest; Job 3.17, 18, 19.
there the Prisoners rest together, they hear not the voice of the Oppressor;
the small, and the great, are there, and the Servant is free from his Master.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial VI.
Triumph (also) for thou art an Heir. But, here are three Questions.

But, who are Those, who are Christ's? Qu. 1.


But, are those (who are Christ's) Heirs?

But, of what, Christ's) Heirs?

But, who are Those, who are Christ's? Qu. 1.
How shall those, who are Christ's, be known from others?

Those (who are Christ's) are so by eternal Donation, and by effectual Vocation;
Sol.
they are so decretively, and so declaratively, but to these distinctly.

Those (who are Christ's) are so decretively, or, Donation. They are given unto
Christ before Time. Joh. 17.2.
As thou have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life
to as many as thou have given him. All those (who are Christ's) are given unto
Christ; that is, they are chosen in Christ. There is a particular Election
(which is the sublimest Act of Divine Sovereignty) and this was (before) Time.
Ephesians. 1.4.
According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. Not
that we are chosen in Christ (says one) as the foundation of our Election,
Leigh, in loc.
but we are chosen in Christ, as the foundation of our Salvation.

Those (who are Christ's) are so declaratively, Vocation. As, there are Those
given unto Christ (before) Time, so, there are Those unto whom Christ is given
(under) Time. I knew a man in Christ. 2 Cor. 12.2.
By those (who are Christ's) I mean those (who are actually Christ's,
declaratively Christ's;) those, effectually called by Christ: Among whom, Romans
1.6.
are ye also the called of Jesus Christ. Christ, speaks of those given unto
him, and unto whom he is given. John 17.9.20.
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which thou have given me,
and shall believe on me. As there are some given unto Christ, so there are some
unto whom Christ is given, and these are the persons (unto whom Christ is
given) that I intend.

But, Qu. 2. Sol. 1 Cor. 3.21, 22, 23
are those (who are Christ's) Heirs?

Those (actually) Christ's, are Heirs. All things are yours, whether Paul, or
Apollo, or Cephas; whether the world, or life, or death; whether things
present, or things to come; all are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is
Gods. Christ, has his Heirs, and those (actually) Christ's, are Heirs. If ye be
Christ's, Gal. 3.29.
then are ye Abraham's seed, and Heirs according to promise. An Heir, is one
that succeeds another into a Possession, and Inheritance, after his death.
Thus, Solomon, was Heir to David; and thus Isaac, was Heir to Abraham. Genesis
21.10.
Cast out the Bondwoman, and her Son, for the Son of the Bondwoman shall not
be Heir with my Son, even with Isaac. Those (actually) Christ's, whether Jews,
or Gentiles; whether Men, or Women, are Heirs. That the Gentiles should be
fellow-heirs, Ephesians. 3.6.
and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ, by the Gospel.
What (indoed) is more legible in the Sacred Scriptures, than that those (who
are actually Christ's) are Heirs? He, Rev. 21.7.
that overcomes, shall inherit all things, and I will be to him a God, and he
shall be to me a Son.

But, of what, Qu. 3.
are those (who are (actually) Christ's) Heirs?

These things, may be redaced to two Heads; Sol.
things present, and things to come; but, to these dis^^nctly.

Those (actually) Christ's, Heirs of things present.

But what are those things present, Qu.
of which (those actually Christ's) are Heirs?

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of Christ. Sol. 1.
An Empire (says Luther) is but a Crest, which the Father of mar^ies may cast
to a D^g. An Empire (without a Christ) is nothing; but Christ (without an
Empire) is any thing; is every thing; is all things. There have been few, but
the Nimrods, and Ne^^chadnezzars of the world; but the Sanis, and Sennacheri^s
of the world; but the Pharachs, and Pilates of the world, that have been the
Lords of the world. Christ, is the Object of the Nations desire; the Object of
the Fathers delight, and yet those (actually) His, are Heirs of Him. Christ, is
the Being of Beings, as God; the Beauty of Beauties, as Man; and the Blessing
of Blessings, as God-Man; and yet those (actually) His, are Heirs of Him. My
Beloved, is mine, and I am his, Can. 2.16.
he feeds among the Lillies.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Grace of Christ. Grace, is a Pearl
of that weight, worth, that the Topaz of Ethi^p^a, is but a peb^le to this
Pearl, and not to be val^ed with it, and yet those (who are actually Christ's)
are Heirs of the Grace of Christ. Grace, is such a Pearl, that it entitles, and
entails Glory; such a Pearl as will go into Glory, when Time goes into
Eternity, and yet those (who are actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Grace of
Christ. Grace, is so pure, that there is no sin in it, and so precious, that
the whole Fabric of Salvation is laid upon it, (By Grace are ye saved;) and
yet those (who are actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Grace of Christ. Since
the day ye heard it, Col. 1.6.
and knew the Grace of God in truth.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Spirit of Christ. Body is without
the Soul, that the Soul is without the Spirit. What the Soul is to the Body,
that the Spirit is to the Soul; and yet those (who are actually Christ's) are
Heirs of the Spirit of Christ. A man without the Gales, and Gusts of the
Spirit; without the Incomes, and Influences of the Spirit, is like a Ship
becalmed, and weatherbound, and yet those (who are actually Christ's) are Heirs
of the Spirit of Christ. It is the Spirit that searches all things, yea, the
depths of God; it is the Spirit that witnesses together with our spirits, that
we are the children of God, and yet those (who are actually Christ's) are Heirs
of the Spirit of Christ. Because ye are Sons, Gal. 4.6.
God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Father,
Father.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Ministry of Christ. has a twofold
Ministry, the Ministry of Men, and the Ministry of Angels; to these
distinctly.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Ministry of Men. Gospel-Ministery
would be accounted no small mercy, were not we sick of a spiritual Plurisie.
Honey, will down with an hungry Man, but the full stomach treads under foot the
Honeycomb. Manna, would have been tasteful unto an hungry Man, but the
Israelites were glutted with the plenty of it. Have not Gospel Ministers, been
Gospel-Instruments, in the hand of God, for the conversion of many Souls? 1
Cor. 3.5 Satius est, ut Sol non luceat, quam ut Chrysostomus non doceat.
Who then is Paul? and who is Apollo? but Ministers by whom ye believed, even
as the Lord gave to every man. Is it not pity, that every Gospel-Minister has
not such an Auditory as Chrysostom had, which said, That the world knew as well
how to be without the firmamental Sun, as they knew how to be without their
Minister? We had better want the shining of the Sun, than the Preaching of
Chrysostom. It is true, the Ambassador, is to show his Letters of Credence,
before his Audience: Paul (writing to the Romans) in the very first words,
proposes his Vocation. Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, Romans 1.1.
called to be an Apostle, separated unto the Gospel of God. A Gospel-Minister,
is a great mercy, if it may be (truly) said of Him, Nazianz.
as it was of One, As his Lip was, so his Life was: And, as it was said of
Another, That, Z^ll^^s.
He was not (only) a Theoretick, but (also) a Practical Divine; for what he
taught, he first practiced himself. When Ernustus was desired (by the City of
A^spurg) to return Regius the Minister; he answered, Duke of Bransu^^k
That he would as soon part with his Eyes, as with Him. Were it not for the
pleasure of knowledge, the delight in study, and the hopes of winning S^als to
Christ, who would be Ministers, so little Veneration (from some) has a
Gospel-Ministery now? Faith, comes by hearing, Romans 10.14, 17.
but how shall we hear without a Preacher? Is it not hard to determine, whether
a People be happier in the enjoyment, or anhapp^er in the loss of a painful,
powerful, gracious, and Gospel-Ministery? and yet those ( actually Christ's) are
Heirs of a Gospel-Ministery: It is said of One, Themistocles.
That he was ever bamshed in Peace, but sent for home in War. Ah Soul! There
may arise such a storm within, and such a cloud may interpose between thy Soul,
and thy Savior, that thou may send for a Gospel-Minister. Wallaeus.
One (preaching his Farewei-Sermon at Middleburgh) filled his People with such
sighs, and tears, that they (rather) seemed children, to part with a Father,
than People, to part with a Pastor. The desire of Jewel, was, Aut precantem,
aut praedicantem.
That he might dye Preaching. It was (also) the usual wish of Austin, That when
Christ came, he might find him either Praying, or Preaching. If any sin in a
Gospel-Minister be unpardonable, it is his Silence, for he is Gods Mouth, and
the Gospel his Voice, and yet those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of a
Gospel-Ministery. One (writing of the Romish Prelates) says, That since
Prelates increased in Pomp, Bernard.
choosing the first places in the Church, they have been the chiesest in
persecuting of Jesus Christ, and have ever showed themselves not Teachers, but
Dece. verse; not Pastors, but Impostors; not Prelates, but Pilates; succeeding,
not Peter in Teaching, but Romulus in Mu^dering. Though they are unfit to be
Seers, that cannot distinguish between Hagar, and Sarah; the Manna of Israel,
and the enchanted Cup of Babel: As they are unfit to be Ministers, (who are
like Jeroboam's Priests) the vilest of the People; and he is unfit to be a
Minister, who may set his foot (for ignorance) against a quondam Scottish
Bishop, who (being addressed with a Case of Conscience) protested (like an
ignorant -- as he was) that he knew neither old Law, Bishop of Dunkelden
nor new; which is become a Proverb in Scotland, (to express a very ignorant
man) Thou art like the Bishop of Dunkelden, who knew neither old Law, no^ new;
yet a Minister (of Christ's making) is a Woer of Souls for Christ; Animarum
procus.
and his grand design is to raise up a Seed to his eldest Brother; now, those (
actually Christ's) are Heirs of a Gospel-Ministery. It is said of Bid, that
three things were very familiar to him in his whole life; to pray, Hac sunt in
Fossa, Bedae venerabilis Ossa.
preach, and write; that (upon his Tomo) was this found: Here lies intombed in
these Stones
Of venerable Bede his Bones.
Were a Man's Head, Gold; his Granary fuller than Pharaohs; his Treasury richer
than Hezekiahs, and every Room in his house better furnished than Solomon's;
there might come a time he might stand in need of a Gospel-Minister; and yet
those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of a Gospel-Ministery. As great a Potentate
as Pharaoh was, Exodus 8.8
and as despicable a person as Moses was, yet the Potentate sent for the
Prophet. It is said of One (who was Rector of the University of Geneva) that
with sighs and tears, Spanhemius.
the People parted with him; as if in losing him, they had lost a principal
Member of their Body. Gospel Ministers, are called Ambassadors; called Fathers;
called Shepherds; called Stewards; called Watchmen; called Workmen, etc. and
yet those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of a Gespel-Ministery.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Ministry of Augels. Heirs of the
Ministry of Men, so of Angels. Angels, are Gods Heralds; Gods Ambassadors, to
carry comfort from his Throne, to his Footstool; from Heaven to Earth; and yet
those (who are actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Ministry of Angels. Angels,
are Gods Servants; Gods Stewards; Gods Ministers; Gods Messengers; and yet
those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Ministry of Angels. Heb. 1.14
Are they not all ministering Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall
be heirs of salvation? The best part of Man (even his Soul) is lower than
Angels; an Angel, is a perfect Soul, and a Soul but an imperfect Angel. Angels,
were created in the beginning, and settled in an upright state, in whom, may be
considered these things.

Their Nature. Angels, are spiritual, incorporeal Essences. Heb. 1.7.
Unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son? He takes not
hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham he takes hold. Heb. 2.16
Greek.

Their Qualities. 1. They are wise. Tekoah told David, As an Angel of God, 2 Samuel 14.17. 2 Thessalonians. 1.7.
so is my Lord the King, to discern good, and bad. 2. Angels, are of great
might. And to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels. 3. They are of great Agility.
Gabriel, is said to sly swiftly. This, Dan. 9.21
is the reason, why the Cherubims in the Tabernacle, were painted with wings.

Their Number. They are many; very many; how many. Heb. 12.22.
To an innumer able company of Angels.

Their Place. The highest Heaven; wait upon God. Matthew. 18.10.
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you,
that in heaven, there Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in
heaven.

Their Degrees. 1 Thessalonians. 4.16.
with the voice of the Archangel.

Their Office. Partly, to Magnify God, perform his Commandments. Bless the
Lord ye his Angels, that excel in strength; Psalm. 103.20.
that do his Commandments. Angels, have not the least spot, or tincture of sin,
in their nature, yet the nature of Angels was potentially sinful. Evil Angels
(which fell at first) were holy; and they (who now stand) might have fallen,
notwithstanding their created holiness, if God had not superadded confirming
Grace, which esta^^sheth them for ever.

If the nature of man, Qu.
be nothing but sin, and Angels have not any sin at all in their nature, how
then is there Folly in the Angelical Nature? Job 4.18.
His Angels he charged with Folly.

There was not any Folly concreated with them. Sol. 1.
Their nature, is purely pure.

They have not contracted any Folly into their nature. Folly of the good
Angels, is but like the Folly of man in a Paradisica^ state, when he had
(only) a power to sin. They have (only) a potentiallty, a possibility in
their nature to sin; And Christ has changed their possibility to sin, into an
imp^ssi^^^ty of sinning. Caryl in loc.
Redemption, has not (only) bettered the condition of man, but (also) the
condition of Angels; and yet those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the
Ministry of Angels.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of the Righteousuess of Christ. imputing
of Christ's righteousness unto (his) is their sustisication; the imparting of
his righteousness to (his) is their sanctification. Christ, is sanctisication
to (his) as well as righteousness. There is a twofold righteousness in Christ,
imputed, and imparted; the first, in order to justification; the second, in
order to sanctisication; a righteousness imparted, justifies before God; a
righteousness impacted, justifies before man. Noah, become heir of the
righteousness which is by faith. Heb. 11.7
It is called a righteousness of faith, because faith is conversant about it,
as its object, and yet those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of his righteousness.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of God. is the inheritance of all that are
actually Christ, and who is able to say, yea, able to see what an inheritance
God is? Naboth, looked upon the inheritance of his Father, as a great thing;
God, forbid, it that I should give away the inheritance of my fathers unto
thee. But, for a God; the God of Gods; the chiefest Good; the Good, in whom is
all good, and nothing but good, to be the inheritiance of those (who are
actually Christ's) who is able to express, or conceive what this is? Here,
Expression, is puzzled; yea, here, Conception is posed. If children, then heirs,
Romans 8.17.
heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. If children, there is the
Supposition; then Heirs, there is the Position; heirs of God, there is the
Exposition. Here, are three passages of Dignity, rising gradually. 1. Not
(only) children, but (also) heirs. 2. Not heirs of a mortal man, but of an
immortal God. 3. Not basely assaciated in this inheritance, coheirs with
Christ. Children, inherit, by the Law of God; by the Law of Nature; by the Law
of Nations; and yet those ( actually Christ's) are heirs of God.

Those ( actually Christ's) are heirs of Gospel-Priviledges. These have a
Gospel-propriety, Gospel-Priviledge; Access; Audience; Assistance; Acceptance.
To these distinctly.

Those ( actually Christ's) have a Gospel-Propriety in Access (to) God, at the
Throne of Grace. Access to a sinful, and mortal man nothing? but what is Access
(then) to a sinless, and immortal God? Oh Soul! when thou cryest free among the
dead; when thou have been days, and nights in the deep, thou may go into a
Chamber, into a Closet, and give vent to thy Soul there, and is not this a
great mercy? when thy Soul has been like a troubled Sea, and thou have cried
forsaken, and forgotten; out of the hand of God, and out of the heart of God
too, thou have gone to thy knees, and told Christ of thy sins, and sorrows, who
sends not away sad from his presence, and is not this a great mercy? Heb. 4.16
Let us (therefore) come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain
mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need. Leigh.
The Cherubims, or Mercy-seat, (says one) was a Type of the Throne of Grace;
unto this Throne of Grace, may those ( actually Christ's) have Access; they may
come as the Sons of the New Testament, and are not to come as the Servants of
the Old: If they come (believingly) they may come (boldly;) or (according to
the Greek) with boldness: (...)
with liberty, and confidence, of speaking all our mind; but this Access, and
obtaining mercy, is thorough Christ Jesus the Lord, their High Priest, Romans 5.2.
and Intercessor.

Those ( actually Christ's) have a Gospel-Propriety in Audience (from) God,
Throne of Grace. Is it nothing to have man's ear? but, what is it (then) to have
Gods Ear? who is all Ear, as well as all Eye; hearing (all) things, as if he
had but (one) thing to hear, as well as seeing (all) things, as if he had but
(one) thing to see. God, hears not Sinners, but he hears Saints. I sought
the Lord, Psalm. 34.4, 6, 15.
and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears, Christ (by those actually
his) may be consulted as an Oracle, and have his Ear. This poor man cried, and
the Lord heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles. Is it not a
great mercy to have Christ's Ear, especially, when thou have none other Ear to
hear thy cries? The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and his ears are
open unto their cry.

Those ( actually Christ's) have a Gospel-Propriety in Assistance (from) God at
the Throne of Grace. Soul to go to the Throne of Grace, and be ammated there;
to go to the Throne of Grace, and be assisted there, is not this a great mercy?
Oh (says the Soul) though it is my duty to pray at (all) times, and has been
my mercy to pray (many) times, yet I cannot pray now; my heart is like a
W^^derness now; like a Desert now; my heart is dark, and drad, and down now,
that I cannot pray: Is it so? yet, let there be no declining (of) duty, for
there shall be assisting (in) duty. Like wise the Spirit also helps our
infirmities, Romans 8.26
for we know not what we sh^^ld pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself
makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Is not this
a Metaphor, taken, either (1.) from one that lifts a piece of timber? which he
cannot do alone, but as he is at one end, so he has one at the other end, that
helps him to lift it. Thus, must the Spirit help thee in Prayer, or thy Prayer
will never pass thorough the hand of the Son, unto the heart of the Father. Or
(2.) from a Norse, that takes hold of the Child, to assist it in g^^ng, and
prevent its falling? Thus, the Spirit, must take hold of the Soul in Prayer;
Prayer, being a breathing (out) that before God, which was first breathed (in)
by the Spirit of God. Or (3.) from an old Man that leans upon his staff, and
cannot go without it? Thus, thou may go (unto) duty, but thou will not go
unto God (in) that duty, without the Spirit.

Those ( actually Christ's) have a Gospel-Propriety in Acceptance (with) God, at
the Throne of Grace. Prayers, and all my Tears! He has a Bag for my Sins, but
I fear he has not a Book for my Prayers, and a Bottle for my Tears. But, Soul,
art actually Christ's? then person, and performance; then Soul, and Service, are
accepted with God thorough Christ Jesus. Ephesians. 1.6. (...)
To the praise of the Glory of his Grace, wherein he has made us accepted in
the Beloved. Or (according to the Greek) wherein he has freely made us free,
or, freely accepted us.

Those ( actually Christ's) are Heirs of Gospel-Promises. Are not the Promises
great things? Bilney, Glover, and Spira, thought them so; yet those ( actually
Christ's) are Heirs of the Promises. Are not the Promises great things, when the
Soul cries for a Promise, as the Woman for Children; Children, or I dye? A
Promise (says the Soul) or I dye; Christ (in a Promise) or I dye. Does the
Soul say, I do not know that ever God brought, and blessed, any Promise to my
Soul: But, Soul, have a Propriety in the Prince of Life? then thou have a
Propriety in the Promise of Life; for, 2 Cor. 1.20.
All the Promises of God, in Christ are Yea, and in Christ, Amen, to the Glory
of God by us.

But, what are those things which are laid under Promise? Quest.


Eternal Life, that is laid under Promise. Sol. 1.
Is Life nothing? Natural Life nothing? This is Spiritual; yea, this is Eternal
Life. Eternal Life, is made up of Grace, and Glory, and yet this is laid under
Promise. In hope of Eternal Life, Tit. 1.2. Non ab aeterno, sed ante multa
saecula. Grotius.
which God (that cannot lie) promised before the world began. Before the world
began; not from Eternity (says one) but before many Ages. Either God decreed
from Eternity to promise Eternal Life, or he did promise Eternal Life, from the
beginning of Ages, in that famous promise, Genesis 3.15.
of the blessed Seed. Is not Eternal Life worth the hearing? worth the heeding?
worth the having? worth the holding? and yet this is laid, and left under
promise.

Pardon of sin, laid under promise. Ask a desponding, doubting, drooping Soul,
and he will tell you, that pardon of sin is a singular mercy, of the plural
number. What would not a cast man, a condemned man give for a Pardon? What
would not a Soul cast down with the sight, and sense of sin, give for a sight,
and sense of the pardon of it? Is not that a sweet word? I will be merciful to
their unrighteousness, Heb. 8.12
their sins, and their iniquities, will I remember no more.

Power against sin, laid under promise. Oh (says the Soul) I am not a match
for this Achan! for that Goliath of Gath! for these sons of Zerviah within! Oh
(says the Soul) I find a Law in my members, warring against the Law of my
mind! Oh, I find fleshly Lusts warring against the Soul! Is it so with thee? so
it is with me, but, power against sin, is laid under promise. As, the way of
the Lord is strength to the upright, so, they that wait upon the Lord, (and
keep his way) shall renew their strength; Isa. 40.31.
(change their strength, so the margent;) they shall mount up with wings as
Eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk, and not faint.

Purity, Soul, is laid under promise. Oh (says the Soul) how should I run
thorough thick, and thin! thorough fire, and water, if my sins (those cursed
Inmates, and cruel Makebats within) were but subdued! Oh how should I face
Crosses, and Losses! the Rack, and the Stake, if my sins were but subdued! and
this body of sin, were but destroyed! Oh! what is pardon of sin, and power
against sin, when there is the presence of sin still? But, purity of soul, of
heart, and life, is laid under promise, for thee, and me, if we be actually
Christ's. He will subdue their iniquities. Mic. 7.19.5.


Peace of Conscience, is laid under promise. Peace, of Conscience, is an
Anticipation of Glory; a Heaven begun here, and yet this is laid under promise.
A wounded, and clouded person, is like a man in a Rack: A man may sustain his
own infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear? A man (that has lost sight
of Christ) is like (as it were) a living man in hell, having no peace going
out, coming in, lying down, rising up. To have the shines, and smiles,
Praeludia coeli.
of the face of God; to be indulged the looks, and loves, of Christ, these are
the foretastes of Heaven, and of Glory. Thou will keep him in peace, peace,
Isa. 26.3.
whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusts in thee.

Growth, in Grace, is laid under promise. children, grow not, but living
children grow. Look upon a child painted upon the wall, and it grows not; it is
no bigger than it was when first painted, and seven years have passed since;
but a living child has grown much in seven years. All Gods children, are
living children, therefore growing children; they grow upward, or downward; if
they grow not in Faith, and Love; Comfort, and Joy, which is a growth upward;
then they grow in Humility, and Self-denial; in Tears, and Soul-abhorrence,
which is a growth downward; if they grow not in quantity, grow bigger; yet they
grow in quality, grow better; and the one as real a growth as the other. As it
is true, where there is life, there will be motion; it is as true, where there
is the truth (of) Grace, there will be growth (in) Grace. I will be as the dew
unto Israel; he shall grow as the Lilly, Hos. 14.5, 7.
(which grows suddenly, and with a singular beauty) they shall revive as the
Corn, (of one Seed, comes very many) they shall blossom us the Vine, (which
blossoms abundantly) and the memorial, or monument thereof, shall be as the
wine of Lebanon. Ye shall go forth, and grow up, Mal. 4.2.
as Calves of the stall. It is true, Falls, and Sicknesses, may (for a time)
hinder the growth of a natural child; it is (also) true, Corruptions, and
Temptations, may (for a time) hinder the growth of a spiritual child; but all
Gods children, are living children, therefore growing children. These grow,
though they do not see themselves grow: The Grass, and the Corn (in the season
of Growth) grow, though the Husbandman does not see these grow; he sees that
these are grown, though he did not see these grow: Thus, the children of God,
may see themselves grown in G^a^e, though they see not themselves for to grow
in Grace, and growth (in) Grace, is from the G^^ of) Grace; He, that gives a
Being, gives a Bressing.

Perseverance, Grace, is laid under (...). It had been much better never to
have professed, than finally to Apostatize. It had been better for men never to
have known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn
from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. Grace, may decay, but (...)
cannor dye; it may be abated, but it cannot be ab^^shed; it may be shaken (in)
the soul; but it cannot be shaken (out) of the soul. I have prayed for thee,
that thy faith sail not. Job 17.9.
The righteous (also) shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands,
shall add strength, to strength. The righteous; the person that does
righteousness, shall hold on his way: what way? the way of his heart, or his
inward way; the way of his hand, or his outward way; this person shall stand;
and having done all shall stand. There may be the fall of the Leaf, but there
cannot be the fall of the Root; Because I live, ye shall live also. Judas, fell
finally, as well as foully; Peter, though he fell souly, yet he fell not
finally. The ways of the Lord are (...), Hos. 14.9.
and the just shall walk in them, but the (...) shall fall therein. Apostasy,
is a great (...) Apostates are great s^ners, but those ( actua^^ Christ's) shall
not (finally) aposcatize; they shall (thorough) Christ, persecere in the ways
(of) Christ. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, Psalm. 37.23, 24.
and he delights in his way: Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast
down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.

Supporting-grace, laid under promise. As no Saint is without corruption, so no
Saint is without ^^^ptation. Paul, had both, and so has every Saint. 2 Cor.
12.7, 8, 9.
I had a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. By this, some
understand corruption; others, understand temptation; others, corruption, and
temptation: Thus, I understand it, to be some Satanical suggestion, working
upon his corruption. For this, I besought the Lord thrice, Estius, Marlorat,
Tirinus.
that it might depart from me; Thrice; that is, often, frequently, instantly: A
certain number, put for an uncertain. And he said unto me, my Grace is
sufficient for thee. My Grace, not thy Grace; Grace, in thy public head, not
Grace in thy private hand; the Supply of Grace, not the Receipt of Grace;
Grace, in the Fountain, not Grace in the Stream. Though Christ do not always
answer in kind, yet he answers in effect: Though Christ did not presently
deliver Paul from the temptation of evil, yet he did deliver him from the evil
of temptation. Though temptation, by Christ, is not taken from off Paul, yet
Paul, by temptation, is not taken from off Christ.

Supplying-grace, is laid under promise. My God, Phi. 4.19.
according to his riches in Glory, by Christ Jesus. I know not how to pass this
Text (sweeter than a bundle of myrrh) nor pass out of this Garden, without
plucking some Flowers, and presenting these Meditations.

That those (who were Christ's) had, Meditat.
and those (who are Christ's) have their times of need. need. These (were
Christ's) and yet had their times of need.

That, Supplies of Grace, are laid under promise, Christ's) in their times of
need. Shall supply your need. Here, is the promise.

That there is a Supply of Grace in God for those (who are Christ's) in all
their times of need. supply your need; yea, all your need. The supplies of
Grace, shall quadrare (with) and be adaequate (unto) all your need. God, shall
supply all your need.

That God, Christ's) with Grace, according to his Riches of Grace, in their
times of need. According to his Riches in Glory. It is here called Riches (in)
Glory, but in another place called Riches (of) Glory. That he would grant you,
according to his Riches (of) Glory, Ephesians. 3.16.
to be strengthened with all might in the inner man. It is (also) called Riches
(of) Grace. In whom, we have redemption thorough his blood, Ephesians. 1.7.
the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his Grace. Grace and
Glory, are near akin, and differ not in kind, but in degree; for, Grace, is
Glory Militant, and Glory, is Grace Triumphant.

That those (who are Christ's) are (thorough Christ) supplied with Grace, times
of need. By Jesus Christ, God shall supply all your need, according to his
Riches of Grace by Jesus Christ. As all in Egypt, so all in Israel; but all in
Egypt, went thorough the hands of Joseph; and all in Israel, goes thorough the
hands of Jesus. Christ, is the Disposer, and Dispenser, of all Grace. As he is
the Fountain, from which all our mercies flow, so, anion with him, is the
channel, in which all our mercies run.

That Assurance of Interest in the God of Grace, Grace of God, is attainable,
and obtainable, in this life. My God: But, my God, shall supply all your need,
according to his Riches of Grace, by Christ Jesus. My God. Felicity, is bound
up in Propriety. My God.

But, Quest.
what are these times of need, which those (who were Christ's) had, and those
(who are Christ's) have; or, may have?

A time of Poverty, Sol. 1.
is a time of Need. It is said, the rich men of Italy, are the richest, and the
poor, the poorest men in the world. Poverty, is a Snare, though not so great a
Snare as Plenty. It was the saying of one, Gregory.
That contented Poverty, is true Riches. As there are the Worlds Poor, so there
are Christ's Poor; The Poor (says Christ) ye have always with you, but me ye
have not always. The poor man cried, and the Lord heard him. Luther, and
Calvin, were poor. Herne, Perkins, and Lactantius, dyed very poor. Dod (for
many years together) had nothing but Providence to live upon. Ainsworth (they
say) had but Nine-pence per week to live upon. It was the holy Prayer of holy
Agur, Give me neither Poverty, Prove. 30.8, 9.
nor Riches; not Poverty, lest I steal, and take thy Name in vain; not Riches,
lest I be full, and deny thee. Is not Poverty (now) coming in like a prodigious
Torrent, as if it would bear down, and break down, all before it? Is it not the
design of some in our Bowels, and of some in our Borders, yet to reduce England
to a more astonishing Ebb? The poorest Christian, that lives in a Cottage, has
great treasure in his (heart) though little in his (house.) Smyrna, was the
poorest of the seven Asiatick-Churches, yet had the richest price set upon her;
though she was poorest in Goods, Rev. 2.9.
yet richest in Grace. I know thy poverty, but thou art rich: Gods poor, as
they are (often) poor in purse, so they should be (always) poor in spirit; for
the poorer we are in spirit, the richer we are in spirituals. It is a mercy to
be denied superfluities, but a misery to be denied necessaries. The Heathens
could say, Adversity, finds few Friends. 1 Cor. 4.11.
Even unto this present time, we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and
are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place. These holy, and heavenly
ones; these believing, and beloved ones, had hunger, and thirst, and yet naked;
were naked, and yet buffeted; yea, after all this, had no certain dwelling
place; was not this a time of need, and did not they (now) stand in need of
supply (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Plenty, is a time of Need. Poverty be a great Snare, yet Plenty is a
greater. It is an Affliction to be poor for want of Riches, but it is a Curse
to be poor in the possession of Riches. He, Eccl. 5.10
nor that loves silver, shall not be satisfied therewith, nor he that loves
abundance, with increase. It is far better to be rich in Grace, than in Gifts;
in Godliness, than in Gold; in Goodness, than in Goods: It is far better to be
rich in Love, than in Lands; in Righteousness, than in Riches; in Mercy, than
in Money. A prosperous state, is more dangerous than an adverse; and a
plentiful, than a poor. Who ever richer than Adam in Paradise? Who ever poorer
than Job on the dunghill? yet (in Paradise) Satan worsted Adam, when (upon the
dunghill) Job worsted Satan. In my prosperity, I said, Psalm. 30.6.
I shall never be moved. Prosperity, leads unto security; here is Sunshine
weather; the Sun of prosperity, peace, and plenty, shined upon the man's
Tabernacle, and he was secure; I shall never be moved, the bitterness of death
is p^se now; but, after a calm, a storm; a state of security, is like a City
without Gates, and Bars; the Enemy may enter (when) he will, and (where) he
will. A man in a secure state, is like a man upon the top of a Mast, in the
midst of the Sea, under a stupendous storm. It is said of an Hypocrite, (or
wicked man) that in the fullness of his sufficiency, Job 20.22.
he shall be in straits. Dives (out of plenty) goes to Hell; Lazarus (out of
poverty) goes to Heaven. Is not a time of prosperity (as well as poverty) a
time of need, and do not men (then) stand in need of supply (from the God of
Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Debauchery, Need. Sin (begins) in turning (from) God, and Sin (ends)
in turning (against) God; now, to be turned (from) God, and (also) turned
(against) God, is not (this) a time of need? and do not those that (thus) sih,
stand in need of Grace? It was a time of great provocation (in the days of
Noah) when God brought a deluge upon the old world, and sent all but eight
persons to the bottom; Luke 17.26, 27, 28, 29.
they were eating, and drinking; marrying, and giving in marriage. It was the
like time (in the days of Lot) when God rained (as it were) Heh out of Heaven;
Fire, and Brimstone, upon the Cities of Sodom, and Gomorrah; they did eat,
drink, buy, sell, build, plant. But, could (those) times vie with (this) time,
for (these) things, and worse things than these? Is not cheating, and
circumventing (now) called Ingenuity? Are not Oaths accounted the greatest
Rheterick? Is not Adultery a veniai Sin? And Polygamy the Grandeur of a Person?
Ah Sin! Sin! Sin! a complex evil; upon the reflection of which, one said, That
he had rather be thrust into Hell without Sin, Anselm.
than go into Heaven with Sin. That was a time of great Debauchery, when it is
said, Will ye steal, murder, commit Adultery? Jer. 7.9, 10.
swear falsely? burn incense unto Baal? and walk after other gods whom ye knew
not; And come and stand before me in this house, whereupon my Name is called,
and say, We are delivered to do these abominations? Was it so then? it is so
now; Is it not (then) a time of need, and do not those (who are Christ's) stand
in need of fresh, and full supply (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?
The reason, is evident; for, as these are to be good at all times, in all
places, and among all persons, so, they are to be best in the worst of times;
in the worst of places; and with the worst of persons.

A time of Tribulation, is a time of Need. Christ, Cross, and shall the Church
be? the Christian be? The Messiah, was not without the Cross, and shall the
Minister be? the Member be? Ought not Christ to have suffered these things,
Luke 24.26.
and to enter into his Glory? Shall not the Soldier go, where the Captain goes?
but this way the Captain went. Heb. 2.10
The Captain of their salvation made perfect thorough suffering. Did Christ
suffer, and not sin? Shall we sin, and not suffer? Acts 14.22.
We must thorough much Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God. The
wilderness, is the way to Canaan; the Cross, is the way to the Crown. I John,
Rev. 1.9.
who also am your Brother, and Companion in Tribulation. Is not this (also) a
time of Need, and do not those (who are Christ's) stand in need of supply (from
the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Temptation, is a time of Need. God, Son without sin, and yet (this)
Son was not without Temptation. Mat. 4.1.
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the
Devil. Christ, was made like unto man, that he might be tempted, and man is
tempted, that he may be made like unto Christ. Our whole Life (says One) is
but a Temptation. Augustine.
There is no Christian without Temptation. Saul, gave Michal to David; but, to
what end? That she might be a snare unto him, and that the hands of the
Philistines might be upon him. Now, Temptations, are from without, or within.

From without. Satan they are. Eve, was not long in the Garden, before she was
laid under Temptation. Genesis 3.13.
The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And (sometimes) from Fellow Creatures.
Thus, Joseph's Mistress tempted him, unto whom he said, How can I do this great
wickedness, Genesis 39.9.
and sin against God?

From within. Jam. 1.14
and enticed. Temptations, could never hurt us, if Corruptions did not join
issue. Were there not in us tinder, as there is in Satan fire; were not the
heart the Mother of Corruption, as Satan is the Father of Temptation, how
insignificant would his solicitations, and suggestions be? But, where is the
Garden without weeds? where is the Gold without dross? where is the House that
is without rubbish? where is the Heart that is without leaven? where is the
Man; or the Woman, that is without sin? Is not a time of Temptation (then) a
time of need, and do not those (who are Christ's) stand in need of supply (from
the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Declension, Need. The Prophet says, Mic. 3.6.
Night shall be unto you from a vision, and it shall be dark unto you from
divining, and the Sun shall go down over the Prophets, and the day shall be
dark over them. Was it so, and is it not so? Is not the Sun greatly gone down
over the People, and the Prophets too? Over Members, and Ministers too? Where
is that zeal for God, and his Glory, that (formerly) was in thee, and in me? Is
there that affection, Jer. 2.2.
and action, that care, and conscience (now) in thee, and in me, as was in the
day of our first espousals? Is there (now) that desire, and delight, that
frequency, and fervency in duty, that was in thee, Rev. 2.4.
and in me, under our first conversions? But I against thee (so the Greek)
because thou have left thy first Love. Where is that curious, and critical
observance of the Lord's Day, and of the Lords Commands, that (formerly) was in
thee, and in me? Oh that it were with thee, and with me, as it (formerly) was,
when (that) discourse, was a (lost) discourse, if we did not speak (of) a
Christ; and (that) Duty, a (lost) Duty, if we did not speak (with) a Christ! Is
there a decaying, and declining, in Grace, and Gifts? Certainly (then) it is a
time of need, and those (who are Christ's) stand (now) in need of fresh, and
full supplies (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God.

A time of Death, is a time of Need. All things, center. Man, Genesis 3.19.
makes to his center every moment. Dust, thou art, and unto Dust shall thou
return. Death, is the way of all men; the way of all flesh; the way of all the
world. Your Fathers, Zech. 1.5.
where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever? we know not what it
is to shoot this Gulf; when many come in sight of it, they cry out, Lord, we
cannot dye; Lord, we will not dye; Lord, we dare not dye. Is not (then) a time
of Death, a time of Need, and do not those (who are Christ's) then stand in need
of supply (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Danger, is a time of Need. wrought (as it were) so many miracles, as
we are preserved moments? Ah! how obnoxious to contagion of Soul, and Body, and
how obnoxious to casuaity of Body, and Basket, has Sin left us! 1 Cor. 15.30.
Why stand we in jeopardy every hour? These days, look like the last days, and
in the last days, perilous times shall come. The Apostle, gives us a Narrative
of his dangers: In perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine
own contrymen, 2 Cor. 11.26.
in perils of the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness,
in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren. Now, Soul, art in danger
at Sea? in danger at Land? in danger of Soul, and Substance? in danger of Body,
and Basket? then this time of Danger, is a time of Need, and those (who are
Christ's) stand (now) in need of supply (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of
God.

A time of Dissertion, is a time of Need. To lose sight of Christ, who is so
taking a Beauty, is a loss indeed; For we are in the wilderness, and have (at
most) but a pisgah-sight of the Holy Land. It was not enough to Absalom, to
live in Jerusalem, if he might not see the face of the King; It is not enough
to a Christian (of Christ's making) to live in a Church, if he does not see the
face of a Christ. Divine withdrawings, are Soul-troubles; now Soul-troubles,
are the saddest, and the sorest Troubles. Psalm. 30.7.
Thou did hide thy face, and I was troubled. What loss, next the loss of the
Soul, to the loss of the Face of God, and Christ! Has God forgotten to be
gracious? will he be favorable no more? A Christian (thorough Grace) knows (in
some measure) how to bear (other) losses, but he knows not how to bear (this)
loss; a loss of the Face of God. Is not that a strange strain? Wherefore hidest
thou thy face, Job 13.24.
and hold me for thine enemy? Is not (now) a time of Desertion, a time of
Need? and do not those (who are Christ's) stand (now) in need of fresh, and full
supplies (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God?

A time of Duty, Need. The chiefest, and choicest Saints, have no exemption
from Duty. Mercy, exempts not from Duty. Mercy, is so far from giving a
dispensation (unto) Duty, as that it lays under the greatest obligation (for)
Duty. Two things (here) fall under discussion; the Duty to be performed, and
the indifferency of spirit, to perform this Duty.

The Duty to be performed. varieties of Duties, incumbent upon those (who are
Christ's;) there is meditating, and mourning; preaching, and praying; hearing,
and reading; but, I shall single out one, Acts 9.11
and that is Prayer; Go, for behold he prays. Prayer, is natural worship; and
incumbent it is upon every creature, to look unto the Creator.

Consider the indifferency of spirit, perform the duty. Indifferency of spirit,
is a malignant disease; a disease, full of malignity: where is the man, or the
woman, that is not (more, or less) at (some time, or other) tainted with it?
The Church, was not without this Plague Sore. I have put off my coat, Cant. 5.3.
how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? Had she
not (then) too great indifferency of spirit, whether she should open to Christ,
or no? whether she should maintain a converse with Christ, or no? whether she
should be found in a way of Duty, or no? Ye have said, it is vain to serve God,
Mal. 3.14.
and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we walked in
black before Jehovah of Hosts? If persons be indifferent, whether they
meditate, and pray, or no; whether they hear, and read, or no; whether we keep
up Family, and Closet Duty, or no, it is very dangerous; for, if a person take
leave of Duty, he is like to take leave of Christ too. The safety, and mercy of
a Soul, are in a way of Duty.

Thy Safety is in a way of Duty. Prove. 1.33.
and shall be quiet from fear of evil. He shall not (only) be quiet from the
evil of fear, but (also) quiet from the fear of evil. Jonah, was safe, while he
kept with God.

Thy Mercy is in a way of Duty. what then? Isa. 48.18
what not then? Then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as
the waves of the sea. Then, there had been more Peace, and more Grace too.

There is a twofold Obedience, Active, and Passive; now Grace for both, is laid
under promise.

There is a twofold Obedience, Active, and Passive; now Grace for both, is laid
under promise.

Grace, for Action, is laid under promise. Christ, is the Cry of every Soul
(in) Christ! Oh, I tremble to think least my day should be at an end, before my
work be done! Oh (says the Soul) my Glass is almost out, and little of my work
is done! But, Soul, Grace, to do, is laid under promise. Verily, Verily, John
14.12.
I say unto you, he that believes on me, the works that I do, shall he do
also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father.

Grace, for Passion, laid under promise. As there must be doing, so suffering,
according to the will of God. Oh (says the Soul) there may be a Storm at hand,
a Shower of Blood at hand, and I know not how to weather it! Oh (says the
Soul) for ought I see, there may be a Rack for me, a Stake for me, and I know
not how to weather these! But, Soul, Grace to dye, as well as do, is laid under
promise. It is given unto you in the behalf of Christ, Phi. 1.29.
not (only) to believe, but (also) to suffer for his sake. Are not (now) these
times, times of need, and do not (now) those (who are Christ's) stand in need,
of fresh, and full supplies (from the God of Grace) of the Grace of God? Thus,
of things present.

Those (actually) Christ's, Heirs of things to come. As Heirs of things present,
so, there are things to come, of which they shall be Heirs.

But, Qu.
what are those things to come, of which those (who are actually Christ's) shall
be Heirs?

Those (actually) Christ's, Sol. 1.
shall be indulged (hereafter) a perfect knowledge. Knowledge, is imperfect
here, it will be perfect hereafter. Ignorance, is so far from being a Virtue,
Multi, multa sciunt, se autem nome.
as that it is a Vice; and so far from being the Mother of Devotion, as that it
is the Mother of Destruction, whatever the blind, and the bloody Papists say.
It was the usual Speech of Henry IV. That many know many things, but no man
himself. It is deservedly accounted a piece of excellent knowledge, to
understand the Law of the Land, and the Customs of a man's Country; how much
more to know the Statutes of Heaven, and the Laws of Eternity? It was the
saying of One, To know thy self is very difficult; for, as the Eye can see all
things but it self, Basil.
so, some, can discern all faults but their own. We should be thankful for the
little that we know, and humble that we know so little. We should use our
knowledge as much as we can, Nosce teipsum.
but know it as little as we can, unless in the using of it. To know for our
Good, is only good knowledge. To know God, and our selves, is the sum of all
knowledge. God, does not know him, that knows not himself. It is said of a
holy, and learned man, that in the midst of his Learning, Bishop Usher.
he would still cry out of his ignorance of Christ. Empty Vessels sound most,
and shallow streams make the greatest noise in passage. It was said by the
Ancients, That it is impossible to know God, without God. We must learn all
that (from) God, Ex puris negativis, nihil concluditur.
which we know (of) God; unless God be our Tutor, we shall never be good
Seholars. We know not God, nor our selves, any further than God teaches us.
The Sun, is not more necessary to the World; the Eye, to the Body; the Pilot,
to the Ship; the Admiral, to the Army, etc. than the knowledge of Christ, to a
self-destroying creature. The knowledge of God (now) is rather negative, than
positive; we know not so well what God (is) as what God (is not;) now, it is
observed to our hands, that, from pure Negatives, there can be no certain
Conclusion made. Is not this all we know, that we know nothing? that we know
not that neither; that it is nothing we (yet) know, as we ought to know? But,
though knowledge (here) be imperfect, yet knowledge (hereafter) shall be
perfect. Now we know but in part, but then shall we know, even as we are known.
1 Cor. 13.12.
This (As) is a Note of Quality, not of Equality; as God knows according to his
infinite excellency, so we shall know according to our capacity.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) perfect Unity. Here, Ephraim
envy Judah, and Judah vex Ephraim, but it shall not be so hereafter. Luther,
and Calvin, did not agree upon Earth, but they do not disagree in Heaven; they
are of one mind in Heaven, though their Disciples are not of one mind upon
Earth. Hooper and Ridley.
Those two blessed Martyrs, (in time of peace, and liberty) could not agree
about black, and white; but (as their expression is) in time of Persecution
could agree about Red; when laid under passion, they could forget all
differences of judgment. The first rent that ever was in Gods Family, was the
Pride of the Angels, and ever since it has born the like fruit. Seneca.
What one said of Philosophers, (That the Clocks would sooner agree, than the
Philosophers) may be said of some Prefessors. It was a good saying of one,
Baxter 's True Catholic, 128.
Though we must not unite with any in their Sin, yet we must unite with all
that are Christians, in their Christianity. Our Chronicles tell us, that the
Saxons and Danes, had never conquered us, had it not been for our own
Divisions. Division, is a cursed weed, and it grows apace; but, is it not pity,
that Abraham and Lot should fall out by the way, for they are Brethren? united
force, Vis unita sortior,
is most forcible; and a threefold Cord is not easily broken. Saintship, must
not be confined within one Party: The new Creature, is found in Circumcision,
as well as in Uncircumcision; and as eminent in the one, as the other. It were
the highest Sacrilege in the world, to make a Monopoly of Christianity; to
monopolize that Title of Saints, and Godly Party, to any one Party. Why should
we gratify the Turks, who pray, That seeing the Christians cannot love them,
they may (therefore) hate one another? One, writing to another, says, Though
we should never see one another more in this World, yet we shall meet in that
place, Grynaeus, to Chytraeus.
where Luther and Zuinglius agree very well together. The Combination of
Sinners, have not so much prejudiced the Power of Godliness, as the Contention
of Saints. Division of Tongues, obstructed the building of Babel; and (if I
mistake not) Division of Hearts, Heads, and Hands, obstruct the building of
Jerusalem. The Romists, improve their utmost endeavor to break the Unity of
Christians, and what would they not give to effect it? Quarrel not the Moon out
of her Orb, and think her unworthy of the Skies, because she wears a spot, for
she is a glorious Ball of light. Whoever is right, or ^rong, in point of
Judgment, I am sure he is wrong, that is not right, in point of Affection. I
cannot but approve what God is (now) reducing unto, Protestant and Papist. Why
is Mahomet (set like Dagon) where the Ark once stood? And Paga asm has thrust
Christianism out of doors? Israel, is not true to Judah; the renting of the Ten
Tribes from the Two, has made both the Two, and the Ten miserable. Oh that
Jerusalem were at Unity within her self! Oh that Zion may not dye (like
Antiochus, or Jehoram) of a disease in her own bowels! All, that I can say, or
will say, is Love, Love, Love: The God of Love, and love of God, constrain
beloved ones, to love one another; that it may be said at (last) as at (first)
Behold, how they love one another! In all the loud Cries about Differences,
this tou^heth my heart, that some can trample a poor Saint into the dust, and
(if they might) into the Grave, for a Peccadillo, a little distance in an
Opinion. Now, though Christians (of Christ's making) disagree upon Earth, they
shall agree in Heaven. When pale Death, arrests those (actually) Christ's, for
an Eternity, and they be Graciously passed thorough the Gates into the City,
they shall not find Faith there, for that is gone into Vision; nor Hope there,
for that is gone into Fruition; but, they shall find Love there; yea (there)
they shall find nothing but Love. There abides Faith, Hope, 1 Cor. 13.13.
and Love; these three, but the greatest of these is Love. The greatest,
because the longest lived.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) perfect Grace. Is not
perfection of Grace, the great thing looked for, and longed for, by those who
are actually Christ's? Every Grace is imperfect (here,) but every Grace shall be
perfect (hereafter.) Christ, beholds, in all that are (actually) his, a
constant striving after plenary Perfection, in the midst of all their
Imperfections. Perfection, is the Aim of the Saints on Earth, and the Reward of
the Saints in Heaven. They, who now pretend to Personal Perfection, are perfect
Strangers to their own hearts. Who can say I have made my heart clean, Prove.
20.9. Faldo 's Key, etc. p. 77.
I am pure from my sin? There is a Generation of a late Edition, that pretend
unto a Personal Perfection; they say, Perfection, is not that which is sincere;
or, a Perfection of Parts; or, a Sanctification throughout in part; but a being
without sin, in the least Remains, and Stains of it: But, uprightness of Heart,
and sincerity of Soul, goes for Perfection with God. Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright, Psalm. 37.37.
for the end of that man is peace. As God accepts the Will for the Deed, so
he expresses the Deed by the Will; interpreting one to be perfect, who would
be perfect. There is no plenary Perfection, on this side Heaven (but sin that
dwells in me) unless we reflect the first Resurrection, Romans 7.20. 1 Cor.
15.42. Beza.
which will be a state of Incorruption. These were some of the words of One, a
little before Death sealed up his lips, Lord, Perfect that which thou have
begun, that I suffer not shipwreck in the Haven. Here, the complaint is, a
little Faith, and great Unbelief; a little Humility, and great Pride; a little
Patience, and great Passion; but there shall be no such cry hereafter When
Time, goes into Eternity, then Grace, shall go into Glory. There is a twofold
Perfection; a Perfection of the Truth of Grace, and a Perfection of the Growth
of Grace; but suffer a distinct discussion of these.

There is a Perfection of the Truth of Grace. Mat. 25.4.
took oil in their vessels, with their lamps. Oil (only) in the Lamp, is
(only) a^ blaze of Profession; Oil, in the Vessel, is Truth o^ Grace in the
Heart. This, is a Perfection of parts. Since the day ye heard it, and knew the
Grace of God in truth. Col. 1.6.
Thus, a Child, is a perfect Child, having all the parts of a man. The Soul,
which has the Truth of Grace, has something of every Grace.

There is a Perfection of the Growth of Grace. Ephesians. 4.13.
and knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fullness of Christ. This, is a Perfection of degrees, when Grace
is swailowed up in Glory. Heb. 12.23.
To the spirits of just men made perfect.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) perfect Peace. Pax, Bello
potior. Nomen Pacis desiderabile. Esto bellando pacisicus. Aug. Greg. Nyssen.
Peace, is better than War; yea, the very name of Peace, is desirable. Peace,
is a confluence of all good things; the Jews (therefore) when they wish a man
well, salute him thus, Peace be unto thee. The effect of War, is waste. It is
said of the Turkish-War, that where the Grand Seigniors Horse sets his foot, no
more Grass will grow; he makes havoc of all. Every Seat of War, becomes a Seat
of Wrath; an Ire-land. In War (says One) seek Peace. Another, says, Both the
name, and nature, of Peace, is sweet. Outward Peace, is the chiefest of outward
Blessings; inward Peace, is the chiefest of inward Blessings. Peace (upon
Earth) is imperfect, but Peace (in Heaven) shall be perfect. Heaven, is called
the Joy of the Lord, Mat. 25.21, 23.
because (there) is Joy, and nothing but Joy is (there.) Enter thou into the
Joy of thy Lord.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) perfect Vision. Potter 's
Compendious View. p. 54.
Vision (on Earth) is imperfect, but Vision (in Heaven) is perfect. In the most
Northern part of Tartaria, they have Day for six months together, and Night
(also) for the other six months together. It is thus with some Souls; if they
have Day (the shines of God) for a considerable time, they (also) have Night
(the Frowns (...) God) for a considerable time. A Christian, is ^^ke the
Marigold, that opens with the shining, and ^^uts with the setting of the Sun.
God, often leaves ^^e brightest men in an Eclipse, to show, That they ^rrow
their light from his Reflection. It is said, Clark's Mirror. p. 190.
that over the top of the mountain of Potosi, there ^ways hangs a Cloud, even
in the clearest day. Un^er the greatest Calm, thou may be near a Storm;
under the greatest Vision, be near Desertion. Aug.
It was ^^e desire of One, to see three things. 1. Rome, in ^s Flower. 2. Paul,
in the Pulpit. 3. Christ, in ^he Flesh. Did Alexander lay up Homers Iliads in
(...) Cabinet, embroidered with Gold, and Pearls? Certainly (then) a deserted
Soul will lay up reci^us Promises in the Cabinet of his heart, as choice
Treasure. The Saints (on Earth) cry out of De^artures, Eclipses, etc. but (in
Heaven) there shall ^e Vision without Amission, and Intermission.

In Heaven, there shall be Vision without Amission. loss of Vision in Heaven.
Here, ^he Cry is, Saw ye him whom my Soul loves? Can. 3.3.
Do you ^ee him? for my part, I have lost sight of him; but, ^o such Cry in
Heaven, as the loss of Vision.

In Heaven, Vision without Intermission. As it is the felicity of a Person upon
Earth, that God always beholds him, so it is the felicity of this Person in
Heaven, that he always beholds God. Upon Earth, the Sun goes down upon thee,
and it is (often) Night to thy Soni; but, in Heaven, it shall (never) go down
upon thee, but shall be always Day to thy Soul. If once arrived at Heaven, thou
shall never more lose sight of the Tree of Life; when once there, no Cloud will
at any time interpose beeween thy Soul, and thy Savior. Blessed, Mat. 5.8.
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. The pure in heart (here) see
God, and then lose sight of him; but, the pure in heart (hereafter) shall so
see God, as never more to lose sight of him.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) perfect Freedom. A threefold
Freedom, shall these have.

Those (actually) Christ's, shall be indulged (here. after) a perfect Freedom
from (Satanical) Suggestion. Now, Satan rages, ranges, roars, for his time is
short. Who is able to enumerate (now) the temptations of those who are Christ's?
Satan, always goes about like a Lion to devour, or like a Serpent, to deceive,
and delude. Are not the best tempted most? But, Satan, being once cast out of
Heaven, shall never come there more; he is confined to the Aireal part; Ephesians.
2.2. (...)
he is the Prince of the Power of the Air. He tempted in the terrestial, but he
cannot tempt in the celestial Paradise; yea, under the Personality of Christ's
Reign upon Earth ( the thousand years, Rev. 20.3.
according to the Greek) Satan shall be chained up.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) a perfect Freedom from (sinful)
Communion. The Cry of a Christian (here) is, Woe to me that I live in Mesech,
Ps. 120.5.
(with a barbarous People) and dwell in the tents of Kedar, (with the Sons of
Ishmael.) The Cry of Christians (in this world) may be like the complaint of
the Prophet, The Princes of the Nations, are like the Princes of Sodom, and the
People of the Nations, like the People of Gomorrah; but, there are no Nero's,
and Nebuchadnezzars, in Heaven; no Pharachs, and Pilates, in Heaven; no Cains,
and Caligula's in Heaven; no person living, 1 Cor. 6.9 Heb. 12.22, 23, 24.
and dying in his sin, shall inherit the kingdom of God. There (is) in Heaven,
a holy God, and a holy Christ; there (are) in Heaven, holy Angels, and holy
Saints, but not an unholy Soul there.

Those (actually) Christ's, indulged (hereafter) a perfect Freedom from (sinful)
Corruption. I know none (save those that are perfect strangers to their own
hearts) but complain of Sin; some, of one Sin, some of another. Oh how fain
would the Soul (which is actually Christ's) lay down this body of Sin, and
Death! Oh, says the Soul, when shall I go home? when shall I go to my Fathers
house, where I shall never sin more? He, that is dead, is freed from sin. Romans
5.12
Death, came in by Sin, and Sin goes out by Death; the Death of the Body,
freeth us from the Body of Death.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial VII. 2 Chronicles. 18.3, 31. Chap. 19.2, 3.
Be joyous (also) for thou art on the best side. As there is the worst, so
there is the best side. The worlds side, is the worst side; Gods side, is the
best side. It was not the Virtue, but the Vice of Jehoshaphat, to be of Ahab's
side, and it had like to have cost his life. That side, is the best side, on
which holy Saints, and Angels are; on which a holy God, and a holy Christ are;
but these are on (thy) side, if thou be (actually) Christ's.

That side, is the best side, Saints are; but they are on (their) side, who are
actually Christ's. Though God has a Bag for the Sins of his, yet he has a Book
for the Prayers of his, and a Bottle for the Tears of his: Now all the Prayers,
and Tears, of all the Saints, throughout all the Universe, are engaged for
those, who are actually Christ's. I have seen, Acts 7.34
I have seen the affliction of my People which is in Egypt, and have heard
their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.

That side, is the best side, Angels are; but they are on (their) side, who are
actually Christ's. Sodom, and Gomorrah, were not a match for two Angels.
Sennacheribs Army, was not a match for one Angel; and yet holy Angels are on
their side, who are Christ's. Are they not all ministering Spirits, Heb. 1.14
sent forth to minister unto them who shall be heirs of salvation.

That side, is the best side, God is; but God is on (their) side, Psalm. 118.6.
who are actually Christ's. Jehovah is on my side, or (for me) I will not fear;
what can man do unto me?

That side, is the best side, Christ is; but he is on (their) side, who are
actually his. For how many did Alexander stand? For how many did they reckon
Gideon? The Sword of the Lord, Rev. 6.2.
and of Gideon: But a greater than Gideon is here, Christ Jesus the Lord, (who
went out conquering, and to conquer) and for how many stands He? Now, is not
(that) side, the (best) side, on which holy Saints are, and they are numerous?
I looked, Rev. 14.1.
and lo a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him an hundred forty and four
thousand. Is not (that) side, the (best) side, on which holy Angels are, an^
they are innumerable? Heb. 12.22. Isa. 40.15
To an innumerable company^ Angels. Is not (that) side, the (best) side, o^
which a holy God is? For, All Nations unto him are but as the drop of a Bucket.
Is not (that) side the (best) side, on which a holy Christ is? For He is the
Captain of the Saints salvation, Heb. 2.10
made perfect thorough suffering. Soul, thy side, is Christ side, and Christ's
side, is thy side; take (now) (...) taste what manner of side Christ's is.

Christ's side, strongest side. Are not me^ for the strongest side? but, most
men mistake tha^ side; that is the strongest side, on which Christ is Be
strong, and courageous, be not afraid, nor dismayed, for the King of Assyria, 2 Chronicles. 32. 7, 8.
nor for the multitude tha^ is with him, for there are more with us, than with
him; with him, is an Arm of flesh, but with us is the living God to help us,
and to fight our Battles. God, is incomprehensible, therefore innumerable:
Here, all natural, and spiritual Arithmetic, and Rhetoric, are puzzled, and
posed.

Christ's side, soundest side. The worlds side, is an unsound side; an ulcerous
side; a rotten side: Their Root, is Rottenness. The world, has a stinking
Breath, and the Air of the world is infectious. Joseph, had not been long in
the Court of Pharaoh, before he learned to swear by the Life of Pharaoh: But,
now, Christ's side, is a sound side, there is soundness within, there is truth
in the inward parts: yea, it is sound within and without; The Kings daughter is
all Glory within, Psalm. 45.13.
and her clothing is of wrought Gold.

Christ's side, prudent side. The greatest Sinners, are the greatest Fools, the
greatest Saints, are the greatest Sages. Those (who are actually Christ's) are
wise unto salvation, which is the greatest wisdom; they have that wisdom from
above, which is first pure, and then peaceable. Thou (thorough thy
Commandments) have made me wiser than mine Enemies. Psalm. 119.98.


Christ's side, prevailing side. He must reign, until he has put all his
enemies under his feet. A fourfold Conquest, has Christ Jesus made for His.

Over Sin. To conquer a Lust, conquer a Land. 2 Cor. 5.21.
He was made Sin (a Sacrifice) for us, who knew no Sin (by Himself) that we
might be made the righteousness of God, in him. He slays the Sons of Zerviah
within.

Over Satan. Satan, is a great Enemy, Sin be a greater; but Christ has made a
Conquest upon both. 1 John 3.8.
Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the Devil.

Over the Earth. potent Enemy unto all, but a prevailing Enemy unto many, unto
most. Few, are a match for the world, John 16.33.
but Christ is. I have overcome the world.

Over Heaven. Heaven, is worth the hearing, hecding, worth the having, worth
the holding. And to look for his Son from Heaven, 1 Thessalonians. 1.10.
whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to
come.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial VIII.
Be joyous (also) for thou art graciously interested in the blessed Blood, of a
bleeding Jesus.

But what manner of Blood is Christ's Blood? Quest. Sol. 1.


Christ's Blood, is precious Blood. The Redemption of a Soul, is precious, for
the Soul is redeemed with Blood that is precious. If the blood of a Christian
be so precious in Gods eyes, how precious should the Blood of a Christ be in
our eyes? The blood of Saints, is precious in the eyes of God. Psalm. 116.15.
Precious in the sight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints. This Blood, is
(also) precious in the eyes of Christ. Psalm. 72, 14.
He shall redeem their soul from deceit, and violence, and precious shall their
blood be in his sight. Is the blood of a Christian thus? What should the Blood
of a Christ then be in our eyes, for it is precious Blood? Ye are not redeemed
with corruptible things, as silver, and gold: There is the negative part:
Silver, and Gold, are corruptible things, though (unto some) as Micah's gods
were to him; take away these things (though corruptible things) and they have
nothing left: Ye have taken away my gods from me, and the Priest, and what have
I left? Here is a Redemption, but not with corruptible things, as Silver, 1
Pet. 1.18, 19.
and Gold. Silver, and Gold, may redeem a person in captivity to the Turk, or
Tartar, but Silver, and Gold, cannot redeem a Person in captivity to Sin, and
Satan. If this cannot, what can? the Blood of Christ can: But, with the
precious Blood of Christ. There is the positive part. What Silver, and Gold,
cannot do, the Blood of Christ can do, for that is precious.

Christ's Blood, pure Blood. Though, to be sinless, cannot be asserted of man,
yet it may be asserted of God-man. Heb. 4.15
In all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Though Christ was
tempted (to) sin, yet not (into) sin. 1 Pet. 1.19.
Christ, is called a Lamb, and so he is for harmlesness, for meekness, for
silence, for sacrifice: He is a Lamb without blemish, and without spot. Aquinas.
Free (says one) from all sin, original, and actual. He is without blemish,
sound within, and without spot, right without. The Apostle (here) alludes to
the Paschal Lamb, and to the Lamb for the daily sacrifice; both (which) were to
be without blemish, and without spot.

The Paschal Lamb. Ex. 12.5. Joh. 1.29.
a male of the first year. Now, this Lamb, was a Type of Christ. Behold the
Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world.

The Lamb, daily Sacrifice. This, is the offering made by fire, Number. 28.3.
which ye shall offer unto the Lord; two Lambs of the first year, without spot,
day, by day, for a continual burnt-offering. This Lamb (also) was a Type of
Christ. Purge out (therefore) the old leaven, 1 Cor. 5.7
that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For, even Christ our
Passover is sacrificed for us. Was it thus with the Type? then it was thus
with the Antitype.

Christ's Blood, purifying Blood. It is the Blood of Jesus, Heb. 9.14.
that purges the conscience from dead works. It is Christ's Blood, that purges
from dead works in a state of death, and from liveless works, in a state of
life. Joh. 13.8 Rev. 1.5.
It is Christ must wash; If I wash thee not, thou have no part with me. Yea, it
is Christ must wash from sin in his own blood. As the merit of Christ's Blood,
Balnaeum coeleste.
does pacify God, so the virtue of Christ's Blood, does purify man. Christ's
Blood, is the Bath of the King of Heaven. Christ's Blood, is a Laver to wash in;
it washes a crimson-sinner milk-white. The blood of Christ cleanses us from
all sin. The word of Christ, is a Looking-Glass, to show us our sins; the blood
of Christ is a Fountain, to wash them away.

Christ's blood, is purchasing blood. Christ, bought his out of the hands of
Justice; of Sin; of Satan. Ye are bought with a price; 1 Cor. 6.19, 20.
be ye not the servants of men. Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a
price. There was (little) paid for the Savior, there was (much) paid for the
Sinner. Christ, was sold; did not Covetousness set him to sale? But, for what
was he sold? for 30 pieces of silver; the price that a Slave was valued at. The
Prophet stands (as it were) amazed, and amused, at this price. A goodly price,
Zech. 11.13.
that I was prized at of them. And I took the 30 pieces of silver, and cast
them to the Potter, in the house of the Lord. There was little paid for the
Savior, but there was much paid for the Sinner. The Savior, was bought with
silver, but the Sinner is bought with blood; yea, with the blood of Christ.
Feed the Church of God, Acts 20.28.
which he has purchased with his own blood.

Christ's blood, is pardoning blood. blood of Christ, that we have a lasting,
yea, an everlasting pardon, of all our sins. If Christ had never dyed, Sin, had
never been pardoned; Heb. 9.22
for without shedding of blood, there is no remission. Art a believing Soul?
then thou art a pardoned Soul. Christ, does not (only) give Pardon to him that
believes, but (also) gives Faith to believe that Pardon. Art a repenting
Soul? then thou art a pardoned Soul. Christ, does not (only) give remission of
sin to those that repent, but (also) repentance for remission of sin, and gives
them repentance of the sins remitted. Art in the Church. and in Christ too?
thou art (then) a pardoned Soul, though the tears of Repentance stand in thine
eyes, that thou can not read thy Pardon. Luther.
Lord (says One) now do what thou will with me, for thou have pardoned me. The
pardon of sin, is such a mercy, that a man cannot be happy (hereafter) nor yet
happy (here) without it. Though a Soul may have Grace, yet he cannot have
Peace, that is without a sight, and sense of Pardon. Now, Pardon of sin, is an
effect of Christ's blood. Ephesians. 1.7.
In whom we have redemption thorough his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of his Grace. Pardon of sin, is a complicated mercy.

Christ's blood, pleading blood. Satan, the Law, and Conscience, plead against
us; cry to God against us: and (as it were) say, this man, and woman, have
commiteed multiplied forbidden Iniquities, and omitted multiplied imposed
Duties; these Persons, have so many vain Thoughts; so many dead Prayers; have
neglected so many precious Ordinances; sinned after so many signal
deliverances, etc. But, no sooner can these Indictments be put in against those
who are Christ's, but they are cast out of the Court of Heaven by Christ, for
his blood, is pleading blood. The Cry of Sin, is a loud Cry; grievous Sins,
make great Cries. Jehovah, said, because the cry of Sodom, Genesis 18.20, 21.
and Gomorrah, is great, and because their sin is grievous, I will go down now,
and see whether they have done altogether (according to the cry of it) which is
come unto me, and if not, I will know. There is a loud voice in the Cry of Sin,
but there is a louder voice in the Cry of Blood. And to the blood of
sprinkling, Heb. 12.24.
which speaks better things than the blood of Abel. It is called the blood of
sprinkling, in allusion to the Passover, where the bloods (says One) of the
Paschal Lamb was sprinkled on the posts of the door, M. Hildersam.
to save the house from the stroke of the revenging Angel. The blood of Abel,
did plead (against) the Offender, but the blood of Christ, does plead (for) the
Believer. Abel's blood, cried for vengeance; Christ's blood, cries for mercy.

Christ's blood, procuring blood. The holy place; the holy of holiest; and the
holiest of all, are one, and the same. Into the holy place was the High Priest
only to go, and that not without blood. Aaron, Lev. 16.3.
was to come into the holy place, with a young Bullock for a sin-offering, and
with a Ram for a burnt-offering. Into the second Tabernacle, went the High
Priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and
for the errors of the People. Now, the holy place, and the holy of holiest,
were a Type of Heaven; and the blood the High Priest went with, was a Type of
Christ's blood. Christ's blood, was Christ's way to Heaven, and must be the way
for his also. By his own blood, Heb. 9.12
he once entered into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for
us. The spurious spawn of the Papists, are under a prodigious mistake, who say,
That Heaven is not that place, where the Man Christ is, above, or beyond, the
visible Skies, but the happiness they have within them. If Israel (according to
the flesh) passed thorough the Red Sea, unto Canaan as Type, so Israel
(according to the Spirit) must pass thorough the Red Sea of Christ's blood, Heb.
10.19.
unto Heaven the Antitype. Having, therefore, brethren, boldness, to enter into
the holiest; but how? by the blood of Jesus. Our Sins, did shut Heaven, but
Christ's blood is the Key, that opens the Gate of Paradise for us.

Christ's blood, is pacifying blood. bleeding, was Gods pacifying. Christ's
blood, Col. 1.21, 22.
is the blood of Atonement. You, has he reconciled, in the body of his flesh
thorough death. Christ's blood, is not (only) a Sacrifice, but (also) a
Propitiation; denoting, a bringing us into favor with God. It is one thing for
a Traitor to be pardoned, and another thing for this Traitor to be brought into
favor. Man's sin, rent him (from) God, but Christ's blood, Romans 5.10.
cements him (to) God. Reconciled to God; but how? by the death of his Son. Had
we as much Grace as the Angels; had we offered up millions of Sacrifices; had
we wept Rivers of Tears, we could never have appeased an angry Deity. It is the
blood of a Christ, that ingratiates us into the favor of God, and causes him
to look upon us with a (smiling) Aspect. When Christ dyed, the vail of the
Temple was rent: This, was not without a mystery, showing, that (thorough
Christ's blood) the vail of our sins is rent, which did interpose between God,
and us. One, Theodoret.
calls the Cross, the Tree of Salvation; because the blood which trickled down
the Cross, distilleth Salvation. It is the blood of Christ that pacifies.

Christ's blood, is conquering blood. Combat, and the Conflict, is the
Conquest. Nay, in all these things, Romans 8.37.
we are more than Conquerors, thorough Christ that loved us. These things; but,
what things were these? There were seven Dishes, and each Dish enough for the
strongest Palate; Tribulation; Distress; Romans 8.35. (...)
Persecution; Famine; Nakedness; Peril; Sword: yet, in all these things, we are
more than Conquerors. We over-overcome, so the Greek. We are more than
Conquerors (in) them, because we are Conquerors (by) them. But, how is this?
thorough Christ. Though Christians may be killed, yet they cannot be conquered;
for though they die in the Combat, yet (like Sampson), they shall have the
Conquest. The Conquest, that the Christian has, is thorough Christ's blood.
They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, Rev. 12.11.
and by the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives unto the
death. Conquest, is thorough Christ.

Christ's blood, crucifying blood. A Christ ( bleeding to death) will bleed sin
to death. They, that are Christ's, Gal. 5.24
have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. As that Physic saves
a man's life which removes his sickness; so that which is life to the soul, is
death to the sin. We must look upon our sin, as that which was the death of our
Lord; and we must look upon the death of our Lord, as that which will be the
death of our sin. Our old man is crucified with him, Romans 6.6.
that the body of sin might be destroyed. Sin, drew out the lifeblood of
Christ, and faith (in Christ's blood) will draw out the lifeblood of sin.

Christ's blood, softening blood. Though the heart of man, be the hardest thing
in the world, yet the blood of Christ ( God-man) can soften the heart of man.
Oh, says one! my heart is like the nether millstone, and what can soften that?
Oh, says another! my heart is like an Adamant, and what can soften an Adamant?
Is there any thing in the world that can soften an Adamant? Yea, Soul, blood,
will soften an Adamant. The blood of Christ (if applied) will soften the most
Adamantine heart. The blood of Christ (if applied) can dissolve the most stony
heart, and break the hardest sinner. The Jews (who are hardened to a Proverb)
for one says, Do thou think that I am a hard-hearted Jew? these Jews, shall
have the Rock of their Hearts, turned into a Fountain of Tears. Zech. 12.10.
They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn, as one for his
only Son, and be in bitterness as one for his firstborn. God, himself, has
laid himself under Promise, to take away the stony heart, and to give an heart
of flesh. Ezekiel. 11.19.
There is nothing so hard, but it may be softened, if it lay a steeping in this
blood. Water, will soften the earth, but it will not soften a stone; the blood
of Christ (if applied) will soften a stone; yea, an heart of stone. This blood,
turns a flint into a spring. The Jaylors heart was dissolved.

Christ's blood, is quickening blood. life of a thing, is in the blood. The life
of the flesh, Lev. 17.11.
is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an
atonement for your sins; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the
soul. The blood, is called life; because the seat of life, is in the blood; and
this was a figure of Christ; a Type of Christ's life, whose flesh, is meat
indeed, and whose blood, is drink indeed. The life of our soul, Sanguis
Christi, Clavis Coeli. Luther.
is in the blood of Christ. Christ's blood, is Heaven's Key. One little drop
(says One) of Christ's blood, is more worth than Heaven, and Earth. What is
the blood of a Grape? yea, what is the blood of a Son (though an only Son) to
the blood of a Savior? Can we give our firstborn for our iniquity? the seed
of our body, for the sin of our soul? It is the blood of Christ that
quickens. John 6.53, 54.
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no
life in you: whosoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life,
and I will raise him up at the last day. Christ's blood, puts vivacity into us.

Christ's blood, is justifying blood. Justification, ^s a great thing: to be
acquitted from sin, and death, the wages thereof; and to be accounted righteous
unto life, and Glory, the Reward thereof, is not this a great thing? and yet
this is by Christ's blood. The moving cause of Justification, is the free Grace
of God, but the meritorious cause of Justification, is the blood of Christ.
Being justified freely by his Grace, Romans 3.24.
thorough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. The justification of one
sinner, is more than the creation of all the world. There are many, not (only)
in Italy, but (also) in England, who join Christ, and their Alms together;
Christ, and their works together; Socium habet neminem.
who join Christ, and their Prayers together; Christ, and their Preachers
together; who join Christ, and their Thoughts together; Christ, and their Tears
together. We may say of Christ, (in point of Justification) as was once said of
Caesar, He may have a Companion, but not a Competitor. If Caesar, must not have
a Competitor in Reigning, Christ, must not have a Competitor in justifying.
Much more being justified by his blood, Romans 5.9.
we shall be saved from wrath thorough him.

Christ's blood, invaluable blood. It is called the blood of God, because the
blood of that Christ, who is God. He, is the Pearl of great price; of greatest
price. The Kingdom of Heaven: The dispensation of the Gospel, of the Grace of
God, which is as an Instrument in the hands of the Spirit, to bring into the
Kingdom of Grace here, and shows the way to the Kingdom of Glory hereafter.
But, what of this Kingdom? Mat. 13.45, 46.
It is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly Pearls, who having found one of
great price, he went, and sold all that he had, and bought it.

But, Quest. Sol. 1.
what manner of Pearl, is (this) Pearl?

Christ, is, a necessary Pearl. Christ, is not (only) necessary, but (also) of
necessity. He is (thus) to sinners, Acts 4.12 Joh. 15.5.
for there is no salvation without him. A Christ, or I dye, and am damned, is
the cry of a sinner. He, is (also) thus to Saints, for there is no service
without him.

Christ, rare Pearl. A Phoenix, is a rare Bird, for (according to the
Historian) there is but One (at one time) in the world. But, herein, I may be
peremptory, and thou art not to be incredulous, that there is One, and (but)
one Christ. There is one God, 1 Timothy 2.5.
and one Mediator between God, and man, the man Christ Jesus. Pearls (in
Latin) are called Unions, because they are found One by One. Pearls and
Pebbles, do not (alike) lie in the Bosom, and Bowels, of the Earth: Pebbles,
may lie upon Heaps, but, Pearls, they are found One by One.

Christ, is, a taking Pearl. look upon this Pearl, the vetter ye will like it,
and the more ye will love it. If Christ, look upon the Church, Cant. 4.9. Chap.
6.5.
he is taken with Her. Thou have ravished my heart, my Sister, my Spouse.
Ravished my heart; taken away my heart; so the margent. Turn away thine eyes
from me, for they have overcome me. If (also) the Church look upon Christ, she
is taken with Him. As the apple tree, among the trees of the wood, Cant. 2.3.
Chap. 5.16.
so is my beloved among the sons. His mouth, is most sweet; yea, he is
altogether lovely.

Christ, is, a making Pearl. Have Christ? Then, taken for ever, so, thou art
made for ever. Thou had but a Rag before, thou have a Robe now; a Robe, that
will (universally) cloth thee, and cover thee. Thou had but a Pebble before,
thou have a Pearl now, that will pay all thy Debts, and bear all thy Charges,
but to these distinctly.

This Pearl, will pay all thy Debts. A person, pay his Debts to man, but he
cannot pay his Debts to God. Who is he that condemns? Romans 8.34.
it is Christ that dyed.

This Pearl, will bear all thy charges. man should have enough (if but enough)
to pay all his Debts, how shall he do to live afterward? how shall he do to
bear his charges afterward? Now, Christ, does not (only) pay the Debts of
his, but (be it written with a holy reverence) he (also) puts money into their
Purse, to bear their charges by the way. Because I live, ye shall live also.
Joh. 14.19.
If I cannot dye, then you shall (spiritually) live. A Christians life, depends
upon Christ's life: As he gives it, so, he augments it, and continues it.

Christ, is, an inestimable Pearl. puzzle, and pose, men, and Angels, to bring
in the worth, and weight, of this Pearl? Let Paul speak, for he was a curious
Orator. Ephesians. 3.8.
That I should preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ.
The ( City-Jewellers) may know the worth of many Jewels, but no Jeweller in any
City knows the worth of this Jewel; of this Pearl, Christ Jesus. No wonder
(now) that One said, (...) 8.
Mine eyes shall behold nothing but this inestimable Jewel, my Lord, and
Savior, Christ Jesus.

Christ, unlosable Pearl. Other Pearls, may be lost, but this cannot. Pearls,
were lost (in that prodigious, and stupendous City-Conflagration) but this
Pearl (Christ) was not (then) and (there) lost. Ye (that are Christ's) may lose
your Provision; lose your Plate; lose your Purse; but you cannot lose this
Pearl. Ye, may be at a loss concerning this Pearl, but, this Pearl cannot be
lost. Can the Pearl be lost, when the Soul that has (this) Pearl, cannot be
lost? but, the Soul that has this Pearl, Joh. 17.12. Cordial IX.
cannot be lost. All, that thou have given me, have I kept, and none of them
are lost.

Art (actually) in Christ? Be joyous (then) for He is the Object of thy
Delight, and Desire.

Christ, is the Object of thy Delight. This word ( Delight) as it is referrible
to Man, is reducible to two Heads, Unlawful, and Lawful; but to these
distinctly.

Unlawful. Delight, who can deny? would it not be lost labor to prove this? I
shall (therefore) only prove when it is unlawful.

Then Delight is unlawful, sinful. They delight in lies; Psalm. 62.4
they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly; in their inward parts.
marg.

Then Delight is unlawful, hypocritical. They seek me daily, Isa. 58.2.
and delight to know my ways, etc. they take delight in approaching to God.

Then Delight is unlawful, treacherous. This was the command of Saul to his
Servants, Commune with David secretly, 1 Samuel 18.22.
and say, Behold the King has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee;
now therefore be the Kings Son-in-law. Saul, will give Michal to David, but
it is out of treachery; it is that she may be a snare unto him, and that the
hands of the Philistines may be upon him.

Lawful. unlawful, so there is a lawful Delight, which may be reduced to two
heads, Natural, and Spiritual.

Natural. Delight is appointed, and approved (by) God, observing the limits
(of) God. The meek shall inherit the earth, Psalm. 37.11.
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

Spiritual. delight

In the People of God. Psalm. 16.3.
in whom is all my delight. David, did not delight in a cursed, and cruel Crew;
in a profane, and profuse Crew; in a roaring, and whornig Crew; in a daring,
and damning Crew; but his delight was in the Saints, and Servants of God.

In the Commandments of God. Psalm. 1.12.1.
that delights greatly in his Commandments.

There is a Delight in God himself. Spirit of sinfulness to delight in Sin, so
it is the Spirit of Godliness to delight in God, and make him the object of
delight. An Hypocrite delights not in God, nor the things of God. What is the
hope of the Hypocrite (though he has gained) when God takes away his Soul?
Will God hear his cry, Job 27.8, 9, 10.
when trouble comes upon him? Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he
always call upon God? An Hypocrite will serve God, no longer than he serves
himself of God: He looks one way, and rows another; he pretends one thing, and
intends another; he has Jacob's voice, but Esau's hands; we must do by an
Hypocrite (as we do by Hebrew) read him backward: But, a Soul ( actually) in
Christ, makes Christ the Object of his delight. Job 22.26.
Then shall thou delight thy self in the Almighty, and shall lift up thy face
to God. Now, a person then delights in Christ, Qui habet habentein omnia, habet
omnia.
and makes (him) the object of (his) delight, when he is well pleased with
Christ; when he is best pleased with Christ; when he acquiesceth in him, and
can be satisfied with him alone. None (to) Christ, says the Psalmist: None
(but) Christ, said the Martyr: All (in) Christ, says the Apostle. Christ
(then) is the object of a Souls delight, when he can be satisfied with Christ
in the absence of All, and not satisfied without Christ in the presence of All.
I have all; I abound, and am full. Paul, Phi. 4.18.
had little of the world, but he had much of Christ; and having Christ, who is
All; yea, All in All, he had All. No graceless Soul can delight (in) God (as)
God; can delight (in) Christ (as) Christ. What delights soever a graceless
person has, they are in something below a God; in something below a Christ.

But what manner of delight is (this) delight? Quest.


This delight, Sol. 1.
is a strong delight. It is not a feeble, but a full delight; not a weak, but a
strong delight. Nch. 8.10
The joy of the Lord is your strength. Worldly delights are weak, and they
weaken us; delight in the Lord is strong, and that strengthens us.

This delight, holy delight. The delights of the world are impure, and they
defile us; we seldom drink in worldly delights, but they leave some spot, and
taint, upon our spirits, and conversations; but the delights we have in Christ,
are all pure delights; yea, they are all purifying delights. He that has this
hope in him, 1 John 3.3.
purifieth himself as he is pure. This (as) is an (as) of quality, not of
equality.

This delight, cordial delight. It Is a delight (from) the heart; it is the
delight (of) the heart. This delight, is a real delight. Worldly delights, are
but shadows; or (Pageant-like) shadows of delight. The delight of an Hypocrite,
is like his holiness; as he has no real holiness, so he has no real delight;
but (this) delight is cordial. As seeking, so delighting, is from the heart.
When thou say seek ye my face, Psalm. 27.4
my heart said unto thee, thy face Lord will I seek.

This delight, constant delight. This delight, is not for a fit, and a pang,
but for a continuance. It Is not like the crackling of thorns under a Pot, Gnal.
that makes a noise, and a blaze for a time, but are presently extinct; but
(this) delight, is a constant delight. As it is a cordial delight; Delight thy
self (that is, Psalm. 37.4 Psalm. 94.19.
thy Soul) above in Jehovah; Hebrew; so it is a constant delight: In the
multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul. Thus, the
Soul (actually) in Christ, makes Christ the object of his delight.

Christ, is the Object of thy Desire. As Delight, so Desire, may be reduced to
two Heads, unlawful, and lawful.

Unlawful. There is a desire after things lawful, unlawful. There is a lusting
after things forbidden. The-love of money, 1 Timothy 6.10.
is the root of all evil. In these words ye have the Subject, and the Comment.

The Subject. The love of money: the desire; love; or study of money. It is a
preposterous, (...)
and inordinate love, desire, and study.

The Comment. But what of this love? or study? desire? It is the Risa; the root
of evil; yea, of all evil; yea, of all evils; so the Greek. (...). The element
of evils. Timon. Bion.
The Apostle says not that it is the cause, principle, or original, but the
root; and that not of a few, but of many evils; yea, not (only) of very many,
but (also) of all evils: As if a covetous man, who looks like a compound of
self, and of the world, were ready to commit any sin. One calls it the
Metropolis of Vice.

Lawful. As there is an unlawful, lawful desire, which may be reduced unto two
Heads, Natural, and Spiritual; to these distinctly.

Natural. There is a natural desire, appointed, and approved. Prove. 3.15.
She is more precious than Rubies, and all the things thou can desire, are
not to be compared with her.

Spiritual. This is a desire (from) the heart, desire (of) the heart. This
(heart-desire) is not (only) a looking (for) but (also) a longing (after) some
good, of which it finds, and feels, a want. Brethren, my hearts desire, Romans
10.1. Psalm. 73.25.
and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved. Now, having evinced
that there is the desire of the heart, I shall (also) evince, that the Soul
(actually) Christ's, makes Christ the Object of his hearts desire. There is a
place, of which take these Readings.

Who can be to me in Heaven besides thee? Junius.
And besides, thee am I delighted in none upon earth.

Whom have I in the Heavens? Ainsw.
And with thee I delight not any in earth.

There is none to me in Heaven, Sept.
and besides thee have I willed none upon earth.

Who to me in the Heavens? Hebr. Lo-caphatzti.
And with thee have I not delighted (or desired) in earth.

The word signifies to desire, as well as to delight. Here is One, who is the
object of desire, and this One, may be that Onely-one Christ Jesus: This (thee)
in that Text, is called God in the Context. Truly God is good to Israel, Psalm.
73.1. Psalm. 74.1.
even to all that are clean of heart. Oh God! why have thou cast us off for
ever? Now Christ is God: Thy Throne (ob God) is for ever and ever. The Church
makes Christ the object of her desire. Isa. 26.9.
With my soul have I desired thee in the night. That Christ is not without
compare, but in a Christians eye, nor the object, but of the Churches desire,
is evident beyond all (modest) contradiction; For He is not (thus) in the eyes

Of infernal Spirits. What have we to do with thee, Mat. 8.29.
Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to torment us before the time? Nor

Of graceless persons. Depart from us, Job. 21.14.
for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. But that Christ is without
compare in a Christians eye, and the object of the desire of the Church of the
firstborn, Heb. 12.23.
whose names are written in Heaven, will appear to a believing, and
unprejudiced Reader, by a reflection of his Person, and of his Affection; but
of these suffer a distinct (though concise) discussion.

Reflect the Person of Christ. Joseph, Genesis 41.38.
Is there such a Man as this Man, in whom the Spirit of God is? What (then) may
be said of a Jesus? Was it said (also) of a Job, there is none like him in all
the earth? Job 1.8.
What (then) may be said of a Jesus? Was it said of David, Thou art worth ten
thousand of us, 2 Samuel 18.3. Marg. 1.
(or, as ten thousand of us:) What (then) may be said of a Christ? my Soul!
reflect his Person as Man, and as God-Man.

Reflect his Person as Man. Narration of Genealogy as Christ has? It ends
thus; Luke 3.38
Who was the Son of Adam, who was the Son of God. Now, this Christ, was the
beloved and begotten Son of God.

Christ, Son of God. This is my beloved Son, Mark 9.7.
in whom I acquiesoe. Christ, is so beloved of the Father, that he loves none
out of him.

Christ, is the (begotten) Son of God. Joh. 3.18.
but he that believes not is condemned already; why? because he believes not
in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. Here is the Son of God; the
begotten Son of God; the only begotten Son of God. All the Sons of Men, are
the Sons of God by Creation; some of the Sons of Men, are the Sons of God by
Grace; but Christ, is the Son of God by Nature. Christ, is (so) the Son of God,
as there (never) was any, nor (ever) will be any; Is not this Christ (now) a
Person without compare in a Christians eye? and the Object of the Churches
desire?

Reflect the Person of Christ as God-Man. Christ was (true) yet not (mere) Man,
Verus, non merus Homo.
but God and Man; God manifest in the flesh. There have been many things
wonderful in the world, but the (hypostatical) Union, the Union of Natures in
Christ, is the Wonder of Wonders. 1 Timothy 3. ult.
That he who was (with) God; that was (from) God; yea, that (was) God, should
be made flesh, is the wonder of wonders. That he who had eternity for his
mansion, and eternity for his measure, should be an Infant of a day old, is the
Wonder of Wonders; but thus it was; Joh. 1.1, 14.
for the Word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us. Is not this Christ (now) a
Person without compare in a Christians eye? and the Object of a Christians
desire?

Reflect the Affection of Christ. lived as Christ lived, for he lived to love;
and no person ever loved as Christ loved, for he loved to dye, and dyed out of
love. But, suffer me to reflect his Affection, in the freeness of it; in the
fullness of it; in the firmness of it: To these distinctly.

Reflect the Affection of Christ, freeness of it. Christ, is free in love; is
first in love. 1 John 4.19.
We love him, because he first loved us. Had not Christ (first) fallen in love
with Us, we had (never) fallen in love with Him. Had not Christ (first) fired
our hearts with love, we had never bestowed a spark of spiritual Affection upon
Him. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us. That is, not that we loved
God, until we were loved (of) God. The motive for Christ's love (to) Us, was not
(in) Us, but in Himself, for we were in our blood. I will heal their
backsliding; Hos. 14.4.
I will love them freely.

Reflect the Affection of Christ, fullness of it. As it is free, so it is full
love. Is the Sun full of light? Christ is fuller of love. It pleased (both the
Father, Col. 1.19.
and the Spirit) that in the Son should all fullness dwell. Is the Ocean full of
water? Christ is fuller of love. Christ, must needs be fuller of love, than
these of light, and of water, for in him dwells all the fullness of the
Godhead personally. Col. 2.9.
If thou be a beloved one, a believing one, then Christ loves thee more,
than others can hate thee. Does the God of this world (which now lies in
wickedness) hate thee? Do the Gods of this world (given up to a judicial
hardness) hate thee? And do the men of this world (who appear like armed
Furies, and act like incarnate Devils) hate thee? yet Christ loves thee, more
than these can hate thee.

Reflect the Affection of Christ, firmness of it. As it is free, and full, so
it is firm love. The love, will last as long as the loved, or the lover. Peter
denies Christ, but Christ does not deny Peter. Though Peter has been denying,
yet Christ is loving. Mark 16.7.
Go tell the Disciples, and Peter. Peter, is (particularly) and (especially)
named (not in point of superiority) according to the ambition of the proud
Pope, as if he were above the rest; but he is named after all the rest (in
point of inferiority) as if he were below all the rest, forsaking Christ; yea,
denying Christ, with cursing and swearing. Though Peter has been denying, yet
Christ will be looking; Luke 22.61, 62.
will be loving. The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter: -- And Peter went out,
and wept bitterly. As if Peter's tears had fallen first from Christ's eyes.
Shall not (now) this Christ be a Person without compare in a Christians eye,
and the Object of a Christians desire? But suffer a superadding of four things,
in order to a greater endearing of Christ, and crying up him as a Person
without compare, and the Object of a Christians desire.

Christ, mercy, Christ, is the Being of Beings, as God; the Beauty of Beauties,
as Man; the Blessing of Blessings, as God-Man. There had been no mercy, but
misery, without Christ. All the Churches blessings, and benefits, come along
with Christ; he is the mercy of mercies. God, in giving Christ, gives all
things. Romans 8.32.
He that spared not his own Son, etc. how shall he not with him (also) freely
give unto us all things? There had been no Glory, but Wrath, without Christ; no
Mercy, but Misery, without Christ; no Heaven, but Hell, without Christ. Every
mercy enters in at this door. The Law, and the voice from Mount Sinai, came
along with Moses; but the Gospel, and the voice from Mount Sion, came along
with Christ. Joh. 1.17.
The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

Christ, is the Churches merit. Death, Stipend; Life, is a Donative; a (free)
Gift, Martyrology, p. 126 Lord Gray; Duke of Suffolk. Person. p. 99. Bernard:
not a (due) Debt. The mercy of Christ, is the merit of the Christian. One (at
the place of Execution) said, I trust to be saved by the merits of Christ
alone, and by no other Trumpery. A Maryan-Martyr (at the Stake) said, In the
merits of Christ alone, I trust this day to enter into his joy. My merit (says
one) is the mercy of my God; so long as God is not poor in mercy, I cannot be
poor of merit; if he be great in mercy, I (also) am great in merit. Luther
himself confesses, Luth. in Gal. p. 90.
That when he prayed, or said Mass, he used to add this in the end; oh Lord
Jesus! I come unto thee, and I pray thee, that these Burdens, together with the
straitness of my Rule, and Religion, may be a full recompense for all my sins:
But this he (also) says; Before I would admit of the blasphemy of the merit of
Congruence (before) Grace, to (obtain) Grace; and works, in the merit of
worthiness (after) Grace; I would not (only) that the holiness of all the
Papists, and Merit-mongers, but (also) of all the Saints, and Angels, should be
thrown into the bottom of Hell, and condemned with the Devil. Christ, is the
Churches merit, for the Church is Christ's purchase. Feed the Church of God,
Acts 20.28.
which he has purchased with his own blood. Man was sold; sold under sin; a
Slave to Sin; a Slave to Satan; but Christ has bought him, 1 Cor. 6.20.
and paid dear for him. Ye are bought with a price. Here was a valuable price,
for it was invaluable blood; the blood of a (sinless) Jesus.

Christ, Mine. The people of Brazile in America, Clark 's Mirror, Part II. p.
170.
call Gold the God of the Christians. Gold, has devotions paid it as to a
Goddess. In some places of America (if the Historian do not hyperbolize) there
is such abundance of Gold, that in some Mines there is more Gold, than Earth.
p. 77.
So Potter (in his compendious view) says, That in some of the American-Mines,
they can hardly find so much Earth, Basil. Marq. of Vico. Clark's 2d Part.
Ecclesiast. History. p. 104. Joh. 1.14, 16.
as Gold. When one was tempted with Gold, he answered, Give me Gold that will
last for ever. Luther, would not be put off with Gold, without Grace, and
Glory. Galeacius (being proffered a vast Sum of money to return) said, Let his
money perish with him, that accounts all the Gold in the world worth one days
communion with Jesus Christ, and his holy Spirit. There are Mines of Gold, but
Christ is a Mine of Grace* He is full of Grace and Truth. He is an Ore indeed,
that is able to enrich a Beggar; yea, a Bankrupt. Of his fullness have all we
received; Col. 2.3.
and Grace for Grace. All the treasures of Grace are hid in (this) Christ, for
(this) Church.

Christ, Mirror. As he is the Churches Mercy, and Merit, and Mine, so Mirror.
In this Glas^, ye may take a Pisgah-Prospect of the Holy Land. The King, would
not be seen without his (youngest) Son. The Father, will not be seen without
his (eldest) Son. No man has seen God at any time; Joh. 1.18.
the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared
him. The bosom, is the seat of amity, and secresi^; who is so (entirely) loved,
as she that lies in the bosom? Men admit those into their bosoms, to whom they
impart all their secresies. Calvin.
The breast (says One) is the place of counsels. Now, Christ is the Mirror; he
(being in the bosom of the Father) discovers, and declares the Father; unmasks,
and unveils the Father. The (firmamental) Sun, is not seen out of his (own)
light: The Father, and the Son, are so great lights, that they are not seen out
of their (own) light. In thy light, Joh. 14.9.
we shall see light. The Father, is seen in the Son. He, that has seen me,
has seen the Father. Oh my Soul! in (this) Christ thou may see God; see
Glory; see Heaven, and thy name written there. Moses, must stand upon a Mount,
to receive from God the Tables of Stone, and the Law. As Moses must have a
Mount to converse with God, so thou must have a Mirror to see God; to see the
(reconciled) face of God: If ever thou see God to be (thy) God; to be thine
in Covenant; thine in Christ, then Christ must be thy mirror wherein thou
take a prospect of him. If Christ be thus, how (then) should he be endeared,
and cried up, as a Person without compare in a Christians eye, and the Object
of a Christians desire? Now, the desires that will have the ear (of) Christ,
and an answer (from) Christ, they are the desires of the heart; all other
desires, are but as Ships without Sails; Clouds, without Water; Trees, without
Fruit; Bodies, without Souls.

But what manner of desires are cordial desires? Quest.


Cordial desires, are good desires. Sol. 1.
If the desire be from the heart, then good is the object of that desire. I am
writing of a person, that makes Christ the object of his soul-delight; now, the
object of his desire (which is from his heart) must be good. The desire of the
righteous is only good, Prove. 11.23.
but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. It is a Maxim in Philosophy, that
all things desire good. The desires of the righteous (as righteous) are only
good; always good; for, as they desire Christ (above) all, so they desire
Christ (in) all, and (after) all, in whom is all good, and nothing but good.
Cant. 5.8.
I charge you, oh daughters of Jerusalem, if ye see my beloved, that ye tell
him I am sick of love. Oh! if ye see him, be sure to tell him; whatever ye
forget to tell him, do not forget to tell him this, that I am sick of love for
him. Oh tell him that I know not how to live another day without him! another
duty without him! Oh tell him that my head aches! that my Heart aches! that my
very heart strings are ready to break for a Sight (of) him! for a Smile (from)
him! for (inward) and (intimate) Converse and Communion (with) him!

Cordial desires, lawful desires. They must be things lawful that are desired,
or our desires are unlawful. We must not desire as the Mother of Zebedees
children did; Matthew. 20.20, 21, 22.
concerning which Christ said, Ye know not what ye ask. What will thou, says
Christ? She said, Grant, that these my two Sons ( James and John) who
themselves are said to put up this Petition to the Lord, Mark 10.35.
for they said, Do for us whatsoever we shall desire; The Mother (therefore)
and the Sons joined together in this work: But, what follows? Grant that these
my two Sons may sit, the one at thy right hand, and the other at thy left, in
thy Kingdom. She might mean his kingdom on Earth: To sit on the King's right
hand, signifies the next place to the King; and to sit on his left hand,
signifies the third place in the Kingdom; for the greater any one is in a
Kingdom, the nearer does he sit to the King; But Jesus answered, and said, Ye
know not what ye ask. The like Check he gives to James and John: Luke 9.54, 55.
Shall we command fire to come down from Heaven, and consume them, as Elias did?
But Christ rebuked them, saying, Ye know not of what spirits ye are: Ye know
not what Spirit acts you: Ye think ye are acted by such a Spirit as Elias of
old, but ye err: Ye have a zeal, but not according to knowledge: This is not a
(divine) motion, it is at (most) and at (best) but a (humane) Affection. Our
desires are unlawful, if we do not desire things that are lawful. In order
(therefore) to the constituting of Desire, that it may be right, we must desire
things that are lawful.

Cordial desires, working desires. Endeavor, is added unto Desire. There must
be Works as well as Words, and doing as well as desiring. True Endeavor is
ever a Concomitant of true Desire. The man that had been infirm thirty and
eight years, John 5.5, 6, 7, 8.
could not go into the Pool, but he could lay at the Pool; yea, did lay at the
Pool: Though he could not cure himself, yet he could wait (there) to be cured,
and was cured in waiting (there.) He, that is nothing but Desires, shall have
nothing that he desires; but he that adds good Endeavors, unto good Desires,
can ask nothing that is good (if for his good) but he may have it. There must
not (only) be desiring, but (also) doing, or they are not desires from the
heart, and will not be granted. Psalm. 27.4.
Lend an ear unto what the Psalmist speaks: One thing have I desired of the
Lord: One thing (among) many things; one thing (above) many things: One thing
have I desired of the Lord: Here is desiring; but is here all? No; here is
doing as well as desiring; here is seeking, as well as desiring: One thing have
I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after: But, what is it? That I may
dwell in the House of the Lord all the days of my life: It seems that a great
Estimate was set upon Church Communion then, though there be too little
Veneration for this now: Here, he would dwell 'till he died; here he would
dwell, 'till he had upon earth no longer to dwell: But, what was in his Eye?
Were not Loaves? No: was it not a Name amongst Men? No: Two things were in
(his) eye, and should be in (thine) too; in (mine) too; greater sight, and
greater light: Greater sight; to behold the beauty of Jehovah: i. e. to behold
the face of Jehovah; for Beauty sits in the face, and the face is the Seat of
Beauty: And, as greater sight, so greater light; to enquire in his Temple.

Cordial desires, are constant desires. Jehu, Breath. Ye did run well, who did
hinder you, that ye should not obey the truth? Gal. 5.7.
The desires of an Hypocrite, are not desires from the heart, for he looks one
way, and rows another; pretends one thing, and intends another; he has Jacobs
voice, and Esau's hands. You must do by an Hypocrite, as we do by Hebrew, read
it backward: An Hypocrite must be read backward. The Desires of an Hypocrite,
are by Fits and Starts, therefore not cordial desires; but now cordial desires,
are constant desires; they will captivate denial. The Beggar at the gate
knocks, and continues knocking; he takes no denial. Thus, the Woman of Canaan
cried unto Christ, Mat. 25.22, 23.
but Christ answered her not a word. Christ, was a Mute, and yet she cried, For
the Disciples said, send her away, she cries after us; I am not sent but to
the lost sheep of the house of Israel: He seemed (before) to neglect her, but
(here) he seems to deny her: She cries still, Lord, help me: As her Daughter
was her own, so her Daughters case was (as) her own, Lord, help me: She meets
(now) with another repulse; Was not here enough to seal up her lips? As Christ
was a Mute at (first) is not She a Mute at (last?) No, but she answers by an
(ingenious) inversion; Truth, If I be a Dog, I am (thy) Dog: Crumbs, belong to
Dogs; give me (therefore) the portion of a Dog: She had (indeed) this property
of a dog, to hold fast: If I be a Dog, indulge me the place and portion of a
Dog; let me have the Room of a Dog, and the Fare of a Dog: Christ now (if I may
write it with a holy reverence) is (as it were) in a holy captivity to her
cordial, and constant desire: This appears, by what follows: Oh Wonan! great is
thy Faith; be it unto thee even as thou will; And her daughter was made whole
from that very hour.

Cordial desires are holy desires. Heart be at work, then Holiness is in the
Eye. Though perfection be not in a Christians hand, yet it is in a Christians
eye; the beat, bent, and bias of his Soul, is after perfection. That is a
desire from the heart, 2 Cor. 7.1.
which is a desire to be perfecting holiness, 'till the Soul be perfectly holy,
and perfect in heliness. When desires are from the heart, they are desires
after (more) holiness; after (more) grace. The Disciples said unto the Lord,
Luke 17.5.
Increase our faith. Those, who had (most) grace, desired (more) grace. When
the Desire is from the Heart, it is a Desire more for Grace than for Peace; more
for Conformity, than for Communion; more for Holiness, than for Happiness; more
for Purity and Perfection, than for Pleasure, and for Pardon. Phil. 1.23.
May the Apostle speak? I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart
(to die) and to be with Christ, which is far, far better; or, which is best of
all. I cannot think, that this (holy) and (happy) Man, desired (only) to be
perfectly happy, but (also) to be perfectly holy: I cannot think, that he
(only) desired Death for full Communion (with) Christ, but (also) for full
Conformity (unto) Christ: I cannot think, that he (only) desired a death to
come upon the life of his Body, but (also) a death to come upon the Sin of his
Soul.

Cordial desires, are hard desires. Desires (from) the Heart, and the Desires
(of) the Heart, are not weak, and feeble, but hard and strong desires. As the
Cry of a Christ was, so the cry of a Christian is; but the cry of a Christ, was
a strong Cry. Who in the days of his flesh, Heb. 5.7.
when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications, with strong crying and
tears, unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
feared. Thus the Cry of a Christian is; it is a strong Cry, when a Cry from the
Heart. This crying, is called wrestling. And Rachel said, Genesis 30.8.
with great wrestlings (with wrestlings of God, Margent) have I wrestled with
my Sister, and have prevailed. They that go (unto) a Closet Jacobs, are like to
go (from) a Closet Isreal's; that go (thus) praying, are like to go away (thus)
prevailing. Jon. 3.8.
A crying (mightily) was imposed upon Niniveh. A Cry (from) the Heart, is
(such) a Cry. A Desire (from) the Heart, must be a strong desire; such a desire
as Christ had, when he said, Luke 22.15.
With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you, before I suffer.
When the heart is at work, the Man is in earnest, and heart-desires are
earnest-desires.

Cordial desires, are acquiescing desires. limited to the Will of God, so they
acquiesce in the time of God. In order to the regulating of desire, that it may
be right, it must be according to the Will of God. 1 John 5.14.
If we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us. We may ask long
enough; desire long enough; pray long enough, but not receive, if we ask not;
desire not; pray not, according to the Will of God. The Will of God, must be
the Boundary for our desires; and, as (this) desire is according to the Will of
God, so it acquiesceth in the dispensement of the things desired, as to the
manner and time of them. The Soul that is cordial in desire, can say (thorough
Grace) Lord (what) thou please; Lord (when) thou please; Lord (where) thou
please; Lord (how) thou please. This person, looks upon God as the Timer of
mercy, Psalm. 31.15.
as well as the Author of mercy. My times are in thy hand. As (his) times of
deliverance, so (our) times of answer, are in the hands of God. The timing of
mercy, is (equally) to be eyed with the giving of it, and the Soul is to
acquiesce in the one, as well as in the other.

Thus, have I cast in my Mite, concerning the desires (of) the Heart, and
(from) the Heart; but (by way of addition) suffer (of three things) a (concise)
and (distinct) discussion.

Whether the desires of the Heart shall be answered by Christ. Psalm. 10.17.
Psalm. 145.19. Prove. 10.24.
This is evident: Lord, thou have heard the desire of the humble; thou will
prepare their heart; thou will cause thine ear to hear. He will fulfill the
desires of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous
shall be granted.

Why the desires of the Heart shall be answered by Christ. desires shall be
answered,

Because imposed. desire is not answered (for) desire, Ezekiel. 36.37.
yet not (without) desire. Thus says Jehovah God, I will yet for this be
inquired of by the House of Israel, to do it for them.

Because promised. desires, are laid under promise. Psalm. 50.15.
Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou shall
glorify me.

Because encouraged. Encouragement

Unto these desires. If thou will not ask me, then I will ask thee. Did
Ahashuerus say to Esther, 1 Kings 3.5.
What is thy request, and it shall be performed even to the half of the
Kingdom? Thus, God; Ask, etc.

After these desires. 1 Kings 3.13.
As there is encouraging (unto) so (after) asking.

How the desires of the Heart shall be answered by Christ. answers two ways; in
kind, in effect.

In kind. Hannah was answered in kind concerning Samuel, whose name signifies,
Asked of God. 1 Samuel 1.27.
For this child I prayed, and the Lord has given me my petition, which I asked
of him.

In effect. Christ, answer in kind, but when he answers not in kind, he answers
in effect, if the desire be from the Heart, 2 Cor. 12.8, 9.
and (rightly) constituted. Thus Paul was answered, My Grace is sufficient for
thee.

Art actually in Christ? Be joyous then, Cordial X.
for He is the Physician of greatest value. That, Christ, is (a) Physician, is
evident; that, Christ, is (the) Physician, is evident; yea, that Christ is an
universal Physician, and universally heals, is as evident. Who forgiveth all
thine iniquities, Psalm. 103.3.
who heals all thy diseases. Who (without a Christ) can heal any disease? but
who (unless a Christ) can heal all diseases? Here, is healing; yea, healing
diseases; yea, healing all diseases. A disease, is a malady, or a malignant
disposition of body, or soul; and the same (in effect) with sickness. Disease,
may be reduced to two Heads; Corporal, and Spiritual. To these distinctly.

Corporal. Thus, Jehoram, is threatened; 2 Chronicles. 21.15.2.
until thy bowels fall out, by reason of that sickness day by day.

Spiritual. As there is the plague of the Body, so there is the plague of the
Soul, the plague of the Heart. 1 Kings 8.38.
When every one shall know the plague of his own heart. Now, if ye reflect
diseases external, or internal; corporal, or spiritual, Christ, is the
Physician of greatest value, and the Healer of all. Mat. 4.23.
He went about healing all manner of sicknesses, and all manner of diseases,
among the people. No sickness, or disease, came amiss to Christ. Mat. 9.39.
He healed every sickness, and every disease, among the people. If any oppose,
that these diseases, are (only) corporal, it is more than I understand; but,
if it be so, it is asserted to my hand, that he (also) heals all spiritual
diseases. 1 John 1.7.
The blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from sin; yea, from all sin.

But, Quest. Sol. 1.
what manner of Physician is this Christ?

Christ, is, a choice Physician. Christ, is, a great Person. The Gods of the
world, are Gods before men, but men, before God. They, are Gods of men, but not
of consciences; of bodies, but not of souls. Christ, Psalm. 72.10, 11.
is greater than men. The Kings of Tarshish, and of the Isles, shall bring
Presents; the Kings of Sheba, and Seba, shall offer Gifts; yea, all Kings shall
fall down before him; all Nations, shall serve him. Christ, Hebr. 1.5.
is great; greater than Angels. Unto which of the Angels, said he at any time,
Thou art my Son? Christ, is a great Person indeed: He is God manifested in the
flesh. There are many (who call themselves Physicians, but are Mountebanks,
etc. persons, of a poor extract, and skill, but, Christ, is a great Person;
Romans 9.5.
Over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. If God sit down first, Christ (as
Mediator of the Covenant) may sit down next. They say, where Natural Philosophy
ends, there the Physician begins. Christ, is a Person so great, that he begins,
and ends, where he begins to cure a person. Christ, is an Asa; a Physician; or
Healer of diseases, as the word signifies. A mortal King, may engage to cure
the Body; a Tumor in the Flesh; but, Christ (the King of Kings) engages to cure
the Treachery, and Tympany of the Soul. Mamulus. Fuller 's Holy War. p. 477.
One, told the Adorers of Andronicus, (that monstrous Miscreant) That it was
just they should dye of the Physic, who made a God of the Physician. But, now,
it is no wonder, that those ( actually Christ's) should live by the Physic, for
a God is their Physician.

Christ, costly Physician. They were the men of Judah, 2 Samuel 19.42.
that said unto the men of Israel, Have we eaten at all of the King's cost? or,
has he given us any Gift? But, none (actually) Christ's, can say, that they
have not eaten of (his) cost; that they have not had (his) Gift. David, told
Araunah, That he would not offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord his God, Chap.
24.24.
that should cost him nothing. At some cost was Christ, with the man that fell
among Thieves, between Jericho, and Jerusalem; but, at far greater cost than
this, has Christ been: He, is not (only) the Physician of the Soul, but his
blood (also) goes for the Physic of the Soul. Joh. 10.15 Fuller 's holy War,
p. 471.
I lay down my life for the sheep. Tyranous Andronicus, sported himself in
shedding innocent blood, which he (wickedly) called his medicine for all
maladies: But, Christ, as he is a Soul-Physician, so his Blood is Soul-physick;
this, is a Remedy, for every Disease; a Salve, for every Sore; a Medicine, for
every Malady. It is written of One, Admiral of France.
That when the War was finished, and he returned to Rochel, not a day passed
over his head, wherein he did not morning, and evening, read over one of
Calvin's Sermons upon Job; which History he called his (Panchrestum) or Physic
for all Diseases; a Salve, for every Sore. What (then) may be said of Christ's
Blood? Certainly, he, was at great cost, who did not (only) spend his breath,
Heb. 13.12.
but (also) spill his Blood. He suffered without the Gate.

Christ, is, a cheap Physician. Physicians, dear; very dear; the Rich (only)
are qualified to be their Patients; no Purse, no Physic; they, will have much,
though they do little; but, Christ, is a cheap Physician: Wine, and Milk,
without money, and without price. I will give to him that is at hirst, of the
fountain of the water of life freely. Rev. 21.6.
Now this (says one) is

The Grace of the holy Spirit, drops,) but (in Heaven) unto fullness; Guttatim.
Joh. 4.14.
according to that, The water that I will give him, shall be in him a Well of
water, springing up into everlasting life. Or,

A Fruition of God, who is the life of his; With thee, is the fountain of life.
Here, Psalm. 36.9
is water, and that is necessary; yea, water of life, and that is of necessity;
yea, Pool, in loc.
the fountain of the water of life; now, water (at the fountain) is purest, and
plentifullest; there, water for quality, and quantity, is ever the same: yea,
this water, is in a way of Gift; I will give to him that is athirst, (...)
of the fountain of the water of life; and that freely: without compensation;
without merit. Physicians, here below, indent with their Patients; so much
down, and so much when the Cure is made; but, Christ (the Physician of greatest
value) does not indent with his Patients. Rev. 22.17.
Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Whosoever, has a will
(from) Christ (for) Christ, let him take Christ; and the Grace of Christ; and
the Spirit of Christ; and that freely; without price; or any merit of his own.

Christ, appointed Physician. Some, go, yea, run, Joh. 12.45.
without sending, but Christ did not. He, that sees me, sees him that sent
me. As God appointed the Passover, so he appointed this Physician. I will give
thee for a light to the Gentiles, Isa. 49.6.
that thou may be my salvation to the ends of the earth. Christ, is under a
designation (and that from the Father) in order to the sanctification, and
salvation of a sinner. The God of our Fathers, Acts 5.30, 31.
raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, and hanged on a Tree; Him has God exalted with
his right hand: But, to what end? To be a Prince, and a Savior; to give
repentance unto Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

Christ, approved Physician. There are some men (approved of men) but (the Man
Christ Jesus) is approved of God. Acts 2.22
Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Mat. 14.30, 31.
Jesus, of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, etc. Christ, has been
tried; tried to purpose. Thus, Christ, has been tried Relatively: He, was
tried in the water, and kept Peter's head above water. He, was tried in the
Fire, and kept the three children there: Dan. 3.24, 25.
Did we not cast three into the Fire? True, Oh King! Behold, I see four, and
the form of the fourth, is like the Son of God. Christ, and the Christian, in
the Ship together; in the Shop together: Christ, and the Christian, in the
Field together; in the Fire together; Is not this sweet? Oh this is sweetly
sweet! But, as Christ was tried Relatively, so, he was tried Personally. Some
men, have been greatly tried: Thus, Job was; thus, Paul was; but, who so tried
as a Christ, in his life? Being in an agony (the word signifies, a striving, or
wrestling against something, as two Combatants, or Wrestlers, Luke 22.44.
do each strive against other) he prayed more earnestly; and his swea^ was as
it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground. And, who so tried as
a Christ in his death? My God, my God, Mat. 27.46. Athanasius. Non solvit
Vnionem, sed subtraxit Visionem. Isa. 28.16.
why have thou forsaken me? He, spoke this (says One) in our person. They are
not words of complaining, but expressing his Grief. The Union, was not
dissolved, but the Vision was restrained. God, left him in great distress;
withdrawing from the humane nature; pouring his wrath upon Him, as the Surety
of His. Thus, Christ, has been tried (in) life, and (to) the life; thus,
Christ, has been tried (in) death, and (to) the death: No wonder, now, He is
called a tried stone.

Christ, is, a loving, yea, ever-loving Physician. Physicians (here) below, do
not love their Patients, as they love themselves; they had rather a thousand
Patients should dye, than themselves should dye: But, Christ, is such a
Physician, that he loves his Patients, as he loves himself; yea, he seems to
love them above himself; for he loves them, and lays down his life for them.
Who loved us, Ezekiel. 18.31, 32.
and washed us from our sins, in his own blood. Why will ye dye, O house of
Israel? For, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says Jehovah
God. Why will ye dye? will ye not (only) kill your selves, but (also) me? Let
me dye, that ye may live; let me have a Cross, that ye may have a Crown; let me
be betrayed, that ye may be blessed; let me be buffeted, that ye may be
beautified; let me be crucified, that ye may be crowned; let me be sacrificed,
that ye may be sanctified and saved. Thus, Joh. 13.1.
a Christ loves, and (who but a Christ) thus loves? His, are loved (rather)
than Himself; if not (above) Himself. And, having (once) loved, he (ever)
loves.

Christ, is, a living, yea, ever-living Physician. Physicians (below) may dye;
must dye; yea, Romans 6.10.
often dye, before the Cure is made; but, Christ, having once dyed, dies no
more, but lives for evermore. The Physician of the Body, is mortal as well as
the Patient, and may dye before the Patient; but, Christ, the Physician of the
Soul, having (once) dyed (no more) dies; death, Joh. 5.26.
has no more domiaion over him. As the Father has life in himself, so has he
given to the Son, to have life in himself.

Christ, valuable Physician. Job (speaking of his Visicors) calls them, Job
13.4.
Physicians of no value; but, Christ, is of value; of great value; of greatest
value. Col. 2.9.
In him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead personally. Christ, is rarely
skilled; infinitely qualified; he knows every Cause, to him (therefore) is
easy every Cure. Nullus effectus, dature sine causa, effectus sequitur
virtutem causae. Causa est prior essecto. Faelix qui ^otuit rerum cognoscere
causas. 1 Kings 4.32, 33. Prove. 8.14.
Effects, cannot be produced without Causes. It is a Maxim, That where
sufficient Causes are in Act, there (of necessity) the Effect must follow. The
Effect, cannot be existent before its Cause: Effects, must depend upon their
Cause, as their Base, and Principle. It is an approved Aphorism, That the Cause
precedes the Effect, in order of Nature; and Time; and Both: every thing
resolves into its principle. It is usually said, They are happy, who know the
causes of things: And (in respect of corporal diseases) they say, That a
disease is half cured, when the cause of it is discovered. Christ, knows the
cause, and therefore can make a cure. Solomon, was a great Philosopher; his
Parables prove his divine wisdom: He, was prodigiously parted; greatly read in
Trees, and Pants; in Beasts, and Birds; in creeping things, and Fishes; which
manifest his humane wisdom. But, a greater than Solomon is here under
discussion; One, that is not (only) understanding in all things, but (also)
understanding it self. I am understanding.

Christ, sudden Physician. Some Physicians of the Body, are long in curing. As
some persons are long diseased; palsical Eneas, kept his Bed eight years: The
woman (whom Christ called a daughter of Abraham) had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years: There lay (also) at the Pool of Bethesda, a man, which had an
infirmity thirty and eight years: Now, as some persons, have been long
diseased, so, some Physicians, are long in curing such diseases: They, are long
in curing, if there be money coming: Their Cures, are like Chancery-Suits,
depending several years; Isai. 107.20.
but, Christ, is quick at curing. He sent his word, and healed them. It is
enough to the Centurion, if he can but get a word from Christ: Speak the word
only, Matthew. 8.8, 13.
and my Servant shall be healed. And Jesus said unto the Centurion, Go thy way,
and as thou have believed, so be it done unto thee: And his Servant was healed
in the self-same hour.

Christ, is, a seasonable Physician. season of a mercy, does greatly accent the
mercy. For a person to be sinking in the Thames, and for another to rescue him
from those (merciless) waves, is not this in season? Mark 5.23, 24, etc.
For the daughter of Jairus (who was at the point of death) and the woman (with
her issue of blood) of twelve years time, to be both healed, was not this in
season? For a person to be arrived near the Gates of Hell, by his Sin, and for
Christ to give him check by his Grace, is not this in season? Zech. 3.1.2.
For Joshua to stand before the Angel of the Lord; for Satan (also) to stand at
his right hand to resist him (to be his Adversary, margent) and for God to
rescue Joshua (being a Brand plucked out of the Fire) is not this in season?

Christ, is, a suitable Physician. Cures (they say) are by Sympathy, or by
Antipathy: Both these ways, Christ cures.

Christ, cures, by Sympathy. An Eye, for an Eye, and a Tooth, Isa. 63.9. 1
Cor. 15.21.
for a Tooth; Blood, for Blood. By man came death, by man (also) came the
resurrection of the dead. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

Christ, cures, by Antipathy. There is Good, Evil; Light, for Darkness; Life,
for Death; Heaven, for Hell. God, has not appointed us unto wrath, 1 Thessalonians.
5.9. Non cur atur pars, nisi curetur totum. 2 Pet. 3.18.
but to obtain salvation, by our Lord Jesus Christ. Physicians, say, If ye
would cure any unsound. part, ye must cleanse the whole Body. Christ, cures by
Sympathy, and by Antipathy; he must needs universally cure, that every way
cures. Christ, has once suffered, the just, for the unjust. A Physician,
asking a Lacedemonian, How he did; answered, The better that (...) meddle not
with Thee, nor take of (thy) Physic. Certainly, no Soul (unto whom Christ has
been a Physician) will say so of (his) Physic.

Christ, is, an incomparable Physician. Christ, incomparably qualified, and
under an incomparable qualification. It is said of a good Chyrurgion, or
Physician, that he must have an Eagles Eye; a Lions Heart; and a Ladies Hand.
Christ (with the greatest Reverence be it written) has all these.

A good Physician, must have an Eagles Eye. He, that is good at healing, had
need be good at seeing that he may discover where the fault, and the failing
is. Thus, Christ, is incomparably qualified; He, is excellent at seeing;
excelling, in seeing; so good at seeing, Joh. 9.6, 7
that he gave sight unto one that was born blind.

A good Physician, Lions heart. He, that is a Physician, must be strong, and
stout-hearted; for, if the Physician fail, how will the Patient bear up his
courage? A Physician, must deal freely, and plainly, with the Patient, telling
him the disease, and the danger, if he take not (this) or (that) he is a dead
man, etc. Thus, Christ, deals freely, and plainly, with the souls of men, and
women; telling them, If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins:
except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. If ye come not to me, and close
not with me (upon Gospel-terms) ye will live in your wounds, and lie in your
wounds, and die in your wounds, and be damned for your wounds. How freely did
Christ deal with the woman? John 4.16, 17, 18.
He said unto her, Go, call thy Husband, and come hither. The woman answered,
and said, I have no Husband. Jesus answered, and said unto her, Thou have well
said, I have no Husband; for thou have had five Husbands, and he whom thou now
have, is not thy Husband: in that did thou say truly.

A good Physician, Ladies hand. A Physician, must use the Patient gently, and
carry it toward the Patient tenderly. Herein, Christ (also) is (incomparably)
qualified. How tenderly did Christ carry it toward the Adulteress? Woman, not
Adulteress; John 8.10, 11.
Woman, not Harlot; Woman, not Whore: Woman, Where are those thine Accusers?
Has no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her,
Neither do I condemn thee: Go, and sin no more.

Art actually in Christ? Cordial XI. M. Knox. In Adamo primo, potuimus non
mori; in Adamo secundo, non possimus mori.
Be joyous (at last) for the death of Him, is the death of death unto His.
Blessed (says one) is their death, who have part in the death of Jesus. In
Adam the (first) there was a possibility of living; in Adam the (second) there
is an impossibility of dying. I have read of One, who pretended, that he had a
Salve for every Sore; a Medicine for every Malady; and could cure all diseases,
but death: Death (the Mistress of Mortals) was such a disease, that he could
not cure. Death (the Emperess of the Universe) was such a disease, that he
could not cure. But, now, the death of Christ, will make a cure of death; it
will make a cure of a twofold death; of the first, and the second death.

The death of Christ, disarms the (first) death. 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.
where is thy victory? The sting of Death, is Sin; and the strength of Sin, is
the Law; but thanks be to God, that gives us the victory thorough our Lord
Jesus Christ. The death of Christ, is the death of this death, unto a person
actually in Christ; it is to Him, a stingless death; it is to Him, not a Foe,
but a Friend; this person, may look this death in the face, and laugh, Oh
Death! where is thy sting? As if an honest man (being set upon by an Highway
man) should disarm him, and then say, Where is thy Sword now? Where is thy
Pistol now?

The death of Christ, prevents the (second) death. first, to the second death?
The second death, is eternal death. Rev. 2.11.
Who can dwell with devouring fire? who can dwell with everlasting burnings?
Now, those actually (in) Christ, and overcoming (thorough Christ) shall not be
hurt of the second death. He (or She) that overcomes, shall not, not (so the
Greek) be hurt of the second death. But, Soul, art actually in Christ? that thy
Soul (then) may be filled with joy, and peace, (like the water-pots of Galilee,
up to the very brim) thorough believing, be in a reflection of these two
concluding words.

Art actually in Christ? He will be thy Guide (unto) death. For (this) God, is
(our) God; but how long? until Sin rise, or Satan rage; until there be a
sliding foot, or a backsliding heart; until I be a Captive to Temptation
without, or Corruption within; and (I fear) no longer: mark the words; For
(this) God, is (our) God, for ever, Psalm 48.14.
and ever; he will be our Guide, even unto death.

Art actually in Christ? He will be thy Guide (thorough) death. Luke 23.43.
To day shall thou be with me in Paradise. Was Socrates glad when his death
approached? because (as he thought) he should go to Homer, Hesiod, and other
learned men, whom (he thought) he should meet with in the other world: How much
more, should they (who live, and dye, in a Christ) be filled with joy, and
peace, that they shall go unto God, and Christ? that they shall go unto Angels,
and Apostles? Drink (now) of the Brook by the way, and lift up thy head, for,
the death of Christ, is the death of death.

The Vale of the Author, to the Reader.
AS with Hortensius, it is not with Me;
Unapt to write, but apt to speak was He:
Nor do I with ALBERICUS compare,
Unapt to speak, but apt to write his share:
For words, or works, their Genius rarely lay,
But (haltingly) do I go (either) way.
Death, subject is; a Cup full to the Brim;
An Ocean, where Elephants may swim.
In POETRY I Am learning but to spell;
Are Deeps exhausted with a Muscle-shell?
One was a Mute, wise Cato being there;
Give fancy Vent, Du-Bartas was not here.
This Poem (now) takes air, our mortal Fate,
As to CONDOLE, so to Congratulate.
Do live to dye? this shows a (doleful) state:
Do dye to live? this (Dolor) antiquate.
Is Truth the White? let that Man never speed,
Who (from the Issue) censures of the Deed.
Man may attempt all Men to please as soon,
As He that made a Vestment for the Moon,
To suit (each) interchange: ah (juggling) Ape!
Days (scarcely) two She keeps in a Shape.
Prose ( Poems too) meet with a (critic) wound;
Some (Faults will find) besides Faults to be found:
Wing Momus (then) this Book is not for Thee;
And Zoilus take thy Flight as far as He.
Art Notional? 'twas no Prophetic Brain,
Art Critical? it is no Poetic Strain;
But art Celestial? (here lies the STRESS)
Most (lovely) Truth shows in her (native) Dress.
Now, Reader, take; taste; eat; but (also) wish;
It Is (Lordly) Fare, though in an (earthen) Dish.
II. The Description.
PAle Death the Subject is; but what is Death?
From (lifened) dust, but a (departed) Breath
But is not Death (so worthy Meditation)
An Essence? No, nor Substance, but Privation.
There Beings are, but Death no Being have;
No Creature it is; for Creatures it is a Grave.
Death's but a Fall, which (by a Fall) invaded
This Microcosm; whereby he was degraded.
Some Persens are for Debts in PRISON laid;
This Debt pays Man, though Man be left unpaid.
Man, mortal is; this Microcosmus must
Strike Sail to Death, and graved be in dust.
Life's but a breathing Death; a Tale that is told;
He does but live, that lives to be old.
A Vapor is man's Life; a Taper burning;
It Is like the wind that passes not returning.
Ah! what is Life? a Flood; and Ebb; and Man,
Sails (then) into a (timeless) OCEAN.
Ah puzling Theme! was Austin at a loss
What Life to call? let not my Gold be Dross.
Man's Nostril is a passage for his Breath;
It Is then a (dying) Life, or (living) Death.
Life's but a (dying) Death; our Bodies are
But (living) Graves; the longest Liver share
But in a span of days; Death (homeward) sends;
A CIRCLE it is, beginning where it ends.
Ah daring Death! the Tribute due to Nature;
The Law of Mortals, not reflecting Stature:
And of the Universe the Emperess;
That visit Mortals in a various dress.
III. The Assertion.
THE Hebrew Proverb travels very far,
In Golgotha Skulls of all Sizes are.
Death's not a (bie) but (beaten) path for All;
Here Croesus, Codrus, stumble may, and fall.
One shoots the Gulf, yet grounds upon a Shelf;
A Manuscript deceives DEATH it self.
No distance does this Law of Nature know,
But Mortals reap according as they sow.
Death (to the Grave) is path for (any Foot;
This (common) Gulf, the mean and mighty shoot.
They blessed are much more (let this take Air)
In Peter's Chain, than He in Peter's Chair:
Ah Miscreant to refuge in a Lie!
Ah Monster-Man! I see (as I pass by)
Thy Triple-Crown begins to stand awry;
Down ( Dagon-like) let this fall from on high;
Break Crown, Head, Neck, this is the (common) Cry;
Thus wished it is, that thou may (ever) dye.
Popes (dyed) have, without a (doleful) Song,
Unless it were because they (lived) long.
Where Is Adam? Abram? Isa'c? Jacob? Where?
Inventi non sunt; they SEPULCRED were.
What Proto-Adam? Yea, He was a Man;
Red-earth I find, when that his name I scan.
This Proto-Man finds Death on Nature enter;
Thus earth to earth returns, as to its Center.
What Abraham? it is strange; it is true, he dies,
And in the CAVE of Mackpelah he lies.
What Isa'c too, a TYPE so eminent?
Types, Shadows are; Death pitched has his Tent
With Abraham: Ah when his Days were spen^!
He (like a Son) unto his FATHER went.
WHat Jacob too? Esau supplanted He;
One named right, for Name and Act agree:
Ah but Supplanters may supylanted be!
Him (daring) Death transplanted have I see.
Mortality (whatever Men suggest)
Antiquity has for her (native) Crest:
Did not Death reign from ADAM unto MOSES?
Where Is Matthew? Mark? Paul? Peter? James? and Joses?
Our Fathers where are They? the greatest Sage
Is slily passing; going off the STAGE.
Well styled (then) is Death, most aged King,
Who led the Van, and up the Rear does bring.
Ah read Death's Motto in a Ladies Line!
My lot's to Day; to morrow may be thine:
And wond^r not at that true Celled-sense,
Amongst these Skulls I find no difference.
But where is Methuselah of all most gray?
Scan but his name, the word the man bewray:
Years lived he Nine hundred sixty nine,
But dyed then; no longer was his Line.
Though many (now) on Beds of IVORY
Do stretch themselves; yet these must also lie
In Beds of Earth; this Tribute pay they must,
And for their Heads a Pillow have of Dust.
The great Mogul erects his Nest on high;
But lives he, that shall not (also) dye?
All dyed have, that lived have; or have
Translated been, and so deceived the Grave:
Thus dye shall All that live, or changed be;
From ADAM all derive their Pedigree.
Now, Reasons take (from one so low in Stature)
Why Death should be a Tribute due to Nature.
IV. The Reasons.
1. The Decree of God.
DEath, seizes All, for this is God's Decree;
She seizes, but will not surrender Thee.
Death (Heavens Statute is) in Scripture-sense,
Each man's line meets in this Circumference.
Earth, Heaven, Hell, their Laws are different,
(If writing thus be not impertinent:)
Earths Law municipal, is (once) to dye;
But Heavens is to live eternally:
Hell (also) has a LAW, to dye for ever;
Take prospect (here) of three; Once; always; never.
2. The Matter of the Body.
ADd (nextly) now the Matter of the Man;
This Fabric (then) Eternize if ye can.
Ah mortal Man! made up of Elements;
Earth, Air, Fire, Water, are Ingredients:
For Man to dye, to me appears just,
Who (at the first) was reared out of dust.
The Breath of God, the Soul I find to be;
The Work of God, the Body seems to me.
The Building's Clay, the Basis (also) Dust;
The Creature to the Center (dying) must.
3. The Merit of Sin.
ALl sinned have, and therefore All must dye;
This must be true, or Truth must be a Lie.
The Soul dies not, it is an (immortal) Spirit:
The Body dies, it is Sins (undoubted) Merit.
Sins venial, and mortal, Papists make;
But this distinction is a gross mistake.
As Adam's bounds were set, and Soul endued;
So breaking these, a (double) Death ensued.
It Is better thus (infernal) Sophistry
To naus'ate, than a (double) Death to dye.
V. The Uses.
THree Uses (now) of daring Death be making;
High Prudence it is right Measures to be taking.
I. Of Trial.
TRy, mortal Man; come to the Test, and try;
Stage Persons; also Things; yet Man must dye.
Can any PERSON? Or, can any THING
(That Persons deck) match Death? this (timely) bring.
I. Of Beauty.
CAN Beauty (that is a Snare) from Death's Arrest
Bail MORTALS? No; as Ages do attest.
Can Beauty (so admired by the Tall?)
No, mortal Man, for Nature caught a Fall,
When she was young (as did a petty Prince)
Which caused has her halting ever since.
She Is courted; painted; spotted; yet I see,
It Is (native) Beauty without sports to be.
Some try to mend, but while they mend, they mar;
For Beauty-spects, the SPOTS of Beauty are.
Fade Beauty will like Flowers of the Field;
Not shot-free girded with an Ajax's Shield.
She fades; faints; falls; and ( running of her Race)
Has for her Soutch'on but a (wrinkled) Face.
Where Is Sarah that the Court of Pharaoh charm?
This (daring) Death, this Beauty does alor'm.
Where Is Absalom, the Beauty of his Age?
He acts his part, and gooth off the Stage.
From Head to Foot, no Blemish could be found;
But Beauty dies; Death marching is her Round.
This Tribute due to Nature paid He;
The Halter was his Hair upon a Tree.
Here ( Isr'el's Mirror) had his mortal Stroke;
Will others (now) call this the Royal Oak?
II. Of Men, and Means.
CAn Men, or Means? each Creature in its Station,
From Natures instinct plot its Conservation.
What Drug by Galen could prescribed be?
Or could Hippocrates by DOSES free
His Pat'ents? No; they differ as to Stature,
Yet payment make of Tribute due to Nature.
For Spirits Chemists are; Phlebotomy
A Monster seems in that extracting eye:
They breathe no Veins; rare Spirits they apply;
But salved is not DEATH by Chemistry,
Two ways there are Diseases for to cure;
But neither can face-paling Death allure:
Is Sympathy the way? the Arrow's wide,
For Digby that admired Artist died.
Or is A NTIP ATHY? ah but undarted
Is still the White! beloved Luke's departed.
Speak Borgius (that I may hear the sound)
Who Remedies for all Diseases found,
But Death; He dies, and dying did assure
No Drug, or Dose, of Death could make a Cure.
Let Nature (now) most fortify that can,
Health's highest sphere a Crisis proves to Man,
One way to come (into) the World had all;
But to go (out) a thousand; and to fall.
A Nail kills Sisera; but, by a Stone
Goliath falls; for he would stand alone:
This Giant (now) meets with a mortal Blow;
Right goes an Arrow out of Heavens Bow;
One wound Goliath kills, but twenty three
Great Caesar had, and then departed he.
Strong Samson enters now, of whom it is said,
He Rubbish made, and under Rubbish laid.
Thus Men, and Means, disputing Con and Pro,
Do act their Parts, and off the Stage do go.
III. Of Honor and Policy.
CAN Honor? No; the tallest Pines are shaken
By smallest winds; and may not this awaken?
Sure footing (Soul) has not Magnificence;
This may be in the Preterperfect Tense:
This (Bucket-like) now up, now down, is She;
But (down) the mot'on swiftest seems to me.
Could I prefer, such have Preferment should,
Not that would Places, but that Places would.
All worldly Grandeur in the Dust is laid;
As Caesar took, so Caesar Tribute paid.
Thus ROMAN Honor passes as a Blast,
Though Pompey slew, slain Pompey was at last.
High Haman staged is (making uproar;)
Next to the King does now this Abject soar:
As to Design, in Jewish blood he wallows;
As to Desert, ascends He the Gallows.
CAN Policy? No; MAZIRINI may
Strike Sail to Death, and go this (common) way.
Ah where is Pythagoras, with prudent Cato?
Where Is Seneca, with Socrates and Plato?
Where Is Cicero, with Athen's Legislators?
And where is Apollo, with the Commentators?
But where is that (admired) Aristotle?
(Yet Euripus would not into his Bottle:)
So (often) ebb, and flow this Deep, that He
(Unsatisfied) would the Bottom see.
But where is Achitophel? accursed may
Such Policy be to the (latter) Day:
An ORACLE was He within his Age;
But hangs himself, and falls off the Stage.
Where Is Solomon, more wise than any other?
That could detect the true from feigned Mother:
Ah (turbid) Death! He was a (mortal) Sage;
And being mortal goes off the STAGE.
IV. Of Wealth.
CAN Riches? No; or Truth is made a Lie;
But Wealth's a gilded, lying VANITY.
The World (says One) to Man is God's Epistle;
But (often) proves to Man a vexing Thistle.
The World's a Labyrinth; my Soul beware;
And ( Michal-like) is given as a Snare.
Ah bitter-sweet, and that but for an hour!
Sweet is the Promise, but the Payment sour.
The World's a Cheat; the things thereof decay;
And (Laban-like) for Rachel Leah pay.
A Sirens Song, and unto Whoredom pander,
Which causes many (Dinah-like) to wander.
Ah England mourn, and grow into a Passion!
The Spanish Mode, is now an English Fashion.
Most vainly Mortals worldly things aspire;
These are not Food, but Fuel to Desire.
Shall Hearts be set on that, where (only) Feet
Should standing be? hence bearing but a Sheet.
Job staged is, and not for Wealth the least,
But greater than the greatest of the East;
His Substance winged is (the Blow was such;)
But Jah Jehovah gives him twice as much.
No Object for the Eye is Wealth, and can
This Object be unto the Heart of Man?
But worldly Men make for themselves a Rod,
Below a Soul, is all below a GOD.
Where Is Crassus? Croesus? Crates? Aristippus?
Or Cyrus? Xerzes? Dives and Philippus?
Left by the World are they, where (living) find them;
And (dying) they do leave the World behind them.
Where Is He that had so vast a Territory?
Who Ruler was (according to the Story)
Of Provinces an Hundred twenty seven;
The Man is dead, and gone to Hell, or Heaven.
V. Of Fortitude.
CAn Fortitude? This Mortals rarely deck;
A (rare) but (rich) Gem it is about the neck
Of Potentates; refute it if ye can,
Son unto Caesar Valor makes a Man.
Great Alexander would immortal be
Unwounded; wounded mortal proved he.
Where Is (little) David? yet has (little) Fear;
Who killed both the Lion and the Bear:
Philistine-foreskins hanged up may be,
As (signal) Trophies for a Saul to see:
Yea, Gath-Goliah, dreadful in his motion,
Had (native) Blood prescribed for a Potion:
Ah but he dies (as Scripture has averred!)
And in the (Royal) City was interred.
Stout Hannibal ( Rome's Terror) where is He?
Or those stout Scipio's, that would not flee?
Where Is Saladine, that (Oriental) Victor?
Or where should I dig for (puissant) Hector?
Huniades does next ascend the STAGE,
Who (all his Race) did war with Turcists wage;
In Battles many (stoutly) he engage,
And (thorough Valor) Turkey did enrage:
To this (vast) Empire dreadful was his name,
Their (crying) Babes were stilled with the same;
Jobs (iron) Pen take to engrave his Fame,
(My Narrative defective is, and lame;)
That to Posterity transmitted may
His Valor and his Conquest be I say.
Where Is Scanderbeg? who was so valorous;
And with his Valor so victoricus:
In more than twenty Battles he engage
Proud Saracens; whose right Arm did presage
His Valor and his Conquest in his Age:
This (matchless) Valor goes off the Stage.
VI. Of Learning.
CAn Learning? This to Tully does allye;
Knots-Gordian this (thorough Art) untye;
Which one no way but (by his Sword) epsy:
But did not Tully, and his Nephew dye?
Keep Learning in her (native) Orb, and thus
Shall due Respect be for Philologus.
Where Is Homer? Horace? Zeno and Prochorus?
Or Xenophon? Tertullus? Theodorus?
Where Is Plato? Plautus? Plutarch? Theophrastus?
Or Memucan? Alvarez and Erastus?
Where Is Austin with his Tract of Recantation?
Or Ambrose, modest in his Meditation?
Though Ignorance to Learning gives check,
Yet (surely) this the Sons of Adam deck.
Thus Learning in a Lord (as was of old)
Assimilates a DIAMOND in Gold.
Where Is Origin so full of Allegories?
Or Moderators in the Consistories?
Where Is Jewel, who the Truth defended well?
Or Bolton, on Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell?
Where Is Chrysippus? his Study might have bled him,
(For ought I see) had not Melissa fed him.
Where Is Hilary for Style so greatly eyed?
Or Gregory, that was so mortified?
Where Is Basil? Beda too? so preaching then
(If one speaks Truth) the stones did cry Amen.
Where are those prying Ones of Issachar?
And where is Erasmus learnings morning Star?
Where Is CYPRIAN so worthy Martyrdom?
With very many more? but here is no room.
Where Is Moses, mighty, both in Words and Deeds?
Death (unto Death) the man in Moab bleeds.
Where Is Cranmer? Ridley? Lambert? and the rest?
Ah dead are these, and dying are the best!
II. Of Terror.
ART out of Christ? On Ebal stand I must,
And Lectures (now) not (only) read of Dust,
But (also) Wrath, that is blown into a flame:
Almighty Breath is kindler of the same.
To Souls in Christ, Death is most amiable;
Most terrible of all things formidable
To Christless Ones; yea (this) appears to me
Of HELL the very Suburbs for to be.
Ah mortal Man! If I may speak my Sense,
Infernal Dregs are in the (future) Tense.
It Is pity that an ENOSH is deterred
From (dying) Thoughts, for Bildad has averred
That Death the King of Terrors is to thee,
If Christless dying; and thus unto me.
Lend but an Ear to what the Romists say,
Rome (unto Heaven) is the (only) way:
Ah but (my Soul) go not so far about!
A Papal-Toe may (sometimes) have the Gout:
Rome's Monster goes wrong, and will not suffer
A going right; this Candle wants a Snuffer;
Yea, an Extinguisher, that lighted may
A better be, and light a (better) way.
Ah needs must Hell a dismal Dung'on be!
Where Heavens Sun shall never shine to thee.
Sin, has no Mean, but not at all to be;
Sin, is the Means for to endanger thee.
Prepare for Death; let this appear to thee.
Certain; uncertain is the Time to me.
Death (if no Children) did a Rachel cry;
Ah crying be a Christ, or else I dye!
Does Death arrest, and find thee without Grace?
With Judas (then go to thy proper place.
If (true Grace (here) shall not implanted be,
Then Woe, Woe, Woe (hereafter) unto thee.
III. Of Triumph.
A Scend (my Soul) on Mount Gerizim stand;
A taking Prospect is the Holy LAND.
(...) joyous Saint, no Corrosive to thee,
^f (stingless) Death can a Memento be.
^ot fuller is of light the Worlds bright eye;
^or yet the Sea with water (never dry)
^i en that man's Heart with joy who (truly) see
^he Death of Christ, the Death of Death to be.
^ad Heaven Sin (thus Anselm speaks about it)
^uch rather would He be in Hell without it.
(...) drop of Sin, does unto Mortals bring
^ore evil than a Sea of Suffering.
^here may be Sorrow without Sin, but can
^n (without Sorrow) be unto the man?
^eath's an Eclipse; to man this happen may
(...) in a (clear) so on a (cloudy) day.
^one (until Dearth) were blessed in Solon's eye;
^hey blessed are, that in a JESUS dye.
(...) (moment) Man! be winged like a Dove;
and restless too, till Arked with thy Love:
^lace thy self with Loves; If Christ be thine,
^ALL into Honey, WATER into Wine,
^nverted are: Now Marah tastes sweet;
and (lovely) will appear a (winding) sheet.
^ake Death familiar; this welcome thus;
^ome Life, come Death, with good Ignatius.
^he presence of all Good, is Heaven; and
^he absence of all Evil: Here Is a Land!
(...) then (my Soul) suck sweetly here, and crave it!
(...) Heaven it is to hope it; what to have it?
^hus, Time's a Space, lent from Eternity;
Globe, that rolls with (sly) Celerity:
(...) it is true, Alpha it is that lends it;
(...) is as true, Omega it is that ends it.
VI. The Epilogue.
FAith (thorough Grace) make (now) of Sacred Truth;
Must NESTOR dye? so may the Shumem-Youth.
It Is true, Life is the Triumph of each Stature;
It Is true, Death is the Tribute due to Nature.
All Ages; Statures; Sexes; Sifes must,
This payment make, and bedded be in dust.
And he dyed, this Epitaph must have
Each individual, upon his Grave.
Death (ingress) had by Sin; this (sadly) wounds;
Sin (egress) has by Death; this (gladly) sounds.
Reader; the (Bodies-death) does perfectly
From (Deaths-body) the Saint indempnifie.
Death, a Dilemma is; non-plust are All,
Who enter Lists, and so resign the Wall.
The Fear of Death, the Soul with Terror fill;
Death kills (once) but Fear does (often) kill.
A Creature (with the Ephemera) may
Be (as to Life) a Creature of a Day.
Tears unto One the God of Nature gives;
Another not a Day in Nature lives:
View Nature (now) and in this (Glass) descry;
Art a Day old? then old enough to dye.
The best of Men, they are but Men at best;
The worst of Men, dye sooner than the rest.
In hearing, hear; in saying (also) say:
In trying, try; in praying (also) pray:
In doing, do; in giving (also) give:
In living, dye; in dying (also) live.
Are grace-ful Veins found running thorough Thee?
All Glory (then) be given unto THREE.
FINIS.
