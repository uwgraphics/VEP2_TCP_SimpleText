Oh! how I sigh, when I think on the man, etc. Or, the Amorous Virgin;
Who never till this time, did fancy a man,
But now she must love; let her do what she can.
To a dainty new Tune, much sung in the Duke of York's Playhouse.




To little or no purpose,
I spent many a day,
In Manging the Parks
The Exchange, and the Play;
For never in my Rambles
till now, did I prove
So lucky to meet with
the Man I could love,
But Oh! how I sigh,
when I think on the Man,
I find I must love,
let me do what I can.
How long I shall love him,
I can no more tell,
Then had I a fever
when I should be well;
My Passion shall kill me
before I will slow it,
And yet I would give
all the World he did know it:
But Oh! how I sigh,
when I think, should he woo me,
I cannot deny what
I know would undo me,
I always did wonder,
how Maids could lov^ Men,
How Ladies fell sick,
when Men loved not again;
I could not tell where
the blind Boy then did lurk,
Or how the enticing
Temptations did work:
But now I cry out,
I dye for the Man;
Let wisdom, and Reason
do all that they can.


He is the most handsom'st
that ever I saw,
for Love has no Reason,
and Fancy no Law:
Were all Men's perfections
contracted in one
Accomplished Gallant,
it is himself alone:
For Cupid I see
is a very Trapan;
And I m^st have Charles,
let me do what I can.
When first I espied him,
he daz'd my eyes,
And fla^^es, like Lightning
did th^row me fly;
I blushst, sighed, and patend,
my Pu^ses did move,
I am of ^pinion
there is Witchcraft in Love:
But let Love and Reason
do all what they can;
The Grav^ will have me,
If I have not the Man.
I am so ^uch perplexed,
sometimes I could find
In my h^^rt to go to him
and t^l^ him my mind:
Why, if I did so,
what could he say then:
Such boldness would make him
not love me again?
A Woman is straightened
much more than a Man;
But yet I must love him
do what I can.
This amorous Virgin
was lying alone,
Hid in a close Arbor,
and sighing this Song,
And lay in a Posture
Attired in a Dr^ss,
Would tempt a Per^i^n
unto wickedness:
But all her complaint was,
I must have the Man
or I shall be Ruined
do I what I can.
The Man whom she fancied
was up to the brim,
In love with her person
as she was with him:
And being in the next Arbor,
where she made her moan,
He scaled a strong wall,
that was built all of Stone:
And there he presents her
the very same Man,
That must be her Lover
do she what she can.
They clung so together.
no Power could unloos^ 'um
She did her fond Blushes,
in's neck, and his bosum:
And there to each other
their hearts they reveal;
And tell these kind secrets
they cannot ^en^^al:
At last she is like
to be blessed with the Man,
That she must love
do all what she can.
They vow their Affections,
and there plight their Troth
They make up a Contract,
bound fast by an Oath:
They wedded, they bedded,
by Parents consent
The Maid has her wishes,
the Man is content:
When Providence orders
a Maid and a Man;
They shall have each other,
do all what they can.
