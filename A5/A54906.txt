Bowels of Compassion toward the scattered Seed. Or a visitation to all, who
has been seeking the resting place, but has not found it: the cause why
showed; and the way to it manifested, wherein is something showed also, of the
emptiness, and unsoundnesse of all profession, without the light of Christ, to
be the guide.
Also an information to all the honest hearted who desires to know the truth in
the simplicity of it concerning us, the people of the most high who is by the
world called Quakers: where all people is warned not to pass their Judgment
upon us, only by the reports of such as know not God: wherein they are
councelled out of love to their souls to wait with patience; and to mind the
testimony of Gods witness, that they may be preserved from lifting their hand
against the Lord, and his work.

Written in love to the scattered people in America: and is to be sent to all
the Islands belonging to it, that all may be warned, and left without excuse.
By one who am a witness what the Lord has done for his people, and has
obtained with him among the rest of the faithful, whom he has gathered into
his fold of rest; where they are thoroughly satisfied; and lies down in peace
and rest.

Richard Pinder.

COme oh all ye wearyed souls, who has travailed long, and has waited long
for deliverance: now is the everlasting light broken forth; and deliverance is
proclaimed by it unto all that have mourned in the time of Zions desolation,
and has waited for her deliverance out of Captivit^, and bondage to be set
free. Unto you the Lordis uttering of his voice, to the causing the dead to
hear; that ye may understand the way of life, and salvation; which unto you
is held forth in the light of eternal life, unto all that shall receive it,
and believe in it, and be turned to it, whereby you will be turned from under
Satan's power (which has caused your souls to mourn) into the power of God;
and will feel redemption wrought by it, and deliverance to be brought to the
seed of God, which has long been kept in bondage; and been captivated, and
has groaned for deliverance; but found it not, while your minds was alienated,
and estranged from the pure Principle of God in you, and so from the life of
Christ, and strangers to it. For all are strangers to the life of Christ,
until they be turned to his light which shines in them: whereby they are
turned from the darkness, and from under the power of it, into his power who
has enlightened them, who is the life, which was given to be the light of men
(which the darkness could not comprehend) that whosoever should believe in
him, should not abide in darkness but should have the light of life; and so be
translated from death to life; that in his life who has enlightened them, they
might be pertakers of Gods love, who has loved them, and called them out of
darkness into his light; that in his light they may know his power; that by
it, they may be quickened, and made alive unto him; whereby the way of life
will be known, and lived in, which is not known by those that hates the light
who are enemies to it, and does not believe in it, and so come short of the
life (which should satisfy them) and remains in the death, and the power of it
guides them that does not obey the light, but obeys unrighteousness, and
yields their members servants unto it, and so is free from righteousness,
because they believe not in Christ (who has enlightened them) who is Gods
righteousness, in whom God is well pleased, and in whom his Children finds
acceptance with him, and is well pleasing to him in obedience to his light; in
which they come to receive his mind, and will, and knows his secrets revealed
in them and so knows his voice; and follows it, in the way where they find
pasture, and feeding; and so is satisfied, and lies down in peace with him; and
knows the resting place, which all they are ignorant of, that denies his light
by which they are enlightened; and the leadings of it, which should lead, them
out of the way of death, and destruction, which all they are going on in that
does not believe in the light, which is the way to God, and is the truth, and
the life; in whom salvation is only to be sought for, and found, and in no
other but in him; that has enlightened you with his true light. So all you
that has long professed God, and has sought after peace with him, but has
not found it; here is the ground, because you have not sought it in the light;
and so have not known the power which should have reconciled you unto God, that
so the enmity has lodged in your hearts; and the partition wall has been
standing unthrown down, which kept you at a distance from God; which must be
slain; and thrown down; before peace with God be known, and witnessed; which
never any comes to see slain, or thrown down; but those that comes to the
light, and receives it, and beleivs in it; and so receives the power which
slays the enmity; and breaks down the partition wall: for to as many as did
receive him, power was given to become the Sons of God, in which power they had
victory, and were redeemed to God by it, out of the iniquity, and out of the
sin: where peace with God comes to be witnessed in the light, and power of God,
which has discovered it; and thrown it down, and here Christ comes to be put
on, and the true faith known, and the increase of it: and the old man with his
deeds, comes here to be put off, and crucified; and the new man known, which is
after Gods Image, and comes to be renewed according to the will of God, and
here comes the image of the heavenly to be known and born; the wisdom which
is from above received: which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy
to be entreated: which all they who are making a profession of God, and the
Scriptures in their earthly wisdom (and the enmity standing in their minds)
that wisdom which is from above they are ignorant of, for the wisdom which
is from above comes only to be known in the light: for Christ who is the light
is the wisdom of God, and the power of God. So all they who make a profession
of God and yet disobeys the light which Christ has enlightened them withal:
their wisdom is earthly, sensual, and divellish: and all who be in this
wisdom they are below the knowledge of God, and so in this wisdom is it that
men put light for darkness, and darkness for light; and so is not fit to judge
of the things of God; for the things of God is foolishness to that wisdom
which is from below; and God will confound it, and all them that be in it, that
sets themselves against his appearance, which is in light; in which light the
things of God comes only to be seen and known in that which is spiritual and
eternal: for it is the eye which is eternal and invisible, that sees into the
invisible things of God. So all they which be from the light (which is the eye)
they are blind, as concerning the things of God; for it is only the light which
gives the knowledge of God, and searches into, and sees into the things which
is eternal: and the things of God are only spiritually discerned; for the
natural man does not perceive them, neither can see into them. So all you that
are speaking of the things of God, and are professing the Saints word, which
was given forth by the eternal spirit which dwells in them, and did reveal the
things of God unto them: Now you that profess their words, and yet denies the
light that Christ has enlightened you withal, and calls it natural (and so
excludes your selves from having any thing in you which is eternal of God) you
are wholly blind in the things of God. For any who ever comes to know any thing
of God, as concerning the salvation of their souls; they must know it by the
light in them; for God is only light, and in him is no darkness at all; and so
the darkness that cannot reveal him, nor comprehend him, who is light it
self, who has immortallity, and dwells in the light, and only reveals
himself to his Creatures in the light; that so they in his light may know what
concerns the good of their souls; and as they are kept in it, they are kept
in unity with him, who is the Author of it. And so as the Saints walked in the
light; they had unity with God (who is light) and one with another; and in it
knew the washing, and cleansing, by the blood of Jesus, from all
unrighteousness. And all they that deny the light, deny that which should wash
them and cleanse them; and so tramples under foot the blood of the Covenant,
and counts it an unholy thing; and so neglect that which is ordained of God to
be the salvation of their souls; and despises the day of their visitation; and
slights it; and so remains in darkness, and knows not what way they go,
because darkness has blinded their eye, with which they should fee the way of
salvation; and their eye being blinded, then they stumble and so erres from the
way of God; and stumbles at Christ the chief corner stone who is a stumbling
stone, and rock of offense unto those that does not believe in him; but take
pleasure in unrighteousness. But who loves his light, and walks in it; the
occasion of stumbling comes to be taken away: for all stumbling that is in the
night in the darkness, from the light: and so all who stumbles, it is because
they believe not in the light which Christ has enlightened them withal; and
so the light is their condemnation, because they do not believe in it, but
loves their evil deeds; which the light (if they were obedient unto) would
lead out of; and so lead out of condemnation: for this is the condemnation,
that light is come into the World, but men love darkness rather then light,
because their deeds are evil; and will not bring their deeds to the light,
because the light will reprove them. And so he ^s the ground, why so many, both
teachers, and people, hates the light, and speaks evil of it; because they
love, their evil deeds: but all that love the light brings their deeds to it;
whereby they are manifest that they are wrought in God, and is justified by his
light, which has led out of the love of the evil deeds. So all you that are
breathing after peace, and fellowship with God, and has longed for it, but
has not found it, come to the light, and this will let you see what has kept
you from it; for this for your sakes is written, that you may understand where
the way of life and peace is to be found; and that you may be brought into it,
where you will see the emptiness, and unsoundnesse, and unprofitablenesse of
all that profession which is without the light; and of all those performances
which is acted, but not led into by the light, which is the Principle of God.
So never any comes to find true peace, neither in performing, nor in not
performing, but those that are led into the obedience of what they do, by the
principle which is of God; for this orders their service, and worship, unto him
aright: and is accepted with him, where an answer from him comes to be known
and received; which none comes to know, or receive, but those that are led into
what they do by the motions of his own spirit. For his worship and service;
that stands in the spirit, and in the truth. And all whose minds are abroad
from the principle of truth in them, they are strangers to the worship and
service of God; who are waiting for him and his appearance in outward
observations, you are mistaken, and the God of the world has blinded your
minds: for his kingdom comes not by observation, nor stands not in words, but
in power, and in peace, and joy in the holy Ghost, and the appearance of it is
to be found in you, as a grain of mustard seed; and the increase of it you are
to wait to feel there. And all you that have been seeking lo here, and lo
there, you must turn back, and feel the appearance of it in your selves; and
not be as fools, whose eyes is abroad. For you have been deceived by those
that has cried lo here, and lo there; they have drawn you forth from the
principle of God in you (which should have led you into the knowledge of God)
and so you have come short of what you have desired after and sought for; and
you have spent your money for that which is not bread, and your labor for that
which has not given you true satisfaction. Now the Lord have ^ing remembered
the travel of all such; and having regarded the cry of the oppressed, it has
caused bowels of compassion; that so after the time of your long darkness, he is
risen to gather you, with thoughts of love toward you; if you be not
stiffnecked, and rebellious; but be willing and obedient unto, he will gather
you the resting place to ly down with those whom he has caused to understand
his council, and made known the way of life unto them; and has established
their feet upon the sure foundation, and rock of ages: this the Lord has done
for many thousands, after their long travel, and much seeking has brought to
the knowledge of the truth it self; whereby they are thoroughly satisfied, and
lies down in his arm, by which he has gathered them into his fold of rest.
This the Lord has brought to pass; to the praise, and honor of his own name;
in the Island of England; where many is brought to walk in the light of the
Lord their God; and lies down together in the resting place, where their waters
is sure. And now the Lord is fulfilling his promise made of old; and is ri^en
to gather his elect from the four corners of the earth, into his everlasting
fold, where there is one shephard, and one fold witnessed according to his
promise; who has promised that he will seek, save that which was lost; and
bring back that which was driven away. And this is a visitation unto you the
scattered in America, who has any true, and living breathings after God; who
has professed him in words, but has not found thath which your souls longed
after by one whom am a witness what the Lord has done for his people; and
having obtained deliverance, and favor wim (amongst the rest) who is
constrained by the love, and power of God to visit you; that you may also be
gathered, and made pertakers of the same love, and power, which now the Lord is
manifesting to the glory of his everlasting name; and to the peace; and comfort
of all tha^ have waited for him, and sought him in sincerity, and uprightness
of heart: now has he caused his glorious light to shine forth, to guide their
feet in the way o^ peace, and salvation; in which fools shall not err, nor
go astray: and all tha^ walks in it, shall find pasture; and feeding, and
shall grow to his praise, that hat^ called them; and shown them the way of
life, who has visited them with the da^^ sprung from on high, which has given
the knowledged of salvation; and hat^ brought deliverance with it, even unto
those that sat in darkness^, and under the shadow of death; behold light i^
sprung up, which has caused many to rejoyc^ Arise, arise, you that are yet in
darkness, and come forth, that Christ may gi^^ you life; that you may come to
witness deliverance to your souls, which is pr^c^ous in the eyes of the Lord;
who does not desire your death, but rather that yo^ should repent and live,
that he may have mercy on you; that you might be gather^^ in this day of his
love; least it be said unto you, how often would the Lord have g^thered you,
but you would not. Oh be not stiff-necked, neither harden your hearts against
him; least the day of your visitation pass over your heads, and it be hid from
yo^^ eyes, but while the Lord calls, and waits to be gracious unto you, that
you may return with speed; that he may show mercy unto you: who has said that
in the day that the wicked man turns from his wickedness, and does that which
is just, he will remember his sin no more. But know assuredly that if you
neglect the day of your visitation, and continue, and go on in sin, and
wickedness; that the day of the Lord will overtake you; and that his fury, and
indignation, you must partake of, which must be poured out without mixture: and
will fall heavy upon the head of the wicked, and ungodly, that turns his pure
grace into wantonness; which has appeared unto them, and would teach them to
deny all ungodliness; (if they were obedient unto it) and to live godly, and
soberly in this present world. But if you go on in wickedness after you are
warned, and do despite unto the spirit of grace; then your candle shall be put
out: and know then that utter darkness shall be your portion; where there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for ever, and ever.

And unto all you whose hearts is tender toward God; and desires to know the
truth as it is in Jesus, and is afraid of being deceived, and led in the way of
error a few lines I am moved to write unto you, that you may be more fully
informed concerning us, whom the Lord has made witnesses of his truth; seeing
many false reports, and many slanders is cast upon us by those that know not
God, nor his worship, which is in spirit, and in truth; and this worship we
own; and set up, and witness it amongst us: and therefore is it that we are so
much hated, and re^roached by all sorts of people that are in the false
worship, and ways, because we ^estifie against them all, who are in the Sects,
and opinions, that are setting up their ^wn inventions; and so is worshipping
the work of their own hands; against all such ^^ve bear our testimony, who
knows not a principle of God to guide them in their worship: but is worshipping
by tradition: for this we say, that it is neither cir^umcision, nor
uncircumcision that avails any thing with God, but a new creature, ^^o this in
short; we are against all those that profess that, which they live not ^^e
life of; such we account as hypocrites, and all such teachers that profess the
^criptures, and Saints words; and yet be out of their life; all such we do
deny, and turn from them, as having the form of godliness; but not the power
of it, who ^^enies the light, which Christ has enlightened every one withal;
with which they should be led into the life of what they profess, and this we
say, that none comes unto the life which the Saints was in who gave forth the
scriptures, but those that ^ome to be guided by the same spirit, as they were;
nor into the power which the ^^ints lived in, but those that receives the light
of Christ, which shi^es into their own consciences. And I say again, that those
professed Teachers, who does de^^ the light of Christ to be manifested within
people, to guide, and teach them; ^^ch we account, as blind guides: for we
knowing, and being assured that there is nothing that can guide any in the way
of God, but the light, which comes ^^om him, and all they that does deny the
appearance of it to be within; we say they are ignorant of the anointing which
was in the Saints, and did teach them; and as they continued in it, they needed
not any man to teach them, and all who deny the teachings of the anointing
within, we account as Antichrists, and deceivers; and say they were never sent
of God: for those that were sent by him, they were sent to turn people from
darkness to light, from Satan^ power, unto God. And again we say, that none
brings any unto God, nor profits people, but those that turns them to the
light; for how is any like to come into the knowledge of God, while they remain
in darkness: and them Teachers, which does not bring people to the anointing
within, to be taught by it; we account of that sort which keeps people ever
learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. For it was the
spirit of truth, by which the Saints was led into all truth; and the spirit did
reveal the things of God unto them; and it was within them: and what may be
known of God, is manifest within. So not any one knows any thing of God, but as
his spirit reveals unto them. For no man knows the Father but the Son, and h^
to whom the Son reveals him, and who ever comes to know the Father, and the
Son to dwell in them, they must come to the light, and wait in it, to feel the
Father and the Son revealed: and here you will know the doctrine of Christ; and
all that abides in it, they have both the Father, and the Son: and if any bring
any other doctrine then this, you are not to receive them into your houses,
neither bid them God speed, least you be partakers of their sins. And all that
reads this, may see that that accusation is falsely cast upon us, to say that we
deny the Ministers of Christ; for it is none but those that profess themselves
to be his ministers; and does not abide in his doctrine, it is those that we
deny; and declare against those that we find walking in the steps of the false
Prophets, which we read of in the scriptures. So this is for the simples sake,
that they may clearly understand that we do not deny the true Ministry, nor
Ministers, but own them; and witness th^^ true ministry among us. And praises
be unto the Lord, many have the word of reconciliation committed unto them, and
are faithful ministers of it; not of the letter, but of the spirit, which
gives life; by which many comes to be converte^ unto God, and turned from
darkness unto light. So it is none but those that can not witness this
ministry that we speak against; who runs for their own ends but is not sent of
God, and so does not profit people; those indeed we do declar^ against; as all
those ever did that was sent by God; and did receive their ministr^ from him
freely; and so was to minister freely unto those whom the Lord sen^ them; and
so the Lord he cared for them. And those that make a prey upon the people; and
through covetousness make Merchandise of souls, those we do deny; such as
watches not for the good of souls, but for the flee^e; such we exhor^ people
to turn away from, least they be destroyed by them; such who feeds n^^ the
flock, but feeds themselves; those teachers we declare against, in what
Country, or place soever we find them; and seeks to redeem people out of their
mouth^^ that so they may no longer make a prey upon them; that they may be
brought (...) know their true shephard, and true Teacher; who is now come to
teach his people by his own spirit, and is fullfilling his promise made with
Israel; all the children of the Lord shall be taught of the Lord; and great
shall be their peace: and now he is gathering the residue of his own seed into
his covenant of ligh^; where they shall not need to teach every man his
neig^b^ur, and brother, saying know the Lord, but all shall know him, from the
least to the greatest: and he is pouring forth of his spirit upon all flesh;
and many, both Sons and Daughters, is brought to Prophecy, according unto his
promise; and this he has fullfilled, and brought to pass, among his gathered
flock, other great astonishment: of all the heathen round about; who knows not
God, nor his power, by which he subdues Kingdoms; and over-turnes them, until
the Government of them come into his hand, whose right they are: who reigns in
righteousness, in justice, and in equity; who must rule all Nations with his
Iron rod, and will dash them to pieces, (like a Potters vessel) that opposes
him in his work, which now he is bringing to pass; by his own Arm; even his
work, his strange work, his act; his strange act. So this the Lord has put in
my heart, to warn all, both high, and low, both rich, and poor, bond, and
free, that you take heed how you lift your hand against the Lord, and his
people; whom he has made witnesses of his outgoings, which has been as in
times of old; least it come upon you, as spoken of by his Prophet, behold ye
despisers, and wonderers, and perish; for the abomination, which has caused
desolation is seen; and he that stands in the holy place reads, and
understands. So I say, again this is a warning unto all sorts of people, in
these foreign Countries that they be not hasty to speak evil of things
that they know not; nor to judge rashly of things they do not understand; but
that they may with patience wait to see what the Lord will bring to pass;
least they be found fighting against him; and so be consumed by the breach of
his nostrills: for surely his stroke will be grievous, and fall heavy upon all
that withstands him: for consider was there ever any that strove against the
Lord, and prospered? Nay; though the heathen rage; and the wicked imagine vain
things against the Lord, and his people; they shall be confounded; and his Son
he will exalt upon his holy hill; to be both Lord and King, and Lawgiver: unto
whom Kings, and Princes shall be made subject and shall lay down their Crowns
at his feet: and this the Lord will bring to^ pass; contrary to all the wills
of men; that so he may be exalted, and get himself a name for his own works
sakes; whose outgoings was ever strange unto the World: and this I say for
your sake; whose hearts is after God, that you may not be filled with reports
from the mouths of wicked and ungodly men, concerning us, the people of the
most high; but that you may be single in your minds from judging of us, until
you see further of us. And mind the testimony of Gods witness in you, that you
may be preserved, from passing Judgment nastily upon u^, only from the
reports of such as know not the Lord. For a people that is hated of the World
we are; and the Lord has redeemed us out of the pollutions of it; whereby we
give our testimony against it that the deeds of it is evil; wherefore we are
hated of the World, as those ever was, whom the Lord called out of it; and
chose to bear his testimony against it, and unto his truth; whereby they
become a byword, and a reproach unto the World, as we are now, whom he has
redeemed unto himself out of the vain glory, and customs of it; whereby we
have the testimony of his spirit, that we are of him, and that the whole World
lies in wickedness; and because we obey his commands, and they are not
grievous, but joyous to us: And because the love of God dwells amongst us, and
is perfected in us, and one toward another, whereby we know that we are passed
from death to life, where Satan has no power, but is cast out; which has
caused great wrath upon them that dwells in the Earth, that so many times they
have sought to devour us; and has had power to cast some of us into Prison,
and to inflict punishment upon our outward bodies for a time, in which time the
Lord was with us our stay, and refuge; when all the powers of darkness rose up
against us, and would have devoured us in a moment, had not the Lord appeared
for us, for the deliverance of his own seed, for whose sake he is now risen,
with full purpose to gather, and to make it the praise of the whole Earth, and
to exalt it in spite of all his enemies, and to crown his people with victory,
and dominion ^ver the heads of all the ungodly, whom he has upholden by his
arm, and has led them through great tribulation, whereby they came to be
acquainted with the Lords dealings with them, and saw his arm and power,
through all preserving of them, where they had their garments washed, and made
white, and is redeemed by the blood of the Lamb, and has received the mark of
the living God in their foreheads, and have found their names written in the
Lambs book of life, from the foundation of the World, and so cannot worship
the Beast, nor his Image; but makes war against him, with the testimony of
the Lamb, by which we overcome and have victory, and rejoices over the Beast,
and false Prophet (praises be unto the Lord for ever more) and worships him
that made heaven and earth, who was dead, and is alive, and lives for ever
more; who has brought salvation, and redemption, who has wrought all our
works for us, and in us, who has saved in the time of need: who by his own
arm has brought deliverance, and has delivered out of captivity, and
bondage, and has made us free, in the kingdom of his own Son; who cannot but
extol his loving kindness, and infinite mercies toward us, whose time has
been a time of love, even when none else pittyed, then he by his own power
wrought our deliverance, and saved us; whereby we are become the first fruits
unto the Lord God, and to the Lamb, and rejoices before the Throne of his
glory, where we come to be filled with his praises, who has purchased us by
his own blood, and has redeemed us out of kindred, tongues, and Nations, not to
live unto our selves, but unto him that dyed for out sins, and is risen again
for our justification, that we should not fashion our selves according to the
former lusts, in our ignorance, nor according to the course of the World,
neither that we should be conformable unto it; but that we should live to his
praise and be conformable to his Image, who is our Captain, and forerunner, who
for the joy set before him endured the Cross, and despised the shame, and so
he being our example, and Master, who suffered the contradiction of sinners,
therefore, we as followers, and servants thinks it no strange thing to be
hated, and reviled of the World, we knowing that our Lord and Master passed the
same way: and that the servant is not greater then his Lord: and that they who
will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution: So we rather choose to
suffer with our Lord and Master, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin; which is
but for a season; we rather choose to fill up the measure of his sufferings
which is yet behind: for we knowing that all who ever reigns with him, must
first suffer with him, for he was made perfect through sufferings; and we
knowing, and having such a cloud of witnesses, recorded in the Scriptures of
truth, that persecution, and suffering, was the portion, which the people of
God received from the World; Therefore we even so walk, as we have them for an
example: we beleiving that they through patience obtained the promise; and is
laid down in peace, and rest; that so, none need wonder why we are so hated,
and persecuted in every place, by those that knows not God; and by them also
that professes in words they know him; but in works deny him; by all such we
are hated, and falsely slandered, but unto us reproaches is great riches: we
knowing that they have no evil justly to accuse us of, or lay to our charge,
as we have a true testimony in all consciences, that does witness for us, that
our lives and conversations is honest, and harmless toward all men, both in
word and action; and that we walk void of offense toward all. Only this the
seed of enmity is offended when we cannot bow to it, nor honor it: knowing
that all honor is to be given unto God; and that it is due to him, and that he
will not give it to another; and that all knees is to bow at the name of Jesus,
both things in heaven, and things in earth. So no more we can bow to the seed
of the Serpent, knowing that it is that seed, which seeks the honor which is
below: and not the honor which is from above; So we honor all men in the
Lord; and gives honor unto whom honor is due; but bow to Haman's wicked
nature we cannot, though we suffer for it, as Haman would have caused Mordecai
to have done. Or it may be they are offended at us, because we prophecy
against all sin, and wickedness, and exhorts people to come out of it; and to
mind the light of Christ in them, which checks and reproves for sin, that so
they might be brought to repentance; to witness the salvation of their souls;
now indeed, when the seed of the Serpent hears this, it begins to rage in
them, in whom it bears rule, for great is the enmity of the old Serpent, the
Dragon, against the Man-child, wherever he speaks, knowing that it is he that
must bruise his head, and dash his kingdom to pieces with his rod of Iron, who
must rule all Nations; and unto whom all knees must bow, and we knowing this,
that all power is given unto him the Lamb of God, which was slain from the
foundation of the World we are subject unto him, and his power, for conscience
sake; knowing that it i^ the higher power, unto which all is to be subject.

And here the honest hearted Reader may see what has been, and is the caus^
why we have suffered, and do suffer by the hands of unreasonable men, seeing
ther^ is enmity put between the two Seed, and that he that is born after the
flesh persecutes him that is born after the spirit, and that there is no
agreement between the temple of God, and the temple of Idols, nor no communion
betwixt light, and darkness, and that the Bondwoman, and her Son, seeks to
destroy the free Woman, and her Son. So if thy eye be but single, and thou read
without prejudice in thy mind, and let not the evil overcome thee; thou may
easily see what seed we are of. If we were of the World, the World would hear

therefore the World hate us, because it hated him, who has called, and chosen
us; before it hated us: a^^ the Servant is not greater then his Lord.
