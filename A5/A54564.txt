TO THE HONORABLE THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS AND BURGESSES IN THE COMMONS HOUSE OF
PARLIAMENT NOW ASSEMBLED.
The humble Petition of 15000. poor laboring men, known by the name of
Porters, and the low^st Members of the City of LONDON.
Humbly shows,
THat your poor Petitioners, though they be the lowest and meanest Members of
this City, yettney do with all humble and hearty acknowledgment confess, that
the uncessant and unexpressable care and pains you have aken for the good of
both Church and State, in the midst of so many Plots, Conspiracies and
perils, deserves to be recorded to your eternal Fame, and of your poor
Petitioners most humbly and gratefully accepted of; although those happy
effects, you have by your unwearied endeavors labored for, and your
Petitioners long expected, be not yet produced; the case of which is, that
adverse malignant-blood sucking-rebellious Popish party in the general: For
particular parties, many of them has been often mentioned in this Honorable
House heretofore: therefore we will omit to make any further mention of them;
only your Petitioners does humbly crave leave to name some of those many
particular evils, which we have too much cause to fear, and are in a great
measure sensible of: as First, that great height of power the Adverse party is
grown unto, in that they are so impudent and Insolent, as to counsel to, and
devise a way to a^cuse the Innocent; and when that would not hit, then they
counseled that power Prerogative should trample upon all the Privileges of
Parliament, and the Liberty of the Subject, which if Gods providence and your
prudence had not timely prevented this design, the whole Kingdom ere this
time, had been involved in blood. Secondly, the daily growth of the Forces,
Insolences and outrages of those salvage, and more then barbarous Rebels in
Ireland, exercised upon our poor Brethren by Nation and Religion, whose
miserable and distressed estate we truly sympathize, and do much condole; and
if the good hand of the Allmighty, by your prudence and puissance, do not
speedily bridle the adversary, they will totally extirpate and extinguish the
name of the English, with the Protestant Religion in that Nation. And your
Petitioners do humbly conceive, that the hand of the adverse party is too much
seen amongst us here, by contriving and procuring obstructions and delays in
their relief and supplies. Thirdly, the universal deadnes of Trading, it has
been a languishing long, and struck in diverse branches of it, but now the very
body of it is struck livelesse and dead: and the reasons hereof (as your
Petitioners does humbly conceive) are diverse, not only the things before named,
but the many fears, jealousies and distractions we lie under: for being the
adverse party sees that their secret plots, Conspiracies, and hellish devices,
has hitherto become abortive, it is to be feared they will break out into open
Hostility, as they have done in Ireland; and moreover, laying of our selves
open to foreign Invasion, by delaying of the fortification of the Cinque
Ports, which is (as your Petitioners do humbly conceive) too great an
advantage and encouragement to the Papists amongst us to make Insurrection, and
does too much animate a foreign pewer to Invade us. These and many more,
which is above and beyond our line and soheare of conceiving, are the causes of
this universal deadness of Trading: now this deadness of Trade is the
solecanse your poor Petitioners does want employment in such a measure, that
their lives are made very uncomfortable: for besides the single number
mentioned before, which is the least that do live in that way; there is a
treble number which has their subsistence of the labor of your poor
Petitioners, that is, their Wives and Children: and being your Petitioners can
have no better employment, they are exposed to many hardships for that little,
your Petitioners was possessed of before these times, since these times of
Trading grew so dead, they have been constrained to sell part, and paund other
part, for to buy food for their Families, and now they have scarce so much left
as will satisfy their Landlords for Rent, and so your Petitioners are very
nigh turning into the Streets.

Therefore, the most humble request of your poor Petitioners is, that this
extreme necessity of theirs may be taken into serious consideration, and that
this Honorable House would fall upon the speediest course that your wisdoms
sees best, for abateing and quelling of the pride, outrage, and insolency of
the adverse party here at home; and that relief and supply may be sent to our
Brethren in Ireland, if it may be before it be too late. And your Petitioners
do further humbly pray, that this Land May be secured, by fortifying the
Cinque Ports, and putting the people into a posture of Defense, that all, or as
many of our fears as can, may be removed; that the way and life of Trading may
again be set up and opened; that so your Petitioners wants may in some measure
be supplied. They further humbly pray that Justice may be done upon Offenders,
according as the atrocitie of their crimes have deserved: for if these things
be any longer suspended, they will force your Petitioners to extremities, not
fit to be named, and to make good that saying, That necessity has no Law: It
is true, that we have nothing to lose but our lives, and those we will
willingly expose to the utmost peril, in the defense of the Kings Majesty's
Royal person, Crown and Dignities, and this Honorable House of Parliament,
with the Privileges thereof, with all therest, contained in our Protestation,
to which your Petitioners will adhere to the loss of their lives: And they do
most humbly desire a favounble construction and acceptance of these few
immature and undigested expressions, and so much as is unsavourie in them to
impute it to a defect in their understanding, and not to any perniciousnesse in
the will. And your Petitioners do with all humbleness and submission desire a
speedy Answer;

And they will never cease to pray, (...)
A true relation of the manner how it was delivered.
THe Petitioners coming to the House, were called, and six of them having
access one of them was to speak, and that was the man that delivered the
Petition; and thus he delivered himself: May we humbly crave leave of this
Honorable House to deliver a Petition; the Answer was, to bring it in, and
then the Petitioners were ordered to withdraw: and after some time spent, the
Petitioners were called in again, and Mr. Speaker was desired in the name of
the House to give the Petitioners many thanks for the love, care, and obedience
they manifested: and their expressions were kindly accepted of: and the
Petitioners were wished to continue in their obedience, and for their request,
part of it was provided for, and the other part the House did take special
care of, and we should have full satisfaction. To which the Speaker for the
Petitioners replied, that they gave the Honorable House many humble and great
thanks for their gracious acceptance, and with all did humbly desirethe
Honorable House would take notice, that the pressing necessities are such we
lie under, as cannot admit of delays.
