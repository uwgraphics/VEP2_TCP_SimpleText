News from Sally: Of A strange Delivery of four English Captives from the
slavery of the Turks.
ABout the beginning of October last, four English Ships, the one from Rye,
the other from Bastable, the third from Apsum, and the fourth from Dartmouth,
being bound homeward from Rochell, after a day and a nights sail, it was their
fortune to meet with a Turkish man of War of Sally, who being well provided,
with small resistance took them (they being Merchants men and not for service)
carried them to Sally, where after some few days arrival, one of each Ship
was sold to a Merchant of Argier for Slaves, who having not opportunity of
passage remained some days in Sally with his Slaves, in which time he gave
order that Shackles should be made for each slave weighing fifty pound weight,
but the Lord most graciously delivered them after this manner; viz. for being
chained every night (as the custom is) to an Iron Bar until their Shackles
were made, and in the day time imployd about the Town, they found means to
speak with a Portugal slave concerning their escape, who assured them that if
they could conveniently get out of the town, they might take their course along
the sea shore, and in three or four hours they may recover a town of the
Spaniards, not distant from that place above eighteen miles; which having
learn, tthey employ their best endeavors for their escape, so that having
gotten a piece of Clay, and finding opportunity to make the impression of the
key of their Prison in the aforesaid clay, by which they made a wooden key, and
making trial found that it would stand them in stead; the night before they
should have departed for Argier, and that their shackles should have been put
on, having got a strong nail, they begun about twelve a clock to tamper with
the lock which held the chain to the iron bar, to which they were fastened;
but having spent two hours, and not being able to pick the lock, despairing of
their purpose, laid themselves down to sleep: but God putting into the heart of
James Cadman (Master of that ship from Rye) once more to assay the lock, rose
up, and being next unto the lock, at the very first trial opened it; which
having done, opened the door with the wooden key; then coming to another
door, they easily lifted it off from the hooks with an iron bar which they
there found; so likewise a third door, which lead them into the street. But
mark the wonderful works of the Lord, for all the time that this was a doing,
a dog continued barking in the house, which their Patron and another Turk never
heard, although they lay the very next wall unto them. So being come into the
street, the one having the iron bar, the other an axe, the third a staff, and
the fourth an iron ladle (such as they melt lead in) they ran presently to the
Town wall, and leaped down without any harm, it being eighteen foot high,
and so took their way toward the shore, not meeting with any Scouts or Watch
in all the way. After which, as the Portugal directed them, they run along the
seashore, in far more danger of the wild beasts (which use to haunt those
places) than formerly they were of the Turk their Master; but God which
delivered them out of the hands of the one, saved them also from the jaws of
the other: For they met but with one wild Bore, who so soon as he had set eye
on them, fled from them. They did hear in diverse places the barking of a small
beast, which usually follows the Lions, by which they ghessed diverse Lions
were thereabout, but met with none. So with running, by break of day they
obtained the Spanish Town, where the Governor gave them noble entertainment,
and within the space of an hour, took them into a Turret, where he showed
them 24 Turkish Horsemen, which had pursued them, but God be praised, they
were out of their reach. The Iron Bar, the Axe, and the Ladle, the Governor
hanged up in the chief Church of the Town, in memorial of their strange
delivery. So having occasion of passage for Cales, they came away from thence,
and finding a Dover ship at Cales, came for England, where they now are to give
God praise for their safe delivery.

FINIS.
