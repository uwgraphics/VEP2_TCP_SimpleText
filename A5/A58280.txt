THE REBEL CAPTIVE. An Excellent New SONG, On the taking of Argile in Scotland
by three Young Men, who met him as he was flying away in Disguise, after his
Men had deserted hin, etc.
Behold Argile the Famous Rebel, He
Who awed Three Kingdoms, now subdued by Three.
Oh Archibald! (to save) hard was thy Doom,
In The Field a wretched Life to loose at Home,
To the Tune of Sawny and Jockey. etc.
^

I.
THree bony Lads were Sawny Cloud Hammilton,
And Andrew Grier the Captain that led 'em on,
When for the Loons it proved a fatal day,
Argile was ta'n, and all his Men run away.
When Duglas Jiv'd him,
Riv'd him,
Driv'd him
And of all hopes had deprived him,
Routed him, flouted him,
The De'l bigoted him,
And now the States a Rope have allotted him.
II.
On June the Fifteenth, oh! 'twas a Fatal day,
Archibald fled, and all the Rogues run away
In a disguise the Loon thought to shun his Fate,
Three bonny Boys stopped him on the Gate,
In a blew Bonnet,
On it
One hit
Such a bread Gash as made him tull own it,
Oh! spare me,
Disarm me,
And do no more harm me,
For I am Argile the head of the Whig Army.
III.
Quarters, oh! quarters! I yield my self Prisoner,
Here take my Sword too that useless Tool of War.
Footmen and Horses, now I all give you over,
Dunbartons Forces no Man can stand before.
But they will fight him,
Right him,
Fright him,
The proudest Fo; will put to the flight him,
Thunder him,
Plunder him,
Dash all asunder him,
And make Argile himself truckle under him.
IV.
Thus having yielded up both his Sword and Durg,
The Bony Boys conveyed him to Edingburg,
Where with a Train he enters the Watergate,
The Hangman walking before in Muckle State
With a Hemp Garter,
The Martyr to Quarter
And by the Lugs to cut the Loon shorter.
The same Fate
Ever wait,
To Crown the Rebels Pate,
And all such Traitors as dare oppose the State.

Charing Cross.
