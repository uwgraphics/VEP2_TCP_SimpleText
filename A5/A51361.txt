LONDON, Printed for T. B. 1642.

To the Kings most excellent Majesty, And To the High Court of Parliament, and
in them to the whole Kingdom of England.
Dread Sovereigne,
I Make a tender to your Royal Majesty (and in you, to the high Court of
Parliament, and to your whole Kingdom) of an illustrious example of the divine
providence, no less wonderful for admiration, then the discovery of Gods
judgments, made by the Prophet Daniel to King Nebuchodonozar, and Baltassar
his son; not less behoofull for the good and welfare of your self, our
gracious Queen, your Roy. I Offspring, and our whole Kingdom (if you will
vouchsafe o^pprehend and make, use of it) then the discovery of the treacheries
of Bagathan and Th^res, and of the pernicious devices of wicked Aman, made by
Mardocheus to King Ahassuerus, was for ^in and his people.

My course has been d^^ected to your Royal Majesty, by Gods sacred and
special appointment, ever since your first coming to your Crown, and before,
though I never addressed any writing unto you in special (...) this m^tter
till now; because I was first to dealt with Roman Catholics, and afterward
with some of your Iustings, Judges, and other Officers, and finally to expect
in p^^^ence some events of the divine providence, succeeding thereupon, that
ascending to your R^y^ll Tribunal by degrees, I might have more ample and
special matter every way to present, and not appear empty handed before you.

Now Gods judgments are grown to a great ripeness, or (to speak with
allusion to our blessed Saviors expression in a like case) The figtree has
budded whereby men may know Summer is nigh. Wherefore, if your Royal Majesty,
and the high Court of Parliament, will be pleased to make a due enquiry and
examination of my course, whereby the matter of fact may be authentically made
known; and then cast a serious eye upon the public events of the divine
providence, which (succeeding in due conformity and consequence this many
years, and parallel to the approved testimonies of Gods special judgments in
ancient times) are as it were, the great broad Seal of heaven, giving weight
and authority to my words, and endeavors; besides that your Majesty may with
ease see that there is a supernatural order of things, taught by supernatural
faith (which one not many years since in a public printed book dedicated to
your Highness, has endeavored to evacuate) you may moreover with like
facility perceive how the sacred decrees of Gods heavenly providence are drawn
up, not only concerning the rest of the Christian world, but also especially
concerning you and your Kingdom, and by conforming your self to his holy
will, decline the common mischiefs approaching, which otherwise by no humane
means can possibly be avoided.

Let not my meannesse (who am but an unworthy instrument, and the least of your
Majesty's subjects) move your Highness, or the grave assembly of Parliament to
despise the offer which I make, but first enquire, and examine diligently (as
both Gods Law and man's reason do enquire) and then judge. There are some
dangers which can neither be known, nor avoided, unless they be first
graciously discovered by some special favor and operation of the first cause
which is God himself, from whom nothing can be hid, and in such cases, though
his divine Majesty does many times employ men of great wisdom and sanctity
(as he did the Prophet Elizeus to discover to the King of Israel the
ambushments set to entrap him by the King of Syria) yet he does sometimes also,
not only use the most contemptible of men, as instruments to make the greatest
potentates acquainted with his ways, and so enable them to avoid prepared
mischiefs, but moreover takes a brute beast for the like purpose, as in the
case of Balaam and his Ass.

Your Majesty's great predecessor William the Conqueror thought it wisdom,
in a certain occasion, to hearken to the advertisement even of a natural
fool, as we read in our Chronicles: and long before his time, Alexander the
great gave ear to a woman, who was thought distracted, as Curtius the
Historian does testify; by which happy credulity (God, who is al able to make
fools and mad men speak his wisdom, having discovered his divine knowledge
and judgment by means of those silly ones) those two great Princes avoided
imminent danger of death, and conserved their lives, and fortunes, for their
great succeeding victories. On the otherside, the neglect of timely
advertisements, has brought many great Princes, and amongst the rest, that
great Monarch Julius Caesar to the loss of their Crowns and lives. He that
will not hearken to God in his gracious signs and forewarnings, must feel his
heavy hand when it will be too late to avoid it.

For me I do not profess my self among the number of wise men, and if your
Majesty, or the great assembly of State now on foot, please, you may take me
for a fool, or a mad man (provided you acknowledge, that God Almighty can by
his holy overruling Spirit, make a madness prodigious, and so use the folly or
madness of his creature, as an instrument to express ^n act of his divine
wisdom, providence and power;) but what ever I be, foolish or wise, or
however your royal Majesty, or the high Court of Parliament shall be pleased
to think of me, God is wise even in the fool and mad man, and his holy will
is to be searched out in all; which if it had been duly done more then
thirteen years ago (adhering close to the testimony of divine and humane
Law, implied in the reality of my whole course, with a due inspection of the
countersignes extant even then in the seeds of those heavy events, which have
appeared since most plainly to the view of all in their own proper and perfect
existence) when before some of your Majesty's tribunalls, I did publicly in
GODS name, and in virtue of his public Laws, special right, and command,
with due relation likewise to the Laws of our Realm, and two of your Royal
Majesty's Proclamations, invite your Royal Highness, and your whole Kingdom,
to a due enquity of Gods prepared judgments, and of the devices then in
hatching to entrap you and your people; not only your Judges and other persons
of higher rank and note, who lie now exposed to the rod of Justice, might have
been freed from undergoing the danger now threatening them; but your Majesty
also might with ease and security have prevented those troubles, and
mischiefs, which turmoile at this present all your Realms, and threaten a
desolation. So much it behooves Princes and States to attend, and examine well,
if God almighty dot but make even B^laams Ass bray forth some imminent
judgments in his holy name. For mischiefs arising from the power of man may by
the power of man with Gods ordinary concourse be extinguished or averted: but
such as are threatened by God Almighties special hand, and power can by no
means possible be avoided, but by admission, and performance of such
conditions, as his Majesty divine is pleased to propose.

I have strove to keep silence now these many years, being loath to meddle any
more in a cause, which has cost me so much trouble, and affliction (though I
know not why I should be so handled by any for suffering God Almighty to
express in me, whether men will have it to have been by the intermediation
of wit or madness, a testimony of his divine providence toward his Church,
and people) but I dare be silent no longer, being furnished now with such
illustrious evidence of fore-pessed events proper to my cause, to confirm my
words, and the thing it self concerning so deeply your Royal Majesty, our
gracious Queen, your Royal Offspring, and our whole Kingdom: lest God
Almighty should inflect upon me the judgment threatened against the Watchman
in the thirty third Chapter of the Prophet Ezechiel, yet I will forbear to
trouble your Royal Majesty, with the specification of particulars, till I see
whether I be thought fit to be admitted to a free, and indifferent heating, or
no. One thing I must crave pardon of your Royal Majesty, and the great
Assembly of Parliament; that I address my self thus to you in print, before I
have acquainted you with my case in a more private way. The reason I have done
so is: that seeing every man now prints, what he lists; and my cause has been
many years since public, and I suffered so much in maintenance of it under
the view of many; I may either by the testimony of some, at least wise of those
many, be introduced to a free, and public audience: or else upon compassion be
voted, as a fool or madman, to be set free from prison, and further trouble
(seeing I never appeared in so many years extremities, either furious,
seditious, or turbulent) and so be committed to the care of my friends, that I
may end my old age in peace, and quietness; commending you, and your Kingdom,
to Gods merciful providence, care, and protection.

I humbly beseech God Almighty, to bless, and protect your Royal Majesty,
our gracious Queen, your Royal Offspring, and our whole Kingdom, and grant
that you may know his holy will, and faithfully perform the same to the glory
of the divine Majesty, and the common comfort, and good of all.

From the Prison of Newgate 23. April 1642. Your Royal Majesty's loyal and
lowly Subject, Edward Morgan.
