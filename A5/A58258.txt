Reasons humbly offered in justification of an Order granted to Major George
Wither, by the Honorable House of Commons, the ninth of Febr. 1642. for
repair of his damages sustained (by the Kings Forces) at the beginning of this
War, out of the goods and estates of his Plunderers, or any others in Arms
against the Parliament: Whereunto are annexed also, reasons against the passing
of an Ordinance for one Edward Andrews a Delinquent, part of whose personal
estate, was seized and possessed by virtue of the said Order, and injuriously
taken again out of the said Majors possession, by color of a composition at
Goldsmiths Hall, to the dishonor of the House of Commons.
Reasons justifying the said Order in general.
IN primis, The said Major Wither was one of the first in the Kingdom, who was
damnified by the Kings Forces to any great value; the first Contributer to the
Parliament in those parts where he lived; the first who there took up Arms for
it, as a Commander, and one who has not only diverse other ways since this
war, but all his life time also, manifested himself, both in word, deed, and
sufferings, to be an Opposer of public tyrannies, oppressions, and
superstitions, according to his faculties and his power, even to the hazarding
of his life, and the loss of his estate at this present, as well as to the
hindrance of his preferment heretofore.

Secondly, (though the contrary be suggested by some envious or malignant
persons in Surrey) the said Major can make it appear, that his hindrances and
losses, whose repair was intended by the said Order, were far greater than to
the said House of Commons they were certified to be; and that such as in the
said County of Surrey, were drawn by some in authority to swear the
Negative, were abused, and made to perjure themselves, in so doing.

Thirdly, the said Order was fairly gotten, and deliberately granted, not only
according to an Ordinance of the Parliament of England, but in pursuance also
of a Declaration of both Kingdoms, wherein it is declared, that no man who
has been in eminent action, or suffered any notable loss for the Public,
should be neglected or slighted; but, one way or ^ther, thankfully remembered,
to his good and the honor of his posterity: The said two Kingdoms thereby
declared also, that the whole estates, real and personal, movables and
inheritance, of such who were personally excepted from pardon, and who having
taken up Arms against the Parliament, should not come in before a day set
therefore, should be forfeited for the paying of public debts, easing common
burdens, and repairing particular losses; and, as an establishment of the said
Order is a making good of the said Declaration, and of the Public Faith
thereby engaged; so the annihilation or frustrating of the same, before the
said Majors losses are fully repaired (without some other recompense) will be a
dishonor to the Parliament, it not a violation of the faith of both Kingdoms.

Fourthly, if the said Order should be contemned, and made ineffectuall to the
said Major, as it has lately been, it would much infringe the Liberties of the
House of Commons, and make their Orders contemptible, to the dis-honour of the
whole Commonaltie of England: For, it will be conceived, that they either
granted more, then they ought to have vouchsafed; or more, then they have power
to maintain; or more, then they have will to perform; or else, that they were
not well advised what they granted; the least of which being admitted, would
bring contempt on that Honorable House: and should they give and take away, or
not prosecute what they had given, few men would hereafter regard their Gifts
or Orders.

Fifthly, the said Order was granted at the beginning of this War, and when the
favor thereby vouchsafed (for few such Orders were afterward obtained) was in
probability, that well-affected men might be thereby encouraged to contribute
their assistance the more cheerfully, and the more bountifully to the
Parliament. And, if now, when their necessities are once supplied, and the
public secured (by those willing-once, so far as their estates would extend,
who bore the first brunt of the war) the promises made them should be
forgotten, or the Orders granted for their relief rendered in valid, without
any demerit or cause shown; it will prove an injutie of dangerous consequence,
and lose the State tentimes more, then that little which would be saved thereby
could ever recompense; especially when the wrong shall fall upon a man who is
able to make his oppressions appear to the world, and whose good affection to
his Country is so well known to the whole Kingdom, as the said Majors: and
who can tell what extreme wants, joined with unsufferable inju^e and neglec^,
long complained of, without remedy or regard, may tempt him unto?

Sixthly, the said Major ought in equity to be repaired according to the said
Order, because his thankfulness for the same, and his confidence in the
Public Faith, made him neglect the execution of the said Order, when it might
have been most for his advantage, rather than he would desert the public
service for his private benefit, when the Commonwealth was in danger, although
that neglect endangered the leaving of his children without means of breeding,
and exposed his wife and family to, extreme wants upon uncertain hopes: for,
on the continuance of his life all their maintenance then subsisted. Besides
this, he has forborne his own pay ever since the beginning of this war;
disbursed to his Soldiers above five hundred pounds out of the remains of his
plundered estate, to keep them from dis-banding; and paid all contributions and
taxes to both Kingdoms, without repining, even out of that money which he
borrowed, and pays interest for, to maintain his Family; because he would
not discourage others; and because he thought too much to be adventured in this
quarrel.

Seventhly, it appears reasonable, that the said Order should be made
effectual to the said Major Wither, in regard he has no way abused the favor
vouchsafed, by acting greedily or rigorously; for, it will appear upon
examination; that he executed the same moderately and modestly, with more
sense of compassion toward others, than of his own necessities; never taking
any thing by virtue of the said Order, till extreme wants pinched him, or his:
In so much, that (though malice and malignancie have suggested the contrary)
he is yet so far from recovering any part of his principal damages sustained
by plunder (his hindrance considered in the loss of the interest thereof, out
of which his subsistence should arise) that he is at this day worse by some
hundreds of pounds, than at his first plundring, though his yearly expenses are
far short of what they formerly were. And if his kind Creditours continue not
their forbearance, he who was never heretofore so engaged, may be a prisoner to
morrow, without adventuring into the Kings quarters; yea, and though they
should for ever forbear him, his children will grow barbarous for want of
means to educate them, and be exposed to hunger and nakedresse; if his arreares
be not speedily paid, or if his faithfulness, engagements, and sufferings, be
not better considered and recompensed (than they have hitherto been) by some
other timely supply.

Eighthly, whereas some have sought to enervate the said Order, by the Ordinance
for Sequestrations, because it came forth after the said Order was granted to
Major Wither, and before it was fully executed, the said Major having, by that
means, received much detriment to the frustrating of the favor graciously
intended to him by the Commons, humbly conceives it to be reasonable (the
said Order neither being unduly executed, nor expressly repealed, nor the just
end accomplished, for which it was granted.) that it should be continued,
effectual to that end for which it was granted; especially, when, by
possession or seizure, and equitable property or interest, in the goods or
estate of a Delinquent, is transferred from the said Delinquent, to one to whom
the whole Parliament is engaged: and perhaps, it would ill become the
honorable Commons of England, to permit their own just grant, and favor to be
eluded, for want of a circumstantiall Proviso in an Ordinance, wherein nothing
was intended prejudicial thereto.

Ninthly, the said Order may be justified without damage to the Public,
because, it the said Major Wither has, or shall transgress in executing the
same; there are Committees of Account for the whole Kingdom in general, and
for most Counties in particular, by whom his mis-user thereof may be
discovered; and there is at this present owing to the said Major, from the
State for his (...) and (...) due by Account made upon Debenters, with Orders
for the payment thereof, (besides what is due for the quarters, and pay of his
Soldiers) ^bove three thousand pounds, out of which the Commonwealth may be
secured.

Lastly, the gracious favor intended by the said Order is the rather to be
confirmed to the said Major, because, though he has suffered many wants,
molestations, and unjust affronts in the Parliaments service, he nevertheless,
continues constant in his dependence thereon, and in his affection thereto.
And if the said Order had been, or might be as advantageous to him, as they who
envy that favor have supposed; yet, he conceives it need, not be repented
of, as an over large proportion of grace, considering how rich many other men
are become by safe and easy employments, who have neither contributed, nor
acted, nor adventured, nor suffered any thing so considerable (if any thing at
all) for the common safety. Moreover, the said Major Wither, has not lived
heretofore, nor desires to live hereafter, to himself only, upon that which
has been, or shall be restored unto him: For he has ever since this war,
spent his money and his time, according to his abilities and the occasions
offered, without any charge to the State, (except now and then a dinner) in
serving diligently, and in discharging faith fully the Public Trust at his
own cost in the Commission of the Peace, and in almost all the Committees of
Surrey since his military employment ceased; until they who found him,
unusefull for their designs, caused him to be left out of some of those
Committees: yea, and since he and they who stood in the (...) the first shock
of tyranny, were justled out of employment, he has found (...), and put
himself to cost, in those public services, which (perhaps) the next age will
think considerable, though this does not.

Reasons why the composition with Captain Edw. Andrews at Goldsmiths Hall
should not be confirmed unto him by an Ordinance.
FIrst, the said composition was surreptitiously gotten, and before the nature
of the said (...) his Delinquencie, or the value of his estate was made known
to the said Committee, by which means the sum compounded for, was not a
fourth part of the yearly values?

Secondly, it is probable that the said Andrews came not our of the Kings
(...) purpose to compound: but, rather to betray Major Geo. Wither unto the
Kings forces at Reading, or Basing; for, there was a voluntary confession of
such a design, confirmed on oath, by one who should have assisted therein; but
Basing being beleaguered, and Reading deserted when Andrews came thither, he
thought it (as it seems) his best course to pretend a submission. And that he
did not at first really intend the same, appears by his promising to a
Country (...) his, whom he thought to be of his mind, that as soon as he had
compounded for his estate in Surdie, and disposed thereof, he would return
into the Kings Quarters, where his family and the rest of his estate, then was.

Thirdly, because the said Andrews not only raised a Company of Dragoons
against the Parliament voluntarily, and without Commission (as is informed) but
after the said Dragoons were taken by Sir William Waller, acted violently,
also, against the well affected in Herefordshire, and particularly broke up and
ransaked the house of Sir Edw. Powel, in a felonious manner, without Warrant or
Commission, having only one Russian-like fellow in his Company, who with a
drawn sword put the housekeeper in fear of his life, as appears upon oath.

Fourthly, before the said Composition was allowed or reported, the said
Andrews did by color thereof, dis-possesse the said Major Wither of a Farm in
Surrey, which being a part of the personal estate of the said Andrews, the
said Major had formerly by virtue of an Order of the House of Commons seized,
valued, and possessed, for the Delinquencie of the said Andrews, who had
forfeited his estate therein by taking up arms against the Parliament, and by
not returning to his obedience before the set Day, according to an Ordinance.
In contempt of which Order, the said Captain Andrews brought, or sent to the
said Farm, soldiers and others about midnight, who, assaulting the house with
threatenings to kill those that were within it, if they opened not the door,
shot three musket bullets against the said door, one of which bullets broke it
open, and carried the lock thereof against the breast of the said Majors
servant, to the indangering of his life: and, he being all alone in the house,
the Ryotours broke in upon him, demanding in a hostile manner, if he would have
quarter, and seized upon the goods in the house belonging to the said Major,
which he keeps from him ever since, with his corn, then growing upon the
ground: and the said Major has waited now almost twelve months without remedy
or hearing; which, considering how well the said Major Wither, and how ill the
said Andrews has deserved of the State, renders his insolences (as is humbly
conceived) too many and too great, to make him capable of an Ordinance for his
Composition.

Fifthly, the said Andrews having before his time, and without order, forcibly
and ryotously entered the Farm as aforesaid, and unlawfully taken to himself
almost as much of the said Major Withers own goods, as would discharge the
value of his Delinquencie, did immediately also, and before his composition was
reported to the House of Commons (or before he had any possession lawfully
given unto him) fell down the woods, and take the profits of the said Farm,
to a greater value than his whole composition amounted unto, which makes it the
more unreasonable.

Sixthly, Andrews his composition (at least for that part of his personal
estate, which was seized by Major Wither) ought not to be confirmed to the said
Andrews by an Ordinance, because the said Andrews not coming in before the
time limited in the Ordinance of Grace; and the said Major having possessed
that part of the said Andrews estate, immediately after the said, time
limited, and before the Ordinance of Sequestration came forth, (by no worse
authority than by an Order of the House of Commons, grounded on a Declaration
of both Kingdoms, for a just relief of damages sustained in the general
Cause) it would seem very unreasoanble, that without cause or hearing, the
said Major should be dis-possessed thereof, and concluded against by an
Ordinance of Parliament, he having petitioned and waited almost twelve months
for the prevention thereof. And it will not be disgraceful and injurious to
the said Major Wither only, if he should be thus affronted without remedy, but
dishonorable to the House of Commons, that their Order should be slighted,
and their gift taken from their friend, and conferred on their enemy, who (as
is reported) could not forbear since his composition, to let fall words
manifesting a continuing disaffection to the State.

Lastly, if the said composition should be confirmed to the said Andrews, for
so small a value, to the damage and disparagement of the said Major; the said
Andrews having voluntarily armed himself, and acted against the Parliament,
so long as he had power or repute in the Kings quarters: If after he has (in
probability) done more spoil, and committed more outrages than an hundred
times his estate, and twice so many lives as his can make recompense for; yea,
if he, who is rather mischeevous than serviceable to us, now he is come in,
shall after he has murdered and robbed the Parliaments friends, be permitted
(even during the war which he has fomented, and in our quarters) to enjoy his
estate peaceably, to the despitefull dispossessing of him, both of his
habitation and maintenance, who has, adventured his life, lost his estate, and
many other ways continued an unwearied zeal to that Public Safety, which,
such Traitors as the said Andrews, has sought to destroy; it is feared the
injury will be more than can be well borne, and such, as will redound not only
to the dishonor of the House of Commons, but of the whole Parliament and
Kingdom; for which the said Major should be veris sorry.

THus having reasoned; whether he
An Independent seems to be,
Or Presbyterian-Friend;
Let not the difference Wrong the Cause;
For whilst our Factions give us Laws,
Our plagues will never end.
Where Truth and Love together side,
Men will debate; (...), not divide:
But, where Selfe-seekings reign:
And, where Opinion sway does bears,
Confusions in their Counsels are,
And Reason speaks in vain.
GEO. WITHER.
