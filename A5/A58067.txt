Oxford May the 20, 1649.
THis morning as the General was going to the Church Capt. Moody brought a
Letter from Col. Reynolds, who was s^nt in pursuit after Thompson, wherein it
was signified that Major Butler being sent with a select party of horse to fall
into Thompsons quarters, he being gone from Northampton to a Town near
Wellingborough toward Rutlandshire, where he surprised all his party in the
Town, but Thomson mounted and got into a wood, where they found Thomson well
mounted, who being alone, yet rid up to our party desperately, shot the Cornet,
wounded another and retreated to his Bush, having also received two shots, when
they began again to draw near unto him, he charged again with his Pistol
and Tuck, Received another shot and retreated the third time that he came up,
for he said he scorned to take Quarter; Major Butlers Corporal had Reynolds
his Carbine, which being charged with seven Bullets gave Thomson his Deaths
wound. The Lieutenant of Oxfordshire troop, who joined with Thomson is
likewise taken, it seems he seized of the Magazine of Northampton, and the
Excize money, and with thirteen men kept that walled Town in awe, a Town of
blew Character.

Yesterday the General, Lieutenant General and other Officers were very nobly
entertained in Maudlin College at a great Feast, and afterward took their
degrees in the Schools, receiving great respects from the Vice Chancellor; the
heads of the Colleges, and the rest of the University,

Your most humble Servant, J. R.
