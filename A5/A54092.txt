Penitential Cries.
I. The Sinner's Self-Reflection.
I.
AH Lord, ah Lord, what have I done?
What will become of me?
What shall I say, what shall I do?
Or whither shall I flee?
By wandering I have lost my self.
And here I Will make my moan,
O whither whither have I strayed,
Ah Lord what have I done?
II.
Thy Candle searches all my Rooms
And now I plainly see,
The numerous Sins of Earth and Hell
Are summed up in me.
The Seeds of all the Ills that grow
Are in my Garden sown,
And multitudes of them are sprung,
Ah Lord what have I done?
III.
I have been Satan's willing slave,
And his most easy prey,
He was not readier to command,
Than I was to Obey;
Or if at times he left my Soul,
Yet still his Work went on,
I was a Tempter to my self;
Ah Lord what have I done?
IV.
I puffed at all the threats of Heaven,
And slighted all its charms,
Nor Satan's Fetters would I leave,
For Christ's inviting Arms:
I had a Soul but prized it not,
And now my Soul is gone.
My forced Cries do pierce the Skies,
Ah Lord what have I done?
II. The Sinner's Remorse, as the 25 Psalm.
I.
LORD thou have overcome,
I Have got my deadly wound,
And he that Kicks against the Pricks;
Will soon himself confound;
My Sins those venomous Darts,
Which Heaven-wards I did throw,
Are now my Rack, being driven back
By mine Almighty Foe.
II.
My Sins have found me out,
And at my door they lie;
And there they stay both night and day,
And there I hear them cry;
In vain my Friends attempt
To cure my miseries,
What they propound to me is drowned
In sins loud roaring cries.
III.
In vain are all the Tears
Of them that stand without,
My Dart's within, it is my sin,
They cannot pull it out;
My Heart is all one wound,
My breath repeated sighs,
My Bread is tears, my life is fears,
My Language Groans and Cries.
IV.
What are Heavens lights to him
Who in the Dungeon lies,
Not one thin Ray, or piece of day
Does cheer my clouded eyes;
Sins match enkindles Hell,
Sin makes the Damned Roar,
This I have heard without regard,
But never knew before.
III. The Sinners Fears.
I.
ALas! for I have seen the Lord,
With a drawn Sword he stood,
Now might he sheath it in my flesh,
And bathe it in my blood;
I Have dared him with my mighty sins,
As if we was too slow,
But now he comes both armed and girt,
As an enraged Foe.
II.
What shall a guilty Sinner do?
When Justice does appear,
Or whither shall I flee from him,
Whose place is every where?
As I can neither stand nor fly,
So neither can I bear,
That mighty hand which Grinds the Rocks,
And does foundations tear.
III.
My pale, my poor, my trembling Soul
Does start at every thing,
It hourly fears huge Hosts of wrath
From this incensed King;
Should he but his Commissions grant
All Creatures would engage
Against me as their Common foe,
With an united rage.
IV.
I have such Monsters in my soul,
As do portend and tell,
As Devils here with me have dwelt
So I with them must dwell;
They have my wretched Soul possessed,
They hold it in their chains,
I fear least they should drag it down
To suffer endless pains.
V.
My fears are just, I Have deserved Hell,
And'tis my proper hire,
But who can dwell, O who can dwell
With everlasting Fire?
IV. The Sinner's Shame or Confusion.
I.
SO foolish, so absurd am I,
That nothing can be more;
Was ever such a Monster seen
Upon the Earth before?
I dare not look upon the Earth,
The witness of my Sin;
My conscience is a Doomsday Book*
I dare not look within.
II.
Upwards I durst not cast mine Eyes,
For there my Judge does sit:
Nor downwards whence the smoke does rise,
From the Infernal Pit;
How shall I answer at the Bar,
Of him, who is most pure?
I cannot answer for my self;
My self I cannot endure.
III.
And as my self I cannot endure,
My self I cannot fly;
Thus Fools do sell themselves for Slaves,
And what a Slave am I?
My Heart the seat of folly is,
My Life a Life of Sin,
Surely I am more brutish far,
Than ever Brute has been.
IV.
Is this my wit, is this my way?
To make a glorious name?
Is this the thanks I Have paid to Heaven,
Ah what a beast I am?
The Crown is fallen from my Head,
My Royal Robes are gone?
Confusion is my only Cloak,
And I must put it on.
V.
And whilst I blush, and whilst I bleed,
Here will I sit alone;
And here I Will lead the Lepers life,
And make my doleful moan:
I am not worthy of the Earth,
Not worthy of the Air,
Not worthy of one watery drop,
But of the Damneds fare.
VI.
O how it kills my heart to think
Upon my foolish ways!
Yet this I Will bear, and bless the Lord,
Because damnation stays.
V. The Sinner's Amazement, as the 25 Psalm.
I.
I Read that Sins are Clouds,
Whence Vengeance storms have fell,
But this is that, I wonder at,
That I am out of Hell.
Sure there are those in Hell,
Who never have deserved
In Hell to lie, so much as I,
And yet I am preserved.
II.
My sins have proudly scorned
My sins have boldly dared
The God of Might, with much despite,
And yet my Soul is spared.
The best and goodliest things,
Which did this World adorn,
By sin are rased, and quite defaced,
Yet still I am forborne.
III.
At our first Parents br^^ch,
Pale Death came rushing in,
The Angels fell from Heaven to Hell
Pressed with the weights of sin.
The Sodomites Cry prevailed,
Hell could no longer stay,
But lo there came a Sulfurous Flame
And met them by the way.
IV.
When Corah did Rebel,
Earth would not be his Slave,
To bear his weight, but opens straight,
And was his willing Grave.
When Israel did corrupt
The Air with murmuring breath,
It did rebound, and gave a wound,
And that was present Death.
V.
The whole Creation groans,
Sins Racks the World do fill,
It empties Rooms, to furnish Tombs,
Yet I am living still.
On the Lords hand I live,
And cannot but admire,
He does not shake so vile a Snake
Into Eternal Fire.
VI.
That Miracles are ceased,
Some confidently tell;
But I do know it is not so,
Whilst I am out of Hell.
VI. The Sinners Hope.
I.
WHO knows but such an one as I
May Grace and Mercy find?
I hear the God of Israel
Is merciful and kind,
Had he been pleased to torture me
With everlasting bands,
He might have done it long ago
Who had me in his hands.
II.
I do not hear the Trumpet sound,
To call me to his Bar,
The proofs and patterns of his Grace
Forbid me to despair.
Despair is such a sin of sins,
It cannot be forgiven;
Whilst other sins Hells ways do pave,
This Bars the Gates of Heaven.
III.
Cease then thy murmuring, O my Soul,
And silently attend;
To the sounding Bowels of a Christ,
Who is the Sinners Friend.
He does not say, Depart from me,
Into Eternal Fire;
But, Come into my open Breast,
Where weary Souls retire.
IV.
The trembling wretch, who touch this Hem,
But feared an heavy Doom;
Received a Cure, and Blessing too,
And went rejoicing home.
The Prodigal deserved, and fared
Worse than the Swine he fed;
But found a Mirthful Feast at home,
Who only looked for Bread.
V.
Heaven looked upon the Publican,
Who was bowed down with shame;
Mercy he called, which soon appeared,
And answered to its name.
My Sins are mighty sins indeed;
But I have understood;
Great sins are foils which do inhance
The Price of Saving Blood.
VI.
My Soul has many ghastly Wounds,
Yet will I not despair,
Whilst there is Balm in Gilead,
And a Physician there.
That I might march to Canaans Land,
The Silver Trumpet sounds,
My Day still shines, my Tent is fixed
Within Salvations bounds:
VI.
The Door is shut, but is not barred,
And he that is within,
Does bid me ask; and seek, and knock,
And strive to enter in:
Here then I Will ask, and seek, and knock,
Until the Door be open;
Nor will I stir a foot from hence;
It is a Door of Hope.
VII. The Sinner's Confession.
I.
WHO, who can number all the Stars,
Or Sands upon the Shore?
Thy Sins, thy Sins are multitudes,
My Soul, thy Sins are more.
Alas! I cannot bear the sight,
They do like Clouds arise;
The Sword of Justice will awake;
For they have reached the Skies.
II.
Most stubbornly I have rebelled,
And broke thy Law, O God;
How just is it, that such a wretch
Should feel thy Flaming Rod?
I bleed to think how I did slight
Thy Message from above;
How I despised thy Blood, O Christ,
And thy Redeeming Love?
III.
How often I did repeat my sin,
And ran upon the score,
Though Conscience loudly did dissuade;
And bad me sin no more.
How is it Lord thou do so long
This wretched Soul forbear?
When almost every thoughts's a sin,
My breath pollutes thy air.
IV.
Manasseh's sins were white to mine,
Mine bear a Crimson die;
Sure never any so provoked
The Lord of Hosts as I.
Ah how much viler than the Earth
By sin am I become?
A Sinner of polluted birth,
A Sinner in the Womb.
V.
Lord, whither, whither must I range
To count up my trangressions?
Give me thy pardon, in Exchange
Accept of my Confession.
VIII. The Sinners Retreat.
I.
FArewell, vain world, I bid adieu;
Thou can not fill but cloy:
Thy Throne, O God, does send forth new,
And more refined joy.
Mere Vanity does Man pursue
With eagerness and heat;
The bravest things the World can show
Are but a perfect cheat:
II.
Who gain the riches of the Earth,
Gain but a finer dross,
Who gain a World, and lose a Soul,
Sustain the greatest loss.
The blast of honor sounds aloud,
Yet that is but empty air,
Which quickly passes through the Crowd:
And does no more appear.
III.
Alas there is nothing here that can
True blessedness afford;
Ye painted shadows, get you gone,
Ye hold me from my Lord;
He Is blessed indeed who loves God,
Whose undefiled mind
Can scorn such poor delights, and can
In Jesus better find.
IV.
O happy they who only love
Their God, and him admire!
That I may taste your purer joys,
I Will from the World retire.
I Will make it my ambition now,
To be beloved of God:
Sinners, in time, in time, return,
Before you feel his Rod.
IX. The Sinner's Resolves.
I.
THIS empty World has now too long
Deceived me with lies,
I am resolved to be gone;
Deluded Soul, arise.
Go fly to Christ without delay,
Engage him for thy Friend,
Such men are blessed in their way,
And blessed in their end.
II.
What have I more to do with sin?
Ye flattering sweets be gone;
The time and place'twas acted in,
Are sad to think upon.
My vain companions I Will forsake,
Them from their ways withdraw,
I Will read a Lecture that shall make
Those frozen hearts to thaw.
III.
My sins will I no more repeat,
Nor finish that begun,
My Summons to the Judgment Seat
May come before it is done.
I will not with my Finger once
Touch my beloved Sin.
Who knows its latter end? you know
But where it did begin.
IV.
The snares of Satan lie so low,
And are so smoothly placed;
I Will softly tread where e're I go,
And never act in haste.
The word and Spirit I Will obey,
And think if God say so,
It is enough, I Will never stay,
To see what others do.
V.
I Will dedicate my self to God
And his alone will be,
I triumph I am in the road
To true felicity.
Lord, all is spread before thy face,
My Soul resolves upon;
My Soul commits it to thy Grace,
O leave it not alone!
X. The Sinners Cry for pardon.
I.
GReat God, thou art a God of Grace,
Who pardons have in store;
O do not turn away thy face
From me, tho I am poor.
I do deserve the hottest plagues
Of an incensed God;
To drink the Vials of his wrath,
To feel the damneds rod.
II.
But turn away thy wrath from me,
Now turning at thy call;
O why should thou exalt thy self
In thy poor Creatures fall?
I might be cast into thy Jail,
There lie for evermore;
But Lord, thy patience did give Bail,
Thy Christ did pay the score.
III.
Mercy, good Lord, Mercy I ask,
This is the Total Sum,
For Mercy, Lord is all my suit,
Lord, let thy mercy come.
Lord, if thou will my sins forgive,
Wilt not in wrath destroy;
'Twill add new comforts to thy Saints,
Fresh triumphs to their joy.
IV.
This will encourage Sinners, Lord,
To turn and seek thy face;
When they shall hear the worst of them
Has now obtained thy Grace.
My Sins are Mountains, tho they be,
These Mountains cannot stand.
What are those Mountains to my Christ?
They fly at thy command.
V.
My Sins indeed are numberless,
are not thy Mercies so?
This did thy pardoned ones profess,
They bad me to thee go.
Tho they be numerous and great,
I Am in Salvation's Road;
They cannot pass the blood of Christ;
Which is the blood of God.
VI.
Where Sin abounds, thy Word does say,
Grace has abounded more;
This is, and shall be still my plea;
Whilst thou have Grace in store.
Mercy, good Lord, Mercy, I ask;
This is the total sum,
For mercy; Lord, is all my suit,
Lord let thy Mercy come.
XI. The Sinner's Address to Christ.
I.
WHere lies a Sin, I Will drop a tear,
Then view Redeeming blood,
To mourning Souls Christ will appear,
And surely do them good.
It Is thou alone, my Lord, can give
This asking heart relief*
Christ's gentle voice would make it live,
His hand wipe off my grief.
II.
Those falsely called the sweets of Sin,
Are bitter unto me;
I loath the state that I am in,
Lord, may I come to thee?
But O will thou receive him now
That Is coming to thy door?
For I can bring no dowry, Lord,
I come extremely poor.
III.
What if my tears could make a flood,
My rightcousness is dross,
Those tears need washing in thy blood,
Though wept upon the Cross.
I have an Argument to plead
Which thou can not deny,
Thy Grace is free, and thou do give
To Sinners, such as I.
IV.
Thou do invite all wandering Souls,
And I am one of those,
With thee the sick do find a Cure,
The weary find repose.
The world and Sin will ever vex,
Will trouble and molest,
I therefore trust my Soul with Christ
To bring to Heavens rest.
XII. The Sinners Reception.
I.
WHilst others costly Offerings bring
Unto my Lord most dear,
To him a Song of Praise I Will sing,
And sacrifice a Tear.
This is my choicest gift, I have
No better to impart;
When thou receiv'dst me first; then I
Did offer up mine heart.
II.
I am the Prodigal returned,
And met upon a plain,
And thou the loving Father, that
Invit'st me home again.
Thou did invite, and bring me home,
My study now shall be
To furnish and prepare a Room,
Where Christ may dwell with me.
III.
O cleanse my Soul and make it white,
Adorn it with thy Grace,
To dwell with me do thou delight,
And never hide thy face.
Who can but love so dear a Lord!
I Will make a daily feast,
The daily exercise of Grace
Shall entertain my Christ.
IV.
I love thee, Lord; and thou do know
How I adore thy name;
Surely, my God, I would do so,
Would wear a loving frame.
With thankfulness I will record
Thy kindness all my days,
I Will live upon and to the Lord:
And breath a constant praise.
XIII. The Sinner's admiration of Divine Mercy, as the 148 Psalm.
I.
TO praise Redeeming Love,
Dear Christians, lend a voice,
Come thou Diviner Dove,
And help me to rejoice;
My heart too low,
Lord thou can raise:
Best Spirit blow,
And I shall praise.
II.
Here Lord will I admire
The wonders of thy Grace
Till thou shall call me higher,
There to behold thy face:
O Height of Grace!
O Depth of Love!
Now fit me for
My place above.
III.
Hell was my proper hire,
For I was Satan's Slave,
Fit Fuel for that Fire,
But God delights to save:
God often called:
I would not come:
He called until
He brought me home.
IV.
Dejected Souls may not
Acceptance with him fear;
No sigh was ever forgot;
He Bottles every Tear.
Do not despair,
Because you see,
How kind the Lord
Has been to me.
V.
My Sins were very high,
My Soul almost in Hell,
Yet Mercy then drew nigh,
And caught me as I fell.
Bless God, my Soul,
Even unto death;
And write a Song
For every Breath.
VI.
Who can this Love express?
His Mercy never decays,
What can my Soul do less,
Than love him all my days?
Bless God, my Soul,
Even unto Death,
And write a Song
For every Breath.
XIV. The Sinners Thirst after more Grace.
I.
IBless my God for giving Grace,
Will thou increase my store?
And as my Graces do increase,
Thy Praises shall be more,
This barren Soil will never bear,
Or else bear nothing good;
Unless thou water with thy Care,
And moisten with thy Blood.
II.
Be thou to me, as thou have been
Unto thine Israel,
A Dew to keep my branches green,
To make my blossoms smell.
I daily thirst, I sigh, I groan,
For greater growth in Grace;
O spread each sigh before thy Throne,
Before thy brighter Face.
III.
Increase the Grace that thou have wrought,
So kindly, freely given,
Lord cherish it, till thou have brought
Me up the Stairs to Heaven.
This thirsty Soul must still repeat
Its earnest Suit again.
I am thy Garden, and entreat
Thy Garden may have Rain.
XV. For Spiritual Protection.
I.
I Have an Host of Enemies,
Are ever breaking in,
Satan, the World, the Flesh devise
To ruin me by Sin.
I trust to God, as my defense,
Against her subtilties;
From all destructive baits of sense,
Will thou restrain mine Eyes?
II.
Tho'ye combine against my Soul,
I make the Lord my Guard,
Who will your fiery Breath control,
Who will be my Reer-ward.
Whenever dangers near approach,
Lord be at hand to me,
And bring my Soul by each assault,
The nearer unto thee.
III.
O keep from Sin, which brings a frown,
Be gracious at my Cry:
Let no Temptations cast them down,
That on thy Grace rely.
Why should that frame set up within,
Which thine own hand did raise?
Be ever broke or slurr'd by Sin,
Why should thou lose thy praise?
IV.
Even as thy care, thy hand is large,
And fills each empty space;
Remember that I am thy charge;
This day consult my case.
My Soul, my Frame, I will commit
To thee, O Holy Ghost!
Thou art my Guardian, and I trust,
Thy work shall not be lost.
XVI. Lamenting the loss of first Love.
I.
O That my Soul was now as fair,
As it has sometimes been,
Devoid of that distracting care
Without and guilt within.
There was a time, when I could tread
No Circle but of Love;
That joyous Morning now is fled;
How heavily I move?
II.
Unhappy Soul, that thou should force
Thy Savior to depart,
When he was pleased with so course
A Lodging in thy Heart.
How sweetly I enjoyed my God?
With how Divine a srame,
I thought on every Plant I trod,
I read my Savior's Name!
III.
I lived, I loved, I talked with thee,
So sweetly we agreed,
And thou no stranger wast to me,
Till I became a weed.
The Tempter robbed me, and I must,
I fear, be ever poor;
May this suffice to roll in the dust,
Before thy Temple Door?
IV.
My dearest Lord, my Heart flames not
With Love, that Sacred Fire,
But since my Love has wore that blot,
Repentance runs the higher.
O might those days return again,
How welcome they should be!
Shall my Petition be in vain,
Since Grace is ever free.
V.
Lord of my Soul, return, return,
To chase away this Night,
Let not thine anger ever burn;
God once was my delight.
XVII. The Conflict.
I.
O What a War is in my Soul,
Which fain would be devout!
I am most weary with the Fight,
But may not yet give out.
The Flesh and Spirit, both contend
For this weak Soul of mine,
That ost I know not what to do,
But, Lord, I would be thine.
II.
I would believe, but unbelief
Prevails the other way;
And I have constant cause of grief,
A longer night than day.
I cry to God, those Cries declare,
Whose part my Soul does take,
Accepts my poor desires, whilst I
Do this resistance make.
III.
My Evidences should be clear,
But ah the blots of Sin!
Turn chearing hope to sadning fear,
And make black doubts within.
The Laws of Sin, and Grace will jar,
Both dwelling in one room,
The Saints expect perpetual War,
Till ye are sent for home.
IV.
Although these Combats make you fear,
They should not cast you down,
God will give Grace to hold out here,
And Glory for its Crown.
XVIII. The Back-sliders Return.
I.
THOUGH I am fallen from my God,
I Will venture to draw nigh;
His Word assures me, he would not
Have any Sinner die.
Sinners may hope to see God's Face,
Though fallen never so low;
If they go to the Throne of Grace,
And weeping, as they go.
II.
Who shames himself before him there,
His Sin shall be forgot;
If Sinners blush, when they confess,
That blushing hides their spot.
Ah Lord! I am ashamed to come,
Ashamed with thee to meet,
I dare not look, but down I fall
At thy most blessed Feet.
III.
Did ever any thus before,
Thus basely wrong thy Grace?
Sure I Am more vile than any one
Of wretch Adam's Race.
Here comes a Prodigal, Lord, hear,
And answer at his Call,
I beg for Jesus sake, that thou
Remember not my Fall.
IV.
Nothing I plead on my behalf,
But yet thou know well,
Bright Saints in Heaven were once black Brands
Snatched from a burning Hell.
The Blood of Bulls thou ask not,
A Penitential groan
Shall be accepted, this I bring,
And offer at thy Throne.
XIX. The Sinner's Morning Prayer; as the 100 Psalm.
I.
GOd who once more unsealed mine eyes,
Shall have my choicest Sacrifice,
My highest thanks I humbly pay,
For Mercies running night and day.
II.
O Lord, thy Pardon I implore,
And Grace, that I offend no more,
O let thy goodness never cease;
Renew thy Covenant of Peace.
III.
As thou renewest still my days,
With new endearments crown my ways;
Father, with me this day abide;
Be thou my leader and my guide,
IV.
That I may plainly see and know,
The very Path where I should go;
And may at night rejoicing, say,
My God was kind to me this day.
V.
Those Graces that I want supply,
And keep me with a tender Eye;
Let my corruptions more and more,
Lose of the ground they had before.
VI.
By Faith, dear Savior, I would live,
And like the fruitful Lily thrive:
The fruitful Christian honors God,
And shows his Pastures to be good.
VII.
Give me my claim to Heaven clear,
Thy constant Grace to persevere:
Whilst here on Earth be thou my Guard,
And at the last my great Reward.
XX. The Sinner's Evening Prayer; as the 100 Psalm.
I.
O Lord, behold a wretched one,
That flings himself before thy Throne,
By practice sinful, and by birth,
Lord, viler, viler than the Earth.
II.
O let thy Christ my Jesus be,
To save from Sin and misery!
My Soul, beneath thy feet I lay,
Entreating Pardon for this day.
III.
God made his World, and brought me in,
And I brought mine, my World of Sin;
Behold those sins not as a Spy,
To mark, or as a Judge, to try.
IV.
But as Physician to the Poor,
Who brings a Balsam for the Sore:
Absolve, renew me by thy Grace;
Fit me for Death which comes apace.
V.
Encircle me within thine Arm,
My Body to defend from harm;
Preserve my wandering Soul from Sin,
Both going out, and coming in.
VI.
Keep far from me a careless heart.
From which my Savior would depart:
O bless and prosper all my ways,
That they may issue in thy Praise.
XXI. Cry for Improvement of Talents.
I.
I Am a Tree that God has set,
Which he expects should grow:
We must allow that Hand to reap,
Which was at cost to sow.
II.
If thou expectest from my Flock,
Or from my Tillage Bread.
Then help me to improve my Stock;
Let not thy Grace lie dead,
II.
Those Talents that the Masters send,
The Servants must improve,
Thine Aid, O my great Master! send
To help me from above.
Since thou did buy me, when a Slave,
Shall I not now be true?
I Will use the power that I have,
Dear Saints, for God and you.
III.
With Riches give a liberal Heart,
That so I may restore
Again, and pay thy Tithes unto
Thy Deputy the Poor.
That honor thou do shine on me,
Shall honor thee always;
My lesser Talents join to pay
Their Tribute to thy Praise.
IV.
Whatever is mine, it first was thine,
And thine shall ever be;
All my Enjoyments shall combine
To raise, and honor thee.
My parts, my time, my every thing,
Are wholly thine I own:
Accept the Music from each string
Presented at thy Throne.
XXII. A Cry before the Sacrament.
I.
TO day the Lord of Hosts invites
Unto a costly Feast;
O what a privilege is this,
To be the Almighties Guest!
II.
I am invited, I must go,
Lord help me to prepare,
That so I may be welcome, and
Partake of Childrens fare.
III.
All they that sit down with him must
Be decked with his Grace;
He smiles on such Communicants,
And they behold his Face.
IV.
But who, and what am I? O Lord!
Unholy and unmeet,
To come within thy doors, or to
Wash thy Disciples Feet!
V.
Come, holy Spirit, come and take
My filthy garments hence,
The guilt, the stain, the love of Sin,
Will give my Lord offense.
VI.
Remember not my sins, O Lord!
Which ever load my mind,
Thy Son did die, for such as I,
That I might Mercy find.
VII.
Worldly distractions stay behind,
Below the Mount abide,
Be no disturbance to my mind,
Nor make my Savior chide.
VIII.
Let nothing that is not Divine
Within thy presence move,
What e're would cause thee not to shine
In tokens of thy love.
IX.
Whilst thou do at thy Table sit,
Send out thy Spirit to breathe
Upon my Soul, to summon forth
My Graces from beneath.
X.
Awake Repentance, Faith, and Love,
Awake, O every Grace;
Come, come, attend this glorious King,
And bow before his Face.
XI.
O come, my Lord, the time draws nigh
That I am to receive,
Stand with my Pardon sealed by,
Persuade me to believe.
XII.
Let not my Jesus now be strange,
Nor hide himself from me;
O cause thy Face to shine upon
The Soul that longs for thee.
XIII.
O let our entertainment now
Be so exceeding sweet,
That we may long to come again,
And at thy Table meet.
XXIII. Under Desertion.
I.
MY Lord, My God, I once could sing,
But now I fear to say
My God, I only cry my King,
Of force I must obey.
I Have forfeited that blessed Guest,
That joy that sometimes shone,
Within this dark unhallowed breast;
O whither is it gone?
II.
In infinite compassion, Lord,
To my complaint give ear,
Whole troops of sorrow bear me down,
O when will thou appear?
Remember, Lord, what I am styled,
Though under darkness great,
Though under darkness, still thy child,
My heart is still thy seat.
III.
My King, thou do possess that Throne,
Thou do that Seepter sway,
It Is thine, it is purely thine alone,
I hate the sinners way.
Lord, when thou see me come to pray,
Bow down a gracious ear,
To answer me make no delay,
One darksome day's a year,
IV.
I know I am extremely vile,
Lo here is room for Grace,
Look therefore on me with a smile,
A reconciled face.
I will no more my Lord provoke,
Or cause thee to withdraw,
Thy former frowns have made me wise
To fear and stand in awe.
V.
My restless Soul will never give over,
Until thy Bowels move;
I Will not be driven from thy door,
'Till thou shall say I love.
XXIV. For the Success of the Gospel.
I.
AMong the Jews let every Tribe
Turn to their Ancient Lord,
All Glory to his Name ascribe,
With joy receive his word.
Let Jews, and Gentile world agree
Thy glorious Name to raise,
When they the path to Heaven see,
They come with Songs and Praise.
II.
O that the Lord would conquer those
That do resist his hand,
O cause that all thy Churches Foes
May yield to thy Command.
Thy Churches, Lord, beyond the Seas,
Are graven on our Hearts;
Shower down thy Grace on them and these,
Let neither lose their parts.
III.
Let those that seek thee not, be found,
Whilst the despisers fall,
And those that hear the Gospel sound,
May answer to its call.
Thy Saints complain that they are few,
They make too mean a Quire;
Let converts fall like Morning Dew,
Thy Praise will rise the higher.
IV.
In England give thy Gospel free
From a devised dress,
And let thy goodness which does shine
In H -- * -- never be less. -- Name your Town here.

Let those whom thou have known of old,
Be quickly called home,
Even all thy Sheep within this Fold,
Compel them Lord to come,
V.
Build up thine own, who wait till thou
Do their corruptions kill;
Breathe on our Souls, advance our Grace,
Lord, higher, higher still.
Our Pastor whom thou do appoint,
To keep our Vineyard, bless,
With saving Grace, thy sweetest smiles,
And with a fair success.
VI.
Of thy sweet presence grant us more:
Much more our Souls desire;
Until we sing on Sions Hill,
With that Seraphick Quire.
XXV. For a soft Heart.
I.
THat Heart is Harder than a Stone,
That rises up to play,
And never with sorrow thinks upon
The Sins of Yesterday.
The last nights failures well might make,
If they were duly scanned,
Each Rock, each Sinners Heart to ache,
For Saints are daily tanned.
II.
Ah Lord! do thou not see my heart!
Alas! how little Love!
I pray thee do not lose thy part,
Drop softness from above.
O keep it tender! keep it soft,
That I may know to raise,
And quickly set the lowest string,
Unto a Tune of Praise.
III.
Thy People do lament and cry,
Their Sins have made them groan;
Give me their frames, then so shall I,
Lord roll away this Stone.
If thou withold a little space,
Withold not very long;
Send down the melting Dews of Grace,
I Will send thee up a Song.
IV.
Make my heart softer, softer still,
Me like thy mourning Dove,
I mourn because I cannot mourn,
But Lord thou know I love.
Make my heart softer, softer still;
That by thy gracious hand
A deep impression may be made
Even from the least Command.
XXVI. Against Unbelief.
I.
A Soul that is burdened with the weight
Of Sin that on him lies,
Must go to Golgotha, then ask
For whom that Savior dies.
Surely for Sinners, such as I,
That precious Blood was spilt,
Come, poor defiled Souls, O come,
And wash away your guilt.
II.
Christ's calls, arise, and do not fear,
Tho thou wast Satan's Slave,
Let this thy drooping spirit cheer,
His errant was to save.
Christ did appear to Magdalen,
When Blinded with her tears,
To lead on others to believe,
And cast away their fears.
III.
My Sins are grown so high, that they
Deserve a second flood,
Behold the Deluge, Christ is come;
To drown them in his blood.
My work is to believe on him,
By Faith his Blood apply,
When Faith takes out the fiery sting,
That Sinners shall not die.
IV.
Lord give me this believing heart
Advance it more and more,
Rebuke these doubts and scruples that
Are crowding at my door.
Lord, Satan says my Sins are high,
And spread before thy face;
Vast heighths indeed; but what are these
Unto the heighths of Grace?
XXVII. For Universal Obedience.
I.
LORD thou have planted me a Vine
In fertile soil and air,
Now tend and water me as thine,
Make me thy daily care.
My Christ I Am wholly thine, direct
Me wandering in the dark,
O may my constant aims be strait,
Thine honor be my mark.
II.
I have observed thy sacred Laws
To be exceeding wide,
Let me not from the least of them
Turn wilfully aside.
Lord let thy Word and Spirit guide
Thy Servant in thy way,
May I walk closely with my God
And run no more astray.
III.
Shall Simon bear thy Cross alone
And other Saints be free?
Each Saint of thine shall find his own
And there is one for me.
When e're it falls unto my lot
Let it not drive me from
My God, let me be never forgot
'Till thou have loved me home.
IV.
O happy Christians, be not loath
To have a coarser fear:
Saints that have had no Table cloth,
Had Christ at dinner there,
To do or suffer I am pleased,
So long as Christ stands by,
Support me with thy constant aid,
Lest all thy Graces die.
V.
The way is to the upright strength,
Lord make it so to me,
That never tiring with the length,
My Soul may reach to thee.
XXVIII. The Sinners Cry for Quickening Grace.
I.
THE Spouse sought her beloved one,
But sought him on her Bed,
Seldom such seekers speed with God.
Cold Prayers are counted dead.
How many Duties do I spoil,
How many Sins do I
Contract by this my drowsy frame,
Forgetting Christ is by?
II.
Thy Saints enjoy a lively Frame,
Run cheerfully to God,
Their Heavenly praises show the same
Whilst I Am a lifeless clod.
Ah Lord shall it be ever thus?
Have I no wings for thee?
It grieves me to go bowed down,
Whilst other Christians flee.
III.
None can remedy this but thou,
Drop down the Oil of Love,
My Soul then like Aminadab,
With swift delight will move.
O come to me with quickening Grace,
Remove this drowsy frame,
Then shall the fire of Love within,
Brake out into a flame.
IV.
Come, come to me, O come and set
My Soul upon the Wing,
When I upon the Mountain get,
I Will praise my heavenly King.
No more delays, O come, and blow,
Stir up thy grace begun;
When thou do breathe, thy Spices flow;
The work goes kindly on.
XXIX. For Communion with God.
I.
Alas my God, that we should be,
Such Strangers to each other,
O that as Friends we might agree,
And walk and talk together.
Thou know my Soul does dearly love
The place of thine abode,
No Music drops so sweet a sound,
As these two words, my God.
II.
I long not for the Fruit that grows
Within these Gardens here,
I find no sweetness in their Rose,
When Jesus is not near.
Thy gracious presence, O my Christ
Can make a Paradise;
Ah what are all the goodly Pearls
Unto this Pearl of Price;
III.
May I taste that Communion, Lord,
Thy People have with thee?
Thy Spirit daily talks with them,
O let it talk with me;
Like Enoch, let me walk with God,
And thus walk out my day,
Attended with the Heavenly Guards
Upon my Kings Highway.
IV.
When will thou come unto me Lord?
O come, my Lord most dear,
Come near, come nearer, nearer still,
I Am well when thou art near.
When will thou come unto me Lord?
I langnish for thy sight,
Ten thousand Suns if thou art strange
Are shades instead of light.
V.
When will thou come unto me, Lord?
For till thou do appear,
I count each moment for a day,
Each minute for a year.
Come Lord, and never from me go,
This World's a darksome place,
I find no pleasure here below,
When thou do veil thy Face.
VI.
There Is no such thing as pleasure here,
My Jesus is my all,
As thou do shine or disappear,
My pleasures rise or fall.
Come, spread thy savor on my frame,
No sweetness is so sweet;
Till I get up to sing thy name,
Where all thy Singers meet.
XXX. On the Lord's Day. As the 100 Psalm.
I.
THou spreadst a weekly Table, Lord,
Where Souls may Banquet on thy Word:
Whilst means in plenty we enjoy,
Let not our Souls be parched and dry.
II.
We wait here at Bethesda's Pool,
Those Waters which refresh and cool,
We wait whose Souls are scorcht with sin,
O come, dear Savior, help us in.
III.
Thy Power and thy Grace display,
Be thou amongst us on thy day,
That Sinners may observe thy call,
And numerous Converts to thee fall,
IV.
That those who do thy footsteps trace,
May find all sweetness in thy Grace,
O may they never more complain
That they have sought their God in vain.
V.
Thy people at thy Footstool lie,
Behold us with a gracious Eye,
O let our Souls with Jesus meet;
Our fellowship with him be sweet.
VI.
Among thy people here am I,
Lord let me not be passed by,
Let this poor Soul with Triumph say,
I Have seen my dearest Lord to day.
VII.
I sit within thy Temple shade,
O let thy presence make me glad,
Love me, my Lord, or else I die,
Thy love alone can satisfy.
XXXI. Of Death.
I.
DEath steals upon us unawares,
And Digs a Grave unseen,
Whilst we dispute, are full of Cares,
What may be, what has been;
Shall I be bent on vanity?
And rotteness to trust,
Till Death shall lay his hand on me,
And crumble me to dust?
II.
What if my Sun should set at Noon,
If Death should call to day?
Can thou, my Soul, go off so soon,
Have thou no scores to pay?
Behold my Sands, how quick they fall,
How near I am my Goal,
Let not my Body be undrest,
Till thou have dressed my Soul.
Let not my Body be undressed,
Till thou have dressed my Soul.
III.
That at the Trumpet's Sound I may
Spring from my dusty Bed:
Rejoicing at the Voice that calls,
Arise, come forth, ye Dead.
Lord, give me Patience if I lie
Upon a Dying-Bed;
O let my Savior standing by,
Support my weary Head.
IV.
Support my weak and tottering Faith
Whilst dismal Fears annoy;
My Jesus, be my sweet Defense;
My Jesus, be my Joy.
Blessed Advocate, do thou not fail
At this Time to appear;
O let my shaken Faith prevail,
My Evidence be Clear.
V.
My Soul in thy sweet Hands I trust;
Now can I sweetly sleep,
My Body falling to the Dust,
I leave with thee to keep.
XXXVI. Psalm 63. 8. My Soul follows hard after thee.
I.
MY God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Mine All in All to me,
Will thou a gracious Father prove
To Souls that hang on thee?
II.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
For thee I thirst alone;
The sweetest Waters upon Earth,
My Soul accounts as none.
III.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Mine only, only Friend,
I seek, I long, I look for thee,
Why will thou not attend?
IV.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
O whither art thou gone?
Either be near, unto me here,
Or lift me to thy Throne.
V.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Can thou that Soul forsake,
That follows thee with restless Cries,
Longing to overtake?
VI.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Thy Child entreats thy stay.
Father, shall not thy Bowels move?
O turn, and look this Way.
VII.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Come, come, with me abide;
Rejoice me with thy Presence, Lord,
I know no Joy beside.
VIII.
My God, my God, my Light, my Love,
Hear thou my mournful Cry:
He hears, he hears me from above,
He will not see me die.
Psalm 86. Done by Mr. J. M.
I.
HEar, hear me, Lord, for I am Poor,
And seek Salvation at thy Door;
Bow down thy gentle Ear to me,
Who am oppres'd with Misery.
II.
Save me, my God, for I am thine,
Thy Touch has made my Heart Divine;
Save me, my God, to whom I flee,
Who have none other Gods but thee.
III.
Let Mercy come from God or High,
The Object of my daily Cry;
I daily knock, I daily wait,
For Mercy's Alms, at Mercy's Gate.
IV.
God of all Comfort, Give a Dole
Of Comfort to thy Servant's Soul:
For this my Soul does bend her Knee,
And stretch her craving Hands to thee.
V.
Thou, Lord, art Good, and thou do stand
With sealed Pardons in thy Hand;
Oh how the Dews of Mercy fall,
And answer at thy Peoples Call;
VI.
It never was writ, here lies One,
Died at the Foot of Mercy's Throne;
Lord, hearken to my humble Cries,
And let them found above the Skies.
PART II.
I.
I Have a God, to whom I may
Resort with Freedom any Day;
I Will seek him when I am in Pain,
I Am sure to here from him again.
II.
And when my Soul shall understand
The Comfort of his Curing Hand,
Then shall I sing, O happy Rod,
That brought me nearer to my God.
III.
What are those Gods whom Folly feigns,
Those Creatures of distempered Brains?
What are those Dunghill Gods before
The Mighty God whom I adore?
IV.
O King of Nations, Lord of All,
Before thee shall all Nations fall;
And every Language shall confess
Thy glorious Everlastingness.
V.
For thou art Great beyond Compare,
Thy Works amazing Wonders are;
To God alone all Glory be,
There is none other God but He.
VI.
Lord, guide me in thy secret Way,
With such a Guide I shall not stray;
Bring me into an Heavenly Frame,
Unite my Heart to fear thy Name.
VII.
My Lord, my God, my Heart shall Praise
And glorify thee all my Days;
Thy Mercy to me does excel,
I am a Brand snatched out of Hell.
PART III.
I.
THE Sons of Pride against me rise,
Fierce Atheists are mine Enemies;
They fear not God, they love not me,
My Comfort is their Misery.
II.
They mark me for their common Foe,
And jointly Plot my overthrow;
But thou, my Lord, do take my Part,
Thou, Lord, a God of Bowels art.
III.
Thou art most swist to Acts of Grace,
But unto Wrath of flowest Pace;
Thy Mercy and thy Truth abound,
This is Faith's everlasting Ground.
IV.
Whilst God is Merciful and True,
I am both Safe and Happy too;
I cannot fall, who lean upon
The Pillars of the highest Throne.
V.
O leave me not, who follow Thee,
Let Mercy look on Misery;
Save, Lord; for thee I do adore,
As did my Mother heretofore.
VI.
Save, Lord, one Born within thy House,
A Child of Prayers, and Tears, and Vows;
Mine Eyes expect some happy Sign,
To tell my Soul that thou art mine.
VII.
Me with Salvations Walls enclose,
To the Confusion of my Foes,
That they with blushing may confess,
We cannot Curse whom God does bless;
VIII.
We cannot catch, whom God will have;
We cannot hurt, whom God will save;
We cannot touch his smallest Limb;
We Curse our selves, in Cursing him.
