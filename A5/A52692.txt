The Grand Impostor EXAMINED: OR, The Life, Trial, and Examination OF JAMES
NAYLER, The Seduced and Seducing QUAKER WITH The Manner of his Riding into
BRISTOL.

JOH. 19. 7. We have a law, and by our law he ought to die; because he made
himself the Son of God.

JOH. 20. 31. But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his Name.

LONDON, Printed for Henry Brom, at the Hand in S. Paul's Churchyard. 1656.

To the READER
Courteous Reader,
I Do here give thee an account of what passed between James Nayler and his
Judges, as thinking it a part of my duty toward God and man; that thereby thou
may see and know there is but one only God, and one only Jesus, which is
the Christ, who was crucified by the Jews at Jerusalem: Which whosoever denies,
let him be accursed.

It has been the Custom in former Times, to Immure, Stone, or other ways
punish with Death such as did falsely style themselves the only Sons of the
most High God; As thou may see in that faithful Chronologer, John Speed; who
affirms, That in the Reign of King Henry the third, there appeared a Grand
Impostor somewhat in wickedness resembling this of whom we are to treat: This
man (or rather Devil) thinking himself to be somebody, boasted himself to be
nobody in the eyes of the World, but as being sent from Heaven; And having a
grave and impudent aspect, pretended himself to be no less then the Savior of
Mankind: And to strike a belief into the easily-seduced People, he had wounded
his hands, and feet, and side; Affirming these to be the wounds which the Jews
had given him at Jerusalem. For which blasphemous and horrid Doctrine, he was
sentenced to be starved to death between the walls of a strong Prison; Where he
and his Doctrine died: Even So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord.

Thou will in his Examination discover some Difference to be between him and
GEORGE FOX: but I suppose they are again reconciled.

I shall not trouble thee with all the many Letters which were conveyed from
him to others, or from them to him, lest I make my Relation swell too big: I
shall only give thee two or three of the chiefest; Out of which if thou can
pick but a little sense, and less Truth, thou can do more then

Thy loving Friend.
December 16. 1656.
James Naylors Examination.
READER,
THinking it a very good foundation to my building, to give you the manner of
his progress, before you come to his confession; or before his blasphemy
aspires to the stool of Repentance. I shall thus begin: James Naylor of
Wakefield in the County of York, a deluded and deluding Quaker and Imposter,
rode October last through a Village called Bedminster, about a mile from
Bristol, accompanied with six more, one whereof a young man, whose head was
bare, leading his horse by the bridle, and another uncovered before him,
thorough the durty way in which the Carts and Horses and none else usually go.
And with them two men on horseback with each of them a woman behind him, and
one woman walking on the better way or path. In this posture did they march,
and in such a case, that one Georse Witherley noting their condition, asked
them to come in the better rode, adding that God expected no such extremity:
but they continued on their way, not answering in any other notes, but what
were musical, singing Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath, etc. Thus
continued they, till by their wandering they came to the Almsehouse within the
Suburbs of Bristol, where one of the women alighted, and she with the other of
her own sex lovingly marched on each side of Naylor's Horse. This Witherley
says, he supposes they could not be less deep in the muddy way then to the
knees, and he says they sang, but sometimes with such a buzzing mel- ODIOVS
noise that he could not understand what it was. This the said Witherley gave in
upon his oath. Thus did they reach Ratcliff-gate, with Timothy Wedlock of Devon
bare-headed, and Martha Symonds with the bridle on one side, and Hannah
Stranger on the other side of the Horse; this Martha Simonds is the wise of
Thomas Simonds of London, Bookbinder, and Hannah Stranger is the Wife of John
Stranger of London Combmaker, who sung Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Israel.
Thus did he ride to the high Cross in Bristol, and after that to the
White-hart in Broadstreet, where there lies two eminent Quakers, by name,
Dennis Hollister, and Henry Row; of which the Magistrates hearig they were
apprehended and committed to prison.

Long it had not been after their confinement in the Goal at Exeter, from
whence passing through Wells and Glassenbury this party bestrewed the way
with their garments. But to be short they were searched, and Letters were found
about them, infinitely filled with profane nonsensicall language; which
Letters I shall not trouble you with, only some of the chief, lest your
patience should be too much cloyd. We shall have now to their examinations; and
because Naylor was the chief actor it is fit he have the pre-eminence of
leading the way in their Examinations, we shall therefore give you a full
account of what passed between the Magistrate and him, which take as
follovveth:

The Examination of James Naylor, and others.
BEing asked his name, or whether he was not called James Naylor, he replied:
The men of this world call me James Naylor.

Q. Art not thou the man that rid on horseback into Bristol, a womou leading
thy horse, and others singing before thee Holy, holy, holy, Hosannah, etc.

A. I did ride into a Town, but what its name was I know not, and by the Spirit
a woman was commanded to hold my horses bridle; and some there were that cast
down clothes, and sang praises to the Lord, such songs as the Lord put into
their hearts; and its like it might be the Song of Holy, holy, holy, etc.

Q. Whether or no did thou reprove those women?

A. Nay, but I bad them take heed that they sang nothing but what they were
moved to of the Lord.

Q. Do thou own this Letter (whereupon a Letter was showed him) which Hannah
Strange sent unto thee?

A. Yea, I do own that Letter?

Q. Art thou (according to that Letter) the fairest of ten thousand?

A. As to the visible I deny any such attribute to be due unto me; but if as to
that which the Father has begotten in me, I shall own it. But now Reader,
before I pass further, I hold it not impertient to deliver you the words of
the same Letter, with another, which were these:

A Letter to James Naylor at Exeter, by Hannah Strange.
J. N.
IN the pure fear and power of God, my soul salutes thee, Thou everlasting
son of righteousness and Prince of peace; oh how my soul travelleth to see
this day, which Abraham did and was glad, and so shall all that are of
faithful Abraham: O suffer me to speak what the Lord has moved. There is one
temptation near, the like unto the first, and is like the wisdom of God, but
it is not, and therefore it must be destroyed* Oh it desileth and hates the
innocent; I beseech thee wait, my soul travelleth to see a pure Image brought
forth, and the enemy strive to destroy it, that he may keep me always
sorrowing, and ever seeking, and never satisfied, nor never rejoicing: But he
in whom I have believed will shortly tread satan under our feet, and then shall
thou and thine return to Zion with everlasting rejoycings and praises. But till
then better is the house of mourning then rejoicing, for he that was made a
perfect example, when he had fasted the appointed time of his father, was
tempted to eat, and to show a miracle, to prove himself to be the Son of
God: But man lives not by bread, said he, and now no more by that wisdom shall
he live on which he has long fed as on bread, and as his food has been so
must his fast be, and then at the end temptation, to as low a thing as a stone,
that if it were possible the humility and the miracles would deceive the
elect, innocent, and righteous branch of holiness. But be his wills never so
many, the time comes he shall leave thee, for he is faithful, who has
promised he will not leave the Throne of David without a man to sit upon
thereon, which shall judge the poor with righteousness, and the World with
equity. This shall shortly come to pass, and then shall the vision speak and
not lie. O let innocence be thy beloved, and righteousness thy Spouse, that
thy fathers lambs may rejoice in thy pure and clear unspotted image of
holiness and purity, which my soul believes I shall see, and so in the faith
rest. I am in patience, vvait, and the power will preserve from subtilty,
though under never so zealous a pretense of innocent wisdom it be, yet shall
the Lord not suffer his holy one to see corruption, nor his soul to lie in
Hell, but will cause the mountain to melt at his presence, and the little hills
to bring him peace; O I am ready to fear as a servant, and to obey as a child.
If I have spoken words too high, love has constrained me, which is as strong
as death, and with the same spirit cover them as they are spoken with, and then
shall the spirit of David be witnessed, who refused not words though from his
servants mouth; if they were in the fear, I am his servant, and he my Master,
whom I love and fear, and trust I shall do unto the end.

Hannah Stranger.
From London, 16. day, of the 7th. month.

Another from the same.
OH thou fairest of ten thousand, thou only begotten Son of God, how my heart
pants after thee; O stay me with flagons, and comfort me with Wine. My well
beloved thou art like a Roe, or young Heart upon the mountains of Spices, where
thy beloved Spouse has long been calling thee to come away, but has been but
lately heard of thee. Now it lies something upon me that thou mindst to see
her, for the spirit and power of God is with her; And there is given to her
much of excellent and innocent wisdom arissen and arising in her, which will
make all the honest-hearted to praise the Lord alone, and no more set up self.
And therefore let not my Lord and Master have any jealousy again of her, for
she is highly beloved of the Lord, and that shall all see who come to know the
Lord. And now he does bless them that bless his, and curse them that curse
his: for this has the Lord showed me, That her portion is exceeding large in
the Lord; and as her sorrow has been much, so shall her joy be much more,
which rejoices my heart, to see her walk so valiantly and faithfully in the
work of the Lord, in this time of so great trials as has been laid upon her
especially.

And I am Hannah Stranger.
The Postscript.
Remember my dear love to thy Master. Thy name is no more to be called James
but Jesus.

John Stranger.

a Postscript by him to his Wives Letter, as is acknowledged,

there himself.

Q. Who is thy mother according to thy spiritual birth?

A. No carnal creature.

stands; Christ is in me the hope of glory.

Q. What more hope is there in thee then in others?

A. None can know but them of Israel, and Israel must give an account.

health?

Word of God.

Q. Was Dorcas Erbury dead two days in Exceter? and did thou raise her?

A. I can do nothing of my self: the Scripture bears witness to the power in
me which is everlasting; it is the same power we read of in the Scripture. The
Lord has made me a sign of his coming: and that honor that belongs to
Christ Jesus, in whom I am revealed, may be given to him, as when on earth at
Jerusalem, according to the measure.

Q. Art thou the unspotted Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world?

A. Were I not a lamb, wolves would not seek to devour me.

Q. Art thou not guilty of horrid blasphemy, by thy own words?

A. Who made thee a Judge over them?

Q. Wherefore came thou in such an unusual posture, as, two women leading thy
horse; others singing Holy, holy, etc. with another before thee bare-headed,
knee-deep in the high-way-mud, when thou might have gone in the Causey; and
at such a time, that it raining, thy companions received the rain at their
necks and vented it at their hose and breeches.

A. It tended to my Fathers praise and glory; and I ought not to slight any
thing which the Spirit of the Lord moves.

Q. Do thou think the Spirit of the Lord moved or commanded them?

A. Yea.

Q. Whom meant they by Holy, holy, holy, etc?

A. Let them answer for themselves, they are at age.

Q. Did not some spread their clothes on the ground before thee, when thou
ridst through Glastenbury and Wells?

A. I think they did.

Q. Wherefore did thou call Martha Simonds another, as George Fox affirms?

A. George Fox is a liar, and a firebrand of hell: for neither I, nor any with
me, called her so.

Q. Thou have a wife at this time?

A. A woman I have, whom by the world is called my wife; and some children I
have, which according to the flesh are mine.

Here follows a Relation concerning one of his Companions.
ONE of James Naylers Disciples having attained to some knowledge in the
French-tongue, went over into France to a City called Bordeaux, where entering
into a Congregation of the Protestants, he began after his wonted manner here
in England, to cry out in the open Congregation against the Minister, calling
him conjurer, liar, impostor, deceiver; and the elders and people being
astonished at the novelty, and reputing him a madman, came and told him, that
they had laws in France, to protect the Congregations either of Papists or
Protestants from any disturbance; and thrust him forth of their Church.

Upon which, he went into the Churchyard, and upon a stone continued his
discourse, which drew the whole Congregation out of the Church, after him, and
caused the Minister to give over: and the elders coming again to him, told him,
that he being a stranger they were willing to favor him; but seeing he did
continue his disturbance, they would commit him to justice: he told them,
Justice was never in that place until his appearance.

Upon that, they took him a way to the Governor: where being brought, with his
hat on, he asked the Governor what he was; who told him he was the Governor
of that place, under the King of France: he said, that he would not answer him
as Governor, his Government being carnal: and a certain Bishop being with the
Governor, who was a Papist, desiring that he might question him, and demanding
what he was, he told him he was an Englishman, and sent of the Lord to prepare
his way: he demanded of the Bishop what he was; who told him, he was a Bishop:
whereupon he replied, that against him he was sent, who was one of the locusts
that was sent forth of the bottomless pit; and that the wepons he had with him
was fitted to destroy him and the whole kingdom of Antichrist, who was held in
darkness and blindness; and that he was to pour out Vials of the fathers wrath
upon him. The Governor of Bordeaux perceving several of the people to be
infected with his Doctrine, demanded if there was any ship ready to sail for
England; which being informed of, he therein shipped him, being not willing to
use extremity to a stranger, but caused some six or seven who had been infected
with his doctrine to be whipped through the streets.

A Relation concerning some others of the same Tribe.
SEven or eight others went over in a vessel to New England, where being
arrived, they began to spread themselves; but the Master having notice, caused
them to be clapped up close in a castle, and would not suffer any to come to see
them under penalty of five pounds; in the mean time, he sent for the Master of
the ship that brought them, and commanded him immediately to carry them back
into old England; which he refusing, was also clapped up close prisoner until he
consented and took them aboard again.

Now, Reader, I shall close up all with a word or two of his Life and Actions.
JAmes Nayler is a man of so erroneous and unsanctified a disposition, that it
is hard to say whether heresy or impudency bears the greater rule in him;
as will appear,

First, in what he testifies before sufficient witnesses, see the brief
Relation of the Northern Quakers, page 22. that he was as holy, just, and good,
as God himself. And

Secondly, That he in a letter to one in Lancaster expressly says, That he that
expected to be saved by Jesus Christ that died at Jerusalem, shall be deceived:
see Mr. Billingsly's Defense of the Scriptures, page ^6. The perfect Pharisee,
page 8. And so said another of that sect; He was not such a fool, as to hope to
be saved by Jesus Christ that died at Jerusalem sixteen hundred years ago: See
Mr. Farmer's Mystery of Godliness and ungodliness: Thus they glory in their
ignorance, and count that foolishness which is the true Wisdom.

Thirdly, in a letter I had in my possession, but now lent to a friend,
subscribed by the Pastor and other members of that Congregation in the North,
whereof Nayler once was a member, till for his apostasy he was excommunicated,
It is offered to be proved, and by them testified to be true, that one Mris.
Roper, her husband being gone on some occasion from her a long voyage, this
Nayler frequents her company, and was seen to dandle her upon his knee, and
kiss her lasciviously, and in that time of his society with her, she was
brought to bed with a child, when her husband had been absent seven and forty
weeks to a day from her; and on a time he was seen to dance her in a private
room; and having kissed her very often, she took occasion to say, Now James, what
would the world say if they should see us in this posture? to which he said
somewhat, but he was so low, that it could not be heard. This was objected
against him, but he denied to answer it before the said Church; objecting, that
he would not speak to them that spoke not immediately by the Spirit.

Fourthly, in that when I had discourse with him concerning perfect perfection,
at the Bull and Mouth, he said I was a liar to say he owned it; then I proved
it from his own writings, as that he said, they that say they have faith, and
their life is not the life of Christ, and them that say they have faith, and
yet they cannot be saved from their sins but in part in this world, them and
their faith I deny, etc. To which he hypocritically said, that I was a liar to
say that he owned it in himself, though he disowned it in others. And when I
had objected any thing against what he said, he would deny it so soon as he had
spoke it: which to convince the people of his lying deceits, I desired them
that stood by me, to Remember that he said, All that are in the world are of
the world, in direct opposition to that saying of Christ, Joh. 17. I pray not
holy father that thou should take them out of the world, but preserve them
from the evil of the world; which I presently accused him with* for which he
called me liar; for he said, he said not so; I then desired them that heard him
to testify to the truth, against the liar and his deceit, which they did, but
his seared impudence was such, that he said, Should a thousand say so, they
were all liars, with much more to the like effect.

For his Character.
HE is a man of a ruddy complexion, brown hair, and flank, hanging a little
below his jaw-bones; of an indifferent height; not very long visaged, nor very
round; close shaven; a sad downlook, and melancholy countenance; a little band,
close to his collar, with no bandstrings; his hat hanging over his brows; his
nose neither high nor low, but rising a little in the middle.

Something concerning some others of them also.
DIsborough not much inferior to Nayler himself, attempting to lie with one
Rebeccah (who was first seduced to be, and then was of their heresy) she asked
him what his wife would say if she should know what he attempted? Disborough
replied, that he gave her the same liberty that he took himself (that was, to
be a whore, as he was a whoremaster) but in short, he having obtained his
desire of her, she asked him how if she should prove with child, he answered,
she must be content to be numbered with the transgressors, and to make her
grave with the wicked (so that he followed not that light which is pure, but
sinned against knowledge) and she the said Rebeccah, as bewailing her sin,
confessed unto one Mr. White a Lincolnshire Gentleman, to whom she added that
Nayler attempted to defile her also; so that in stead of perfect Saints, they
are rather perfect Sophisters.

This Relation under the said Gentleman's hand, and the aforementioned letter
from the Church, whereof Nayler was once a member, were offered to be proved
and made good, in the public meeting at the Bull and Mouth to Nayler's face,
more then once or twice, who was unable to say ought unto it, but left his
standing and sat down silent. They that offered it so to public trial were,
one Mr. Persivall, and Mr. John Deacon author of the Public discovery of their
Secret deceit.

Some of their Opinions are these:
1. They deny the Scriptures are the Word of God.

2. They esteem their own Speakings to be of as great authority.

3. They hold it unlawful to expound or interpret the Scriptures.

4. They say, that he that preaches by a text of Scripture, is a Conjurer.

5. That the holy letter is carnal.

6. That the Bible ought to be burned.

7. That Jesus Christ inhabits in their flesh as man.

8. Some have said, that Christ never ascended into heaven.

9. That to pray that their sins may be pardoned, is needless.

10. They believe not that there is another world.

11. Some of them deny the Resurrection.

12. That they cannot sin, but that they are perfect.

13. They make no distinction of persons.

A Friend of mine being desirous to be resolved of a doubt, as, Whether that
which was reported of that Heretical Sect were more then they erred in, or less
then they erroneously maintained contrary to the Truth; he went unto their
Meeting within Aldersgate: where he had no sooner entered that Synagogue of
Satan, but the then-speaker (namely, George Fox) cried out, (but on what
occasion, he knows not) Quakers, Quakes, Earth's above God, in the open house
before hundreds then present. At which my friend wondered: and pressing
forwards a little into the multitude, he saw some disputing upon the same
words: who demanding what was the matter, one answered, that George Fox said
Earth is above God; and here is one faith, that whatsoever George Fox should or
did say, he would maintain: (pointing to a young man then standing by) to whom
my friend replied, he had undertaken a harder task then he was able to perform:
for God was the Creator of the earth, and all things else; and therefore above
the earth, and not the earth above him that created it, forasmuch as the
workman is above his work: for although an Artificer shall by Art compose any
thing that is never so excellent, yet it can claim no equality with the maker,
in regard that what is excellent in it, is the makers excellency, and not its
own: for, destroy the work, and the workman can make the like; but destroy the
workman with the work, and both perish. To which he replied, He did not mean
the earth under our feet, but earthly sin in man. To which my friend replied,
that now his blasphemy was worse then it was before: for take the earth simply
in it self, it has no prejudice toward God; but sin is that which seeks Gods
destruction, and therefore he was not to be conversed with, being of so
diabolical an opinion.

ONe Stephens of London being on a time at their Meetings, with an intent to
oppose what he should there hear, not agreeing with Truth; which, at his first
coming, he did for a short time, till one of them, taking him by the hand, and
rubbing his wrest very hard; which put him to very sore pain: and so altered
his resolution, that he was so transformed by their enchantments, that he since
confessed, that should any one whatsoever, have dared to oppose or resist them,
as he just before did, he would have stabbed them to the heart, whatsoever had
come of it.

There is one Stephens, (and it is supposed the same) a Quaker, that now lies
stark mad, and has so been a pretty while, through the disturbances of that
Spirit which rules in the old Quakers.

John Deacon.

FINIS.
