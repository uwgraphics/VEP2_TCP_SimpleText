So that all the Cities and Countries almost in England and Wales, have no
Knights nor Citizens to represent them in Parliament, ^^t the affairs of the
three Kingdoms, are carried by the Burgesses of a fevv inconsiderable
Buroughs, who have excluded the rest of the Members of both Houses.

They have also discharged the Parliament of Scotland, and the Parliament of
Ireland, give Laws to impose Taxes on both, which no English Parliament did
in former times, nor they now do by Law. By which means, instead of three
famous Parliaments of th^se three renowned Kingdoms, we have nothing left,
if the will and force of a fevv men may prevail, but a small piece of the
Parliament of England.

Observations upon the before mentioned List.
1. That in former times, and in the Primitive condition of this Parliament,
upon the death or disabling of any Member, the Keeper or Speaker gave his
Warrant for a new Writ, that no place might want some to represent them. 2.
Former Ages never knevv that way, or rather counted it dishonest, as well as
unjust and illegal, for a fevv, and those not the chief of the House of
Commons, to make use of a mercenary force of inva^e^al and Apostate Englishmen,
to possess themselves of the Legislative Power, to the injury of the whole
Parliament, (which should consist of above six hundred) and all the people. 3.
The Major part of the House of Commons, which are excluded by force, are so
used, for over-voting the House from the minor part; Whereas till this Iron Age
(though bin for dissenting in the House) never any that attended, were hindered
from sitting, or excluded from free voting. 4. If those fevv who sit, had
convenient modesty, they would not think the wisdom of these three Kingdoms
were under their Hoods, when there are so many and wise Personages in them
nor Judge their own forcible exclusion by the Arm ^^min^ions, when so fevv,
when themselves by force seclude and eject so many.
