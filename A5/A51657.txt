The Lamentation of John Musgrave, Who was Executed at Kendal, for Robbing the
King's Receiver, and taking awa^ from him great store of Treasure.
To the Tune of, Wharton.


TO lodge it was my chance of late,
at Kendal in the Sizes week,
UUhere I saw many a gallant state
was walking up and down the street,
Down plumpton park as I did pass,
I heard a Bird sing in a glen:
The chiefest of her Song it was,
farewell the flower of Serving-men.
Sometimes I heard the the Music sweet,
which was delightful unto me:
At length I heard one wail and weep,
a gallant youth condemned to dye:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
A Gentleman of courage bold,
his like I never saw before,
But when as I did him behold,
my grief it grew still more and more:
Down Plumpton Park, etc.
Of watery eyes there were great store,
for all did weep that did him see,
He made the heart of many sore,
and I lamented for company:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
To God above (quoth he) I call,
that sent his son to suffer death:
For to receive my sinful soul,
so soon as I shall loose my breath,
Down Plumpton park, etc.
O God I have deserved death,
for deeds that I have done to thee:
Yet never lived I like a thief,
till I met with ill company.
Down Plumpton park, etc.
For I may curse the dismal hour,
first time that I did give consent:
For to Rob the King's Receiver
and to take away his Rent:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
You Gallants all be warned by me,
learn Cards and Dice for to refrain,
Fly whores, eschew ill company,
for these; thing will breed you pain:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
All earthly treasures are but vain
and worldly wealth is vanity:
Search nothing else but heaven to gain
remember all that we must dye:
Down Plumton park, etc.
Farewell goodfellows less and more,
be not dismayed at this my fall:
I never did offend before,
John Musgrave, all men did me call:
Down Plumton park as I did pass,
I heard a bird sing in a glen, etc.
The second part of the Lamentation of John Musgrave.
To the same Tune.


THe bait beguiles the bonny Fish,
some care not what they swear or say
The Lamb becomes the Foxes dish
when as the old sheep runs away:
Down Plumpton park as I did pass,
I heard a bird sing in a glen,
The chiefest of her song it was,
fare well the flower of Serving-men.
The Fowlers that the Plovers get,
take glistering glass their net to set:
The Ferret when the mouth is cop't.
does drive the Coney to the Net:
Down Plumton park, etc.
The Pike devours the Salmon free,
which is a better Fish than himself:
Some care not how whose children cry,
so that themselves may keep their pelf:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
Farewell good people less and more,
both great and small that did me ken:
(...)rewell rich, and farewell poor,
and farewell all good Serving-men;
(...)wn Plumpton park, etc.
Now by my death I wish all know,
that this same lesson you may teach,
Of what degree, of high, or low,
climb not I say above your reach:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
Good Gentlemen I you entreat,
that have more sons than you have land(...)
In idleness do not them keep,
teach them to labor with their hand(...)
Down Plumpton park; etc.
For idleness is the root of evil,
and this sin never goes alone:
But Theft and Robbery follows after,
as by my self is plainly shown:
Down plumpton park, etc.
For Youth and Age, will not understand,
that friends in want, they be but cold,
If they spend their portions and lack land
they may go beg when they are old:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
Farewell, farewell my brethren dear,
sweet Sisters make no doal for me:
My death's at hand I do not fear,
we are all mortal and born to dye:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
I know that Christ did dye for me,
no earthly pleasures would I have:
I care not for the world a fly,
but mercy Lord of thee I crave.
Down Plumpton park, etc.
Come man of death and do me right,
my glass is run I cannot stay:
With Christ I hope to lodge this night
and all good people for me pray:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
The man of death his part did play,
which made the tears blind many an ey
He is with Christ, as I dare say,
the Lord grant us that so we may:
Down Plumpton park, etc.
FINIS.
