The last farewell of three bold Traitors.
Bloody Cromwell, bloody Bradshaw and Tyrant Ireton, who being drawn to Tyborn
upon two Sledges, January 30. 1661. the same day of the month as they Murdered
our Sovereign Lord King Charles the first, of ever blessed Memory, Cromwels
Sledg coming first to Tyborn, his Coffin was broken open, then a rope put
about his Neck, by the Executioner, and drawn upon the South side of Tyborn,
Bradshaw and Ireton, come on the second Sledg, and Bradshaw was drawn up with a
rope on the East side of Tyborn, and Ireton was hanged on the North side; they
did hang for the space of six or seven hours, in the view of thousands of
people, then was their heads cut off by the Executioner, and their bones buried
under Tyborn, and their heads set where the Kings Majesty pleases.

To the Tune of, Oliver was of Huntington, etc.


WHO did not hear of Olivers Nose,
with a fa, la, la, la, la, lero.
It was of the largest sise as I suppose,
with a fa, la, etc.
O he was excellent cunning and wise,
And Craftily fooled the people with lies.
And thought by his wit to furmount the Skies,
with a fa, etc.
He was a Soldier in time of the War,
with a fa, etc,
And he caused many a bloody scar,
with a fa, etc.
From a Captain unto a Lord General,
And then a Protector at last of all
And from that high style he there caught a fall,
with a fa, etc.
But in the first place, he ruld as a King,
with a fa, etc.
He had his pleasure, the world in a sling,
with a fa, etc.
He had whatsoever with the beck of his fist,
And ^^m^unded all men to what he list,
And those that offended, he gave them the Twist,
with a fa, etc.
Then Noll at last fell mighty sick,
with a fa, etc.
Past the care of man or Physic,
with a fa, etc.
When No^ was felling sick and would die,
Beldam Ione ^ung for nither Chapawry,
And having an Oynion she seemed to cry,
with a fa, etc.
Then a brave Tomb there must be made,
with a fa, etc.
And in it this Hector must be laid,
with a fa, etc.
And further to worship their Idol beast,
They every day made him a feast,
After they had put, this bar-boone in his chest
with a fa, etc.
The Second part
to the same Tune,


But then brave Monck he turned the tide,
with a fa la la la la lero,
Threw Lambert and Haslerig out of their pride
with a fa, etc.
Brought in our King and the Traitors knapt,
And many into fast prison was clapped,
But they wanted a tyrant under ground wrapped
with a fa etc.
It Was thought the great wind had him stole,
with a fa, etc.
At last they dived into a hole,
with a fa, etc.
And looking into the Valt round,
Olivers Nose they quickly found,
And two Traitors more that lay under ground
with a fa, etc.
Then out of Westminster they lifted them hey,
with a fa, etc.
To the Sign of the Lion all in one day,
with a fa, etc.
And then upon the thirtieth day,
On sledges they did them convey,
To Tiburn for to take their way,
with a fa, etc.
Oliver first to Tiburn came,
with a fa, etc.
The Sheriff and his men for him made room,
with a fa, etc.
Then Squire Dun his Coffin burst,
With a Rope Gaffer Cromwell up he trust,
And when he came down his head off must,
with a fa, etc.
Then Bradshaw next that bloody Judge,
with a fa, etc.
To hang him up Dun did not grudge,
with a fa, etc.
Their did hang this bloody fiend,
On Tyburn he had a stretching swing,
And then next his head must be severed from him,
with a fa, etc.
Then Ireton next to make a Tryangle,
with a fa, etc.
They there by the Neck in a halter did dangle,
with a fa, etc.
Now these Traitors have lost their powers
Who formerly had gaind Towns and Towers,
Did hang at Tyborn six or seven hours,
with a fa, etc.
Cromwell, Bradshavv, Ireton, farewell,
with a fa, etc.
A mess under Tiburn for the Devil of hell,
with a fa, etc.
From Tyburn they e're bid adieu,
And there is an end of a stinking crew,
I wish all may to their King prove true,
with a fa la la la la lero.
