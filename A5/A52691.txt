GLory to God Almighty who Rules in the Heavens, and in whose hands are all
the Kingdoms of the earth, who raises up and casts down at his Will, who
has ways to confound the exaltation of man, and to chastise his Children, and
to make man to know himself to be as grass before him, whose Judgments are
above the highest of men, and his pity reaches the deepest misery, and this
Arm of his Mercy is underneath to lift up the Prisoner out of the Pit, and to
save such as trust in him from the great destruction, which vain man through
his folly brings on himself; who has delivered my Soul out of darkness, and
made way for my Freedom out of the Prisonhouse, and Ransomed me from the great
Captivity, who devides the Seas before him, and removes the Mountains out of
his Way, in the Day when he takes upon him to deliver the Oppressed out of the
hand of him that is too mighty for him in the earth, let his Name be exalted
forever, and let all flesh fear before him, whose breath is life to his own,
but a consuming fire to the Adversary.

And to the Lord Jesus Christ be Everlasting Dominion upon earth, and his
Kingdom above all the powers of darkness, even that Christ of whom the
Scriptures declares, which was and is, and is to come, the light of the world
to all Generations, of whose coming I testify with the rest of the Children of
light begotten of the Immortal Seed, whose Truth and Virtue now shines in the
world unto the Righteousness of Eternal life, and the Savior of all that
believe therein, who has been the Rock of my Salvation, and his Spirit has
given Quietness and Patience to my Soul in deep affliction, even for his Names
sake, praises for ever.

But Condemned for ever be all those false worships with which any have
Idolized my Person in the night of my temptation, when the power of darkness
was above, all their casting off their Clothes in the ^ay, their bowings and
singings, and all the rest of those wild actions which did any way tend to
dishonor the Lord or draw the minds of any from the measure of Christ Jesus in
themselves, to look at flesh which is grass, or to ascribe that to the visible
which belongs to Christ Jesus, ^^l that I condemn by which the pure Name of the
Lord has any way ^een Blasphemed through me in that time of temptation, or the
spirits of any People grieved that truly loves the Lord Jesus throughout the
whole world of what sort soever; this offense I confess which has been sorrow
of heart that the enemy of man's Peace in Christ should get this advantage in
the night of my Trial, to stir up wrath and offenses in the Creation of God, a
thing the simplicity of my heart did not intend, the Lord knows, who in his
endless love has given (...) Power over it to Condemn it; And also that Letter
sent me to Exeter by John Stanger when I was in Prison, with these words, Thy
name sh^^ ^e no more James Naylor, but Jesus; this I Judge to be written from
the Imaginations, and a fear struck me when I first saw it, and so I put it in
my Pocket (close) not intending any should see it, which they finding on me
spread it abroad, which the simplicity of my heart never owned; so this I deny
also that the Name of Christ Jesus is received in stead of James Naylor or
after the flesh, for the Name is to the Seed to all Generations, and he that
has the Son has the Name which is Life and Power, the Salvation and the
Unction, into which Name all the Children of light are Baptized; so the Name of
Christ I confess before men, but not according to men, which Name to me has
been a strong Tower, in the night and in the day.

And this is the Name of Jesus Christ which I confess, The Son, and the Lamb,
in the Seed, where he speaks in Male or Female, but who has not this in
himself has not life, neither can have by Idolizing my Person, or the Person
of any flesh, but in whom the Heir is born and has spoken, or does speak,
there he must not be denied the mouth to speak by, who is head over all, and in
all his own God blessed for ever.

And all those ranting wild spirits which then gathered about me in that time
of darkness, and all their wild actions and wicked words against the honor of
God and his pure Spirit and People, I deny the spirit, the power and the works
thereof, and as far as I gave advantage through want of Judgment for that evil
spirit in any to arise I take shame to my self, justly, having formerly had
Power over that spirit in Judgment and discerning where ever it was, which
darkness came over me through want of watchfulness and obedience to the pure
Eye of God, and diligent minding the reproof of life, which condemns the
Adulterous spirit; so the Adversary got advantage, who ceases not to seek to
devour, and being taken Captive from the true light, walked in the night where
none can work, as a wandering bird sit for the prey, and if the Lord of all my
mercies had not rescued me, I had perished, for I was as one appointed to death
and destruction, and there was none could deliver me; And this I confess, that
God may be justified in his Judgment, and magnified in his mercies without
end, who did not forsake his Captive in the night, even when his Spirit was
daily provoked and grieved, but has brought me forth to give Glory to his Name
for ever; And it is in my heart to confess to God, and before men, my folly and
offense in that day, yet was there many things formed against me at that day to
take away my life, and cast upon the Truth of which I am not guilty at all; as
that accusation as if I had committed Adultery with some of those Women who
came with us from Exeter Prison; and also those who were with me at Bristow the
night before I suffered there; Of both which accusations I am clear before God,
who kept me at that day both in thought and deed, as to all Women, as a little
Child, God is my Record, and this I mention in Particular (hearing of some who
still cease not to reproach therewith Gods Truth and People) that the mouth of
enmity may be shut from evil-speaking, though this touch not my Conscience.

Also that report as though I had raised Dorcas Erbury from death, carnally,
this I deny also, and condemn that Testimony to be out of the Truth, though
that Power that quickens the dead, I deny not, which is the word of Eternal
Life.

And this I give forth that it may go as far as the offense against the Spirit
of Truth has gone abroad, that all burdens may be taken off with the Truth,
and the Truth cleared thereby, and the true light, and all that walk therein,
and the deeds of darkness be condemned, and that all that are in darkness may
not act in the night, but stay upon God who walks in the light, who with the
workers of inquity has not fellowship, which had I done when first darkness
came upon me, and not been led by others, I had not run against that Rock to be
broken which so long had born me, and of whom I had so largely drunken, and of
which I now drink in measure, to whom be the Glory of all, and to him must
every tongue confess, as Judge and Savior, God over all, blessed for ever.

And this further is given me to say to every particular person to whom this
writing shall come, what ever is thy condition, wait in the light which lets
thee see it, there is thy Counsel and thy strength to be received, to stay thee
and to recover thee, Art thou tempted to sin? abide in that which lets the sea
it, that there thou may come to feed on the right body, and not on the
temptation, for if thou mind the temptation it will overcome thee, but in the
light is Salvation; or having sinned art thou tempted to despair or to destroy
thy self? mind not the temptation, for its death that sin has brought forth,
feed not on it nor mind it, least thou eat condemnation, for that's the wrong
body.

The body of Christ is felt in the light, in which is life from death Grace and
Truth to feed on, which will overcome for thee being followed, but if thou
follow the tempration, fear and condemnation w^^ swallow thee up; if there
appear to thee voices, visions, and Revelations, feed not thereon, but abide in
the light and feel the body of Christ, and there will thou receive faith and
power to Judge of every appearance and spirits, the good to hold fast and obey,
and the false to resist; art thou in darkness? mind it not, for if thou do, it
will fill thee more, but stand still and act not, and wait in patience till
light arise out of darkness to lead thee; Art thou wounded in Conscience? feed
not there, but abide in the light, which leads to the Grace and Truth which
Teaches to deny and put off the weight, and removes the cause, and brings
saving health to light; yea this I say to thee in the Name of Jesus Christ,
that though thou have made thy Grave as deep as the nethermost Hell, or were
thy afflictions as great as Jobs, and thy darkness as the depth of the Sea, yet
if thou will not run to vain helps as I have done, but stay upon the Lord till
he give thee light by his Word, (who commands light to shine out of darkness)
from thence will he bring thee forth, and his eye shall guide thee, and thou
shall praise his Name, as I do this day, glory for evermore; And this Word is
nigh thee which must give thee light, though darkness comprehends it not.

And had thou gifts, Revelations, knowledge, wisdom or what ever thou may
read on in the Scriptures of Truth, and do not abide in the light, and feed on
the body of Christ whence the gifts springs, but feed on the gift, thou may
be up for a while in thy own sight, but certainly thou will wither and die to
God, and darkness will come upon thee, and thy food will turn to thy
condemnation in the sight of God.

And this I have learned in the deeps, and in secret when I was alone, and now
declare openly in the day of my mercy, Glory to the Highest for evermore who
has thus far set me free to praise his Righteousness and his mercy, and to the
Eternal invisible pure God, over all, be fear, obedience and glory evermore,
Amen.

JAMES NAYLOR.
