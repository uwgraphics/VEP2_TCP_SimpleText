Holy Time: OR, The True Limits of the Lords Day.

I. Proving, That the Lords Day does begin with the Natural Morning, and that
the Morning of the Natural day does begin at Midnight; and so consequently
that the Lords Day must both begin with the Natural Morning at Midnight, and
end with the Natural Evening at Midnight.

II. Proving, That the Jews beginning of the Day at the Sunset Evening was
only in relation to the date of the Person purified from his Levitical
uncleanness.

III. That The Jews themselves did hold, That the Natural day did continue
after Sunset till Midnight.

Maymony says, Grateful is a Command that is done in the hour of the same; (so
say I, grateful is the sanctifying of the Lords Day in the hour of the same) In
his Treatise of Offering Sacrifice, Chap. 4. Sect. 1.

Grace and Peace to such as desire to know when the Lords Day does begin and
end;
To the end they might abstain from their own Worldly employments in the Lords
own Sanctified time.

THis point is the more difficult to be explaned, because I have not met with
any beaten road from other Interpreters.

But I have labored to make it evident,

1 That the Sanctified and separated time of the Lords Day is just according to
the Natural day.

2 I have labored to make it evident, That the Natural day begins with the
Morning.

3 That the Natural morning begins at Midnight.

4 That the Natural day, and so consequently the Lords Day, does begin with the
Natural morning, and does end with the Natural evening at Midnight.

And for the want of the knowledge of these things, I perceive that many godly
persons do the works of their ordinary Callings in some part of the Lords
sanctified and separated day, as those do that begin and end the Lords Day at
the Sunset Evening, and for their better information I forced my self to
compose this Treatise.

I find that the chief ground of their error does arise, First, from a
mistaken interpretation of the first Darkness, to be a full Night of twelve
hours; and Secondly, from a mistaken interpretation of the word Evening,
because they apprehend it to be nothing else but a full Night.

These and sundry such like mistakes, I conceive I have cleared, I presumed
therefore that this ensuing Treatise will be heartily welcome to every tender
Conscience, that does truly desire to give unto the Lord his own separated and
sanctified time.

Many godly Christians, to my knowledge, have been much exercised in their
Studies, and Meditations, to find out the true limits of the Lords Day, that
so they might abstain from the works of their particular Calling, in every part
of that sanctified and separated time, from the beginning of the day to the
full end thereof.

For their sakes also, and at the special request of some of them, I have
labored in this Treatise, to prove, That all the time of the first Darkness
was comprehended in the word Morning at last, and that it took its beginning
from the Midnight at last, namely, as soon as all the several parts of the
Natural day were shaped and set into their order.

And therefore the beginning of the Morning from the time of Midnight must not
be ascribed to the Romans, as the first Authors of it (as many unadvisedly do,)
nor yet to any other Nation; but it is the most ancient Scripture-Computation
from the very first created day; and so consequently it must needs be the true
beginning of the Jews Sabbath.

This Tenent may happily seem strange at the first, to such as have long held,
both in their judgment and practice, That the Jews Sabbath (and so
consequently the Lords Day) did properly begin at the Sunset evening; and of
this judgment and practice are most of the Churches in New England, and in
that respect many Professors among them do without scruple take liberty in the
Sunset Evening of the Lords Day, to do the servile works of their particular
Callings, and others take liberty to use Recreations.

But it is worthy to be taken notice of, that whole Churches do many times
err, both in their judgment and practice, or else how could so much
Corruption, Superstition, Idolatry, and Profaneness creep in to several
reformed Churches, as there has done from time to time in sundry ages?

Being therefore entreated by some godly persons in New England, and being also
moved thereunto by the fear of God, I have taken this difficult Task in hand,
lest, to confute this corrupt judgment and practice, it should spread like
Leaven, to the corrupting of Posterity; and so I rest,

Thine in the Lord, WILLIAM PYNCHON.

The chief Heads of this Treatise OF HOLY TIME.
CHAP. I. PRoving that the first Darkness in Genesis 1. 2. was not a complete
Night, By three Reasons. Page 1 The true Definition of a complete Night: It is
the absence of the Suns shining for the space of twelve Hours. p. 3
CHAP. II. Proving that Moses by the term Evening in Genesis 1. 5. does not mean
the whole Night, but the latter half of the Artificial Day, and the first half
of the Night. p. 6 This Chapter is distributed into four Sections, and six
Objections are answered.
SECT. 1. The Hebrew word Gnereb, translated the Evening in Genesis 1. 5. is
explaned in p. 9 1 The first Darkness cannot be called the Evening in a proper
sense. p. 10 2 Neither can the whole night be called Gnereb, the Evening, in a
proper sense. p. 10 3 Neither can the Twilight be called Gnereb, the Evening,
in a proper sense. p. 10. And therefore it is a great mistake in our larger
Annotation in Mat. 26. 20. to say that Harab properly signifies mixed, namely,
the mixture of Light and Darkness in the Twilight; and in that sense
mis-applying Deuteronomy. 16. 6. which is meant of the time of sacrifising the
Passover, and not of the time of feasting. Our Ancestors held Gnereb, the
Evening, to be at all times of the year an even and equal part of time to
Boker, the Morning. p. 16 Gnereb, the Evening, is often put by the figure
Synecdoche for the later half of the Evening, which does always begin at
Sunset, and end at Midnight. p. 16 Gnereb is often put by the figure
Metanomia for the West, because the later Evening begins at Sunset, which when
it is in the Equinoctial does always set in the West. p. 17 Gnereb, the
Evening, is often put by the figure Metanomy for the last days, and also for
the last end of a thing, because it is the last half of the natural day. p. 17
SECT. 2. Gnereb signifies such a connection of several species, as does ever
preserve the said several species distinct and entire, without any confused
mixture; and so Gnarbaiim in the Dual number does explain it; and therefore
Gnarbaiim is eleven times over put for the two distinct parts of the natural
Evening. p. 19 And because Gnarbaiim, the two Evenings, are but the two
distinct parts of the full natural Evening; therefore the Seventy Interpreters
do translate them in the singular, as one proper Evening. p. 22 And the Hebrew
Text does often make the two Evenings to be but one proper Evening. p. 23
SECT. 3. Proving, by seven demonstrative grounds, that the natural Evening
begins at Midday at the first declining of the Sun. p. 24 The Jews divided the
Artificial day into four great hours, as they divided the Night into four
Watches. p. 27

CHAP. III. This Chapter has three Sections, and five Objections are answered.
SECT. 1. Proving that the time of the first Darkness was called Boker, the
Morning, at last, namely, after all the parts of the natural day were shaped,
framed, and set together. p. 35 Boker, the Morning, does signify Early. p. 35
Boker is put for Gods early seeking out, either to punish the wicked, or to
protect the godly. p. 37 Boker is put for the first time, and for the first
beginning of a thing. p. 37 Boker is put for the Sunset Evening, because the
time of Sunset is the first beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day of
Cleanness, for then the person purified began the date of his day of
Cleanness. p. 40, 56, 86
SECT. 2. Proving that the Morning does begin in the darknight. p. 41 SECT. 3.
Proving that the Morning (in all likelihood) does begin at Midnight; besides
the former certain proof from the exact beginning and sending of the natural
Evening, from Midday, to Midnight, p. 44
CHAP. IV. This Chapter has three Sections, and four Objections are answered.
Proving that the Jews Custom in beginning their weekly Sabbath at the Sunset
Evening, was occasioned by their Ceremonial Custom, because the persons that
were Ceremonially purified, were commanded to begin the date of their new day
of Cleanness at that point of time. p. 50. And hence it follows, 1 That this
accidental beginning, must not be accounted for the true beginning of the
natural day. 2 Therefore the Sunset Evening is not the right time for us
Christians to begin our Lords day. p. 50
The Jews were cleansed from their Ceremonial defilements in two degrees of
time. 1 In the time of the afternoon, by washing or baptizing their bodies. 2
In the time of the second Evening, which did always begin at Sunset, then,
and not till then, they must begin the date of their day of Cleanness. p. 51,
54
All Israel are called men of Holiness, in regard of their outward purity by
their Ceremonial Cleansings. p. 54 The Jews Morrow began at Sunset in
Ceremonial respects only p. 56, 86 It is disputed by some, that the Sunset
Evening is not fully come until it be full Twilight, or somewhat past; or else
they confess, it cannot be proved that Christ lay three days in his grave. p.
57, 104 The time of Sunset is fully come as soon as the body of the Sun is
gone out of sight; and therefore before it is Twilight. p. 57 The time of
Christ's burial was at Star light. p. 7. 105 They did not begin their Religious
Festival Suppers until three Stars appeared in the sky. p. 60 The Jews
observed a double date of the day. 1 They observed the date of their Ceremonial
day. 2 They observed the date of the Natural day, for several purposes. p. 61.
95, 96. at Object. 18

CHAP. V. Proving that the Passeover-Evening did begin and end according to the
Natural Evening from Midday to Midd-night p. 63 And in this Chapter eighteen
Objections are Answered.
Some think that no other Evening belonged to the Jews Sabbath but the Evening
before the Sabbath; but they are much mistaken, for that was the Evening of the
Sabbath, no otherwise, but only in relation to the date of the person
pu^ified. But the proper Evening of the Sabbath it self begun at Midday, and
ended at Midnight, as the Passover Evening did. p. 64. 110. and 95. at
Object. 18. All Passeovers were Sacrifices, and therefore the blood of them all
must be sprinkled at the Lords Altar in his Temple. p. 69 Blood was the Lords
portion; and in that respect he did prohibit the Jews to eat blood, and
likewise some sorts of fat. p. 69 The Lord permitted many private Altars for
Sacrifice in the days of Samuel, for the use of a particular person or Tribe;
but he allowed but one public Altar, for the public Sacrifices of all the
twelve Tribes, such as the Passeovers were. p. 70 The Passeover-day was none of
the Jews Festival Sabbaths, it was but a half Holy Day. p. 72 No Levites but
Priests only must sprinkle the blood of the Sacrifice upon the Lords Altar. p.
74 It was not convenient for above twenty persons to make their count for one
Lamb-Passeover. p. 75 A digression to open some difficult phrases about the
Passover, because they are borrowed from the unusual known dialect of the
Thalmud. p. 77 The time of Christ's Burial was at Starlight. p. 83. 57. 105
Boker, the Morning, is put for the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, which
did exactly begin at Sunset. 86 The Jews accounted the first half of the night
to belong to the former day, as a true part thereof, in the case of their
Religious Feasting upon their Passeovers; and in other cases also. p. 90. 51.
64 110 The second part of the Passover Evening was the appointed season for
the time of their Religious Feasting from Sunset till Midnight. p. 93
CHAP. VI. Proving, that the day of Reconciliation was an extraordinary long
Fasting Sabbath; and therefore the beginning of that day ought not to be
produced as an exemplary pattern, neither for the beginning of the Lords day,
nor yet for the beginning of any other Fasting day. p. 98 No Fasting day among
the Jews was so long as the day of Atonement was. p. 110
CHAP. VII. Answering their Objections more particularly, that hold the Lords
day to begin at the Sunset Evening. p. 103 Such as hold the Sabbath day to
begin at the Sunset Evening, can never prove that Christ lay three days in
his grave. p. 104 Luke says, that the time of Christ's burial was when it began
to be Starlight. p. 105. 57. 83 The Hebrew Doctors held the Sunset Evening
after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it self. p. 110. 50. 64 The
Hebrew Doctors allow no more but seven Furlongs and a half to an English mile.
p. 114
CHAP. VIII. Proving that the punctual time of Christ's Resurrection was in the
Morning, just at the time of Sunrising. p. 117

HOLY TIME.
CHAP. I. Proving that the First Darkness in Genesis 1. 5. was not a complete
Night. By three Reasons.
Reason I.
BEcause the first Darkness wanted a Twilight going before it, which is a
proper adjunct, and a true part, of a true created night; and therefore the
first created night was not without it; and our own experience does witness
that every complete night has a Twilight going before it in the evening as a
true part thereof as well as a Twilight in the end of it in the morning: But
the first Darkness, though it had a Twilight in the end of it immediately
before the light shined out, yet it wanted a Twilight in the beginning of it;
therefore it was not a full night: it was no more but a Synecdoche Membri, a
part of the first night.

And indeed there could not be a complete night at first, not until the
Artificial day was first completely formed by the shining out of the light
twelve hours together, and then at the end of the said twelve hours the light
went out of that horizon, and then there succeeded another darkness of twelve
Hours which began with a Twilight. The first half of this darkness made up
the first darkness to be a complete night of twelve hours; and the other
half went on toward the beginning of the second natural day.

And thus, after this order and manner the first night was created, shaped and
limited, with a double Twilight, and by this means it became a true pattern and
sampler to all the other Creation nights.

Mr. Thomas Wilson in his Mystical Cases, in Aenigmate 35. propounds this
necessary Question:

How can there be Darkness, where there is no Night?

The Answer hereunto (says he) must be referred to the first Creation only.

By this Answer of his, it is evident that h^ did not hold the first Darkness
to be a true night, as most Interpreters do, though much amiss in so doing.

The sum of what I have said, may be drawn up into this Syllogism.

No Darkness that wants the true shape and form of a complete night, can be
called a complete night.

But the first Darkness wanted the true shape and form of a complete night,
because it wanted a Twilight in the beginning of it, which is an inseparable
adjunct to the true shape and form of a complete night.

Therefore the first Darkness cannot in proper speech be called a complete
night.

The Proposition is so clear that I need not prove it, because no man I think
will deny it.

The Assumption is thus proved, God made the Stars to rule in the night, Genesis
1. 17. And the Stars were set first into their dominion in the Twilight Evening
of the fourth day, Genesis 1. 17. in respect whereof Job does call them the Stars
of the Twilight, Job 3. 9. But the Seventy Translators call them the Stars of
the night, because they held Jobs Twilight to be a true part of the night; And
Solomon does likewise make the Twilight of the Evening to be a term synonimous
with Darkness, and with the night, Prove. 7. 9. And Aben Ezra on Exodus 12.
says there is the evening of the Sun, and the evening of the Night, when the
shining of the Sun is gone from off the Earth.

For the further proof of this, I refer you to Chapter 4. To my Answer to the
second Objection.

But I will hereunto add the description of a complete night, which may
further enlighten this truth. A complete night is the absence of the Suns
shining for the space of twelve hours.


A complete night is the absence of the Suns shining from off the face of the
earth for the space of twelve hours, when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as
the days were in the first Creation: This description of the Night agrees with
the testimony of Aben Ezra, immediately cited.

Object. Why do you set out the shape and form of the first Artificial day by
the shining of the Sun, and of the Night by the absence of the Suns shining?
Seeing the Sun was not created till the fourth day; It is likely that the
light that was created the first day did not then rule the day after the same
manner as the Sun did on the fourth day.

Ans. Though there was no Sunshine in the first day, yet doubtless instead
thereof the God of Nature, and the God of Order, did cause a certain light to
shine out of darkness, from the Element of Fire, in the self same manner and
order, as he caused the Light to do on the Fourth Day.

At the first, the general matter of the Globe, called Earth, was without form,
Genesis 1. 2. because it was void of all ornaments for a time; in like sort the
first Darkness was at the first a confused thing, and without any shape or
form of a night, for a time; but after the space of five or six hours God
said, Let there be light, and there was light, Genesis 1. 3. It were too gross
blindness, to think that God did cause this Light to break out of darkness
all on a sudden, like a flash of Lightning; no, God was now framing the First
Day, to be a Pattern, and Sampler to all the rest; and therefore the God of
Nature, and the God of Order, did cause the Light to break out of Darkness by
degrees, in the same order and manner as he caused the Sun to do on the
Fourth Day, and so by this means the God of Nature did first create a Twilight
to the first Darkness, before he caused the light to shine out upon the face
of the Earth, as he did by the Sun on the Fourth day; then also he caused the
Light to ascend by degrees, until it came to its height at midday, and then he
caused it to decline by degrees, until it went off from that Horizon, as the
Sun does now; and so by this means the Artificial Day was completely shaped,
and formed, before the whole Night could be shaped and formed.

But secondly, When the Artificial Day was thus formed, by the shining of the
Light twelve hours, then there succeeded another Twilight, and twelve hours
Darkness more then the first Darkness; the first half of that twelve hours
darkness made up the first darkness a complete night of twelve hours, with a
double Twilight, and so it became a true pattern and sampler to all other
Creation Nights, and then the last half of the said twelve hours darkness
went on toward the beginning of the Second Day.

And except this order be observed, there cannot be found out a double Twilight
to make the first Night a complete pattern for all the other Creation nights.

Reason II.
It is evident that the first Darkness was not a complete night by the order
of that Dominion which God established for the ruling of the Artificial Day by
the Sun, before he gave Dominion to the Moon, and to the Stars, to rule the
night.

But if the first Darkness had been a full night before the Artificial day had
received its shape and form, then the Moon and Stars should have had their
dominion before the Sun, for doubtless the God of order would place them in
their dominion in the day of their creation, according to that priority of
order which the day had of the night, or the night had of the day. Genesis 1. 14.
19.

If the night of the fourth day had been first in order before the Artificial
day, then the Moon and the Stars should have had the priority of their dominion
to rule the night of the fourth day, before the Sun could have had its dominion
to rule the artificial day; and so by this account the Sun shall borrow its
light from the Moon as the chiefest in the dominion of the fourth day: Is not
this to make the God of order to be the God of confusion, in setting the Cart
before the Horse, by giving the first dominion to the Moon, and the last
dominion to the Sun; as they do that make the first darkness to be a complete
night.

Or else if you think to avoid this Rock, by saying that the Sun only was
created on the fourth day to rule the artificial day, and that the Moon and
the Stars were not created, and set into their rule and dominion till the fifth
night, is not this to run against the plain Text. For my part I shall think him
a good Logician (that holds the first darkness to be a complete night) that
can fairly get out of this Dilemma.

Reason III.
If the first darkness had been formed into a complete night before the light
was formed into a complete artificial day; Then doubtless Moses would have
called it Night (as the proper name of its perfect shape and form) before he
called the light Day: for it was Gods usual custom to give names to things in
the same priority of order, as they had priority of form and shape: As for
example, As soon as he had made man of the earth, he called him Adam, and as
soon as he had made woman of his Rib, he bid Adam name her; and as soon as he
had formed other creatures, he brought them to Adam, and bid him name them with
names, defining their natures; and so doubtless if the first darkness, had been
first formed into a complete night, he would have named it night in the first
place; but he called it nothing else but Darkness at first, saying the
darkness was, namely it was a misshapen and uncreated thing: But as soon as
he had put a shape, and limited it by a double Twilight, he called it night, as
the name of its perfect form and shape: But it could not receive this shape and
form until the light was first shaped and formed into an artificial day by its
orderly shining upon the face of the earth for twelve hours together, and then
he called it day, as the proper name of its perfect shape and form.

Hence we may clearly perceive, That Moses in Genesis 1. 5. does name all the
parts of the first natural day in their true priority of order as they were
shaped and formed, 1 Day, 2 Night, 3 Evening, 4 Morning. And secondly, hence it
follows that the first formed part of the natural day, was the artificial
day, and not the night.

CHAP. II. Proving that Moses by the term Evening in Genesis 1. 5. does not me an
the whole night; But the latter half of the artificial day, and the first
half of the night.
LEarned Mr. Richardson says, That these two words Evening and Morning do set
our Divines to School to find out what is meant by them in the first Creation.

Most Interpreters say that the two Hebrew words, Gnereb and Boker, which we
translate Evening and Morning, in Genesis 1. 5. do mean nothing else but night
and day. But I must crave leave to differ from them in judgment, for these two
Reasons.

Reason I.
If Moses had called the first darkness Evening, and the artificial day
Morning, Then in reason he would have placed the said terms in the same
methodicall order in the end of the verse, as he had done in the beginning of
the said verse; but he does place them in a contrary order, for in the
beginning of the verse he names the Day before the Night, but in the end of the
verse he names the Evening before the Morning; and what else does this argue
but that he did thereby intend that Gods people should take notice that the
Evening and the morning were a differing division of the natural day from the
division of Day and Night?

Reason II.
If Moses had intended to call the first darkness Evening as synonimous to the
term Night, then doubtless some Scripture or other would have showed them to
be synonima, seeing the said terms are so often repeated in the Bible.

But though I have made diligent search, yet I cannot find where the term
Morning is made synonimous to the full artificial day, nor where the term
Evening is made synonimous to the whole night, in a proper sense.

Therefore seeing they are no where synonima, it is altogether unlike that
Moses does make them synonima in Genesis 1. 5. and no where else?

Object. Why might not the first Darkness be a full Evening, and so a full
night of twelve hours, though it wanted a Twilight in the beginning of it?
might not God dispense with the Twilight in the first night?

Ans. Why do you go about to make the most wise Creator and Governor of all
things, to be an imperfect Artist in his first pattern? for if you make the
first Night to want a Twilight in the beginning of it, do you not thereby make
him an imperfect Artist in his first pattern to the other creation days? for
it is manifest, that the shape and form of the first creation day was a true
pattern by which the rest were shaped and formed; for as the text expresses it
in verse 5. so was the Morning, and so was the Evening the first day; so in
like sort it is said of the second day in verse 8. and so it is said of the
third day in verse 13. and so it is said of the fourth day in verse 19. and so
it is said of the fifth and sixth days, all these days were shaped and formed
just according to the pattern of the first day.

The addition of the Sun in the fourth day made no new part of Light more then
the first day had, as I have noted it already, and therefore the manner how the
Light did break out of Darkness on the first day, was in the same manner and
order as we see the Sun does in the Equinoctial.

1 The Light ascended out of darkness by degrees, as the Sun does now, Genesis
32. 24. By means whereof it did first make a Twilight in the morning, so the
Hebrew phrase calls it in Psalm. 119. 147.

2 Then after a while it began to shine upon the face of the earth, Genesis 19. 23.

3 Then it ascended higher till it came to its height at midday, as Es. 16. 3.
Act. 22. 6. Act. 26. 13.

4 Then it ceased to ascend, and made a little stand for about half an hour.

5 Then it began to decline or go down by degrees till it went out of the
Horizon.

6 Then it made a Twilight, called the Twilight of the Evening, Prove. 7. 9.

7 Then succeeded twelve hours darkness, the first half whereof made up the
first darkness a full night.

8 Then the last half of the said twelve hours darkness went on toward the
beginning of the second day.

In this admirable order did the God of nature set together all the parts of
the first natural day: But I have again set it out more fully in Section 4.

Object. 2. Some learned men say, That Moses by the term Evening and Morning
in Genesis 1. 5. meant Night and Day, no otherwise, but by the figure Synecdoche
only.

They say that the Night is called Evening no otherwise, but because it is
begun of the Evening, and that the artificial day is called Morning no
otherwise, but because it is begun of the Morning, and so by this Exposition
they make no other part of time to be called Evening; but a little point of
time only at the beginning of the night, all the rest of the night is called
Evening (say they) but by the figure Synecdoche only. In like manner they make
no other part of the artificial Day to be called Morning; but a little point of
time in the beginning of the artificial day only, and this Exposition they
borrow from Tremelius Annotation on Genesis 1. 5. or rather from Junius, for it is
easy to make it appear, that Tremelius was of another judgment.

Ans. A man had need of more patience then ordinary that shall spend his time
to answer such fantastical conceits as this. But in brief, I think I have fully
confounded this Objection.

1 By proving that Moses in Genesis 1. 5. divided the first natural day into two
equal parts two several ways, as I have exemplified it by the lines of
longitude and latitude on a Compass Dial in Sect. 4. and see also the
gradations to the morning in Chap. 3. Sect. 2. at Sixthly.

2 I answer by proving that Gnereb the Evening is a connection of the latter
half of the artificial day to the first half of the Night, and so making it
to be an equal part of time to Boker the Morning. But the best way to answer
this, and many other Objections, is to lay down the true interpretation of
Gnereb, the Evening, in the various use of it in the Scripture.

I am not ignorant that Gnereb is usually interpreted to signify The Hebrew
word Gnereb, which is translated Evening, in Genesis 1. 5. explained.
a mixing, or mingling of things together; but I dislike this interpretation,
because it is not possible by this interpretation to find out the true form,
and shape of the Natural Evening, I have therefore made diligent search into
the various use of this word, and I find that Gnereb does signify (not a
confused mixing and mingling of things together, but) a connexing, conjoyning,
or coupling of two or more distinct things together, without confounding their
several species, or natures, and therefore Wine and Water mixed together
cannot be called Gnereb, neither can the confused mingling of Light and
Darkness together (as it is in the Twilight) be called Gnereb, and yet that
short time of Twilight is comprehended within the large limits of Gnereb,
because it is the partition of (Gnarbaiim) the two Evenings; but the Twilight
it self is ever expressed by two other several Hebrew words, and never by
Gnereb.

The thing I aim at in this Discourse is only to clear the true signification
of Gnereb, from a confused mixing or mingling of things together, and to make
it clear and evident, that it only signifies a conjunction of two or more
distinct things together, and therefore that Gnereb in Genesis 1. 5. must signify
the conjunction of the last half of the Artificial day to the first half of
the Night, and that these two distinct parts connexed are an even and equal
portion of time to Boker, the morning.

2. I will explain the true meaning of this phrase in Genesis 1. 5. so was the
Evening, and so was the Morning. First mark the dependence; in the former part
of the Verse, it is said, God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
Night; and then it follows, so was the Evening; but how was that? was it framed
out of the darkness only? No, it was framed and formed both out of the said
Light called Day, and out of the said Darkness called Night, Conjunctim, and
not Divisim, namely, the Evening was framed by conjoyning the latter half of
the Artificial day to the first half of the Night; and so was the Morning,
namely, it was in like sort framed out of the Darkness called Night, and out
of the Light called Day, by conjoyning the last half of the Night to the first
half of the Artificial day: and it is most evident that this was the true
meaning of Moses; because he does afterward explain Gnereb the single
Evening, by Gnarbaiim the two Evenings eleaven times over, and the reason is,
because the full Natural evening has two parts; namely the first half is Day,
and the latter half is Night, as I shall open the matter more at large, both in
this Chapter by and by, and in Chapter the fifth.

And from this interpretation of Gnereb, in Genesis 1. 5. these three Conclusions
do follow.

1 That the First Darkness is not, nor cannot be called Gnereb the Evening. 2
That the whole Night is not, nor cannot be called Gnereb the Evening, in a
proper sense. 3 That the Twilight cannot be called Gnereb the Evening.
And the reason is, because none of these three have any distinct conjunction
of species to make them Gnereb; and from this interpretation of Gnereb I frame
this Argument.

The first Darkness by it self considered cannot be called Gnereb the
Evening, neither can the confused mixture of the Twilight be called Gnereb the
Evening, because Gnereb does signify (not such a mixture as is confused, but)
a connexing, or conjoyning of two or more things together, without confounding
their distinct species; and there are no other distinct species in Genesis 1. 5.
to be conjoined together, but the Light called Day, and the Darkness called
Night.

But the first darkness was pure darkness, and no other thing was connexed to
it til the Light was created, and that connection though at the first it might
have been called Gnereb, yet now it must not be called Gnereb, because it
pleased God to call it Boker, the morning.

Therefore the first Darkness by it self considered, cannot be called Gnereb
the Evening, neither was it framed into any part of the Evening at all.

The Assumption will not be denied.

The Proposition I prove several ways.

But first I will begin it by a particular examination of the various use of the
Hebrew word Gnereb through out the Scripture.

1 Gnereb is put for the conjunction of two persons together in a contract of
Marriage, Ezra 9. 2. Psalm. 106. 35. it is also put for the connection of Iron
and Clay in the feet of Nebuchadnezzars Image, Dan. 2. 41. 43. which connection
is expounded to be the joining together of the Seleucida and the Lagida by
Marriages, in Dan. 11. 16, 17. in like sort that Phrase of going in to another
by way of Marriage, 1 King. 11. 1, 2. is called Gnereb in the Chalde, and the
going in to the Nations, Josh. 23. 7. is called Gnereb in the Chalde.

These instances do prove that Gnereb is a connection of two distinct Persons
or Species together, without confounding the Species.

2 Gnereb is put for Merchandise, because of the connection of sundry sorts of
Wares the Merchants use to join together, when they carry them to Faires or
Markets to sell, Eze. 27. 17. 19. 25. 27, 31. 34. Gnereb is also put for
Merchants by the Figure Metonymia, either because of the said connection of
sundry sorts of Wares, or else because of their manifold contracts with other
persons, which contracts are usually made by connexing their hands together,
Eze. 27. 13.

3 Gnereb is put for things that are sweet, or pleasant, by the Figure
Synecdoche; it is put for a sweet or pleasant voice, Cant. 2. 14. and for sweet
sleep, Prove. 3. 24. Jer. 31. 26. and for other sweet and pleasant things, Prove.
13. 19. Psalm. 104. 34 Jer. 6. 20. Hos. 9. 4, Mal. 3. 4. but none of these
things can be said to be sweet or pleasant until they be connexed to some of
the five Senses, or to some of the affections of the Soul; as for example,
Psalm. 104. 34. my meditation of him shall be sweet, or my meditation shall be
connexed to him, namely, with delightful thoughts.

4 Gnereb is put for a league of amity, or of confederation between two
parties, for offense or defense. Eze. 20. 5. Jer. 25. 20, 24. Jer. 50. 37. and
in this manner those Egyptians that joined themselves to the Israelites at
their departure are called Gnereb, Exodus 12. 38. and yet they might still be
distinguished from the Israelites; in like manner after their return from
their Captivity in Babylon, Nehemiah charged the Jews to separate the Heathen
people from them, which they had joined to them in way of Marriage, and they
are called Gnereb, Neh. 13. 3.

5 Gnereb is put for the connection of two parties in a contract of Suertyship,
Genesis 43. 9. Genesis 44. 32. Prove. 11. 15. and in this respect Gnereb is also put
for answering to another; namely, as a Surety with another, Prove. 6. 1. and so
Gnarbaiim in the duall number is likewise put for a contract between two
Persons, namely, when two persons do join their hands together in token of a
contract, Prove. 22. 26.

And in this respect also Gnereb is put for a pledge by a Metonymia of the
sign for the thing signified, because a pledge is given to bind the Covenant
or Contract between two Parties, Genesis 38. 17, 18, 20.

Gnereb is also put for Hostages, by the Figure Metonymia, because Hostages are
given to bind the Covenant, or Contract that is made between two Parties, 2
King. 14. 14. 2 Chro. 25. 24. Gnereb is also put for a Morgage, by the Figure
Metonymia, because the thing Morgaged is given to bind the Contract between
two parties, Neh. 5. 3.

Also a derivative of Gnereb is put for wicked persons, that join together in
a Conspiracy against lawful Authority, Prove. 24. 25. My son, meddle not with
them that are given to change; but it may be better read, Meddle not (by way of
association) with them that are Conspirators, for that is a dangerous
conjunction.

Gnereb is also put for any engagement by way of Covenant, Promise, or
Contract, and in this sense it is put for the conjunction of Christ's heart, in
a sweet Covenant to do his Fathers will, for Man's redemption, Jer. 30. 21. Who
is this that has engaged his heart to approach unto me says the Lord, or that
has connexed his heart, namely in a sweet Covenant, to approach unto me says
the Lord? and in the former clause Christ draws near unto God for all his
seed. See Ainsw. in Psalm. 148. 14. Lo I come (says Christ) to do thy will O
God, thy Law is in my heart, Psalm. 40. 8. Heb. 10. 7.

6 Gnereb is put for the woofe of any Cloth, because it is connexed to the
warp, Lev. 13. 48, 49. 51. 53. 56, 57. 59. but this connection may easily be
cleared from being a confused mixture, because the plague of Leprosy might be
in the Woofe distinctly, and not in the Warp. See Ains. in Lev. 13. 48.

7 Gnereb is put for a conjunction of several swarms of noisome Creatures,
which were miraculously combined together with one consent, to plague the
Egyptians, Exodus 8. 21, 22. 24. 29. 31. Psalm. 77. 44. Psalm. 105. 31.
Interpretors cannot find out the several kinds of these Swarms, because
they are not specified in the text; but in general, there were swarms of
venomous Flies that did plague them in their houses, and there were swarms of
venomous Creatures, and swarms of ravenous Creatures that did plague them
without doors in the Fields, for the twenty fourth verse does tell us, that
they were plagued in all the parts of the Land; but this conjunction of these
several sorts of swarms may easily be cleared from confounding their kinds,
for out of doubt every kind of Swarm did keep it self distinct from confused
mixture with other kinds; Swarms of Flies kept by themselves, swarms of
Serpents by themselves, swarms of Wolves, and swarms of Lions by themselves,
yet all these Swarms were connexed together in their endeavors to plague the
Egyptians. By this interpretation there was no confused mixture among these
Swarms, as some do very unadvisedly expound the word Gnereb in this place to
signify.

8 Gnereb is put for a Desert, or a Wilderness, Es. 41. 19. for a thirsty
land, Es. 35. 7. for a dry land, Jer. 50. 12. Ier. 51. 43. or for an unknown
land, Ier. 2. 6.

All these translated terms are Figurative, the continent is put for the
connection of the several things that are contained in it; and our Savior does
teach us how we must connex and couple the things of the Wilderness together,
in Luke 3. 5. compared with Es. 40. 3* 4. where the things of Gnereb are thus
connexed; Mountains and Hills are connexed to valleys, rough places are
connexed to Plains, or smooth ground, and there are diverse other connexions in
Gnereb the Wilderness, for there are diverse kinds of wild Creatures that are
connexed together in a Neighbourly cohabitation, without confounding any of
their distinct kinds, as Deuteronomy. 8. 15. Mar. 1. 13.

And there are also sundry sorts of Trees growing in a pleasant Neighborhood
together, in their several borders, Es. 41. 19. and therefore Willow trees are
called Gnereb, and Gnarbaiim in the duall number, either because of the
twyparty colored leaf, or else because they do usually grow on both sides of
the Brooks in a pleasant Neighborhood together, Es. 15. 7. Lev. 23. 40.

In Gnereb the Desert also, there is a connection of many miseries which do
often fall together on poor Travellours, Ier. 2. 6. with Deuteronomy. 8. 15.

And by the Figure Synecdoche any particular thing of the Desert may be called
Gnereb; as for example, the Wolf is called the Wolf of Gnereb, and the
Wolf of Gnaraboth, in the plural number, Ier. 5. 6. because all
VVildernesses are inhabited with VVolfes.

In this regard I cannot but wonder why some Translators do translate, Hab. 1.
8. and Zeph. 3. 3. the Wolf of the Evening, seeing Gnereb has relation to
any connexture, either of places, or of persons, or of things, as well as of
the two parts of time in the Natural day, and therefore Gnereb ought not to be
translated the Evening in any place of the Bible, but in those places only that
have relation to time, namely to the Evening of the Natural day; but the
Wolf is not, nor ought not to be called Gnereb in relation to the time of the
Evening of the Natural day, for the Wolf does not hunt after his prey more
in the Evening than in the Morning, nay he does rather seek his prey more in
the Morning than in the Evening, as Jacob does tell us in his allusive
Prophecy, Genesis 49. 27. it is fitter therefore to interpret the Wolf of
Gnereb, with relation to the place of his abode, namely to Gnereb the
Wilderness, rather than to Gnereb the Evening, and in that respect the
seventy Interpreters, in Hab. 1. 8. and in Zeph. 3. 3. do call them the
Wolves of Arabia, because of the manifold companies, and confederacy that is
among them in the Deserts of Arabia.

9 Gnereb is put for the Continent it self of Arabia, 2 Chro. 9. 14. because
in that Continent there were diverse sorts of people that had Kings over them
that were connexed, combined, and confederated together in leagues offensive,
and defensive, and in that respect they are called the Kings of Gnereb, or the
Kings of Arabia, the continent being put for the consederates therein
contained, for Arab, in 2 Chronicles. 9. 14. is written Aereb, in 1 King. 10. 15.
which does properly signify a connexed multitude. See Ainsw. in Genesis 10. 7.
and the Aethiopians in 2 King. 19. 9. and in 2 Chronicles. 14. 9. 12. are called
Cushites of Arabia, by Sir Wall. Rawley, p. 151. 154.

10 Gnereb is also put for several sorts of people, that lived in near
cohabitation together in Arabia, Es. 13. 20. and in that respect the Midianites
(because they were inhabitants in some part of Arabia) are called Arabians. See
Tremelius in Hab. 3. 7. and in that respect Moses his Midianitish Wife is
called an Ethiopian, in Number. 12. 1. and because in that continent there lived
diverse other sorts of people in cohabitation, therefore they are called Gnereb,
for there lived the Posterity of Saba and Havilah, of Sab^ah, Regmah, and
Sabteca, and many others, all which are called Gnereb (or Arabians) that is to
say, a connexed people by a neighbourly cohabitation. See Ainsw. in Genesis 10. 7.
and in Genesis 37. 25.

11 The Raven also, and all sorts of Crows are called Gnereb, because all the
kinds of them are oftentimes connexed together in flocks, and also because
some of their kinds are party-colored; I have seen sundry sorts of Crows
together in flocks, and some of them were party-colored, namely, white and
black like Pyes, and Pyes are a sort of Crows. See Ains. in Lev. 11. 15.

These several instances do plainly evidence, that Gnereb must not be taken
for a confused mixing, or mingling of things together, whereby the distinct
species may be confounded, as wine and water mixed together are, but it must be
taken for such a mixing as is no other but a connection of distinct species.

This explanation of Gnereb does lead us by the hand to the right understanding
of Gnereb in Genesis 1. 5. namely, that it signifies the connection of the latter
half of the Artificial day with the first half of the Night; this part of
the Natural day our Ancestors did most fitly call the Evening; First, because
Our Ancestors held Gnereb the Evening to be at all times of the year an even
and equal part of time to Boker the morning.
it was the even or equal part to Boker the morning. And Secondly, our
Ancestors held the Evening to be a distinct and differing portion of time from
the time called Night; and indeed experience does tell us, that the Night is
not always an Even part of time to the Artificial day, that it is many times
longer, and many times shorter than the day; but the Evening as it is taken
from midday to midnight, is always an even or equal part of time to Boker the
Morning, Summer and Winter, all the world over, and therefore our Ancestors
could not so fitly have called the whole night an Evening, in relation to the
Artificial day, as most would have them speak, though upon better advice they
will now think otherwise.

Obj. 3. What need is there to make Gnereb comprehend such a large portion of
time, as is the connection of the latter half of the Artificial day, to the
first half of the Night; will not that little piece of light which remains
after Sunset, and which is connexed to the Night, sufficiently serve to make
up the true composition of Gnereb the Evening?

Answ. Our dispute did arise at first about the first Darkness, whether Moses,
in Genesis 1. 5. did call it Gnereb the Evening or no? I told you no, because it
was pure darkness without any connection of light at the beginning of it, and
Gnereb the Evening is often put by the Figure Synecdoche for that half of the
Evening, called the latter Evening, which does always begin at Sunset.
when God created the Light to shine out of Darkness, God called that Light
(when it had run the course of twelve hours) Day, and the first half of it,
with the first darkness, he did at last call it Boker the Morning (namely
after the whole time of the Natural day had run its course, and after the
Darkness was formed into a Night.) Hence it follows, that the composition of
Gnereb was formed first from the latter half of the Artificial day, and from
the first half of the Night; but that little piece of light that remains
after Sunset is no part of the Artificial day (which is due to Gnereb) but it
is a true part of the Night, and it is presently confounded with darkness, and
it is therefore called Twilight, and therefore it cannot fitly be called
Gnereb. 2 I answer; That seeing Gnereb is half Day and half Gnereb the
Evening is often by the Figure Synecdoche put for the Sunset evening, so it is
also put by the Figure Metonymia for the West.
Night, it often comes to pass that any one of these parts is called Gnereb
the Evening, by the Figure Synecdoche, and both parts together is often called
the two Evenings; the first Evening takes its beginning at midday, and the
latter Evening begins at Sunset, which does always set due West when the
days are in the Equinoctial, and in that respect our English Translators do
put the West for Gnereb, in Dan. 8. 5. but Tremelius does there put Sunset for
Gnereb, and the seventy in that place do put the South-west Wind for Gnereb,
(and that Wind is one of the four Winds of Heaven, into which the Kingdom of
Alexander was divided after his death, as Daniel prophesied, Dan. 8. 8.) And
truly, seeing the South-west Wind proceeds indifferently both from the South,
and from the West conjoined, it does most fitly answer to the conjunction or
connection of Gnereb; but it is evident that Gnereb is often put for the West by
the Figure Metonymia, 1 Chronicles. 7. 28. 1 Chronicles. 12. 15. 1 Chronicles. 26. 16. 18. 30.
and often elsewhere, and in this respect the Twilight is contained within that
portion of time which is called Gnereb, but yet the Twilight by it self is
never called Gnereb, but two other Hebrew words are used to express the time of
Twilight, as I noted before.

3 Gnereb is Figuratively put by Translators for the plains of Moab, near
Jericho, Number. 33. 48, 49, 50. Numb. 36. 13. Deuteronomy. 1. 1. Deuteronomy. 11. 30. because
they lie West at the setting of the Sun, where the latter Evening does begin,
but the seventy in all the said places do put the West for Gnereb, because the
situation of the plains of Moab lay in the West part of Canaan, at the going
down of the Sun; from whence the latter evening does begin; but see more of
this latter evening in chap. 4. in the answer to Obj. 2.

4 Gnereb the Evening is Figuratively put for the last times, Gnereb the
Evening is often put for the last days, and for the last end of a thing.
Genesis 49. 27. because the time of Gnereb the Evening does follow after the time
called Boker the Morning. See more in Chap. 3. in Ans. to Obj. 1.

5 Gnereb is Figuratively put for the last days, even for the days of the
Gospel, called in Zach. 14. 7. the Evening time, In the Evening time it shall
be light; the allusion is most fit and proper to the first Evening, which does
always begin at Midday, at the first declining of the Sun, and then the Sun
is in its greatest strength both for light and heat; and then Christ Jesus
appeared to Paul for his conversion, that he might send him among the Gentiles
that sat in darkness, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to
light, and from the power of Satan to God, Act. 22. 6, 14. Act. 26. 13, 18. and
he made the word of God to abound through a great part of the world, even from
Jerusalem to Illiricum, Romans 15. 19. In this evening time of the world, the
Gospel did shine in its full strength, for now Christ and his twelve Apostles,
and seventy Disciples, and diverse other Prophets and Teachers, did confirm
their doctrine with signs and wonders, to the conversion of many ten thousand
souls that formerly sat in darkness under the power of Satan.

6 Gnereb is put for the last end of a thing, as in Isa. 24. 11. The mirth of
the land is (Gnereb, that is to say) ceased or ended; And in this sense Matthew
puts the evening of the Sabbaths (in the plural number) for the end of the
week, Mat. 28. 1. for the Jews used to date all the days of the week from the
Sabbath day, in this order, the first of the Sabbath, the second of the
Sabbath, and so on till the week ended with the Sabbath it self. In like sort
they did sometimes call the whole week the Sabbath, and the seven weeks to
Penticost they called seven Sabbaths, Levit. 23. 15. and the Pharisee said, I
fast twice in the Sabbath, Luke 18. 12. or, twice in the week; now if the
Evening had been the beginning of the Natural day, then all these allusions
from Gnereb to the last times, or to the last end of a thing, had been very
improper and very absurd.

7 Gnereb, by the figure Synecdoche, is often put for any particular hour in
the afternoon, or in the beginning of the night, for the Jews were to transact
many Civil and many Religious actions in the several hours of Gnereb, the
Evening, and in that respect any of those hours may be called Gnereb, the
Evening: But at first when Moses did conjoyn and set together all the parts and
parcels of the first natural day, No question but he did use Gnereb in its full
and proper sense for the conjunction of the latter half of the Artificial day,
with the first half of the night, as the even and equal part of time to Boker
the morning; and that is the thing which I mainly aim at in all my discourse
upon Gnereb.

SECT. 2. It is further evident that Gnereb must be taken for such a connection
of things, as does still preserve the Species distinct, because Gnarbaiim in
the duall number is put for the connection of any two things without confounding
their species; But especially it is Eleven times over put for the two parts of
the Natural Evening.
I Find upon search, that Gnereb, the Evening, is eleven times over called
Gnarbaiim in the duall number, because the God of Nature had from the first day
divided the natural Evening into two parts, which are rightly called the two
Evenings by many Translators.

These two Evenings were famously known to all the Jews in Egypt; for when
Moses commanded them to kill the Passover between the two Evenings, Exodus 12.
6. he did not explain what he meant by the two Evenings, he did not make any
circumstantiall description of them, which had been necessary if they had not
been familiarly acquainted with the several limits of them; but he does only
barely name them as a thing that was familiarly known to them.

Five times over the Lord commanded them to sacrifise all their Passeovers
between the two Evenings, Exodus 12. 6. Levit. 23. 5. Numb. 9. 3, 5, 11. and
four times over the Lord commanded them to sacrifise the daily Evening
sacrifice between the two Evenings, Exodus 29. 39, 41. Number. 28. 4, 8.

Solomon Jarchi describes the two Evenings thus, from the sixth hour (which is
at Midday and upwards) it is called between the two Evenings, for that the Sun
declineth toward his going down, etc. between the Evening of the Day and the
Evening of the Night; The Evening of the Day is from the beginning of the
seventh hour, and the Evening of the Night, is when the night begins, See
Ains. in Number. 9. 3.

And Aben Ezra on Exodus 12. says, There is the Evening of the Sun, and the
Evening of the Night, when the shining of the Sun is gone from off the Earth.

And Rab. David in Perek A^oth chapter 5. says, There is the Evening of the Suns
declining, and the Evening of the Suns setting.

His meaning is according to other Hebrew Doctors, namely, that the Evening of
the Suns declining, begins at the first declining of the Sun at Midday, and
that the Evening of the Suns setting does begin then.

And Buxtorfius in his Hebrew Lexicon upon the word Gnarbaiim does cite other
Hebrew Canons to this very purpose; But I shall refer you to Chap. 5. for a
further description of the two Evenings, where I explain the Passover Evening.

I have already cited nine places of Scripture, where the term of two Evenings
is cited in the Hebrew text, and now I will cite two places more: The Priests
were commanded to light up their Lamps between the two Evenings, Exodus 30. 8.
and the Quails came between the two Evenings, Exodus 16. 12. Also I find one
clear example of the two Evenings in the New Testament, in one and the same
day; It is said in Matthew. 14. 15. When it was evening the Disciples came to him
and said, the time is now past (that is to say, it is now past dinner time)
send the multitude away; But Christ did not send them away until he had first
made them dine, and after they had well dined, then he sent them away: After
this Evening Christ went up into a mountain to pray, and then it is said
again, When the Evening was come, he was there alone, ver. 23. This Evening
in ver. 23. is another Evening besides that in verse. 15. and between these two
Evenings Christ did a long action, for he fed many thousands plentifully; And
thus I have proved by a Jury of twelve Witnesses that the natural Evening is
divided into two Evenings, and I have set out the limits of the first Evening
by the testimony of the Hebrew Doctors from Midday till Sunset, and the
latter Evening begins at Sunset, and ends at midnight, and both these
Evenings are called Gnarbaiim in the duall number; that is say, the Twy-party
Evening; for so Gnarbaiim in the duall number must be understood, as it appears
by the like form of speech, where the Scripture sets out the twy-party
connexture of other things, as for example, Ramath in mount Ephraim, 1 Samuel 1.
19. is called Ramothaim in the dual number, 1 Samuel 1. 1. some Translators
render it the two Ramaths in mount Ephraim, but indeed they are deceived, for
there is but one Ramath in Mount Ephraim, and that Ramath is called Ramothaim
in the dual number, because it had two parts, and so Jerusalem is usually
called Jerusalaim in the duall number, 2 Samuel 5. 6, 7. Psalm. 51. 18. not because
there were two Jerusalems, but because the City Jerusalem had two principal
parts; for first, There was the City of the people on the one part; and
secondly, There was the City of David and mount Zion on the other part; but
neither of these parts alone could properly be called the City of Jerusalem,
but both parts must be put together to make up the full City Jerusalem; and in
this respect it might well be called the double Jerusalem, or the twy-party
Jerusalem; the like may be said of Ramothaim, for there was but one City in
Mount Ephraim that was called Ramath, as verse. 19. tells us, But this City was
called Ramothaim in the duall number, because it had two principal parts.
First, There was the City of the people on the one part; And secondly, There
was Naioth in Ramath on the other part where the High place was, and where
Samuel dwelt, and kept a Prophets School, 2 Samuel 19. 18, 19. But neither of
these parts could properly be called the full City Ramath, but both of them
together did make up the full City Ramath. So also Diblath, Ezekiel. 6. 14. is
Diblathaim, Jerm. 48. 22. And so Gnereb the Evening is sometimes called
Gnarbaiim the two Evenings, but neither of those two Evenings taken a part can
properly be called Gnereb the full natural Evening, as it is meant in Genesis 1.
5. but both of them put together do make up the full natural Evening; and in
this respect Gnarbaiim may be translated the twofold evening or the twy-party
evening, as well as the two Evenings, because indeed there is but one natural
Evening, which is divided by the time of Sunset into two principal parts. It
is therefore but a wooden shift of some Scholars to call the first Evening an
improper Evening, and to call the latter Evening only the full natural
Evening: The like wooden shift it is to make no other part of time to be
called Gnereb properly, but the very beginning of the Night, or of the later
Evening only, as some do interpret Junius Annotation on Genesis 1. 5. to speak.

2. If the Holy Spirit had framed Gnarbaiim, to set out both a proper and an
improper Evening with one and the same voice and breath, then doubtless the
seventy Translators being Hebrew The seventy Interpreters do make the two
Evenings to be but one proper Evening.
Doctors would have found it out, and then they would have described the
various acceptance of the word, by some mark of distinction or other,
especially considering they took liberty to vary the term of their translation
from Gnarbaiim, for they do never fully express the term Gnarbaiim the two
Evenings in any place, but nine times over they translate it by the single term
Evening, and therefore if they had accounted the first part of it to have been
an improper Evening, and the latter part only proper, then doubtless they
would somewhere or other have given some mark of distinction whereby to know
them asunder, especially seeing they take liberty to alter the phrase; But it
seems to me they accounted both the parts of Gnarbaiim to be but one proper
natural Evening, because they do nine times over translate Gnarbaiim by the
single term Evening. I confess they do once after a sort set out the two
parts of Gnarbaiim in Lev. 23. 5. for there the Seventy read the Text thus. In
the fourteenth day of the month, between the middle of those things that belong
to the Evening; in this translation they do not fully name the two Evenings,
but yet after a sort they do name the two Evenings, because they say between
the middle of those things that belong to the Evening; their meaning must be
this, In the beginning of the Passover Evening, they in the first place did
offer the daily evening Sacrifice, burn Incense, trim the Lamps, etc.
Secondly, As soon as the latter evening was come (which did, always begin at
Sunset) they began to feast upon the flesh of their Passeovers, and of their
Peace Offerings, in a solemn religious manner: Now between, or in the middle of
these things all their Passeovers were sacrificed. And thus by this
Interpretation it appears evidently that the seventy Translators held Gnarbaiim
to be but one proper natural evening divided into two princiall parts, because
they called that which was done between the two evenings, the middle of the
evening in the singular number. Therefore I may well conclude, that their
distinction is absurd, that make the first part of Gnarbaiim to be no more but
an improper evening, and that make the latter part only proper. I think no man
that is well advised can find any harmony in the Scripture by this
Interpretation.

3. It is also evident that Gnereb the Evening, is as large in length of time
as Gnarbaiim the two Evenings is; for not only The Hebrew text does make the
two Evenings to be but one proper Evening.
the Seventy do translate Gnarbaiim, by the single term Evening; but the Hebrew
Text it self does often put Gnereb for Gnarbaiim interchangeably, as for
example, four places of Scripture do command them to offer the daily evening
Sacrifice between the two evenings, but many more places say it should be done
or sacrificed in Gnereb the evening; five places command all the Passeovers to
be sacrificed between the two evenings, but more places say it shall be done or
sacrificed in Gnereb the evening; one place says, that the Priests must cause
the Lamps to burn between the two evenings, but other places say in the
evening; one place says the Quails came between the two evenings, but other
places say they came in Gnereb the evening: Therefore Gnereb and Gnarbaiim is
but one proper evening; Gnereb is as large in time as Gnarbaiim is, both parts
together make up the true and proper natural evening called Gnereb.

Hence I conclude, that the Hebrew word Gnereb does not The two parts of Gnereb
exemplified.
signify such a confused mixture as is between light and darkness in the
Twilight; but it signifies such a distinct connection of Day and Night together,
as may be called Gnarbaiim, the two evenings, and such a connection as may be
distinguished or severed from each other into two distinct parts: as I may
exemplify the matter by a party-colored coat, one half is white and the other
half is black; so is Gnereb the evening, the first half is white called day,
and the other half is black called night, and the time of Twilight that
couples these two evenings together, may be likened to the seam that couples
the white and black pieces together for the completing of the party-colored
coat. Or thus, the two parts of Gnereb may be exemplified by the cloud that
stood between the Israelites and the Egyptians; the one half of the cloud was
light toward the Israelites, and the other half was dark toward the
Egyptians, Exodus 14. 20. So is Gnereb, the natural evening, the first half is
light called day, and the other half is dark called night.

But if the natural evening had been nothing else but night, as most
Interpreters do affirm upon Genesis 1. 5. then all evening Sacrifices must have
been offered in the night time only; but the Hebrew Doctors will laugh that
opinion to scorn as a foul absurdity; for after Sunset (say they) the blood
of all Sacrifices became unlawful, see Ains. in Lev. 6. 9. (they mean it only
of all evening Sacrifices) and therefore it was a foul mistake in K. James's
Translators to translate Gnereb by the word night, ^n Lev. 6. 20. they say that
Aarons Meat Offering was offered half^ of it in the morning, and half of it at
night, so also they put night for Gnereb, in Genesis 49. 27. and in Job 7. 4. and
in Psalm. 30. 5. and the Geneva Translators do the like, in Genesis 49. 27. and in
Lev. 6. 20. and often elsewhere: but I believe, themselves better advised would
alter it, and though the 70 Translators do take liberty to render Gnereb in
differing terms, yet they never do translate Gnereb by the word Night, because
the night in propriety of speech can not agree to the composition of Gnereb, in
Genesis 1. 5.

SECT. III. Proving by seven demonstrative grounds, that the Natural Evening
begins at Midday at the first declining of the Sun.
THe first Scripture by which I prove that the Natural Evening does begin at
Midday, at the first declining of the Sun, is from Jeremy, whose speech is
both plain and elegant, Jeremy speaks thus in the person of the Babylonian
Soldiers, Arise, let us go up at noon; woe unto us, for the day declineth, and
the shadows of the evening are stretched out, Jer. 6. 4. These words are
spoken by way of allusion; but yet two phrases are remarkable in this Text. 1.
The day declineth. 2. The shadows of the evening are stretched out; both these
terms are Synonima, and mean the same time of the day; for as soon as the day
begins to decline, the shadows of the evening begin to be stretched out. Hence
then it follows, 1. That the evening does begin as soon as the day begins to
decline. 2. That the shadows of the evening do begin to stretch themselves as
soon as the sun which rules the day, does begin first to decline.

Jeremy speaks these words in the person of the Babylonian Soldiers who made
haste to destroy the Jews by the Noontide, but when they were upon their
march they saw they were like to come short of the appointed time, and
therefore they cry out in an angry passion, Woe unto us, for the day declineth,
and the shadows of the evening are stretched out. The Prophet speaks this by
way of Prosopopeia; yet there must be a real truth in the allusion.

Secondly, I prove that the natural Evening begins at Midday, at the first
declining of the Sun, by Matthew. 14. 15. When the Evening was come; Luke
expounds this evening to be come, when the day began to go down or decline,
Luke 9. 12. So Mr. Broughton renders the Text: And when else does the day first
begin to go down or decline, but when the Sun that rules the Day does first
begin to go down or decline? as is above observed from Jer. 6. 4. And
experience does tell us, that the Sun does first begin to decline at midday,
and that it continues declining till Sunset; So then, from the term Evening in
Matthew described by this adjunct in Luke, when the day begins to go down or
decline, it may truly be gathered by necessary consequence, that the natural
evening does begin at midday, at the first declining of the Sun; and this
evening has two parts, the first part begins at the first declining of the
Sun, as I have already expounded, v. 15. and another evening does begin at
Sunset, in v. 23.

Thirdly, I prove that the full natural evening begins at midday, at the first
declining of the Sun, by Deuteronomy. 16. 6. Thou shall sacrifice the Passover at
Evening, at the going down of the Sun, at the season thou came out of Egypt.
This Text is very pregnant to prove the point in question; but because I have
occasion to expound this Text at large in chap. 5. Therefore I refer the Reader
thither.

Fourthly, I prove that the full natural Evening begins at midday by 1 Samuel
20. 5. David does there entreat Jonathan to meet him on the third day at Even,
and it appears that Jonathan was very careful to observe the punctual beginning
of this appointed evening, because it was a matter of weight, and because David
depended upon his punctual observation of the precise time, therefore Jonathan
did confirm his promise by an oath, ver. 13. besides, David did over and above
all this charge Jonathan to come to him quickly or diligently, that is to say,
to be exact, and to keep the appointed time diligently or punctually, and
accordingly Jonathan did manifest his diligence to observe the punctual time,
as it is evident, because he went out into the field on the third day in the
Morning, which (says the Text) was at the time appointed with David, v. 35.

Object, 4. How can you make Jonathans Morning to be the appointed time with
David, seeing David did not appoint Jonathan to meet him on the third day in
the morning, but on the third day at even, as v. 5. testifies?

Answ. Jonathans morning was the appointed time with David, because Jonathans
morning did end at midday, and David's evening did begin at midday, at the
first declining of the Sun: now Jonathan could not have come quickly,
diligently, exactly and punctually to the place appointed at the beginning of
the evening, unless he went out on the third day morning, that is to say, a
little before the evening began; but by his diligence in taking in a little
piece of the morning at the beginning of his Journey, he might well be at the
place appointed according to the punctual time of the appointed Evening; and
thus Jonathans Morning and David's Evening do meet together at Midday, and no
other resolution can be given, as I conceive, to make Jonathans morning and
David's evening to agree together at one and the same appointed time but this.

Object. 5. Why may not the appointed evening be understood of the
night-evening, and the appointed place be a great way off, and in that respect
Jonathan might begin his journey in the morning, that so he might come to the
place appointed at the time of the Sunset evening?

Answ. I perceive that men are loath to have any other evening, but the
night-evening, and therefore they are willing to raise what Objections they can
against the midday evening: But I will give you diverse Reasons why the
appointed evening cannot be meant of the Sunset evening.

First, If the place of meeting had been so far off as to cause Jonathan to
spend so much time in going thither as from morning till Sunset, then Jonathan
could not have had time enough left to return back again into the City in the
same day. But the Text in ver. 23. does tell us that Jonathan did return the
same day into the City; therefore the appointed evening cannot be understood of
the sunset evening.

Secondly, Jonathan returned alone without any company with him, for he had
sent his Boy back into the City before, which in reason he would not have done,
if the place of meeting had been so far off as you make it.

Thirdly, Jonathan knew that Saul was jealous of his familiarity with David,
and he knew also that Saul was much enraged against David at this time;
Therefore in wisdom Jonathan would not be so long absent from Saul as from
morning till Sunset; nay, it would have been Midnight ere he could have
returned, if the place appointed to meet at had been so far off as you would
make it, and then Soul might well have suspected that Jonathan might have had
some other errand into the field besides shooting at a mark, by his long and
late absence; but Jonathan pretended no other errand but to shoot at a mark,
and therefore he took his Boy with him to witness so much if need should be.

1. Hence it follows, that the place of meeting was but a little way without
the City; for what need had a man go far to shoot at a Mark? and so it asked
but a little time to go to it, and to return from it.

2 Hence it follows, that the appointed Evening must be understood of the
Midday Evening, and not of the Sunset Evening: And thus Jonathans Morning and
David's Evening did fitly agree to the same appointed hour at Midday.

In like sort one Evangelist says that Christ was crucified at the third
hour, Mark. 15. 25. But John says he was crucified at the sixth hour, Joh. 19.
14. this differing relation of time, may seem to have as great a difference as
is between Jonathans Morning and David's Evening, and yet there is no difference
at all when things come to be rightly expounded: For the Jews divided the
Artificial Day into four great Hours, just as they divided the Night into four
great Watches, Mark. The Jews divided the day into four great hours, as they
divided the night into four watches.
13. 35. every great hour contained in it three small hours; The first great
hour they called by the name of the third hour, because it ended with the third
small hour, which we call nine a clock; and their second great hour they called
their sixth, because it ended with the sixth small hour, which we call twelve a
clock; and thus as soon as the first great hour ended with our nine a clock,
the second great hour began with our ten a clock: And thus Peter Martyr in the
Judges, Mr. Godwin, and Mr. Weames, do accord these great hours with our small
hours, and just after this sort the end of Jonathans Morning in v. 35. and the
beginnings of David's Evening in v. 5. do fitly close and meet together at
Midday.

Fifthly, I prove that the natural Evening does begin at Midday, by Josh. 7.
6. There Joshua and the Elders fell down upon the Earth before the Ark of the
Lord till Even-tide, that is to say until Evening began.

Object. 6. This Even-tide must be understood of the Sunset Evening.

Answ. I answer no, it cannot be understood of the Sunset Evening, for Joshua
had much business to do after this, which must be done before the time of
Sunset, for the Lord commanded Joshua to sanctify the people against the
morrow, Verse. 13, 14. But Joshua could not sanctify them at the Sunset
Evening, for then the day of their cleanness must begin, by the order of the
Leviticall Law; they must therefore be washed from their defilements in the
afternoon, or else they could not begin the day of their cleanness at their
Sunset Evening; and in case they did not begin the new day of their cleanness
at Sunset, they might not come before the Lord's Ark on the morrow to beg
Atonement for Transgressors, as I have opened the matter more at large in
Chap. 4.

Now Joshua could not have sanctified the people in a fit manner to come before
the Lords Ark on the morrow, if he had lain still upon the earth till the
Even-tide at Sunset; for Joshua must have a large time to inform all the
people by a Proclamation through all the Camp, what was the cause of the Lords
anger, and what they must do by way of preparation before they could obtain the
Lords favor: The thing they must do by way of preparation was to sanctify
themselves from their Ceremonial defilements, by washing their Bodies and their
Clothes according to the Ceremonial customs, as they are set down in Exodus 19.
10. Genesis 35. 2. and this must be done in the same Even-tide wherein the Lord
spoke to Joshua and to the Elders, saying, Up, and sanctify the people, and
say, sanctify your selves against to morrow, Verse. 13. Now then consider the
time that must be taken up for this Proclamation throughout all the Camp, and
consider the time they must have for the washing of all their Bodies and their
Clothes before Sunset, and then it will necessarily force us to understand
this Even-tide of the Noontide Evening, and not of the Sunset Evening.

Sixthly, I prove, That the full natural Evening begins at Midday when the
Afternoon begins, because the Evening in Scripture is often put for the
Afternoon, as the morning is put for the Forenoon: In the morning sow thy seed,
and in the Evening let not thy hand rest, Eccles. 11. 6. Solomon's meaning is,
that men should be as diligent in doing good at all times, as the Husbandman is
in seed-time; he will not rest from sowing his seed neither Forenoon nor
afternoon, because he knows not which will prove best. A wise and diligent
Husbandman will go out to sow his seed in the afternoon Evening, and not defer
it till the Sunset Evening; therefore by Solomon's account the Evening begins
with the Afternoon at Midday.

2. It is said Psalm. 90. 6. In the morning the grass flourishes and grows
up, but in the evening it is cut down and withers: The Husbandman does not
use to go out to mow his grass in the evening after Sunset, or if he
sometimes do so, yet it does not wither in the evening after Sunset; But
Husbandmen use to take the opportunity to mow their grass in the afternoon,
and then it withers, therefore the Evening begins with the afternoon.

3. It is said in 1 Samuel 17. 16. that Goliath drew near Morning and Evening
forty days together: But Soldiers do not use to call for a Pitched Battle in
the evening after Sunset, but either in the Forenoon or in the Afternoon
Evening.

4. It is said 1 King 17. 6. That the Ravens brought bread and flesh to Elijah
morning and evening: but the Ravens do not use to carry meat in the evening
after Sunset, for then they use to fly to their Roost, and so to continue
there all night; Therefore the Ravens carried meat to Elijah in the Afternoon
Evening.

Seventhly, Paul sent for the Jews in Rome to come to his Iodging that he might
testify unto them the things of the Kingdom of God, and that he might
persuade them concerning Jesus, and they came at the day appointed, and then
Paul preached unto them from morning till evening, Act. 28. 23. But I think no
deliberate man will say that Paul continued his Sermon to that mixed multitude
from the morning light, till the evening at Sunset: The hungry bellies and
captious spirits of most of these Jews would not endure it; neither would
Paul's wisdom nor his strength suffer him to offer it, especially seeing the
Jews of this Synagogue had beforehand manifested to Paul their dislike of
this Sect, verse. 22.

These circumstances considered, this phrase from morning till evening must be
understood of a convenient portion of time for one Sermon. It is like they came
to Paul's lodging at the ordinary hour wherein they used to resort to their
Synagogues, about nine a clock in the morning, and it is like also that Paul
continued his Sermon to them till the Noontide evening, a little more or
less, as in wisdom he thought it convenient, all circumstances considered, and
in likelihood the Jews would not appoint to meet at Paul's lodging before the
ordinary hour of morning prayer, nor be contented to stay longer than
Dinnertime, when the Evening begins, at Midday; therefore it may be gathered
by probable conjecture, that the evening began at Midday in Rome as well as in
Judea.

The first Natural Day is divided two several ways by Moses in Genesis 1. 5.

1 Into Day and Night by the Line of Longitude.

2 Into Evening and Morning by the Line of Latitude.

The Hebrew word Gnereb in Genesis 1. 5. was well translated the Evening by our
Ancestors, because it is a connexture of so much Day and Night together as
makes up an even and equal part of time to Boker the morning. And secondly,
Because the Natural Evening is half Day and half Night, therefore Moses does
eleven times over call it the two Evenings, as it is noted in Chap. 2. Sect. 2.

SECT. 4. Bring a Description of the twofold Division of the first Natural
Day, how and in what order every part of it was shaped, named and framed
together.
THe first Natural day in Genesis 1. 5, was twice divided by Moses, just according
to the Lines of Longitude and Latitude in the Globe, and it was shaped and
framed together in this order.

Take a piece of paper and pourtray upon it the shape or image of a compass
Dial. Then first shadow out upon it the first darkness from the North point
almost to the East point.

2. Then shadow out a little piece of Twilight to fill it up to the East point,
as a sign that the light did thence break out of darkness by degrees.

3. Then shadow out a piece of light of six hours long, for the ascending of
the shining light from the East point to the South point.

4. Then make a mark of distinction at the South point for the standing still
of the light for a little while at Midday.

5. Then shadow out another piece of light of six hours long for the declining
of the light from the South point to the West point.

6 Then write upon all this shining light from the East point to the West
point, the name Day, as the proper name of his perfect shape and limit; and in
this order was the first Artificial Day shaped out, limited, and named.

7. Then shadow out a little piece of Twilight, at the departure of the light
out of that Horizon, on the inside of the West point.

8. Then take twelve hours darkness, and shadow out the first half of that
Darkness from the West point until it meet with the place of the first
darkness at the North point.

9. Then write upon all that Darkness from the West point to the East point,
the name Night, as the proper name of its perfect shape and limit, and in this
order was the night last shaped out, limited and named. Then let the other half
of the last twelve hours Darkness be set upon the outside of the same
Compass Dial, from the North point to the East point, for the beginning of
the second Day.

10. Hence we may observe the Reason why the first Darkness could not be called
Night at first, namely, because it wanted the form and limits of a Night, for
it wanted the shape of a twilight going before it, and therefore until it had
obtained that, it was called nothing else but confused darkness, and it could
not have this form til the last period of time belonging to the night was
finished; and it could not have that period till the first half of that twelve
hours darkness succeeding the Artificial Day had met with the first darkness
at the North point, and that conjunction occasioned a mark of distinction in
the middle of the night.

11. By these marks of distinction, the true Form and Figure of the two Lines
of Longitude and Latitude, from East to West, and from North to South, were
clearly marked out.

12. By this Line of division from Midday to Midnight the Natural Day was
again divided into two equal parts (in a differing manner from the division of
the Day from the Night) the first half from Midday to Midnight was called
Gnereb, the Evening, and the other half from Midnight to Midday was called
Boker, the Morning,

13. After this sort has the God of Nature halfed and quartered the Natural
day by the Lines of Longitude and Latitude.

14 By this method the God of Nature has not only made the natural day to be a
twiparty day, consisting of light, and darkness; But also Secondly, He has
made the Artificial Day to be a twiparty day, because he has made the one half
of it to belong unto the Morning, and the other half of it to belong unto the
Evening. Thirdly, He has also made the Night to be a twiparty Night, because
he has made the one half of it to belong unto the Evening, and the other half
of it to belong unto the morning. And in this regard the night is sometimes
called nights in the plural number, Psalm. 134. 1. Psalm. 92. 2. Fourthly, He
has also made the Natural Evening to be a twiparty evening, because it is a
connection of the latter half of the Day, to the first half of the Night; and in
this respect it is called Gnereb, a connection, and sometimes it is called
Gnarbaiim, the two Evenings, because of the two parts of it. Fifthly, He has
also made the Natural Morning to be a twiparty Morning, because it is a
connection of the first darkness, or of the latter half of the night, with the
first half of the Artificial day, and in this respect it is often called
Mornings in the plural number, Psalm. 73. 14. Psalm. 101. 8. Job 7. 18. Lam. 3.
23. Is. 33. 2.

15. The Reason why the first darkness could not be called either Boker the
Morning, or Gnereb the Evening, at first, was, because these names are names of
the perfect shape and limits given unto these two parts of the Natural day; and
the first darkness was a confused misshapen thing at first, therefore it
could not belong either unto the Morning or unto the Evening, until it was
first shaped and limited into a night; for Boker the Morning is constituted of
a part of the shaped Night, as well as of a part of the shaped Artificial Day;
and the first darkness could not be shaped into a Night until it had twelve
hours darkness succeeding the Artificial Day, by means whereof the first half
had a Twilight going before it, and then as soon as it met with the first
darkness at the North point, it First gave perfection of shape to the Night.
And Secondly, It gave perfection of shape to the Evening. And thirdly, It gave
perfection of shape to Boker the Morning.

And accordingly, every part of this day had its name as soon as it had its
perfect shape; as for example, when the shining light had finished its last
period at the West point, it was called Day; in like sort, when the darkness
had finished its last period at the North point, it was called Night: And then
also the Evening and the Morning was the First Day.

Pharez and Zara were Twins, and when they came to their Birth, Zara thrust out
his hand first, thereupon the Midwise said this is first, and she did mark it
out for the first by a red thread; yet notwithstanding Pharez did finish his
Birth first, and thereupon he was first named Pharez, and Zara was last named
though he begun his Birth first: Even so, the time called Morning began its
birth first, but yet notwithstanding the time called Evening was first
perfected in its shape and limits, and thereupon it was first called Gnereb.

O the wonderful variety of Gods wisdom in contriving and setting together all
the parts and parcels of this first Natural Day!

CHAP. III. Proving that the time of the first Darkness was called Morning at
last, namely as soon as that Darkness was formed into a Night.
Moses does tell us, Genesis 1. 1, 2. That in the beginning God created the Heaven
and the Earth, and that darkness was upon the face of the deep, namely for the
space of six hours, before the light was created.

The Queston is, Whether this first Darkness was called Morning or Evening.

The Answer shall be framed into three Heads or Sections.

I. I will prove that the Creation began in that part of time which at last was
called Boker, the Morning. II. That the Morning begins in the dark Night. III.
That the Morning does begin at Midnight.
SECT. I. Proving that the time of the first Darkness was called Boker, the
Morning, at last.
FIrst, It appears to me that the first Darkness was called Boker, Boker the
morning does signify early.
the Morning, at last; namely, as soon as all the parts of the Natural Day were
formed: Because Boker, (the Morning) does signify Early, See Ains. in Psalm. 5.
4. and in this sense the Morning is put for the first opportunity of time for
any business, as in seeking unto God early by prayer, and in this sense David
says in Psa. 5. 3. Jehovah, in the morning (or early) I will direct my prayer
unto thee, and will look out (or epsy) as he that keeps watch and ward
expecting what God will answer; and the godly do often profess, that they will
look out early after God (by the term Morning) as in Psalm. 90. 14. and Psalm.
143. 8. and truly I conceive, that the only Reason why Bulls and Cows, And all
the Herds of that kind are called Baker (from whence Boker is derived) is from
their early seeking out for their meat from God, sooner than other Cattle use
to do: for in the Evening or in the beginning of the Night they use to sit down
and chew their Cud, but in the early Night-morning, they usually rise up and
seek out for food before other sorts of Cattle.

Object. 1. Boker, the Morning, is put for the beginning of the Artificial
Day, because that is the fittest season to seek out or (earth after things that
be lost, or after things that are to be sought after; men do not usually seek
after things in the dark, but as soon as the morning light appears, then they
begin to look and search after lost things, and hence the beginning of the
Artificial Day is called Boker, the Morning.

Answ. I see no Reason to restrain the signification of Boker to man's seeking
by the sight of his eyes, in the time of the Artificial Morning only, but
considering that Boker, the Morning, is placed among the works of Gods Creation
before man was created, it may be considered as Gods first early time in
ordering the Creation in the best manner; for God may be said to seek early
(after the manner of men) not for want of knowledge in particulars, but to set
out his Wisdom and Prudence, and Fatherly care, and the like, in the first
Creation, as these Scriptures do testify, Exodus 14. 24. 27. Ezekiel. 34. 11, 12,
16. Psa. 30. 6. Psa. 90. 14. Isa. 17. 14. Psalm. 119. 176. Zach. 12. 9.

For by Wisdom the Lord founded the Earth, and by Understanding he established
the Heavens, Prove. 3. 19. and so by Wisdom and Understanding he formed all the
parts of the First Day, in such an exquisite Order, that so it might be for an
exemplary pattern to all the other Natural days to the end of the world.
Secondly, Early seeking may be done by advice, counsel, and meditation, as well
in the time of darkness, as in the morning light. Thirdly, When it pleased the
Lord to uncreat Judah by his destroying Judgments (namely, by wars from the
Enemy) how did God order it to be done? but by his early looking out and
searching into things; For thus says the Lord, I looked upon the Earth, and
lo it was without form and void, and to the Heavens, and they had no light,
Jer. 4. 23. for by their wicked confused Government they had provoked the Lord
by wars to turn all their Commonwealth into a Chaos again. This form of speech
(by contraries) declares that God by his wise Providence did search out in the
time of the first darkness how to adorn the earth with light, and how to order
all the parts of the first day in the best manner, and in this respect Gods
early Providence is often set out by the term Morning, both in regard of his
early Judgments upon a people, and also in regard Boker, the Morning, is put
for Gods early seeking either to punish the wicked or protect the godly.
of his early Preservation of his own people.

1. His early and speedy Judgments upon the wicked are set out by the term
Morning, in Number. 16. 5. Zeph. 3. 5. Psalm. 73. 14 Ezekiel. 7. 7, 10. and so in Hos.
10. 15. In the morning shall the King of Israel be destroyed; and in this sense
I shall presently expound Isa. 47. 11.

2. The term Morning does often denote Gods early care and Providence in
looking out for the Protection of his people, Exodus 14. 24. Psalm. 46. 7.

Hence I infer, that seeing the word Morning does signify early seeking, or
early looking out, it may well denote unto us, that the first Darkness was not
comprehended under the term Evening, but under the term Morning, for Gnereb,
the Evening, is never put for early or first, but it is always put for late or
last, because it was the latter part of the Day, as I have showed in my Answer
to the third Objection of the former Chapter, and more by and by.

Secondly, It is further evident that the Morning time was first, As Gnereb the
Evening is put for last time: So Boker the Morning is put for the first time,
or for the beginning of a thing.
and the Evening last, by Genesis 49. 27. Benjamin shall ravine like a Woolf, in
the Morning he shall devour the prey, and in the Evening he shall divide the
spoil; The Seventy render it, The early Morning; and truly, seeing the first
Darkness had the priority of time before the Artificial Morning, it is not
proper to put the Artificial Morning for first in pre-eminence of time before
the first Darkness, and therefore in reason, the first Darkness must belong to
the early Morning, as well as the first half of the Artificial Day does, or
else Jacob did not make a proper Allusion to the Morning and to the Evening, if
the first Darkness had been Evening, for then the evening had been first in
order of time; search into the story of Events, and see how Jacobs Prophecy
does relate to the term Morning and Evening; the event of his P^ophecie lies
thus.

1. Ehud of Benjamin was raised up by God like a Woolf in the early morning to
devour the Moabites, and to deliver Israel, Judge. 3. 15. Then God did also
raise up Hester and M^rdecai of Benjamin like a Woolf as it were in the
Artificial Morning, to deliver the Jews, and to devour Ha^an and all his
Confederates in a hundred twenty seven Provinces, H^st. 8. and Hest. 9.

2. In the Evening-time of the world God raised up Paul of Benjamin to divide
the spoil with the other Apostles, by the preaching of the Gospel, for Paul is
said to make the Word of God to abound from Jerusalem to Illyricum, Romans 15.
19. and it is further evident that the days of the Gospel are called the
Evening, by Zeph. 2. 7. the Prophet does there foretell that there shall be a
remnant of the Jews (namely of the dispersed Jews dwelling in several
Countries) that shall be called to rest or lie down in the Evening, and to this
remnant of dispersed Jews did Peter and James write in the Evening-time of the
Gospel to exhort them to rest and repose their Souls in Christ for Life and
Salvation.

Zachary also does use the term Evening for the last times, namely, for the
days of the Gospel, and in that respect the time of the Gospel is often called
the last days, Isa. 2. 2. Jer. 30. 24. Heb. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 1. 5. 20. Zacharies
phrase runs thus, In the Evening time it shall be light, Zach. 14. 7. It is
very suitable to compare the last days of the Gospel to the Evening, because
it is the last half of the Natural Day; and it is most suitable also to compare
the light of the Gospel to the light of the Evening, for the Evening begins at
Midday at the first declining of the Sun, and then the day is most clear and
bright, and so it continues till almost Sunset; and in the last days, when the
Apostles had a Commission to preach the Gospel in all the world, the Gospel
gave a light most clear to many souls that sat in darkness: But if the Evening
had been no other time but the dark Night, as the most would have it, then
Zacharies Allusion to the light of that Evening, had been but a poor comparison
to set forth the light of the Gospel, for in such an Evening there is no other
light but Starlight, or Moonlight at the best, and that is but a poor light
to illustrate the light of the Gospel by, in the days of the Apostles.

Thirdly, As the Evening is often put for last, so the Morning is put for
first, in Dan. 9. 21. The man Gabriel whom I had seen in a vision at First, or
in the Morning, so the Hebrew speaks.

Fourthly, It is evident by another Allusion that the Morning is before the
Evening, because the term Morning is put for the very first beginning of a
thing; and in this sense Isaiah is most elegant, Isa. 47. 11. Evil shall come
upon thee (O Babylon) and thou shall not know the morning thereof (or the
beginning thereof.) The Hebrew word signifies the early Morning; but the Geneva
does render it the Beginning; and by this phrase the Holy Ghost did (by a
Periphrasis) describe the beginning of Babylons ruin by the early Morning.

Object. 2. Good Divines do take the term Morning here for the beginning of the
Artificial Day, and the word Morning in that sense does not hinder, but that
the first Darkness was Evening.

Answ. I have already answered this Objection immediately before. I told you
there, that if the first Darkness had been called Evening, then doubtless the
Evening would have been put for the first beginning of any thing, and the
Morning for last, but because the Morning is put for the first beginning of a
thing, therefore it is out of all doubt to me, that the first Darkness did
belong to the Morning and not to the Evening.

2. I answer further, that the Morning of Babylons fall cannot be so
conveniently compared to the Morning of the Artificial day, as to the dark
early morning; because the Artificial Morning is apparent and perspicuous to
all men: But the ruin of Babylon was not perspicuous at first, but it was
carried on in a speedy and obscure manner by the Persians, so that the
Babylonians had no suspicion or discerning of their fall as yet; therefore the
Morning of the Artificial Day was not so suitable to exemplify the manner of
their speedy ruin, as the early dark Morning was, for it was done speedily ere
they were aware, Jer. 50. 24. as it appears by these two considerations.

1. Isay did foretell that Babylon should be destroyed in the Night, Isa. 21. 4.
2. Isay did foretell that Babylon should be destroyed in the early Morning, Isa.
47. 11.
Put both these Prophetical allusions together, and then they will amount to
thus much, that Babylon should be destroyed in that Morning, that begins in the
Night; and the History of Events does tell us, not only that Belshazzer was
slain in the Night, Dan. 5. 30. but also it is apparent by the circumstances of
time that must be spent at that drunken feast before that Daniel could be
sought out and brought in, to interpret the vision, that it was in the latter
part of the Night, after the Morning was begun.

Take the early Morning of Babylons fall either in the former figurative sense,
or in the last proper sense (either way or both ways) and it does sufficiently
prove, that the time called Morning was first in order before the time called
Evening, or else this Allusion of Babylons fall to the early Morning had been
improper; hence it follows, that the first Darkness was comprehended under the
term Morning, and not under the term Evening.

Fifthly, Boker, the morning, is put for the first beginning of a Fifthly,
Boker, the morning, is put for the Sunset Evening, because the time of Sunset
is the first beginning of the Jews day of eleannesles.
thing, because it is put for the first beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day
(or for the Sunset Evening) as the Hebrew Doctors do witness. See Ains. in
Deuteronomy. 16. 4. This I have further opened in another place; and so in like sort
Macar, the morrow, is put for the first beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day
(or for the Sunset Evening) in 1 Samuel 30. 17. and in Lev. 23. 15. as it is
further opened in chap. 4.

Sixthly, It is evident that the morning was before the time called Evening by
the title that Job gives to the Angels, he calls them Morning-Stars, Job 38. 6,
7. These Morning-Stars cannot be meant of the Stars in the Firmament, for they
were not created till the fourth day, Genesis 1. 14. But these Morning-Stars are
said to shout and sing when the foundation of the earth was laid; Hence it
follows, that the Angels are called Morning-Stars, either because of the time
wherein they shouted at the first laying of the foundations of the earth, which
was done in the time of the first darkness, or else in relation to the time of
their Creation, which was also done in the time of the first darkness, as many
learned do accord.

But if the time of their Creation, or the time wherein they shouted at the
laying of the foundations of the earth had been Evening, then the Angels should
more properly have been called Evening-Stars, than Morning-Stars.

Object. 3. The Angels are called Morning-Stars, not in relation to the time of
their Creation, but by way of allusion to the excellency of their Nature, and
this is more suitable to be expressed by the light of the Artificial morning,
than by the first darkness.

Answ. If the Circumstances of Gods discourse with Job, and of Gods
Interrogations be well marked, there is no ground to say that God did only
intend to set out the excellent nature of the Angels by comparing them to the
morning of the Artificial day.

For the main thing that God aimed at by his Interrogations to Job, was, to
make him see his folly in desiring to dispute the cause of his afflictions with
God, God shows him that he is not able to find out the depths of his Wisdom in
the first laying of the foundation of the earth, because it made the Angels to
shout out with admiration, and therefore Job was much less able to search out
the reason of his dealings with him, in his present afflictions, and in that
respect God did pose him with this Interrogation, Where wast thou when I laid
the foundation of the earth, tell, if thou have understanding? Job 38. 4, 5, 6.
When the morning Stars rejoiced together, and when the Sons of God shouted,
Ver. 7. The Text does plainly call them Morning Stars, not so much in regard of
the excellency of their Nature, but in regard of the time wherein they were
created, or wherein they shouted at the excellency of Gods Workmanship when the
foundation of the earth was laid, either way or both ways do assure us that
the time of the first darkness was called Morning and not Evening. And that is
the thing that I aim at in this first Section of this Chapter.

SECT. 2. Proving that the Morning does begin in the dark Night.
FIrst, No man can deny but that the Morning is begun when the morning Watch is
begun, for the text does affirm it, Exodus 14. 24. 1 Samuel 11. 11. And it is a
known thing, that among the Jews they did always begin it just three hours
after Midnight, not only in the Summer time but also in the Winter time: Hence
it follows, that their morning Watch in the time of Winter must needs begin in
the dark night, not only in Judea, but also in all the habitable parts of the
world.

2. Hence it follows, that seeing the morning Watch did begin at three hours
after Midnight, then it will follow, that it must end just three hours after
Midday; for in common reason the morning must be as long as the evening,
namely, twelve hours long, or else the Evening may better be called an
Unevening, then an Evening to the Morning; but none that have their senses will
say that the morning does continue till three hours after Midday.

3 Hence it follows, that it is more agreeable to Scripture and to common
reason to begin the natural morning at the marked time of Midnight, rather
than three hours after, especially seeing it is then as dark all the winter
long as it is at Midnight, and therefore seeing the morning is begun with
darkness, why not with darkness at midnight, as well as at three hours after
midnight, seeing the world was created in the Equinoctial, and the Morning is
then as dark at three hours after Midnight, as it is at Midnight?

Secondly, Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz until the Morning, Ruth. 3. 14. and yet
she arose before one could know another. Hence it is evident that it was
Morning in the time of Barley Harvest, whiles it was yet dark; it may be it was
now in the end of our March, or in the beginning of our April; and though some
say that the Morning Watch was not so called from the first hour of it, but
from the last hour of it when it begun to be day light; yet this place of Ruth
calls it Morning whiles it was yet dark, and before one could know another.

Thirdly, It is said that Christ arose in the Morning a great while before Day
(or greatly in the Night) so the Greek speaks, Mar. 1. 35. Hence it is manifest
that it was Morning, whiles it was greatly or much in the night.

Fourthly, None can deny but that the morning is begun at the time of daybreak
in all the Inhabited Countries of the world. Hence it follows, that then it is
morning in some Countries near unto midnight, especially when the days are at
the longest; and known experience does tell us that in the North parts of
England the day does sometimes begin to break near unto midnight; and indeed
the daylight (when the days are at the longest) is scarce ever out of the Sky
in those parts, except a little while about midnight; Hence it follows, that
seeing it is daybreak sometimes near unto Midnight, then why may not the
morning begin at midnight all the year long as well in one Country as in
another, seeing the God of Nature has set such an eminent mark upon midnight,
and upon midday, which doubtless was to set out the bounds and limits of the
Natural morning, and of the evening?

Fifthly, Both Scripture and experience does tell us that there is a certain
Star called the Morning Star, which at some time of the year is seen to arise
not long after Midnight, and all men call it morning as soon as that Star is
risen, and in some parts when the days are at the longest it rises near unto
Midnight, but it always rises before it is day break.

Sixthly, It is evident that the morning begins in the dark night, by this
phrase in Psalm. 110. 3. The womb of the early Morning; I purpose not to meddle
with the mystical sense of these words, because it concerns not the Argument in
hand; but I will only meddle with the phrase, for the phrase sake only; for
this phrase must have some proper allusion to some natural truth: Mibschar, we
translate Morning, but says Mr. Ainsworth the letter M is a Preposition,
signifying [From or Before] and in that respect some translators do render the
text thus, Before the womb of the early Morning; this phrase must have an
allusion to some proper truth, and I can find nothing that may so fitly be
called the womb of the early Morning, as the first darkness was, for out of
this darkness God created the morning light, and in this respect the Morning
may well be divided into several degrees of time.

1 The first Darkness was the womb of the Morning light.

2 From the womb of the morning proceeded the Son of the morning, called the
morning Star, as soon as it was created, and it is now called the Son of the
morning, Isa. 14. 12.

3. Then follows the ascending of the morning or daybreak, Genesis 32. 24, 26.

4 Then follows the time of killing the morning Sacrifice, namely, when the
face of all the East is enlightened, which is between daybreak and Sunrising,
See Ains. in Number. 28. 4. And certain it is that the morning Sacrifice was not
only slain, but also offered before Sunrising, (because the Meat Offering
which was always offered after the Burnt Offering) was offered before Sun
rising, as it appears by 2 King. 3. 20, 22. and the Burnt Offering was always
first, Lev. 1. and then the Meat Offering, Lev. 2. now though the Morning
Sacrifice was offered before Sunrising, yet the Evening Sacrifices of all
sorts must be offered before Sunset. For the Hebrew Doctors say, that after
Sunset the blood of all Sacrifices became unlawful, See Ains. in Lev. 1. 6* 9.

5. Then follows the morning of the Artificial day at Sunrising, Psalm. 104.
22, 23. for God did appoint the Sun to rule and limit the Artificial day, Genesis
1.

6. Then followed the time of morning Prayer at the third hour of the day,
namely at our nine a clock.

First, By these gradations to the morning we may see the vanity of their
opinion that hold no other time to be called the morning properly, but a point
of time only, at the beginning of the Artificial day, all the rest they say is
called the morning improperly.

Secondly, By these gradations to the morning it is evident that the first
darkness was the root or womb of the morning, and therefore at last it was
called Morning.

SECT. 3. Proving that the Morning in all likelihood does begin at midnight,
besides the former certain grounds from the exact beginning and ending of the
Evening.
FIrst, I will endeavor to prove that the morning does begin at midnight by an
argument drawn from Job 26. 7. compared with Genesis 1. 2. Job says, That God
stretches out the North upon the empty; and says Moses, The Earth was empty
and void, namely, as long as darkness was upon the face of the deep; But as
soon as the light was created, the earth could not be said to be empty and void
any longer, for then the deep was adorned with the light as with a most
glorious ornament.

Object. 4. The first Darkness did continue twelve hours upon the face of the
deep, after the general matter called Earth was created: Or thus, how long was
the Earth empty and void before the light was created?

Answ. The answer is from Job, That the Earth was empty and void all the space
of time that the North point is stretched out upon a Compass Dial, namely, the
space of six hours, for the North point on a Compass Dial does stretch it self
out until it meet with the beginning of the East point, the four ends of the
two Lines of Longitude and Latitude do make the four Cardinal Points of the
Compass, North, East, South, and West: Hence it follows, that the North point
is stretched out to the East point, and that is just six hours by the Compass
Dyal, and so long says Job the Globe was empty; but as soon as God created
Light out of Darkness, which began to appear by degrees, first, By a Twilight,
and then shined forth at the East point, then the Earth was no longer empty and
void, but it was adorued with the light.

If any man can give a better Interpretation, for the stretching out the North
upon the Empty, I shall be glad to see it.

But if the first Darkness had been twelve hours long, then Job should have
said, that God stretched out the West point, as well as the North point upon
the Empty: but Job does not say so, but only that he stretched out the North
upon the Empty, and therefore it follows,

1 That the first Darkness was not twelve hours, but only six hours long upon
the face of the deep, before the light was created.

2 Hence it follows, that the first half of that twelve hours Darkness that
succeeded the Artificial Day, did make up the first darkness to be a just Night
of twelve hours, and after this manner both these parts of Darkness did meet
together at the North point, as I have exemplified the matter upon a Compass
Dyal, and the North Land in Jer. 23. 8. may according to the Hebrew be read
from the Land of darkness.

And why else does the Prophet in Psalm. 89. 12. begin the time of the first
Creation in order from the North point, but to remember us, where, and how long
the darkness did continue upon the face of the deep after the Earth was
created, before the light was created?

And so likewise for this Reason, Job does teach us in what order we must place
the four ends of the two Lines of Latitude and Longitude (now called the four
Cardinal Points of the Compass) by placing a man in this order to view the
Globe.

1 He calls the North point, the left hand. 2 He calls the South point, the
right hand. 3 He calls the East point, before. 4 He calls the West point,
behind. See Tremelius for this in Job 23. 89.
So then, He that desires to behold the Globe in a right order, how the God of
Nature did divide it and quarter it, must place the North point of the Globe at
his left hand, the East before, the South at his right hand, and the West
behind. See Ains. in Psalm. 89. 13. and in Numb. 2. 3, 29.

2 The holy Scriptures do often direct us to observe the four ends of the two
Lines of Latitude and Longitude.

1 Because they divide the whole earth into four quarters. 2 Because they
divide the heavens into four quarters.
And in this respect the four quarters of the Earth are sometimes called the
four wings, or the four corners of the Earth, Revel. 7. 1. Numb. 24. 17. Isa.
11. 12. Ezekiel. 7. 2. Job 37. 3. and 38. 13.

2 The Heavens are divided into four quarters, and in this respect the four
Winds are said to come from the four quarters of Heaven, Jer. 49. 36. Ezekiel. 37.
9. Dan. 7. 2. and 8. 2. Zach. 2. 6. Mat. 24. 31.

And when the Lines of Latitude and Longitude are drawn upon a Compass Dyal or
upon a Globe, then they make the four winds in the four quarters of Heaven to
lie thus, and to be called thus, North-East, South-East, South-west, North-west.

And thus the Holy Scripture does force us to observe the various use of these
two Lines of Longitude and Latitude; and therefore doubtless Job was not
ignorant, but spoke as a man of knowledge, when he said that God stretched out
the North upon the Empty. First, He was not ignorant of the North point. Nor
secondly, How far it stretched. Nor thirdly, of the time of the Globes
emptiness.

3 Ezekiel does direct us to take notice of the North point as the first in
order of the sour Cardinal points, because he does first begin the division of
the Land of Canaan from the North quarter, and so he ends it with the West
quarter, read Ezekiel. 47. from ver. 15. to the end of the Chapter; and in this
order also the Lord was pleased to let Moses take a view of the land, he stood
in the Land of Gilead, and from thence in the first place he viewed Dan which
was the furthest Northward and Northally in Galilee, which lay also Northward.
Secondly, Then he viewed the land of Ephraim and half Manasseh which lay
Eastward from him in the middle of the Land. Thirdly, Then he viewed the Land
of Judah to the South. And fourthly, Then he viewed the Land of Jerico which
lay in the West of Canaan. See Ains. in Deuteronomy. 34. 1, 2, 3.

Secondly, I will endeavor to prove that the Morning began with the first
darkness, and that the first darkness must be placed at the North point by
another phrase of Job, for Job does tell us that when the winds have purged the
Air, and made it clear from clouds and vapors, that then out of the North a
golden light does show it self, Job 37. 22. Our eie-sight may witness the truth
of this point, for in a clear Morning before Sunrising we may often see a
golden list of light stretching it self from the North point to the East; and
again after Sunset we may often see a golden list of light stretching it self
from the West point to the North point. This Observation, First, Of the golden
list from North to East, may teach us that the root of the Morning comes from
the North point, where the Midnight begins by the Compass-Dyall. And Secondly,
The golden list in the Evening after Sunset from West to North, may teach us
that the Evening does reach unto Midnight, or to the North point.

Thirdly, I prove that the Natural Morning does being at Midnight, because the
morning of the fifteenth day of Nishan began at Midnight.

I collect it thus, Moses at the first passover in Egypt gave a very strict
charge to all the Israelites, that no man should go out of the door of his
house until the Morning, Exodus 12. 22. namely, not until the morning of the
fifteenth day was come; this was Moses express charge. Hence I reason thus, if
any man of Israel had gone out of the door of his house before the morning of
the fifteenth day was truly come, contrary to this charge (as those did that
went out of the door of their houses to gather Manna on the Sabbath Day
morning) they would have been condemned as Transgressors for it (as they were
that gathered Manna on the Sabbath day morning, Exodus 16. 27. 28.)

But all the people of Israel went out of the doors of their houses either at
Midnight or presently after, as it appears by ver. 33. and 39. and yet none of
them were condemned as transgressors for it: But on the contrary, their exact
obedience to all Moses commands is twice over testified in ver. 28. and twice
over again in ver. 50. The Text says, they did all things as God commanded
Moses and Aaron, so did they, Even as exactly as Noah did in making the Arc,
Genesis 6. 22. or as Moses did in making the Tabernacle, Exodus 40. 16. for their
obedience is alike set out by the same double expression.

Therefore seeing all the people were thus exact in their obedience to all
Moses commands; it follows, that they did not go out of the doors of their
houses until the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and yet they went out
of the doors of their houses at Midnight, or presently after, because they
knew that the morning of the fifteenth day was begun at Midnight.

Yea, It is evident that Moses intended they should all go out of their doors
in the Morning presently after Midnight, because he had foretold them, that
all the firstborn of Egypt should be slain at Midnight, Exodus 11. 4, 5. And
secondly, He had foretold them that the Egyptians would thrust them out of
Egypt, v. 1. and that the Nobles would come and bow down to Moses saying, Go
thou out and all the people at thy feet, Exodus 11. 8. Yea, Moses did prepare
them for a sudden departing from their houses, because he commanded to eat the
Passover with their loins girded, with their shoes on their feet, and with
their staves in their hands, and to eat it in haste, Exodus 12. 11. all these
things do testify that Moses intended they should go out of the doors of their
houses as soon as ever the morning of the fifteenth day was come, and he meant
it was come as soon as Midnight was come.

Object. 5. I grant that all Israel departed out of Egypt on the fifteenth day
of Nishan, Numb. 33. 3. But how prove you that they began their journey at
Midnight, or that the fifteenth day began at Midnight?

Answ. The circumstances of the Text do prove it plain enough; for as soon as
the Egyptiaus saw all their firstborn slain at Midnight, they feared lest
they should be all slain, and therefore they did urge the Israelites in all
haste to depart, and the Israelites knew all this beforehand, and accordingly
they prepared for their speedy departure, and because of this their preparation
they are said to depart out of Egypt in the night, Deuteronomy. 16. 1. compared with
Exodus 12. 29, 31, 42. The Egyptians therefore as soon as their firstborn were
slain at Midnight, urged the Israelites in haste to depart, and then also the
Israelites did depart out of the doors of their houses, because the morning of
the fifteenth day was come, but yet they could not fully depart out of Egypt
until the body of the self same day was come, namely, not till it was Midday.
See Ains. in Exodus 12. 41. they had many businesses to do after they went out
of the doors of their houses before they could fully depart; for they must
assemble together 600000 men befides women and children, and many connexed
people and cattle, and before all this could be put into a fit posture for
their orderly marching away, it was Midday, and yet they made extraordinary
haste to bring things thus soon to pass, and through their great haste they
took their Dough as it was unleavened, and carried it upon their shoulders,
ver. 34. and thenceforth the fifteenth of Nishan was commanded to be remembered,
and to be observed, as a Festival Sabbath for ever, and as the first day of
the Feast of unleavened bread, Exodus 13. 3. Lev. 23. 7. Deuteronomy. 16. 3.

Their Journey in the night began in this order, as soon as the firstborn of
Pharaoh and the Nobles were slain at Midnight, then in their perplexed fear
they did hastily call up Moses and Aaron to depart, and then they gave the
Alarm to the rest, and as the first of them marched through the land of Goshen,
the rest fell in by Troops, but before they could be all marshalled to depart
in fit order, it was Midday, and in this sort their march began at Midnight,
and was completed by Midday, according to Numb. 33. 3.

Conclusion.
From all the premises (which I have laid down under three Heads or Sections)
it follows, That the time of the first darkness (after the Creation of the
Earth) was Morning (and not Evening.) And secondly, That it began at that time
which the God of Nature made Midnight at last, namely, as soon as all the
parts of the Natural day were formed and framed together.

CHAP. IV. Proving, That the Jews Custom in beginning their weekly Sabbath at
the Sunset Evening, was occasioned by their Ceremonial Custom, namely, Because
the persons that were ceremonially purified from their ceremonial Defilements,
were commanded to begin their new day of cleanness then; and hence it follows,
first, That that accidental beginning of the Day must not be accounted for the
true beginning of the Natural Day; And Secondly, Hence it follows, That it is
not the right time for us Christians to begin our Lords Day at the Sunset
Evening, as the Jews did by their ceremonial Custom only.
SECT. 1.
THe Jews were often guilty of sundry degrees of sins of uncleanness against
the Ceremonial Law (besides their sins against the Moral Law) as you may find
them noted and distinguished by Mr. Ainsworth in Lev. 11. 24, 25, 32. and in
Lev. 12. 6. and in Lev. 22. 7. compared with Numb. 9. 10. and with Lev. 13. 6.
and see also Lev. 14. 9, 17. and Number. 5. 2, 3. and Numb. 19. 2, 7, 11.

Secondly, Answerable thereunto, the Ceremonial Law did ordain several degrees
of purification, from these several degrees of ceremonial uncleanness; as you
may find them noted also by Ainsworth, in Lev. 5. 2. Lev. 14. 9, 15. Lev. 15.
14. Number. 5. 7. Number. 19. 18. Genesis 35. 2. and in Exodus 19.

Thirdly, Not only the manner how, but also the time when they must cleanse
themselves, was ordained and appointed by the Ceremonial Law.

Some kind of defilements might be cleansed in one day, but the greatest degrees
of their Ceremonial defilements required not only one, but many days for their
cleansing; but all were commanded to begin their cleansing in the Evening in
two degrees of time, according to the two parts of the Evening, for the natural
Evening has two equal parts (as I have showed in Chap. 2. and shall further
show it in the next Chapter.)

In the first Evening (which does always begin at Midday) they must baptize or
wash themselves. The Jews were cleansed from their ceremonial defilements, 1.
By washing in the afternoon; And 2. By the Suns setting upon them after their
baptizing.


In the second Evening (which does always begin at Sunset) they did begin to
date the day of their cleanness.

For by the setting of the Sun upon them, after their washing, two things were
effected; First, Their cleanness by their former washing was confirmed or made
perfect; And secondly, As soon as their cleanness was made perfect, they began
the day of their cleanness.

Object. 1. Might not the unclean person baptize himself from his Ceremonial
defilements in the latter evening after Sunset, as well as in the time of the
first Evening before Sunset?

Ans. He might not, because God had appointed the time of the two Evenings for
two distinct degrees of their cleansing: The first Evening from Midday to
Sunset was allotted to them for the washing or baptizing themselves from their
ceremonial sins, and this was only as a preparation to the day of their
cleanness, And this I will labor to make evident several ways.

1. Moses in Deuteronomy. 23. 11. does command the unclean person to bath himself in
water, at the looking forth of the Evening. So the Hebrew phrase is, but it may
be demanded, what time is that, that is meant by the looking forth of the
Evening?

Answ. I have showed you in chap. 2. and in chap. 5. that the Evening does
first begin at the first declining of the Sun at Midday, and that it looks
forth toward his setting in the west from the very first declining of the Sun
from Midday until it depart from that Horizon, and to this sense I have
expounded the shadows of the Evening to look forth, in Jer. 6, 4. See Chap. 2.

In like sort it is said of Isaac, that he went out into the fields to
meditate at the looking forth of the Evening, Genesis 24. 63. In those days they
had no private upper Rooms to meditate in, because they lived in Tents, and
therefore they used to sequester themselves by going out into the fields to
meditate, where they had Groves of Trees for shade and refreshing, and thither
the godly used to go to meditate or to study divine mysteries in the heat of
the day, at the first looking forth of the Evening. See Ains. in Psa. 55. 18.

In like sort, they used to bathe or baptize themselves from their Ceremonial
defilements at the looking forth of the Evening, and then also the water was
well warmed by the Sun, and so made the more fit for bathing. I grant also,
that it was lawful for them to bathe themselves from their Ceremonial
defilements all the time that the Sun looked forth by his shadows toward the
West, till it was ready to depart out of that Horizon. But this is to be
marked, that none were commanded to baptize themselves in any part of the
morning (only the Priests were commanded to wash their hands and their feet
every morning, although they were clean before. See Ains. in Exodus 30. 19, 20.)
neither were they commanded to baptize themselves after Sunset, for except
they were baptized before Sunset, they could not begin the day of their
cleanness at Sunset, according to command.

2 It is evident, that the appointed season for baptizing themselves from all
their Ceremonial defilements was in the time of the first Evening, by the
Example of Bathshebaes baptizing herself.

The Text says, it was in the Evening when David arose from his bed and walked
upon the Roof of the Kings house, then he saw a woman washing her self, and the
woman was very beautiful to look upon, 2 Samuel 11. 2. This Evening when David
arose from his bed, cannot be understood of the latter Sunset Evening, for
then for want of Sun-light he could not have discerned her beauty from the Roof
of his house, but it must be understood of the afternoon Evening; for in those
hot Countries they used to sleep in the afternoon upon some Bed or Pallat, as
Ishbosheth did, 2 Samuel 4. 5. from whence he arose and walked upon the flat Roof
of his house, and thence he beheld the beauty of Bathsheba as she was baptizing
her self; hence it may be gathered, that the unclean persons did use to baptize
themselves from their Ceremonial defilements in the afternoon Evening.

3 It is also evident, that they baptized themselves in the afternoon Evening
from their Ceremonial defilements by a famous example in Josh. 7. for when the
Lords wrath was gone out against them, in that the men of Ai slew about thirty
six of Israel, because that Achan had stolen the excommunicate thing; then said
the Lord to Joshua at the Even-tide, Up, and sanctify the people, and say,
Sanctify your selves against to morrow, Josh. 7. 6, 13, 14, 15. and how else
must they sanctify themselves for the Lords presence at his Ark on the morrow,
but by washing themselves from their Ceremonial defilements, for there were
scarce any but they were defiled by one accident or other, and none might come
before the Lords Ark in their Ceremonial defilements upon pain of being cut
off; and before Joshua could make proclamation through the Camp for their
purification, and for their solemn meeting to seek the Lord for mercy on the
morrow, it would require a good space of time, therefore this Evening cannot be
understood of the Sunset Evening, but of the noontide Evening, as I have
explained the matter more at large in Chap. 2.

4 All Israel were warned when ever they came before the Lords presence in his
Tabernacle, to be cleansed from their Ceremonial defilements, especially at
their three solemn feasts; but they were not tied to the observation of their
Ceremonial baptizing when they resorted to their Synagogues on their weekly
Sabbath days, for in those places both the clean and the unclean might meet
together in Gods worship, as I have opened the matter in my discourse of the
Jews Synagogues Discipline.

But under pain of the Lords displeasure none might approach to the Lords
Sanctuary without their legal purificati^ons, as it is manifest by the example
of Gods displeasure against some of Ephraim and Manasses when they came to the
Passover in the days of Hezekiah with out their purifications; but as soon as
Hezekiah perceived their error (which doubtless the consciences of the visited
persons made them to acknowledge) he prayed to the Lord for them, and the Lord
was entreated, and healed the people, 2 Chronicles. 30. 19, 20. and for the better
avoiding of this error afterward, it was observed as a custom among the Jews,
to go out of the Country up to Jerusalem before the Feast of Passover, to
purify themselves, Joh. 7. 55. which purification was effected by two degrees
of cleanness: First, By baptizing themselves in the first Evening; And
secondly, By the Sunsetting upon them after their baptizing (as I have
formerly proved the matter) for none might approach the Sanctuary until they
could declare their purification to the Priests that were the Porters, 2 Chronicles.
23. 19. as Paul did, Act. 21. 26.

And the Lord did so much approve of their Ceremonial purity, both by their
actual baptizing and by their abstinence from unclean meats, and from all other
things else that might defile them: That for that very obedience he does call
the whole Nation, All Israel are called men of Holiness in regard of their
ceremonial purity.
Men of holiness, Exodus 22. 31. for all the Nation in general were very careful
to maintain this kind of holiness. And the Hebrew Doctors say, that if any man
of the common people did but say, I am clean to keep the sin-water, he was to
be trusted, for there is no man of Israel too vild for it, See Ains. in Number.
19. 9. that is to say, no man of Israel was too vild for it, if he were but
Ceremonially clean; and in this sense all Israel were holy, namely, to the
purifying of their flesh; for the Law is not of Faith, Gal. 3. 12. a man might
keep the Law to the purifying of his flesh, though they wanted saving-Faith to
apply the blood of Christ for the cleansing of their consciences from the guilt
of sin.

And thus much touching the first degree of time in which they must perform the
first degree of their Ceremonial cleanness.

SECT. 2.
I Come now to speak of the second degree of time wherein their Ceremonial
cleanness was perfected, and that was as soon as the Sun was set upon them
after their Ceremonial baptizing, and from that time also they began to date
the new day of their cleanness.

First, I prove that God ordained the Sunset Evening to be the time of
perfecting the cleanness of the baptized person, ere he None were completely
purified by being baptized til the Sun was set upon them.
could begin the day of his cleanness, by Deuteronomy. 23. 10, 11. There Moses says
thus to all Israel, If there be in thee a man that is not clean by reason of an
accident in the night, then he shall go out of the Camp; and he shall has
himself in water at the looking forth of the Evening (and what then, was he now
made clean as soon as ever he had bathed himself in water? The answer is, no,
he must yet stay a while longer without the Camp till his Sun be set,) and
then when the Sun is gone down he shall come into the Camp.

Hence it is evident that his Ceremonial purity was not complete until his Sun
was set, but then it was complete, and therefore he did then begin to date the
day of his cleanness.

Hence also I gather, that their Ceremonial baptizing might be done in any part
of the afternoon, provided it were done before Sunset, because the Sun did
look forth toward the place of his going down by his shadow, from Midday, til
it went out of that Horizon, as I have formerly explained the matter.

But if any were defiled by any accident in the night after his Sun was set
upon him, he must remain in that uncleanness until a new baptizing in the next
afternoon, and till a new Sunset Evening,

Secondly, It is evident, that none were completely purified till Sunset, by
Levit. 22. 5, 6, 7. Moses says thus, If any man (whether Priest or Israelite)
be made unclean by touching a dead creeping thing, (or the like unclean thing;)
Then (in ver. 6.) he shall be unclean until the Evening, he shall not eat of
the holy things. But first, He shall bath himself in water. And then Secondly
(says ver. 7.) when the Sun is gone down he shall be clean.

By this Text it is also evident, that he did not attain to a perfect
ceremonial cleanness by baptizing himself in water, until the Sun was gone down
upon him after his bathing: But as soon as his Sun was set, then he was
completely purified, and then also he began to date the day of his cleanness,
and then also he might eat of the holy things.

Thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do abundantly testify that no baptized person did
begin the day of his cleanness until his Sun was set; for this is their common
and peculiar phrase, They shall be unclean until their Sun be set: But the
common phrase of the Ceremonial Law says thus, They shall be unclean until
the Evening. The unclean (says Maymony) may not eat of the Heave Offering
until their Sun be set. See Ains. in Lev. 22. 9, 10. And hence it is evident,
that they held the baptized persons to have some degree of uncleanness upon
them, until their Sun was set: And therefore Maymony says thus; He that is
baptized is the second in uncleanness, until his Sun be set; And he that is so
baptized (if his Sun be not set) may not eat or drink of the Trumah (or holy
offerings) nor of any meat or drink that is holy. See Ains. in Lev. 11. 32. and
in Lev. 7. 20, 21. and in Numb. 19. 19, 20, 21. This phrase in the Law, He
shall be unclean until the Evening, is eight times over repeated in Lev. 11.
and fourteen times over in Lev. 15. and often elsewhere: But the Hebrew Doctors
do usually express it, He shall be unclean till his Sun be set; they accounted
the term Sunset and the term Evening to be all one time. Hence then it follows,
that the date of their new day of cleanness did always begin at the Sunset
Evening.

Fourthly, It is evident, that the Jews began the date of their new day of
cleanness at the Sunset Evening; because the Sunset The Jews morrow began at
Sunset in Ceremonial respects.
Evening is called [Their morning] 1 Samuel 30. 17. David and his men are said to
pursue after the Amalekites, From the twilight unto the Evening of Their
Morrow; that is to say, from the Twilight in the Morning until their Morrow,
which began at the Sunset Evening; it was a custom that was proper and
peculiar unto them, and differing from other Nations, to date the new day of
their cleanness from the Sunset Evening; and therefore the Hebrew Text does
apply the word Their unto David and his men in special, calling it their
morrow; Dr. Willet does explain the word Morrow to be the next day after David
and his men were set forth to pursue the Amalekites; But the text does not say
so, but that David and his men fell upon the Amalekites and pursued their
victory, from the Twilight (in the morning) until the Evening of their morrow,
that is, till the Sunset Evening, for at that Evening began their Morrow, or
their new day to the person purified.

2. It is evident that the Sunset Evening was the Jews morrow, from the time
of their reckoning of the seven weeks to the day of Penticost.

They are commanded to begin that reckoning from the morrow of the Sabbath;
meaning by the Sabbath, the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, which
God commanded them to observe as a Sabbath, Lev. 23. 15. And by the Morrow of
the Sabbath, is meant the second day of the Feast of unleavened bread, which
began at the Sunset Evening, at the end of the first day, that Evening is
called the Morrow, (but this is observable also, that the seventh day of the
Feast of unleavened bread did not end at Sunset; but the holy feast of that
day continued in the night time after Sunset) and in this sense the word
Morrow must be understood in ver. 11. and 16.

The Hebrew Doctors say, they begin this reckoning from the beginning of the
day (not from the beginning of the Artificial day as most are apt to mistake
their meaning, but) from the night of the sixteenth of Nishan. See Ains. in
Lev. 23. 15. and it is a known thing (as I have explained the matter) that they
did account the night to begin at the Sunset Evening according to the date of
the person purified.

And in this sense the phrase of The next day in Matthew. 27. 62. must be
understood; then, the next day that followed the preparation, must be
understood of the Sunset Evening.

3. As Boker, the Morning, is put for the beginning of the day, namely, for the
beginning of the Natural day, and for the beginning of the Artificial day; so
also, it is once put for the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day, or for the
Sunset Evening, in Deuteronomy. 16. 4. as I have opened the matter more at large in
Chap. 5.

These places do plainly evidence that the Jews had a double Morning, and a
double Morrow (as they had a double year) answerable to the Natural Day and to
their Ceremonial Day.

Object. 2. Though I am willing to grant that all purified persons did It is
disputed by some that the Sunset Evening is not fully come until it be full
Twilight, or somewhat past, or else they confess it cannot be proved that
Christ lay three days in his grave.
begin the date of their new Day at the Sunset Evening, yet learned men do
affirm, that the Sun is not set as soon as the Body of the Sun is gone out of
our sight; They say that as long as there does remain any light in the Sky the
Sun is the cause of it, and hence they assert, That the Sun is not set until
the Darkness in the Sky is more than the Light in the Sky; they say the Sun
is not set until it is full Twilight or somewhat past: and by this exposition
of the Sunset Evening, they say it may be proved that Christ lay three days
in his Grave, or else they confess it cannot be proved.

Answ. If this grand Objection (which is very great in some men's eyes) be fully
answered, then all the Conclusions that are built upon it must needs fall to
the ground with it.

I confess I cannot but wonder that any learned men should make the time of
Sunset and the time of Twilight to be all one, for if this be true, then all
Astronomers must go to School again to learn better how to set the Minutes of
the Suns rising and of the Suns setting. But see what I say further in answer
to this Objection, in Chap. 7.

And suppose a man that holds thus, should hire a laborer to That the time of
Sunset is fully come as soon as the body of the Sun is gone out of sight, and
before it be Twilight.
work in his Garden from Sunrising till Sunset, and suppose this Laborer do
contract with him to continue at his labor until the precise time of Sunset,
and accordingly he continues at his labor until the Body of the Sun is gone out
of sight, and then he leaves off and takes witness of it, and presently goes to
his Master for wages according to Contract; his Master refuses to pay him
because he did not continue at his labor until the precise time of Sunset; he
tells him, that the Sun is not yet set, because the Light in the Sky is more in
quantity than the Darkness; for says he, the Sun is the cause of that light,
and therefore it is not yet set, and he takes witness, and so they part in
discontent; and because they could not agree about the precise time of Sunset,
they refer this controversy to be determined by competent Judges.

And first let Moses show his Judgment, what he means by the time of Sunset,
or by the Suns going down, for he does show his judgment by a familiar
example; He directed the Jews how to find out Mount Gerezim on the other side
Jordan, It lies (says he) behind the way, at the going down of the Sun, Deuteronomy.
11. 30. In these words Moses does give them a twofold mark of direction.

1. It lies behind, 2. It lies at the going down of the Sun, and I have showed
you in expounding Job 23. 8, 9. that this phrase behind is often put for the
West. And in this sense also see Ains. in Genesis 14. 15.

2. Moses says, It lies at the going down of the Sun; if you say this going
down of the Sun is not meant of the place where the body of the Sun goes out of
sight, but of the place of Twilight, then whither might the Jews wander by that
mark of direction to seek out Mount Gerezim? For when the darkness in the Sky
is somewhat more than the light in the Sky, the Jews might wander into the
North or into the South as well as into the West, for the time and place of
Twilight is but an uncertain mark to steer their course by to Mount Gerezim.

But to place the time of Sunset where the body of the Sun goes out of sight,
is a perspicuous mark for the West (when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, as it
was when this direction was given) and in this respect the time of Sunset is
often put for the West. See more in Chap. 2. in answer to Objection 3. And see
Ains. in Psalm. 113. 3. and this direction agrees to the first direction, it is
Behind, or it is due West.

On the contrary when Moses directed them to other places that lay East, he
directed them thither by the Rising of the Sun, Numb. 21. 11. Numb. 34. 15.
Deuter. 4. 41, 47. Josh. 12. 1. Josh. 19. 27, 34.

Secondly, Let Joshua also show his judgment about the time and place of
Sunset, and he declares his judgment by another familiar example, for he
directed the Jews how to find out the West bounds of Canaan, not by the
confused, and obscure mark of Twilight; but first, by the perspicuous mark of
Sunset; and secondly by the hindmost Sea, Jos. 1. 4. he makes the hindmost
Sea, and the going down of the Sun to be marks Synonima for the finding out of
the West borders of Canaan; and he does also explain this hindmost Sea to be
the great Sea at Sunset, Jos. 23. 4. and Moses likewise does call this Sea the
Hindmost Sea, Deuteronomy. 11. 24. But the Greek and Chaldee call it the Western Sea.
So then from the premises it follows, That seeing the places that lie due West,
are marked out by the perspicuous mark of the going down of the Sun, we must
thereby understand that the Sunset Evening does begin as soon as ever the body
of the Sun is gone out of sight; and therefore hence it follows, that those
that make the time of Sunset, and the time of Twilight to be all one (for the
beginning of our Lords day) do build their opinion but on a sandy foundation.

Thirdly, The Hebrew Text does often express the time of Sunset by the going
in of the Sun, to lodge all night (as it were in its chamber) and it is said to
go in as soon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of our Horizon. See Ains.
in Psa. 50. 1. on the contrary, as soon as the body of the Sun is risen upon
our Horizon in the morning, it is said to come forth as a Bridegroom out of his
chamber, Psalm. 19. 5.

Fourthly, Experience will tell you, that the Sun is set as soon as ever the
body of the Sun is gone out of sight; or else if it be not set till the
darkness in the sky is more than the light in the sky, then there is no
Sunset at all in the North of England when the days are at the longest, for
experience does testify that the light is hardly out of the sky there, all
the night long, except a little in the middle of the night, and yet experience
does witness that the Sun does truly set there every day.

Fifthly, Let all Astronomers show their judgment when the Sun does set, and
they with one consent do testify that the Sun does set as soon as ever the
body of the Sun is gone out of sight, for they describe the time of Sunset, and
the time of the Suns rising, by the first appearing of the body of the Sun in
the morning, and by the body of the Sun going out of sight in the evening, as
all their Almanacks do testify.

Sixthly, Let the Evangelist Mark show his judgment, for he describes the
Evening to begin at Sunset, Mark. 1. 32. but Luke speaking of the same action
says, It was when the Sun was setting, Luke 440. put this together, and it
implies that the time of the beginning of the Sunset Evening is as soon as
ever the body of the Sun is gone out of sight.

Seventhly, Joshua does testify that the Evening is come as soon as ever the
body of the Sun is gone out of sight, Jos. 10. 26, 27. and Daniel says, That
Darius did labor to deliver him till the going down of the Sun, Dan. 6. 14.
But the Seventy say, till Evening; and Moses says, The soul that touches a
dead creeping thing shall be unclean until the Evening, Lev. 22. 6. but says
he, in verse. 7. He shall bathe himself in water, and then he shall be clean
when the Sun is gone down; from all these places it is evident, that the term
Sunset, and the term Evening, are terms convertible for the Sunset Evening.

Eighthly, It is evident by this reason that the latter Evening does begin as
soon as ever the body of the Sun is gone out of sight, because there is no
interim between the End of the first Evening, and the Beginning of the latter
Evening; and I have proved in Chap. 2. that the first Evening does end, as soon
as ever the Sun does leave off to make any more shadows upon the face of the
Earth: For the whole time of the first Evening is described by its shadows
looking forth toward the place of its Rest, or by the stretching out of its
shadows upon the face of the Earth, as I have expounded, Jer. 6. 4. and
therefore it follows by necessary consequence, that the latter Evening must
begin at that instant time. This consequence is so clear, that none that loves
plain truth can deny it.

But to prevent rash zeal, and unadvised haste in feasting upon the holy flesh,
the Hebrew Doctors advised to stay a little time after Sunset, They begin
their Religious Festival Suppers after Sunset, as soon as three stars appeared
in the sky.
for the Sun must go down upon the baptized person before his Purification was
perfected, and then he began the date of his new day, and then he was made fit
to eat of the holy flesh; yet they advised to stay a little time after Sunset,
namely till three stars appeared in the sky. Mamony says, That the unclean
may not eat of the Heave Offering until their Sun be set, and three stars
appear after the Sun is gone down. See Ains. in Lev. 22. 9.

Thus have I showed how God ordained the time of the two Evenings for the
effecting of two degrees of cleanness; and now I shall in the next Section
show, That all the latter Evening from Sunset till Midnight, was appointed
for the time of their Religious feasting upon their Passeovers, and
Peace Offerings; and that this part of the night was a true part of the former
natural day.

SECT. 3.
FRom the date of the new Day to the person purified at the Sunset Evening, we
may see the true Reason that did enforce the Jews to begin all their
Ceremonial Sabbaths at that time, and of all other days by occasion thereof.

But this beginning of the day was no more to be accounted for the beginning of
the natural Day, than the beginning of their year in Nishan was to be accounted
for the first month by Creation; for they began their year in Nishan upon the
occasion of their famous deliverance out of Egypt in that month; but from the
Creation the year began in Tizri, which now is called the Seventh month, and
this seventh month was afterward made famous again by Joshua's Conquest of
Canaan, and by his division of the land thereupon to the nine Tribes and a
half, in this seventh month, Jos. 14. and in remembrance thereof they began all
their years of Rest, and all their Jubiles from that month. See Ains. in Exodus
12. 1, 2. Lev. 25. 8, 9, 10. Exodus 34. 22. Deuteronomy. 14. 22. and likewise the years
of all Servants and Leases began at this time, Lev. 25.

And after this manner they observed a double date according to the beginning
of their double day. The Jews observed both the date of their ceremonial day,
and the date of their natural day for several purposes. See Ains. in Lev. 23.
20.


1 The person purified began the date of his day of cleanness from the Sunset
Evening.

2 They dated the time of their Religious feasting according to the natural day
till midnight after; for by the Law they were expressly commanded to eat the
flesh of their Peace Offerings in the same day, in which it was sacrificed,
Lev. 7. 15. now it was not possible for them (at sometimes at least) to eat the
holy flesh of their Passeovers, and of their commanded Peace Offerings, in the
same Ceremonial day, because the time of sacrificing their Passeovers and
Peace Offerings did many times continue until it was night, namely till
Sunset; and so it fell out in the time of Josias Passover, 2 Chronicles. 35. 14.
Hence it follows by a necessary consequence, That the command to eat the holy
flesh in the same day must be understood (not of the same Ceremonial, but) of
the same natural day; and in case any of the holy flesh had remained uneaten in
the same day in which it was sacrificed, it must be burnt, and then sometime it
must be all burnt, and none of it eaten, namely when it was sacrificed at the
point of Sunset.

Secondly, If the date of their Ceremonial day had born all the sway, then they
must not only have finished the killing of all their Sacrifices, but of all
their Religious feasts also, before Sunset, and then our Savior and his
Apostles had sinned, because they kept their Religious Feast after Sunset,
namely in the night wherein he was betrayed; for though they caused their
Passover to be sacrificed on the fourteenth day, yet they deferred the time of
their feasting till after Sunset when the fifteenth day was begun, according
to the date of the person purified. But if you will grant that our Savior did
not sin against that Command of eating their Passover in the same day, then
you must also grant that the same fourteenth day by Creation was not ended at
Sunset, but continued still till Midnight after.

Thirdly, Hence it follows, that seeing all Ceremonial Customs are now
abolished by the death of Christ; that Gods people ought not to Judaize, in
beginning the Lords day according to the Jews Ceremonial Customs, but
according to the beginning and ending of the natural day from midnight to
Midnight.

Objection 3. How could the Jews observe a double date of a double day in one
and the same natural day without confusion?

Answ. Their double date of their double day was not strange to them, no more
than their double date of their double year was to them; they could sort out
such things, as belonged to the beginning of the year from the seventh month
from the things that belonged to the beginning of the year in the first month,
without any confusion at all; so in like manner they could sort out all those
Religious duties that belonged to their Ceremonial date, from those duties that
belonged to the date of the natural day. They knew that the Baptized person
must begin his new day at Sunset, and that all Evening Sacrifices must be
finished before Sunset; and yet in respect of the time of Feasting, they knew
that the same Natural day did still continue till midnight; Maymony says,
That the Priests must eat the Peace Offerings of the Congregation in the same
Day, and in half the Night. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 20. Hence you may see, that
the Hebrew Doctors, whom Maymony follows, did hold that the same day (in the
case of Feasting) did continue till midnight; and indeed this time was
sufficient for the accomplishment of all their religious Feasts; in like sort
Solomon calls the Twilight evening of the night, the same day wherein the
Sacrifice was slain, Prove. 7. 9. but it was not the same Ceremonial day, for at
Sun set the Jews began their next day, or their morrow; but for a fuller
answer, see my answer in Chapter 5. to Obj. 8. and 14. and 17.

CHAP. V. Proving that the Passover did begin and end according to the Natural
Evening, from midday to midnight.
I Have showed in Cha. 2. and Sect. 2. that the natural Evening was divided
into two equal parts, and now I shall show you, that the Passover was
solemnized in both the parts of that Evening.

First, All the Passeovers, and all the Peace Offerings that were annexed
thereunto, were all sacrificed in the time of the first Evening, and it was
utterly unlawful to sacrifice any Passover, either before this evening began,
or after this evening was ended, which did ever begin at Midday, and end at
Sunset.

Secondly, All the Passeovers of Canaan must be feasted on, with Religious
solemnity, in the time of the latter evening.

But first I will speak of the time of Sacrificing all their Passeovers, and
that was between the two evenings, namely, it was between the beginning of the
first, and the beginning of the latter evening; this was the precise limited
time for this work.

1 God commanded them to kill all their Passeovers in Egypt between the two
evenings, Exodus 12. 6. 2 God commanded them to kill all their Passeovers in the
Wilderness between the two evenings, Numb. 9. 3. 5. 11. 3 God commanded them
to kill all their Passeovers in Canaan, between the two evenings, Levit. 23. 4,
5.
This space of time is called the appointed season thereof, Numb. 9. 2. Levit.
23. 4.

Solomon Jarchi expounds the two evenings thus; From the sixth hour (which is
at Midday) and forwards, it is called between the two Evenings, for that the
Sun declineth toward his going down, etc. between the evening of the day, and
the evening of the night; the evening of the Day is from the beginning of the
seventh hour, and the evening of the Night is when the night begins. See Ains.
in Numb. 9. 3.

2 Maymony says thus; The killing of the Passover is after Midday, and if
they kill it before it is not allowable; and they kill it not but after the
daily evening Sacrifice, and burning of Incense, and after they have trimmed
the Lamps, then they begin to kill the Paschal Lamb, until the end of the day.
See Ains. in Exodus 12. 6.

Till the end of the day was, till the Sunset evening, for after Sunset
(says Maymony) the blood of all Sacrifices became unlawful. See Ains. in Lev.
1. 9. Lev. 6. 9. Lev. 7. 18.

Hence we see that the Hebrew Doctors held it as a Canon among them, that no
Passover was allowable, if it were killed either before Midday, or after
Sunset; but all the time between was Gods appointed season, Number. 9. 2. Lev.
23. 4.

Ordinarily they began to kill their Passeovers at half an hour after two a
Clock, but if the Passover day fell out to be the Some think of no other
Evening belonging to the Jews Sabbath, but the evening before the Sabbath; but
they are grossly mistaken, for that was no otherwise the evening of the Sabbath
but in relation to the new day to the purified person, but the evening of the
Sabbath if self began and ended as the Passover evening did from midday to
midnight.
evening of the Sabbath (namely, that evening of the Sabbath which began at
Midday) then they began to kill their Passover sonner; But (still this must
be remembered which Maymony often notes, that) they never killed any Passover
till after the daily evening Sacrifice, and some other services that did ever
accompany it. See Ains. in Numb. 28. 4.

But (say the Hebrew Doctors) God sets no particular hour, neither for the
killing of the daily evening Sacrifice, nor yet for the killing of the
Passover; but in general, he commanded them to be killed between the two
evenings.

Hence it follows, That if they killed the daily evening Sacrifice, or the
Passover, or the Peace Offerings, in any part of the afternoon, between the
time of Midday and the Sunset evening, they were allowable, and according to
Gods own limited time.

But because God requires that all his Worship in all the Circumstances of it
should be done decently, and in order, both in regard of time, place, and
persons; therefore the chief Rulers of the people, thought it their duty to
suit all the particular businesses about the Passover, and the daily evening
Sacrifice, to certain particular hours in the evening, so as all things might
be done with the best convenience, decency, and order, that one duty might not
shoulder out another.

The Hebrew Doctors in the Babylonian Thalmud say thus; the daily evening
Sacrifice was killed at the eighth hour and a half, and it was offered at the
ninth hour and a half (that is to say, at half an hour after three a Clock) But
in the evening of the Passover it was killed at the seventh hour and a half,
and offered at the eighth hour and a half (that is to say, at half an hour
after two a Clock) But if the evening of the Passover did fall out to be upon
the evening of the Sabbath, then it was killed at the sixth hour and a half
(that is to say, at half an hour after twelve a Clock) and it was offered at
seven and a half. See Ains. in Exodus 12. 6.

Buxtorfius also in his Hebrew Lexicon upon the word Gnarbaiim, does from the
Hebrew Doctors show, that if the Passover evening fell upon the Sabbath
evening, that then they began to kill the daily evening Sacrifice at half an
hour after twelve a Clock, because of the manifold businesses that belonged to
the Sabbath, besides the killing of their Passeovers; therefore that the doing
of one duty might not thrust out another, their Wisemen did set an order of
time when they should begin to kill the daily evening Sacrifice, which in all
the days of the year was deferred to the last place, except on the Passover
evening, and then it was ever preferred to the first place, and when ever the
Passover evening fell upon a Sabbath, then they began to kill it at half an
hour after twelve a Clock, and that was as soon as ever they could perceive the
shadow of the evening to be stretched out, or declined; and the only reason why
they began thus early upon the Sabbath evening, was, because they might have
sufficient time to finish all the duties of the Sabbath, and all their
Passeovers, before Sunset, for after Sunset the blood of all Sacrifices
became unlawful, because God had expressly commanded all evening Sacrifices to
be killed between the two Evenings, and because they had much work to do on
Passover evenings, especially when it fell on the Sabbath, they must begin to
kill the daily evening Sacrifice at the first declining of the Sun, or else
they could not kill all by Sunset; for in the time of Josiahs Passover, the
Passeovers, and Peace Offerings were so many, that the Priests could not finish
all till night, 2 Chronicles. 35. 14.

Obj. 1. You have often cited the Hebrew Doctors, as if they did all agree in
one, That the Natural evening did begin at Midday; but Mr. Thomas Shepherd in
his third Part on the Sabbath, Thesis 36. does affirm, that the Hebrew Doctors
testimonies are of little worth, because they do often contradict one another
about the beginning of the evening, for though some of them do say, that the
evening does begin at Midday, yet they are overwhelmed with cross
testimonies, from the most of their Fellows, who begin it some about one, some
about two a Clock in the afternoon; and Josephus, who is one of most credit, in
his Writings tells us, That they began their first evening about three a Clock
in the afternoon.

Ans. I would Mr. Shepherd had cited the particular places, where the Hebrew
Doctors do cross one another about the beginning of the Evening, for then the
particular places should have been examined, by the help of such as are expert
in their Writings. I grant that some of them do speak of the beginning of the
Evening at one hour, and some at another, and yet all this without any
contradiction; for in regard of several duties that must be trans-acted at
several hours in the evening, they had just occasion to speak of the beginning
of the evening at several hours, in relation to the said several duties that
must begin at several hours of the said evening, as I noted it in chap. 2. in
answer to Obj. 1. at seventhly, and as I have noted it immediately before from
the Babylonian Thalmud.

But if it do appear true, that Josephus does precisely begin the evening at
three a clock and not in relation to some special duty, then I grant that such
a testimony is worthy of due consideration; but I believe that Josephus is some
way or other mistaken, for the Thalmud called Jerusalemie, which was finished
since Josephus See Ains. in Advertisement at the end of Deuteronomy.
wrote, namely, about the year of our Lord two hund^ed and thirty, and the
other Thalmud called Babelie, which was fi^ished about the year five hundred,
do record the Canons and Constitutions of the Jews, according to which the Jews
do live at this day; (and no question but they knew Josephus his opinion as
well as others, that were more ancient Doctors) and yet these do affirm that
the evening begins at midday. And Moses the son of Maymon, who lived in the
year of our Lord one thousand two hundred, has set down in plainer Hebrew, the
Expositions, Canons, and Traditions of the said Thalmuds, and of the more
ancient Hebrew Doctors, omitting the fabulous Discourses of the Thalmuds; and
this Maymony is of such esteem among the Jewish Nation, that of him it is said,
From Moses (the Prophet) to Moses (the son of Maymon) there was none like
this Moses; and from him also I have cited several testimonies, that the
evening begins at midday; therefore seeing these public and general Recorders
do testify, that the evening begins at midday; how can they be overwhelmed
with cross testimonies, as Mr. Shepherd does unadvisedly affirm? and I little
question but Josephus is taken in a wrong sense by Master Shepherd, and if the
place had been cited it should have been examined, and a more particular answer
returned; and take notice by the way, that I do not find any other Objection in
Mr. Shepherd that is of any moment, but it is already fully answered here and
there in this Treatise.

Object. 2. Why do you make the whole time of the first Evening from Midday to
Sunset, to be the time of killing all their Passeovers in Canaan, seeing Moses
makes the time of killing all their Passeovers in Egypt to be about the time
of Sunset? for Moses says thus in Deuteronomy. 16. 6. Thou shall sacrifice the
Passover in the evening, about the going down of the Sun, in the season thou
came out of Egypt.

Ans. The time of killing all their Passeovers in Egypt, was commanded to be
between the two evenings, Exodus 12. 6. that is to say, between the time of the
first Evening, which began at midday, and the beginning of the evening, which
began at Sunset, so that they might have killed all their Passeovers presently
after Midday, or they might have staid till near Sunset, provided it were
done before Sunset; but they could not kill all their Passeovers in Canaan at
an instant, at the time of Sunset, as they might have done in Egypt; for.

1. In Egypt every firstborn of every family might kill the Paschal Lamb. 2
They might kill it in their own private house. 3 They might sprinkle the blood
of it upon their door-posts without going to the Altar.
But in Canaan they must have a longer space of time to do these works in; for,

1 The firstborn of every family might not kill their Sacrifices in Canaan,
but in their place the Lord chose the Tribe of Levy. See Ains. in Exodus 19. 22.
Number. 3. 12. 41, 45. Exodus 24. 5. and the number of this Tribe, I conceive, were
not so many as the firstborn were in Egypt, and therefore could not kill all
in so short a time.

2 The Levites had many more businesses to do about the Passover in Canaan
than in Egypt (especially if the Passover fell out upon a Sabbath) for says
Maymony, They kill not the Passover, but after the daily evening sacrifice,
and after the burning of incense, and after they have trimmed the Lamps, and
besides in Canaan they used to kill many Peace Offerings therewith: all this
would require more time than the firstborn of every family needed in Egypt for
the killing of the Paschal Lamb only, without these other services.

3 They might not kill their Passeovers in Canaan in private houses as they did
in Egypt; but all their Passeovers must be brought to be sacrificed at the
place the Lord should choose to place his brazen Altar at, which at first was
at Shilo, and at last in Solomon's Temple. See Ains. in Deuteronomy. 16. 5, 6. with
Exodus 12. 7. Deuteronomy. 12. 5, 11, 12, 14, 18. and in respect hereof the Hebrew
Doctors say, He that kills holy things out of the Court of the Sanctuary, if
he do it presumptuously, he is guilty of cutting off. See Ains. in Lev. 17. 2,
5, 8, 9. nay though a Priest did kill a Sacrifice in the Temple it self, yet it
might become unlawful, if the blood thereof were but carried out of the Temple
before it was sprinkled upon the Altar; for thus says Maymony, The blood of
the holy things that goes out of the Court becomes unlawful for Sacrifice,
yea though they bring it in again, and sprinkle it upon the Altar, yet it is
not acceptable. See Ains. in Lev. 1. 5.

If the Jews had thought it as lawful for them to kill the Passover in a
private house (ever since the destruction of the Temple) as they did at the
first Passover in Egypt, then doubtless they would not have omitted to
sacrifice the Passover now in all the places of their dispersion; but ever
since their Temple was destroyed, they have been without the Passover, and
without all other Sacrifices for the space of sixteen hundred years together;
And thus speaks Mr. Broughton from the Hebrew Doctors: He that shall kill the
Pascha, ever since Jesus Christ conquered Canaan, in a private house, had been
held an open enemy to the truth of God. And Maymony says, That now they can
have no sacrifice, because they can have no Temple, neither can they kill the
Paschal Lamb, but instead thereof they only use Unleavened bread with bitter
herbs, and wine in their private houses. See Ains. in Exodus 12. 8. Hence it
follows, that seeing all the Passeovers must be brought to one public place,
that it would require a longer space to kill one after another than they needed
in Egypt where every house might kill their Lamb at one hour.

Fourthly, In respect of the place of sprinkling, it must be all All Passeovers
were sacrifices therefore the blood of them all must be sprinkled on the Lords
Altar.
done at one Altar, and therefore it would require a longer time than they
needed in Egypt; for there every firstborn might sprinkle the blood upon the
door-posts of his own private house at one hour together, but the sprinkling of
the blood of all the Passeovers in Canaan could not be done in so short a
space, because all must be done at one Altar one after another, Lev. 1. 5. for
all Passeovers were Sacrifices, Exodus 12. 27. Exodus 23. 18. Exodus 34. 25. and
no Levites, but the Priests only, must sprinkle the blood of all Passeovers,
and of all Sacrifices, upon the Lords Altar, 2 Chronicles. 30. 16. 2 Chronicles. 35. 11.

And because the Lord did appropriate the blood of all Sacrifices Blood was the
Lords peculiar portion, therefore he prohibited the Jews to eat blood, and also
some sorts of fat.
to himself as his peculiar right to make atonement for men's souls, therefore
in that respect he did straightly prohibit the Jews that they should not eat any
blood. See Ains. in Lev. 3. 17. Lev. 7. 2, 14, 26, 27. Lev. 17. 6, 10, 11, 12.
Deuteronomy. 12. 27. and for this very reason also he forbad them to eat such parts of
the fat as he did, challenge for his own Altar; and in this respect also he did
challenge the fat of their Passeovers as much as of any other Sacrifice; all
which he commanded to be burned upon his Altar for a sweet savor of
Atonement, as the former Scriptures do testify.

Now from the consideration of these four Circumstances, it follows, that all
the Passeovers in Canaan could not be sacrificed in so short a time as about
the time of Sunset; and therefore this phrase about the going down of the Sun,
in Deuteronomy. 16. 6. must not be understood of the very time of Sunset, but of the
whole time of the Suns declining from Midday till it went down out of that
Horizon.

Object. 3. Though the Jews might not kill their Passeovers in Canaan in their
private houses as they did in Egypt, yet they might kill them at more Altars
than one; for the Lord was pleased to allow several Altars for Sacrifices in
several places; and by this means all the Passeovers in Canaan might be killed,
and the blood sprinkled just about the time of Sunset.

Ans. I grant that the Lord was pleased to permit the use of many Altars and
High Places in the days of Samuel; for there The Lord permitted many private
Altars in the days of Samuel, but he allowed but one public Altar for the
general Feasts of the twelve Tribes, and for the Passover day, and for the
daily Morning and Evening Sacrifice.
was an Altar at Gilgal, 1 Samuel 10. 8. 1 Samuel 11. 15. Secondly, There was an
Altar at Bethel, 1 Samuel 10. 3. 5. Thirdly, At Mizpeh, 1 Samuel 7. 9. Judge. 21. 1,
4. Fourthly, At Ramah, 1 Samuel 7. 17. and there were several Altars also in the
days of Elijah; for he complained to God that Jezabel had broken down his
Altars; But notwithstanding all this, no Passover might be killed at any of
these Altars; for the Passover in Canaan was commanded to be observed as a
general Feast; but these Altars were private Altars only, raised by Gods
allowance by some particular person upon some special occasion, and were after
permited to be used by some adjacent Tribe or persons, and in that respect
these Altars were made but of earth or stone that was unhewn: But the Altar
that God commanded to be erected as the general public Altar of all the twelve
Tribes, was made of brass, at the cost of the twelve Tribes, and this was
placed at first in the Lords Tabernacle in the Wilderness; afterward this
Tabernacle, together with the brazen Altar, was placed by Joshua, and the whole
Congregation, in Shilo in the Tribe of Ephraim, Josh. 18. 1. and there it
continued for the place of the general Assembly of all the twelve Tribes for
three hundred and fifty years, till the death of Eli; but after the Philistims
had taken the Lords Aark, 1 Samuel 4. 10, 11. and slain the most valiant men of
Ephraim in that battle, Psalm. 78. 9. God was wroth with Shilo, and forsook it,
Psalm. 78. 60. for by that great destruction of all the valiant men of Ephraim,
Shilo was now become too weak a place to guard the holy Tabernacle, and the
holy Altar, and therefore it was by the Lords advice removed to Gibbeon, 2 Chronicles. 1. 3, 4, 5. which was a Royal City, and a place of great strength, Josh.
10. 2. lying in the Tribe of Benjamin, and it was allotted to the Priests,
Josh. 21. 17. and the Gibbeonites the ancient inhabitants were given to the
Priests to cut wood, and draw water for the house of the Lord, Josh. 9. 21, 23.
27. and afterward in Solomon's days they were called Nethinims, 1 Chronicles. 9. 2.

And from henceforth this place was called the chief Highplace, because the
Lords Tabernacle, and the Lords Altar were placed therein, 1 King. 3. 4. and in
that respect David took care to provide a competent number of Priests to attend
it: But afterward when David had recovered the Ark from the Philistims, and
had brought it into the Tent that he had provided for it in Jerusalem, He
divided the Priests into two parts, and he appointed Asaph and his brethren to
minister before the Lord at Jerusalem, 1 Chronicles. 16. 37. and he appointed Zadoc
and his brethren to minister at the Lords brazen Altar at his Tabernacle at
Gibbeon, 1 Chronicles. 16. 39.

But when Solomon had finished his Temple, he caused the Priests first of all
to bring the Ark of the Lord into its place provided for it in the Temple, and
then he caused the Priests to bring up the Tabernacle of the Congregation, with
all the holy vessels into the Temple, 1 King. 8. 4. and after this manner the
Lord refused Ephraim, and chose the Tribe of Judah and Mount Sion (of Benjamin)
which he loved. Psalm. 78. 68.

This brazen Altar was made and consecrated to be the public Altar for the
General Assemblies of all the twelve Tribes, Exodus 27. 1. Numb. 7. 1. and in
that respect where ever this Altar was placed, there was the chief High place,
until Solomon had made another brazen Alrar in the place of it, 2 Chronicles. 4. 1.

At this Altar was offered the daily Morning and Evening sacrifices for all the
twelve Tribes, and the Passeovers of all the twelve Tribes, and they might not
be offered in any of the former private High places: The Hebrew Doctors say,
They sacrificed not the Passover in a private High-place (no not in the time
when private High Places were permitted) and whosoever offers the Passover
in a private High-place is beaten; for it is said in Deuteronomy. 16. 5. Thou may
not sacrifice the Passover in any of thy gates: we have been taught, that this
is a prohibition to kill it in a private High-place, although it be in the time
when private High Places were permitted. See Ains. in Deuteronomy. 16. 5. and such a
private Altar as this was at Bethlem where Ishai had a yearly Sacrifice, and
Feast for all the family, 1 Samuel 20. 26. and such a private Altar as this did
Saul build with stone, 1 Samuel 14. 35. And of these Altars it is said, that when
Asa and Jehosaphat destroyed the Idolatrous Highplaces, that they did not
destroy these High Places, 1 King. 22. 43. 2 Chronicles. 15. 17.

Now from all the premises it follows, That seeing they might not kill their
Passeovers at several High Places, nor sprinkle the blood on several Altars,
but at the general High-place, and at the general Altar only, That all the
Passeovers in Canaan could not be killed, and their blood sprinkled in so short
a time as about the time of Sunset, and therefore that Command in Deuteronomy. 16. 6.
at the going down of the Sun, must not be understood of the Sunset Evening,
but it must be understood of the whole time of the Suns declining from Midday
till Sunset, just according to the time of the two Evenings in Exodus 12. 6.

2. Let me add another Reason why the going down of the Sun The Passover day
was no Sabbath, it was but a half holy day.
in Deuteronomy. 16. 6. cannot be understood of the time of Sunset; namely because
the fifteenth day according to the date of the person purified, began at
Sunset; but no Passover might be sacrificed after the fifteenth day was come,
but all are commanded to be sacrificed in the fourteenth day at Even.

3. No other part of the fourteenth day was commanded to be kept holy, but the
Evening of the fourteenth day: The Jerusalemy, and the Babylonian Thalmuds say,
that men might follow their work and labor all the first half of the day; but
at Midday (say they) they must leave off, and begin their Rest. Maymony also
says, It is not unlawful to do work in the fourteenth of Nishan, save from the
midst of the day, and so forwards; But (says he) whosoever does work in the
Passover Evening after Midday, he is to be scourged or excommunicated,
because the Evening of the fourteenth day of Nishan, is not like to the Evening
of other Festival days, because in it is the Sacrifice, and the Feast. See
Ains. in Lev. 23. 5.

From these Testimonies of the Hebrew Doctors may be observed these four
Thalmudical Tenants.

1 That the fourteenth of Nishan was not a full holy day (as some do
unadvisedly affirm) it was no more but a half-holiday, namely the full Evening
only.

2 That the Jews observed two sorts of Evenings to every Sabbath; one before
the Sabbath for the date of the person purified; and another from Midday, and
so forwards; for the Evening of the 14. of Nishan (says Maymony) is not like
unto the evening of other Festival days, because in it is the Sacrifice, and
the Feast; But the Evening of other Festival days, meaning the Evening before,
had no sacrifice; but yet the Midday Evening of every Festival Sabbath was as
holy as the Passover Evening, and had Sacrifice, and feasting belonging to it.

3 That the Evening of the fourteenth day was the time of sacrificing all their
Passeovers.

4 That from the time of Sunset till Midnight was the time of Feasting on the
Passover, and that it belonged to the Evening of the fourteenth day.

Hence I conclude, that when Moses commanded them to kill all their Passeovers
in the Evening about the going down of the Sun, Deuteronomy. 16. 6. he did not mean it
of the Sunset Evening, but of the Midday Evening, for then the Sun does first
begin to go down, or decline.

Object. 4. If the business about the Passover was so restrained as you say
it was,

1 To be killed by the Priests and Levites only, 2 To be killed at one Temple
only, 3 And that the blood must be sprinkled at one Altar only,
Then I do not see how they could sacrifice all the Passeovers of Canaan
between the two Evenings from Midday to Sunset; for there could not be less
than a hundred thousand Passeovers and Peace Offerings, when all the twelve
Tribes met together, though you do allow twelve or thirteen persons to each
Passover.

Ans. I think I have made it evident already,

1 That all the Passeovers of Canaan were killed by the Priests and Levites
only. 2 In one Temple only. 3 That all their blood was sprinkled by the
Priests only. 4 On one Altar only, and all this was done in the appointed
season thereof, namely between the two Evenings.
And this was no impossible, but a fecible thing, if all circumstances of quick
dispatch be rightly weighed.

1 There was a competent number of Priests and Levites that waited upon this
service; for though at first the number of the Priests and Levites in the
Wilderness from thirty years old to fifty, was but eight thousand five hundred
and eighty, Number. 4. 48. yet at length they were so multiplied, that in the
days of David they were eight and thirty thousand men, 1 Chro. 23. 3. So many
hands therefore would make but light work of a hundred thousand Passeovers in
the time of the first Evening from Midday till Sunset.

2 The place where they killed all their Passeovers and Peace Offerings was not
strait, but conveniently spacious; for these kind of sacrifices might be killed
in any part of the Court of the Temple, because they were numbered among their
lighter holy things. But the most holy things, such as the Burnt-offering,
Sin-offering and Trespasse-offerings were, these must be killed nearer to the
Altar than the Passeovers and Peace Offerings were, namely upon the ground
close by the North-side of the Altar, Lev. 1. 11. Lev. 7. 2. But the light holy
things, such as the Passover, and Peace Offerings were, them they killed, and
received the blood in Bowls, in any part of the Courtyard, says Manymony. See
Ains. in Lev. 1. 11.

3 Though no Levite might sprinkle the blood of any Sacrifice upon the Altar,
yet for the quicker dispatch of many Sacrifices No I evites, none but Priests
only must sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice upon the Altar.
they might kill and receive the blood in Bowls, and so bring it to the Priests
that stood ready at the foot of the Altar to receive it, and to sprinkle it
upon the Altar; for no Levite, but Priests only might sprinkle the blood upon
the Altar; for the sprinkling of the blood was of the Essence of the sacrifice
as the Hebrew Doctors do collect. See Ains. in Lev. 1. 5. 6. Exodus 12. 45. The
Levites might kill, and flay, and receive the blood in Bowls, and bring it to
the Priests that stood ready to receive it at their hands at the foot of the
Altar, 2 Chronicles. 29. 34, 35. 2 Chro. 30. 17. 2 Chronicles. 35. 11. and this
occasioned the Priest to make the more quick dispatch; and especially
considering the Priests and Levites were so dextrous in their office they might
kill a hundred thousand Passeovers and Peace Offerings between Midday and
Sunset; and there is a clear example that all this was done in the time and
manner aforesaid in the eighteenth year of Josias, and yet there never was the
like Passover kept in Israel (namely not when Israel was joined with Judah,
there was not the like Passover, and yet doubtless, there were as many
Paschal Lambs, but never the like multitude of Peace Offerings that were added
to the Passover, and in that respect they were called the Passover, as they
are in Deuteronomy. 16. 2. 4.) from the days of Samuel the Prophet unto that day, 2
Chro. 35. 18.

Object. 5. How could so many thousand Passeovers be roasted in one Temple, and
how could so many thousand people sit there in companies to feast on their
Passeovers?

Ans. As for the great business of Rosting so many Passeovers, It was not tied
precizely to the Temple as the sacrificing was: for though there were many
Passeovers Roasted in the Temple, as there were in the days of Josiah, 2 Chronicles.
35. 13. yet that business might also be transmitted to any house in the Holy
City, as I showed a little before, and as the example of our Savior, and his
Apostles does testify; for our Savior was at Bethany, when he sent two of his
Disciples to make ready the Passover; 1 By carrying their Lamb to the Temple
to be sacrificed, and thence to a private house in the holy City to be roasted;
and as soon as the Sunset Evening was come, our Savior came to the place
appointed, and as soon as the hour for feasting was come, our Savior sat down
with the twelve, and he continued in feasting with the twelve first on the
Passover, and then 2 on their Peace Offerings, with his prayers and
exhortations, It was not convenient for above twenty persons to join together
for one Passover.
the full time of the latter Evening from Sunset till Midnight, Matthew. 26. 18,
20. By this example, we see that thirteen persons may conveniently join
together at one Passover, and the Hebrew Doctors say, That twenty may make
their account for one Lamb, Exodus 12. 4. but not above twenty.

By this means we may perceive that all the Passovers in Canaan might well be
dispatched in the Evening of the fourteenth day, in the first Evening they
might be all sacrificed, and in the second Evening they might all be feasted on
with Religious solemnity, without any doubt to the contrary.

Reason 3. I will now return to prove by a third Reason, that the going down of
the Sun in Deu. 16. 6. must be understood from the first going down of the Sun
from Midday till Sunset, because the next phrase will not suffer it to be
understood otherwise. At the season thou came out of Egypt.

Object. 6. Here it may be demanded what season was it in which they came out
of Egypt?

Answ. It was in the strength or in the body of the day, Exodus 12. 41. namely
it was about Midday. The Hebrew Doctors say, That as God brought Israel out of
Egypt at Midday, so he slew the firstborn of Egypt at Midnight. The
Israelites did not fly out of Egypt as persons frighted, either in the Sunset
Evening, or in the Twilight, as it were through stealth, or through fear, as
Zedekiah did out of Jerusalem, Ezekiel. 12. but they went out of Egypt with a high
hand, in the fight of all the Egyptians, Numb. 33. 3. or they went out in the
strength or in the body of the day, for at Midday the Sun is in its greatest
strength, Prove. 4. 18. Psalm. 37. 6. Rev. 1. 16. but after the Midday is past,
namely as soon as the Sun is declined but a little toward the West, or toward
the place of Sunset, then the day is said to grow weak, so the Hebrew speaks,
Jud. 19. 19. for then the Sun has lost much of its strength which it had at
Midday, and then the day may be said to be spent, or to be bowed down, or
declined; all these phrases are used, and may be compared together, see Judge.
19. 19. with Mar. 6. 35. Luke 9. 19. and Luke 24 29.

Object. 7. Perhaps this phrase, At the season thou came out of Egypt, does
not mean the time of the day, but the time of the year when they departed, and
according to that time of the year Moses does command them to kill all their
Passovers.

Answ. This Objection argues great ignorance in the plain story: For the time
of the year when they came out of Egypt, was on the fifteenth day of Nishan,
Number. 33. 3. But Moses did straightly command them to kill all their Passeovers on
the fourteenth day of Nishan between the two Evenings; and this fourteenth day
was so strictly commanded that it might not be altered, though it fell out upon
a Sabbath day; Therefore this phrase, At the season thou came out of Egypt,
must not be understood of the time of the year, but of the time of the day
only, which was in the strength of the day, that is to say at Midday, in this
season they are commanded to begin to kill their Passeovers in Canaan, Exodus
12. 6. Lev. 23. 5. Number. 9. 3.

Object. 8. May not the sacrificing of the Passover be changed from the A
digression to open some difficult phrases about the passover, and they are the
more difficult, because they are borrowed from the Dialect of the Thalmud.
fourteenth day, to the fifteenth day; seeing Matthew. says thus, On the first
day of Unleavened-bread, the Disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will thou
that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover, Matthew. 26. 17. Now the first day
of Vnleavened-bread was the fifteenth day of Nishan?

Answ. This day which is called the First day of Unleavened bread, cannot be
rightly understood without the knowledge of the Jewish ancient Customs, which
are now for our information recorded in the Thalmuds; and because this, and
many other phrases in the New Testament are recorded in the Thalmuds, we may
well say, That the New Testament does often Thalmudize, because it uses many
terms that are no where else to be found but in the ancient Hebrew Doctors,
and in the Thalmuds only.

Now for Answer in a more special manner, the Hebrew Doctors do comprehend
under the general term of the Feast of Unleavened-bread (and more especially
under the first day of Unleavened-bread) the Feast of the Paschal Lamb; for
though they are two distinct Feasts, yet they are also so interwoven together,
that they may well be called the one for the other; for though the Paschal Lamb
was always sacrificed on the 14. day between the two Evenings, yet the time of
feasting on that holy flesh, was after Sunset, which was after the fifteenth
day (called the first of Unleavened-bread) was begun, according to the date of
the person purified; and yet the Feast of this Evening was no part of the Feast
of Unleavened-bread, for the sacrifices of that day were not yet killed; but
this Feast was the proper Feast of the Passover belonging to the fourteenth
day, and with the Passover also they might not eat any Leavened (but
Unleavened) bread, and in this respect Maymony does call the Feast of the
Paschal Lamb, the Feast of Unleavened-bread, and sometimes he calls the seven
days of the proper Feast of Unleavened bread by the name of the Passover,
interchangeably confounding the terms. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 7. and in this
sense also Targum Jonathan calls the second day of Unleavened-bread, the day
that followed the first good day of Passover. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 15.

Hence you see, that he calls the first day of Unleavened-bread, The first good
day of the Passover, and so interchangeably they call the proper feast of the
Pascha, the first day of Unleavened-bread; and from this usual dialect among
them the Evangelist Matthew says, That the Disciples came to Jesus Christ on
the first day of Unleavened bread, saying, Where will thou that we prepare for
thee to ^a^ the Passover? And thus the Evangelists speak according to the
Jewish Customs; sometimes they call the proper feast of the Pascha, the first
of Unleavened-bread, as Matthew. 26. 17. and Mark. 14. 12. and sometimes they
call the proper Feast of Unleavened-bread by the name of the Passover, as Luke
does, chap. 22. 1.

But yet secondly, The Hebrew Doctors do sometimes distinguish the proper Feast
of the Pascha from the first day of the proper Feast of Unleavened bread;
Charkumi calls the Evening of the first good day, and that Night, the
Passover; But (says he) the residue of the Feast from the first Night, and so
forwards, is called the Feast of Unleavened-cakes; See Ains. in Lev. 23. 6. and
according to this distinction speaks the Evangelist Mark, Mar. 14. 1. after
two days followed the Pascha, and the Unleavened-bread; and this distinction
does also agree with the twofold Command in Moses, In the fourteenth day of the
first month is the Passover; And in the fifteenth day (which begins at
Sunset) is the Feast, Numb. 28. 16, 17.

Object. 9. Mr. Weams and others, do affirm, That the Jews ate not the Passover
on the fourteenth of Nishan as Christ did, but transferred it to the fifteenth
day, and to the beginning of the sixteenth day; and he gives this reason for
it, because the next day (after Christ had eaten his Passover) is called the
Preparation-day to the Jewish Passover, Joh. 18. 28. Joh. 19. 14. Hence he
infers, that the Jews transferred the eating of the Passover till the next day
after Christ had eaten his. See Weams on the Ceremonial Laws, Page 89. and the
Annotat. of our old English Bibles in Mat. 26.

Ans. I believe that Mr. Weames and others have no better ground for this
tenent but some frivolous Authors, and therefore Mr. Godwin does put a note of
dislike upon such as follow such frivolous Authors; and indeed it is a great
impiety for us Christians to slander them with so gross a transgression as
this; I believe that the Jews, in their corruptest times before Christ, were
very strict in observing the letter of the Command, and mo^^ zealous also to
punish such as did openly practice the contrary; and it is most evident, that
they held so close to the letter of the Command, that they would not transfer
it to any other day, though i^ fell out to be on a Sabbath day; it is a
received Canon among them, that the keeping of the Pascha on the fourteenth of
Nishan does put away the Sabbath, as I have noted it formerly.

Secondly, The Evangelist Mark does testify on the Jews behalf against all
men, that they kept the Pascha in the very self-same day that our Lord and his
Disciples did, for Mark does express it thus; In the first day of unleavened
Bread, [when they Sacrificed the Passeover] his Disciples said unto him, Where
will thou that we go and prepare that thou may eat the Passover? Mark 14.
12. this term [when they] namely when the Jews in general sacrificed the
Passover, then his Disciples said unto him, Where will thou that we go and
prepare, that thou (as well as they) may eat the Passover on the self-same
day as the Jews in general did.

Thirdly, Christ himself does bear witness, that the Jews in general did keep
the Pascha in the very self-same day that he did; Ye know (said Christ unto
his Disciples) that after two days the Pascha is kept, Mat. 26. 2. he says,
You know it, that the Pascha is then kept; it was a known custom among them,
that after two days the Pascha is kept, namely generally of all the Iows.

Fourthly, The Hebrew Doctors do protest, that they punish him that passes the
fourteenth day for the killing of the Pascha; Maymony says, it is an express
Commandment to kill the Pascha in the month Nishan, in the 14th. day, and
(says he) he that breaks this Commandment and kills it not in the 14th.
day, being not defiled, nor in a far journey, is guilty of being rooted out (or
cut off) thus the Jews protest against our slander. See Bro. in his
Advertisement of corruptions in Religion, p. 104.

Fifthly, This our gross mistake of the Jews practice does arise from our
mistake of the meaning of the word Passover, in John 18. 28. he says thus;
The Jews went not into Pilate: common Hall lest they should be defiled, but
that they might eat the Passover; and in chapter 19. 14. John says, It was the
preparation of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. Hence some that are not
well acquainted with the Jews customs, which are now recorded in their Thalmuds,
as the learned do observe, have collected this inference, that the Jews
transferred the Passover from the evening of the fourteenth day, to the
evening of the fifteenth day, and also to the sixteenth day; but indeed in this
term Passover John does Thalmudize, and therefore without the help of the
Hebrew Doctors it is not easy to spel John's meaning; they apply the term
Passover not only to the proper Feast of the Pascha, but (as I noted in my
answer to the former objection) they use it as a general term for the whole
Feast of unleavened Bread, and in that respect they count all the days of it as
if they were the days of the Passover; but more especially they did account
the first day of unleavened Bread to be a Passover day, because they did then
feast on the Peace Offerings belonging to the Passover, for they sacrificed
with the Paschal Lamb on the fourteenth day, certain Peace Offerings of Sheep
or Oxen, and these voluntary Peace Offerings they called the Passover, because
they were sacrificed together with the Paschal Lamb on the fourteenth day; and
by the Law they might be eaten for the space of two days and one night, Levit.
7. 16. now the Jews had eaten the Paschal Lamb the night before, but they had
not as yet endedtheir feasting on these Peace Offerings, which John calls the
Passover; the term Passover in this last sense is not understood of many; but
Mr. Broughton and Mr. Ainsworth have given special notice of the word Passover
in this sense, and that the Hebrew Doctors had grounded their common use of it
on the Law, in Deuteronomy. 16. 2. 4. and Mr. Broughton cites Solomon Jarchi speaking
thus in Deuteronomy. 16. If many belong to one Passover, then they add to it
Chagiga, Oxen, for the Holy Day feast, and says Jarchy (presently after) the
proper sense of the Scripture is, that the flesh of the Chagigah-Passeover,
which thou do sacrifice in the evening with the Lamb-Passeover, shall be eaten
in the fourteenth day, and in the fifteenth day (take notice by the way that he
makes no mention of the sixteenth day, as Mr. Weames does most falsely.)

Maymony also says, When they offered the Passover in the first Month, they
offered it with the Peace Offerings of the fourteenth day, Oxen, or
Flock-beasts, great or small, Male or Female; but they offered not the Chagigah
if the Lamb sufficed the company, and so it was voluntary and not forced by
(any affirmative) Commandment, and it was eaten two days and one night (and not
in the second night, as M. Weames does mistakingly say.)

In these words Maymony does tell us, that John spoke from the depth of
Thalmudique knowledge, and in this sense also does Mr. Ainsworth explain the
equivocation of the word Passover from the Hebrew Doctors, in Deuteronomy. 16. 2, 4.
and in Lev. 7. 16.

John says it was morning and they went not into P^aetorion that they might
not be defiled, but might eat the Passover; not the Passover strictly taken,
for that was eaten the night before; but that they might eat their voluntary
Peace Offerings which they had sacrificed with the Lamb-Passeover the day
before, and which by the Laws allowance they might feast on all the next day
till Sunset, but no longer, Lev. 7. 16.

These Peace Offerings are called the Passover by the Lawonce, in Deuteronomy. 16. 2.
and they are also clearly comprehended under the term Passover in 2 Chronicles. 35.
11. but they are most usually called the Passover in the Writings of the
Hebrew Doctors, and from their custom John does use the word Passover in their
sense.

John says it was morning, and it was the preparation of the Passover, and
about the sixth hour, which sixth hour, according to their account by their
great hours, began at our ten a Clock, and ended with our twelve a Clock, and
this time was called the Jews preparation in order to their Passover Dinner,
and in that respect they were afraid to come into Pilates Common Hall lest they
should be defiled, and so might be made unfit to eat the Passeovers
Peace Offerings at Dinner time.

Object. 10. You say that by the allowance of the Law the Jews might feast on
the Peace Offerings that were offered with the Passover, for two days and one
night, namely, till the next day at Sunset, but not after Sunset; but John
speaks of another preparation to the Sabbath, his words in chap. 19. 31. run
thus; The Jews then because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not
remain upon the Cross (for that Sabbath was a high day) besought Pilate that
their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken down.

Ans. This preparation is indeed a differing preparation from the former, the
former was their fore-noon preparation to their Passover Dinner, but this
preparation was nigh unto Sunset, and so consequently it approached apace unto
that festival Supper, that did properly belong unto the Feast of unleavened
Bread, and in that respect they besought Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken down, lest their cruelty, in suffering
them to hang longer on the Tree, should be a blot to their joyful Feast, for
this day was the first of unleavened Bread, which was the first and the chief
of all their High Sabbaths: Now as soon as the chief Priests had made this
request to Pilate, Joseph of Arimathea did wisely espy the advantage of time,
and then he also went boldly unto Pilate, requesting that he might have the
Body of Jesus in his own power to bury it. The time when this was done was when
the Evening was come, as two Evangelists do witness, Mat. 27. 17. Mar. 15. 42.
and so Tindall in his Bible does translate and expound Mark 15. 42. thus, when
night was come, because it was the evening that goes before the Sabbath.

This preparation therefore in Joh. 19. 31. must needs be in relation to their
solemn Festival Supper, which did properly belong to this High Sabbath, as John
does call it.

Before Dinner the Jews were careful lest they should be defiled, by going into
Pilates Judgment Hall, and so should have been hindered from their Festival
Dinner, and now also at Sunset they take the like care to avoid cruelty, etc.

If this Sabbath spoken of had been the weekly Sabbath, or seventh Day, then
though they had been defiled they might have resorted to their Synagogues, for
there the clean and the unclean might meet together every Sabbath, or seventh
Day, as I have observed in Chap. 4. but in case they had been defiled by any
accident whatsoever at Sunset, they could not have eaten of their festival
Sabbath-supper, for all Israel were admonished to be clean at every solemn
Feast, says Maymony.

Obj. 11. Why does John call the first day of the Feast of unleavened Bread a
high Sabbath? Joh. 19. 31.

Ans. All the seven solemn Festival Sabbaths in Levit. 23. 7. are called High
Feasts by the Geneva, in Eze. 45. 17. But secondly, this first day of the Feast
of unleavened Bread was the very first of all those seven Sabbaths, it was the
day in which the Lord brought them out of Egypt with a high hand, and
therefore the Lord did in a special manner charge them to remember this day for
ever, Exodus 13. 3. this Day and the weekly Sabbath have the word remember
prefixed before them more than any other Sabbaths, and in this regard the
Hebrew Doctors in Deuteroproton, and in (...) do call Pascha day a great
Sabbath, but they do not give this high title to the proper Passover day, for
that was no Sabbath, it was but half Holy Day, and therefore Moses does not
reckon it into the number of the Festival Sabbaths, in Genesis 23. but they mean
it of the first day of the Feast of unleavened Bread, this day they called a
great Sabbath, and Pascha Day, because in it they did festivally eat the
remainder of their Peace Offerings, which they had offered with the
Lamb-Passeover on the fourteenth day.

But though they held this day to be a great Festival Sabbath, and showed great
reverence to it now in their request to Pilate, because it was their
preparation time to their Festival Supper, yet in the morning they held it
lawful to judge Causes of Life and Death, as we may see they did in our
Saviors case, and after Sunset they held it lawful not only to bury, but also
to imbalm the Dead, as the godly persons did to our Savior. See Ains. in Lev.
23. 56. but they did not hold any of this work lawful to be done on their
weekly Sabbath, Luke 23. 56.

Obj. 12. Why does John use the term Sabbath twice over in John 19. 31. does he
speak but of one kind, or of two sorts of Sabbaths?

Ans. John speaks but of one high Festival Sabbath only, now it was their
immediate preparation to their high Festival Sabbath-Supper, and therefore
having satisfied their malice on Christ, they besought Pilate that their legs
might be broken, and that they might be taken down, for that Sabbath was a high
Sabbath. I grant also that the weekly Sabbath was now begun, according to the
date of the person purified, but not the seventh Day it self, for this high
Festival Sabbath was now in its full force, and in its solemn Feast.

Secondly, The time of Christ's Burial is noted by Luke to be The time of
Christ's burial was at Starlight.
when the said Festival Sabbath did begin to lighten, Luke 23. 54 so does Mr.
Broughton and Mr. Weames read it, and so does the Syriac read it; in this
phrase the Evangelist Luke does plainly Thalmudize, his words run thus; That
day was the preparation, and the Sabbath began to lighten; two things are
observable; 1. Luke says this day was the preparation, namely to their
festival Supper. 2. He describes the exact time when Christ was enclosed in the
heart of the earth; it was when this High Sabbath began to lighten, namely, in
the first place with the Evening Star, and that was a perspicuous mark of the
near time of their Festival Supper, but they did not begin their Festival
Supper till three Stars appeared, as I have noted in chap. 4. and Luke does
relate to this custom of theirs, in showing that the time of Christ's Burial
was, when the Sabbath began to lighten; but I believe the chief Priests did
defer the time of their feasting now somewhat longer than at other times,
because they had some business to do with Pilate before they could intend
their Festival Supper, for they went to Pilate to entreat him, that the
Sepulcher might be made sure until the third day, because this Deceiver said,
that he would rise again the third day, Mat. 27. 62, 63. This request of theirs
no doubt did occasion their delay to begin their High Sabbath Supper till more
than three Stars appeared in the Sky this night.

Obj. 12. You say the Priests went to Pilate to entreat him to make sure the
Sepulcher before they kept their Festival Supper; but it is out of doubt (I
think) that they did not go to Pilate till the next morning, for Matthew calls
the time of their going to Pilate the next day that followed their preparation,
Mat. 27. 62.

Ans. Ignorance of the Jewish Customs makes many misconstructions, the next day
began at Sunset, as I have sufficiently explained the matter in Chap. 4. Sect.
2. and this day followed their Preparation to their Festival Supper, for their
preparation in the afternoon was either by washing away of some light
defilements, or else it was their preparation of holy flesh by offering
sacrifices, etc.

But Matthews meaning lies fair and round thus; The next day (after their
preparation) which began at the Sunset evening, they assembled unto Pilate to
make the foresaid request. Hence note, that they did not go to Pilate to make
this request till the next day, namely, not till after Sunset, and then also
they had commission to make him sure, by appointing such a Watch; and all this
they did after it was Starlight.

Their Satanical policy would not suffer them to stay so long as until the next
morning, for then Pilate would have said to them, Why did you neglect to set a
Watch about his Sepulcre over night, as soon as he was buried, for if his
Disciples had had any mind to steal him away they would have done it in the
first part of the night? and doubtless when the Soldiers came to the chief
Priests to tell them what had happened, the chief Priests would have said that
his Disciples stole him away before they began their watch; but the chief
Priests could not plead that excuse because they went presently to the
sepulcher, and made it sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch, Matthew. 27.
66. Hence it follows, that they went to Pilate in the beginning of their next
Ceremonial day, namely presently after Sunset before they began their Festival
Supper.

2 Pilates answer to their request implies that they came overnight, for
Pilate says, You have a Watch, go make it sure as you know. Hence it follows,
that they came to Pilate when Watches were wont to be set; but if they had not
come to him til the next morning, then in reason he would have said, Get
Warders, and make it sure. Hence it follows, that the next day in which they
came to Pilate was at the Sunset Evening, for that was their next day, or it
was their morrow, as I have opened, 1 Samuel 30. 17. and Lev. 27. 15. All these
considerations laid together make it evident that the time ere Christ was
enclosed in the heart of the earth, was when the Sabbath began to lighten with
stars.

Object. 13. How can you call their Festival Supper the proper Feast that does
most properly belong to the first day of Vnleavened-bread; had they not a
Festival Dinner belonging to this High Sabbath as well as a Festival Supper?

Ans. I grant they had a Festival Dinner belonging to this day, as well as a
Festival Supper; but my meaning is, that their Festival Dinner was not entirely
made of the sacrifices of this day, as their Festival Supper was: for part of
their Festival Dinner (at least) was made of the Remainder of those
Peace Offerings which were sacrificed in the former day with the
Lamb-Passeover, and so by that means their festival Dinner did partake of the
Sacrifices of the fourteenth day; but their Festival Supper was made entirely
of the Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and yet this Sabbath-Feast was kept in
the night after the date of the Ceremonial beginning of the sixteenth day, in
which none of the flesh of their Chagigah-Passeover might remain, for that had
been to keep the holy flesh within the third day, which was plainly prohibited
by the letter of the Law: Hence it follows, that all the flesh of their
Chagigah-Passeover must be eaten at Dinner, or else if any of it did remain
until the beginning of the sixteenth day it must be burnt, Lev. 7. 17. and
therefore it follows that this high Sabbath-Supper was entirely made of the
Sacrifices of the fifteenth day, and in that respect, it was the most proper
solemn Feast of this High Sabbath.

Object 14. It seems to me that Moses does allow the flesh of the
Chagigah-Passeover to remain unto the morning of the third day, in Deu. 16. 4.
and that is a longer time than you speak of from Lev. 7. 17. Boker, the
morning, is put for the beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day at Sunset.


Ans. Boker, the morning, in Deu. 16. 4. must not be taken in a proper sense,
either for the beginning of the natural day, or of the morning of the
Artificial day; but in this place, it must be taken figuratively for the
beginning of the Jews Ceremonial day at Sunset; for as Boker, the morning, is
properly put for the beginning of the Natural day, or of the Artificial day, so
also it is figuratively put for the beginning of any other thing (as in Chap.
3. I have given several instances) and accordingly in this place it is
figuratively put for the beginning of the Ceremonial day at Sunset; for Moses
in Deuteronomy. 16. 4. might not give a contrary Law to what he had before given in
Lev. 7. 17. There he does expressly say, that none of the flesh of the voluntary
Peace Offerings shall remain until the third day, if any thing thereof remain
until the third day it shall be burnt. Hence it follows by necessary
consequence, that Boker, the morning, in Deu. 16. 4. must be taken in a
figurative sense for the beginning of their Ceremonial day at Sunset, and
therefore none of the flesh of the Chagigah-Passeover, (Moses does not speak of
the Lamb-Passeover in Deuteronomy. 16. 2. but of the Cagigah-Passeover) of Sheep and
Oxen, which were sacrificed in the fourteenth day with the Paschal Lamb, none
of this flesh might remain until the beginning, or until the morning of the
sixteenth day at Sunset, for then the flesh would have remained until the
third day after it was sacrificed, and then might not be eaten, but it must be
burnt.

Secondly, The Hebrew Doctors testify, that the flesh of their voluntary
Peace Offerings must remain but one whole night after it was sacrificed, and so
consequently but one natural morning. Maymony says thus, By word of mouth we
have learned that this is a prohibition for leaving the flesh of the Cagigah of
the fourteenth day unto the sixteenth day, as it said [unto the morning] that
is till the morning of the second day. See Ains. in Deu. 16. 4. their meanings,
that it should not be kept until the beginning (or until the morning) of the
sixteenth day, which begins at Sunset; in these words Moses does truly, though
figuratively, call the Sunset Evening, the morning, in Deuteronomy. 16. 4. This is a
mystery that belongs peculiarly to the Ceremonial Law, which the inexpert
cannot presently perceive; the like mystery it is to call the beginning of the
Jews Ceremonial day, the morrow, as it is three times over called in Lev. 23.
11, 15, 16. and once more in 1 Samuel 30. 17. as it is explained in Chap. 4. and
it is called their next day in Mat. 27. 62.

And it is a further mystery also that the Jews Ceremonial day should begin six
hours before the Natural day is ended. As for example, The fifteenth day of
Nishan was the first day of Unleavened bread, and a high Sabbath, and by their
Ceremonial custom it began before the Evening of the fourteenth day was ended;
for the Passover of the fourteenth day was not feasted on till after Sunset,
namely, not till after the fifteenth day by their Ceremonial account was begun,
according to the date of the person purified. These are Riddles to such as are
not studious in the Jews customs: They could not keep their Religious Festival
Suppers in the same Ceremonial day, for then they must have kept them the night
before their Sacrifices were offered, which was impossible; therefore the night
after their Festival Sabbaths, was the proper night of the Sabbaths by
Creation, though not by Ceremony; for the Ceremonial day, in which the polluted
person must be purified against their festival Sabbaths, must needs begin the
date of their new day before hand; and yet they must also keep the Festival
Supper appertaining to the Sabbath in the night after, and so by this means,
the Ceremonial day was interwoven with the Natural day for the several respects
already named, and therefore this phrase, It shall be eaten in the same day, in
which the Sacrifice was offered, Lev. 7. 15. and Lev. 22. 30. must not, nor
cannot be understood of the same Ceremonial day, but it may, and must be
understood of the same Natural day.

Object. 15. What need had they to keep their Religious Feasts in the night
after the Sabbath? was not the whole day from Sunset to Sunset sufficient?

Ans. It was not sufficient, because they must feast upon their Evening
sacrifices, as well as upon their Morning sacrifices, but they could not feast
upon their Evening sacrifices until after Sunset, because many times the
Evening sacrifices were not finished till Sunset, 2 Chronicles. 35. 14. therefore
they must of necessity have the night after as the appointed season for the
solemnity of their Religious Suppers; and therefore the Sunset Evening before
was not the beginning of the Natural day, it was but the beginning of the new
day to the person purified, he must of necessity begin his new day then, or
else he could not partake in the solemnities of their Sacrifices the day
following; but the Sunset Evening after the Sabbath was a natural part of the
former day, and the proper Feast of the Sabbath was then celebrated; and the
Prophet Isaiah has reference to this Custom, when he says, Ye shall have a
Song as in the Night, when a holy Solemnity is kept, Isa. 30. 29. for they kept
their Religious Suppers till Midnight, and it is evident that all their
Religious Feasts were kept with songs and with such like expressions of joy in
the Messiah for his Redemption, Es. 23. 15. Deu. 16. 15. Judge. 21. 19, 21. and
in this respect, all kind of sadness and mourning was forbidden at their
solemn Feasts, because it did profane that joyful Ordinance, Lev. 10. 19. Neh.
8. 10.

Object. 16. You seem to limit the time of their solemn Festival Supper, but
until Midnight, but the prohibition in Lev. 7. 15. says, Ye shall not leave
ought thereof until the morning; This implies a permission to continue their
Religious Feasting, not only until Midnight, as you would have it, but
until daybreak, as the Hebrew Doctors expound it.

Ans. I confess the Hebrew Doctors do expound the word Morning in this Text to
mean daybreak, but yet they do also often correct that Exposition, for they
say more than once, that they feared it might be a transgression to continue
the time of their solemn Suppers any longer than till Midnight.

The Hebrew Doctors say, That not only the sacrifice of confession of
Peace Offerings (but of other kinds of sacrifices also) might be eaten all the
night long till break of day; As for example, The Nazarites Ram, and the bread
that came with it, whether it were the portion of the Priests, or the portion
of the Owners, These might be eaten all the night long til break of day; and
the same law they say was for the Sin Offerings, and for the Trespas-offerings,
and for the Peace Offerings of the Congregation, and for the residue of the
Meat Offerings: All these (say the Hebrew Doctors, may be eaten all the night
long till break of day: But yet (says Maymony) To keep men far from
Transgression, our wise men have said, They are not to be eaten, but until
MIDNIGHT. See Ains. in Lev. 7. 18.

In like sort, they say of the residue of the Burnt-offerings, that they might
lie burning upon the Altar all the night long until the morning; that is (say
they) till break of day, Lev. 6. 9. but yet they do also correct that
Interpretation; for they say, Our wise men have said, that the Priests might
not let the fats or pieces of the Burnt-offering lie burning upon the Altar,
but until Midnight, for fear of Transgression.

The Hebrew Doctors say also, that they might continue feasting upon the flesh
of the Paschal Lamb till morning, Exodus 12. 10. that is (say they) till break
of day; but yet they say also that none of the company might eat again after he
had slept, though it were in the beginning of the night. See Ains. in Exodus 12.
10. Hence it is evident that they did allow none to make any more but one
distinct meal of the Paschal Lamb; and truly so small a creature needed not so
long a time to feast on it (but their voluntary Peace Offerings which they
offered with the Paschal Lamb, and in that respect did call them the Passover,
they might feast upon that flesh till daybreak, for they had two days
allowance to eat them by the Law, Lev. 7: 17, 18.) therefore seeing they might
make but one meal of the Lamb-Passeover, why should any man think of a longer
time to feast on it than till the Midnight Morning? if it had been requisite
to feast on it till day break, our Savior would have improved the full time;
but it is evident that he did finish all by Midnight, not only the Supper of
the Paschal Lamb, but also the Peace Offerings, which he adjoined to the
Paschal Lamb, Joh. 13. 12. (This 12. Ver. says, when he was set down again,
namely, afer he had ended the Lamb-Passeover in Verse 2. then he arose from
Supper, and washed his Disciples feet, Verse 3. then he sat down again to
feast upon the Chagigah-Passeover, Verse 12. At which Feast they used to drink
two or three cups of Wine, which our Savior improved for the institution of
his own Supper; they had no common Supper this night as some unadvisedly speak,
but all the flesh they ate was holy flesh, and all their Feasting was with
Religious joy for their Redemption) together with his long Exhortations,
Thanksgivings, Prayers and Psames. I apprehend it was much about the time of
Midnight, or rather before, when he had ended all.

And it does further appear that the Hebrew Doctors did fear it might be a
Transgression to continue at their Religious Feasting The Jews accounted the
first half of the night to be a part of the former day in the case of their
religious Feasting on their Passeovers.
on the Pascha till the morning at daybreak, because they do often limit the
time of their Religious Feasting, but until Midnight.

Maymony says, That the two Lambs which were presented as a Meat Offering,
together with the Two Loaves for the Peace Offerings of the Congregation, on
the day of Penticost, were eaten by the Priests in the Same Day, and in Half
the Night, as the flesh of the most Holy things were. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 20.
By this Testimony it is evident, that all their holy things were eaten in the
same day, and in half the night, except their voluntary Peace Offerings, for
they had allowance from the Law to feast on that flesh two days, and one
night, Lev. 7. 17, 18. Deuteronomy. 16. 2. 10.

Secondly, Consider this well; for though the Hebrew Doctors do sometimes say,
that the fats and the pieces of the Burnt-offering may lie burning upon the
Altar all night till break of day, yet they do also say, that their Wise men
did advise the Priests not to continue the burning upon the Altar any longer
than till Midnight, and in Exodus 23. 8. the Lord says, The fat of my Feast
shall not remain until the morning, therefore it must be wholly consumed with
fire before daybreak. And indeed, they might not continue the burning any
longer than til Midnight without manifest Transgression, esp^cially at
festival times; for at festival times, says Maymony, The Priests must take
away the ashes from the Altar at the beginning of the third part of the night;
But on Reconciliation-days they took away the ashes at Midnight. See Ains. in
Lev. 6. 10. By this Hebrew Canon it is evident that they could not continue the
burning of the fats and pieces of the Evening sacrifices until daybreak
without transgressing this necessary order in cleansing the Altar by way of
preparation to the morning sacrifices, for they might not do any other work
about the morning sacrifice till the ashes were taken from the Altar, for that
was the first work in order to the morning sacrifice, and they could not do
that work until the burning of the fats, and of the pieces of the Evening
sacrifices were finished; therefore they might not continue the burning any
longer than till Midnight (at sometimes at least) without Transgression,
especially in the night before the day of Reconciliation, for then the Priests
must take away the ashes from the Altar at Midnight; and by this it is evident
that the ancient Hebrew Doctors held that the morning (namely the root of it)
began at Midnight, because they did then give order to set things in a
readiness for the morning Sacrifice; and after this work was done, they had
many other things to set in order before they could offer the morning
Sacrifice, and the usual time of killing the morning Sacrifice was before
Sunrising, but on Expiation day it was killed at daybreak. See Ains. in Number.
28. 4. and Lev. 16. 4.

By these Records of the Hebrew Doctors, we may see the true Reason why they
feared it might be a Transgression to continue the burning any longer than till
Midnight, and why they feared it might be a Transgression to continue their
Festival Suppers any longer than till Midnight; it was because they held the
root of the morning to begin at Midnight; And Maymony says, Grateful is a
Commandment that is done in the hour of the same. See Ains. in Lev. 6. 10.

And hence my Answer is to this Objection, it is the safest way to expound the
word Morning, in Lev. 7. 15. and in Lev. 22. 30. etc. to signify, that the
root or the first beginning of the morning is at Midnight, for fear of
Transgression.

After this Treatise was ready for the Press, I met with a passage in Dr. See
his third part of his Harmony. p 194.
Leightfoot on Mark 1. 35. worth the inserting into this place.

Although (says he) the Jews did precisely begin their day from Sunsetting;
yet did they also make the Midnight a distinctive period to part between day
and day, so as to determine Rem Diei, in Diem suum.

Talmud in Beracoth, Per. 1. From what time do they say over their Phylacteries
at Even? From the time that the Priests go in to eat their portion of the
Sacrifices, till the end of their first Watch; But says R. Eliezer, The Wise
men said until M^d-night.

Ibid. in Pesach in Per. 10. The Passover after Midnight defiles the hands.

Jona Per. 1. and Maym. in Tamid. in Per. 2. The cleansing of the
Burnt-offering Altar on the day of Expiation began from Midnight.

Talm. in Zeuach in Per. 5. Trespasse-offerings might be eaten till midnight.

Ibid. Lesser holy Offerings may be eaten till Midnight.

Ibid. The Passover is not eaten but in the night; and it is not eaten but
till Midnight.

The meaning of these Passages is, That whereas these things were to be done to
day, and might not be put off till to morrow: If they were done any time before
Midnight, it was reputed current, as done to day.

Their Phylacteries were to be said over every day at Even: If they were said
over before Midnight, it served the turn for the day before.

And the parts of the Offerings that were to be eaten in the same day that the
Offering was offered (and might not be kept till the morrow) if they were eaten
before Midnight, it did serve the turn for the day before.

The Altar of Burnt-offering was to be cleansed every day; but on the day of
Expiation it began to be cleansed from the Midnight before, and that was taken
as done on the day of Expiation. (And so they observed to feast on the
Passover, but until Midnight.)

These things I have produced the rather, because of this passage in Mark 1.
35. which calls it the Morning; and yet it was (...), much of the Night yet
remaining: for as they reckoned up till Midnight for the day that was past; So
they reckoned the morning to begin at Midnight to the day following.

Were I to discuss the Question about the beginning and ending of our
Christian Sabbath, I should think this matter worth consideration to that
purpose.

And something parallel to this are those Texts in Exodus 12. 22. None of you
shall go out of the door of his house until the morning; yet verse 29. at
Midnight the Lord smote the Firstborn, etc. verse 33. And the Egyptians were
urgent upon the people that they might send them out, Deuteronomy. 16. 1. and God
brought thee forth of Egypt by Night.

Now this Morning in Mar. 1. 35. in which Christ rose so very early, and went
out to pray, was on the morrow after the Sabbath; the day on which the
Christian Sabbath was fixed ere long, which may not be unobserved, since so
special a matter is mentioned of that day.

Thus far out of Doctor Leightfoot, which does illustrate and strengthen that
which I have said in sundry places, about the beginning of the morning at
midnight.

Secondly, I come now to speak of the second Part of the Passover Evening,
which was for the use of their Religious Feasting from Sunset to midnight.

After my long digression to answer several Objections about the Jews customs,
I come now to speak of the second part of the Passover Evening, appointed for
the time of their religious Feasting on their Passeovers, and that was from
Sunset to Midnight, and this space of time was all the latter evening.

And this is evident,

1 By the appointment of Moses. 2 By the practice of our Savior.
1 Moses appointed all Israel to eat the flesh of the Paschal Lamb [In that
Night] Exodus 12. 8, 42. namely in that part of the night that belonged to the
fourteenth day by Creation.

2 It is evident that Christ did not sit down to eat the Passover with his
twelve Apostles, until the latter evening was come; for Christ himself was in
the fore-noon, or in the beginning of the afternoon at Bethany, when he sent
two of his Disciples to Jerusalem to prepare the Passover, and to present it
to the Priests to be killed for them all between the two evenings, Mar. 14. 3.
12. 13. then after it was sacrificed he bad them carry it to such a house, and
make it ready against his coming, and in thus doing he did according to the
Jews custom, for their custom was, that if thirteen or twenty did join together
for one Passover, they did send one or two of their company to present it to
the Priest, and so to make it ready for the rest. See Ains. in Numb. 9. 12.
then at Sunset they all met together, and began the feast at the hour
appointed. This custom our Savior observed, for he came not in person to
Jerusalem til the latter evening was come, Mat. 26 20. Mar. 14. 17. and when he
was come he did not sit down to eat until the appointed hour was come, Luke 22.
14. this hour in general was the latter evening at Sunset, but the particular
hour of their feasting was not by the Hebrew Doctors Canons until three Stars
did appear after Sunset. See Ains. in Lev. 22. 9.

2 It is evident that our Savior did not begin to Feast on his Passover
until the said evening was come, and it is evident also, that he finished all
his religious exercises and solemnities within the space of this latter
evening, from sunset till midnight, as I have opened the matter more in my
answer to the sixteenth objection.

Object. 17. How can you prove that the Passeover-Supper was celebrated in the
night of the fourteenth day, seeing you confess that the fifteenth day began
that night at Sunset; and the Hebrew Doctors affirm, that the flesh of the
Paschal Lamb was eaten in the fifteenth night; how then can that night
appertain both to the fourteenth, and to the fifteenth day?

Ans. It was the fifteenth night, according to the date of the person purified,
as I have opened the matter in chap. 4. and otherwhere, but in regard of the
Feast it did still properly appertain to the fourteenth day. As for example, if
a Jew were defiled on the Passover day by any of the lighter sorts of
uncleanesses, what course must he take that he might not be deprived of the
Passover Feast? the answer is, he must bathe or baptize himself in Water, at
the looking forth of the evening, that is to say, in the afternoon; And what
then? might he then carry his Lamb to the Temple to be sacrificed? No, he
might not yet go himself to the Temple, because his clensing was not fully
complete; but yet he might join with others, and cause others to kill the
Passover for him, because he was now in his first degree of cleansing, and
then as soon as the Sun was fully gone down upon him he was fully clean, and
then he began the date of his day of cleanenesse, and then as soon as three
Stars appeared after Sunset, he might sit down with the rest of that Society
to eat the Passover. See Ains. in Number. 9. 10.

And thus the Sunset evening was the fifteenth day to the Person purified, and
yet it was properly the fourteenth day still, in respect of feasting on the
Sacrifices; and thus these two actions of Feasting and Purifying may well bear
the date of two several days thus enter-woven together, without any confusion
or disorder.

1 It was necessary that the Person purified should begin the date of his new
day as soon as his Ceremonial cleanenesse was perfected by the setting of the
Sun upon him after his Baptising, as I have opened the matter in chap. 4.

2 It was also as necessary that the solemn act of feasting upon the flesh of
their Sacrifices should bear the date of the same day with the said Sacrifices;
1 Because the act of Feasting received no new degree of cleanenesse at Sunset,
as the person purified did. 2. Because the act of feasting in the latter
evening after Sunset had a necessary dependence upon the act of Sacrificing in
the former evening, for the act of feasting on the Holy flesh in the latter
evening was but to help on the Spiritual application of that document that was
typified and exhibited by the sacrifice in the former evening; therefore seeing
the act of feasting had such a necessary dependence upon the act of
sacrificing, I see no reason why this continued Sacramental Passover should
bear the date of two several proper Natural days; I see no reason why the act
of feasting should bear the date of the fifteenth day, except it be only in
relation to the date of the person purified, and thus Maymony above cited must
be understood, that the flesh of the Paschal Lamb was eaten on the fifteenth
night, namely, according to the date of the person purified, though in regard
of the Feast it self it was but the fourteenth night still, as in my next
answer at fifthly I have cited his words.

Obj. 18. I desire to see yet further, how you can prove that the latter
evening at Sunset was a true part of the fourteenth day in the case of their
religious Feasting upon the Passover.

Ans. 1. I prove it by Exodus 12. 6, 8, and 14. verses compared together; the
sixth verse commanded them to kill all their Passeovers between the two
evenings; this was the allowed season for the sacrificing of all their
Passeovers in Egypt. 2. The eighth verse sets out the allowed season for the
time of feasting; they shall eat the flesh in that Night, namely, in that night
that does properly belong to the fourteenth day; and then 3. In verse fourteen,
he does unite these two solemn^ actions together in these words; This day shall
be to you for a memorial, ye shall festivally keep it for a feast unto
Jehovah; mark this phrase, This day, and ye shall festivally keep it; what day
does he mean else, but the fourteenth day before spoken of? and ye shall
festivally k^ep i^, and yet the Feast was kept after Sunset. Hence it follows,
that the time of feasting on the Paschal Lamb after Sunset was a true part of
the fourteenth day by Creation, though it was the beginning of the fifteenth
day to the person purified.

2 It is evident, that the Sunset evening is a true part of the same
fourteenth day by Creation, by Numb. 9. 11. In the second Month, in the
fourteenth day of the Month, between the two evenings they shall do it, with
unleavened Cakes, and bitter Herbs shall they eat it.

In this text Moses does speak of a Twofold action to be done in the evening
of the fourteenth day of the month; He speaks of doing it, namely according to
the Command, that is to say, of sacrificing it between the two evenings;
Secondly, He speaks of the act of feasting with unleavened Cakes, and bitter
Herbs.

Moses does not distribute these two Sacramental actions unto two several
Natural days, but commands them both to be done in the same fourteenth day of
the month.

3 It is evident by Jos. 10. 3. that they kept the Feast of the Paschal Lamb on
the fourteenth day of the Month at Even; Joshuae names only the time of
Feasting (though the time of Sacrificing must be understood) he says plainly,
that it must be feasted on in the fourteenth day of the Month at even, I cannot
see how any man that loves plain truth can deny the Sunset evening to be a
true part of the former day.

4 It is evident that the latter evening was a true part of the fourteenth day,
because the seven days of unleavened Bread have seven latter evenings belonging
to them, besides the latter evening of the fourteenth day, so that they
observed eight festival Evenings together, and so Josephus does number them, in
Antiq. lib. 2. chapter 5. and hence it follows, that the Festival Supper which
belonged to the last day of unleavened Bread, which was the one and twentieth
day of the Month, did also bear the date of the two and twentieth day to the
person purified, and this latter evening was the allowed season for all their
Holy Festival Suppers, and oftentimes it was little enough, for they must boil
and roast all the flesh of their Peace Offerings, which were of the greater
kind, as sheep and Oxen, (for no Fowls were allowed for Peace Offerings. See
Ains. in Lev. 3. 6.) this did much increase the quantity of their Provisions,
and therefore it required the longer time both to Cook it, and to feast on it;
and all these days of Feasting were commanded to be done with great solemnity,
especially the first and the last, and with many relations of Gods goodness
for their deliverance out of Egypt, and with Songs and Psalms of praise, Deuteronomy.
16. 15. Exodus 23. 15. Deuteronomy. 27. 7. See Ains. in Exodus 12. 8. and in this
respect the latter evening was a competent time for these religious
Solemnities, and to continue the time of feasting longer, was a transgression:
for it is expressly commanded in Lev. 7. 15. that the holy flesh must be eaten
in the same day in which it was sacrificed; But if the Sunset evening had been
the true beginning of the Natural day, then this Holy flesh could not have been
eaten the same day, as I have noted the reason thereof formerly, and then God
by Moses had commanded us to do that which is not possible to be done;
therefore the Sunset evening is a true part of the same Natural day wherein
the flesh was sacrificed.

Maymony says (as I noted in objection sixteen) that the Priests did eat the
two Loaves which were presented to the Lord with the Meat Offering of the
Congregation on the day of Penticost, in the same day, and in half the night,
as the flesh of the most holy things were. See Ains. in Levit. 23. 20. so then,
in the judgment of the ancient Hebrew Doctors (for Maymony does but record
their judgment) the latter evening till midnight was a true part of the same
Natural day, in which the Sacrifices were offered, though yet notwithstanding
the purified person began the date of his new day at the Sunset before.

5 Thus (says Maymony) after he had related diverse circumstances about the
Passover, then is brought in a Table furnished with bitter Herbs, unleavened
Bread, and the Body of the Paschal Lamb, and the flesh Chagigah, which is
(says he) for the fourteenth day of the Month, he does not say which is for
the fifteenth day of the Month (though otherwise he does call this time the
fifteenth day of the Month) both are true in a right sense, namely in the sense
formerly given) and in another place Maymony says thus, The evening of the
fourteenth of N^shan is not like the evening of other Festival days, because in
it are the Feast, and the killing of Sacrifices. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 5. He
makes the time of feasting to belong to the fourteenth day; and secondly, he
preferres this evening to the evening of the Festival Sabbaths, and therefore
prescribes a greater punishment for servile work done on this evening, than for
working in the evening before the Festival Sabbaths, for so is the comparison
to be made, as I have noted it elsewhere, because in this evening was
solemnized the proper Feast of the fourteenth day; but the evening before was
but in way of preparation to the Sabbath it self. Thirdly, Maymony says thus,
They searched out Leaven in the beginning of the night of the fourteenth day;
Maymony calls the night before the Feast of the unleavened Bread the fourteenth
night, and yet in another place he calls it the fifteenth day.

Thus have I proved, not only by Scripture, but also by the consent of the
Hebrew Doctors, that the Sunset evening is a true part of the former day,
though it be also the beginning of a new day to the person purified, by a
Ceremonial institution.

CHAP. VI. Proving that the Day of Reconciliation was an extraordinary long
Sabbath, and an extraordinary long Fasting-day, and therefore the beginning of
this day ought not to be alleged as an exemplary Pattern, neither for the
beginning of any other Fasting-day, nor yet for the beginning of the Lords Day.
THe Law says thus, in Lev. 23. 32. ye shall afflict your Souls in the ninth
day of the Month, in the evening, from evening to evening you shall rest your
Sabbath.

This Sabbath was singular from other Sabbaths in two regards.

1 No other Sabbath was like it, for the services of it. 2 No other Sabbath was
like it, for the length of it.
1 No other Sabbath was like it, for the services of it.

For 1. All the Sacrifices of this day were commanded to be done by the High
Priest only, but on other Sabbaths they might be done by any other Priest as
well as by the High Priest.

2 There were more Burnt-offerings commanded to be offered for the public on
this Sabbath, than on any other Sabbath.

3 More Incense must be offered on this day, than on any other day.

4 There was more often sprinkling of blood on this day, than on any other day.

5 The High Priest did oftener wash on this day, than on any other day.

6 He used more sorts of Priestly garments on this day, than on any other day.

7 He did more often change his Garments on this day, than on any other day.

8 The High Priest did enter into the Holy of Holies on this day, and on no day
else all the year long; and thus no day was like this Sabbath in the services
of it.

2 No day was like this day for the length of it, neither in respect of the
fast, nor in respect of holy Rest of it.

For though it was commanded to b^ observed in the tenth day of the seventh
month, Lev. 23. 27. yet it was also commanded to begin in the Evening of the
ninth day, Lev. 23. 32.

This Evening of the ninth day has a double interpretation.

1 Some understand it of the sacrifice-Evening of the ninth day.

2 Some understand it of the Evening at the end of the ninth day where the
tenth day begins

1 In the first sense, Maymony says, They began to afflict their souls in the
Evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth day, and so they tarried in
their affliction a little in the night after the tenth day.

In these words you see that Maymony does not hold this fast to begin with the
tenth day at the Sunset Evening, according to the date of the new day of the
person purified; but in the evening of the ninth day, next before the tenth
day: And Maymony says moreover, That they must abide in their affliction a
little in the night after the tenth day.

This early beginning, and this late ending of this fasting-day does increase
the length of this day, beyond the length of any other fasting-day, or of any
other Sabbath day.

2 This clause [In] the ninth day of the month, in the Evening, is thus read by
the Greek Interpreters, From the ninth of the month, from the Evening; and thus
they vary the Preposition from [In] to [From] and their Translation agrees
fitly to the next clause from Even unto Even you shall Rest your Sabbath; and
by this reading, we may see that the Seventy do make the latter Evening of the
ninth day, to be a true part of the ninth day, though it were also the
beginning of the tenth day according to the date of the person purified.

3 Hence it is also evident, that Moses did not hold the natural beginning of
the tenth day to begin at the Sunset evening of the ninth day, for then Moses
words should have run thus, From the tenth of the month from the Evening; but
Moses does not say so, but from the ninth of the month from the Evening, either
he must mean it to begin from the Sacrifice-Evening of the ninth day, as
Maymony expounds it; or secondly, from the latter Evening of the ninth day (as
a true part of the ninth day) as the Seventy understand it; or thirdly, from
the Ceremonial beginning of the ninth day, which begins at the Sunset Evening
before the ninth day. But then,

4 If you will take this phrase from Even to Even to be from the Evening of the
ninth day, according to the date of the person purified, then all the ninth day
must be a fasting day as well as the tenth day, for the Evening of the ninth
day is the beginning of the ninth day according to the date of the person
purified; but if you desire to avoid this gross absurdity, then you must grant
that the natural Evening of the ninth day did not begin, but end the ninth day,
as the Seventy Interpreters do carry it.

5 They that do place the natural Evening at the beginning of the ninth day,
and yet do allow the Sacrifice Evening to be placed at the end of the ninth
day, they do thereby place the natural morning of the ninth day between the two
Evenings of the ninth day, and so they do make the morning Sacrifice to be
killed between the two Evenings; but when men will not receive the truth in the
love of it, it is just with God to let them run into such absurd consequences
as these.

6 This fasting-day was longer than any other fasting-day; for No fasting-day
among the Jews was so long as the Fast on the day of Atonement was.
all other public fasting days were left to the Elders of the Sanhedrim to be
appointed whenever they were in any distress, which were proclaimed to be
observed in all the Synagogues of the Land, as well as at the Temple: But they
did not enjoin them to begin those fasting days in the Evening before, with
such a strict abstinence as they did the day of Reconciliation; for the Hebrew
Doctors say, That it was lawful for them to eat in the night, when the feast
was on the morrow. See Ains. in Nu. 9. 10. By this testimony of Maymony, it is
evident that they began all their other solemn fasting-dayes in the morning,
and not in the evening before, except the day of Reconciliation only; therefore
no other public fasting-day was of such a length as this yearly fasting-day
was.

7 Neither was any other Sabbath of such a length for strict Rest as this
fasting-Sabbath was, for they must begin the strict Rest of this day, either in
the Sacrifice Evening of the ninth day, or at the beginning of the latter
Evening of the ninth: But they did not begin the strict Rest neither of their
festival Sabbaths, nor of the Sabbath or seventh day in the Evening before, as
they did this yearly fasting-Sabbath; For Maymony says, Such works as may be
done on the Evening of a Feast Day, they do not upon a Feast Day, etc. See Ain.
in 23. 7. By this testimony it is evident, that they did not hold the Evening
before their festival-Sabbaths to be as holy as the day it self.

2 Maymony says, It is unlawful to do works in the Evening of the festival
Sabbaths, from the time of the Evening Sacrifice, and forwards, Even as on the
Evenings of the Sabbaths; and who so does work in them shall never see a sign
of a Bessing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force,
though he is not for it to be scourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening
of the Passover after Midday whosoever does work therein after Midday, is to be
scourged, or excommunicated with the Niddui; for the Evening of the fourteenth
day of Nishan, is not like the Evening of other festival days, because in it
are the Feast, and the killing of Sacrifices. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 5.

Two things are observable from this Record of Maymony.

1 That the Jews did make some kind of preparation, both to their
festival-Sabbaths, and to their Sabbath or seventh day, from the time of the
Evening Sacrifice, and forwards.

2 Hence it is evident, that the Hebrew Doctors did not esteem any part of the
Evening before their Sabbaths, to be as holy as the day following, because they
did neither scourge, nor excommunicate any man, for working in the Evening
before their Sabbaths, as they did for working in the Passover Evening; and
the reason is plain, because they esteemed both the parts of the
Passeover-Evening to be the very day of the Passover it self; but it seems
they did not esteem the Evening before the Sabbath to be any true part of the
Sabbath it self, for doubtless, if they had esteemed it as a true part of the
Sabbath it self, they would not only have scourged and excommunicated such
persons, that did presume to work in the Evening, before the Sabbath, but also
they would have stoned them to death, if they had presumptuously broken the
rest of the holy Sabbath, Numb. 15. 35. And as Maymony makes the Evening of the
Passover, not like the Evening that went before their festival Sabbaths, nor
like the Evening that went before their weekly Sabbath; So I may say of the
Evening that went before the day of Atonement, that it was more strict for
holy rest than the Evening that went before any of the other Sabbaths.

From all the Premises, I conclude, that no day in all the year was commanded
to be of such a length for strict Rest as this day was, for the strict Rest of
this day, and the strict Fast of this day began in the Sacrifice Evening, or
else at the beginning of the latter Evening of the ninth day, and it continued
not only till a little after the Sunset Evening of the tenth day, as Maymony
says, But also it continued longer, for some of the holy duties of the tenth
day, could not be finished till Midnight after; for

1 The Priests must eat their part of the public Sin-offering, Number. 29. 11.
which must be eaten in the same day in which it was offered, Lev. 6. 26. (as
other Sacrifices were, Lev. 7. 15, 18.) and yet the Priests could not eat the
holy flesh of this public Sin-offering till after Sunset; for the fas^ of
this day was not fully ended till after Sunset, and therefore also they might
not begin to Cook that holy flesh until the Fast was fully ended. Hence it
follows, that the same day did still continue till after Sunset, yea until it
was Midnight.

2 The Priests had another work to do within the limits of this tenth day,
namely, they must burn all the fats and pieces of all the public
Evening-sacrifices of this day (which were many) and some of their
Evening-sacrifices were also offered near unto Sunset, and therefore this work
and duty of burning would require not only the more diligence, but also the
more time, to finish this sweet savor upon the Lords Altar in its own proper
day, as I have noted the commanded season thereof more at large in Lev. 6. 9.

3 It appears, that some of the works which appertained to the
morning-sacrifice of this tenth day, must begin at Midnight, and that some of
the works which must be done about the Evening-sacrifice were such as could not
be ended until the Midnight after.

For the first work that must be done on this day in preparation to the
Morning-sacrifice was the taking away the ashes from the Altar, and these ashes
they must begin to take away at Midnight, as Maymony says. See Ains. in Lev.
6. 10. And in an other place he says, they took away the ashes at Midnight,
and ordered the wood, etc. and at the break of day they began to kill the daily
Morning-sacrifice. See Ains. in Lev. 16. 4.

In like sort they could not finish the burning of all the Evening-sacrifices
of this day till Midnight, as I have showed above from Lev. 6. 9. and yet over
and above this full day from Midnight to Midnight, they began their strict
Fast, and their strict Rest, in the Evening of the ninth day, which did
increase the length of this day to be an extraordinary long Fasting-Sabbath.

Hence I conclude, That the beginning of this day cannot be alleged as an
exemplary pattern, neither for the beginning of any other Fasting-day, nor yet
for the beginning of our Lords day, as it is intended by those that allege it
for the beginning and ending of the Jews weekly Sabbath from Even to Even.

CHAP. VII. Answering their Opinion more particularly that hold the Lords day
to begin at Evening; And four Objections are Answered.
Object. 1. IT is objected, that our Lords day is come in the place of the
Jewish Sabbath, which began at Evening; and for the proof of this they allege
the Example of Nehemiah, he is said to shut up the Gates of Jerusalem when it
began to be dark before the Sabbath, Neh. 13. 19. they expound the word Before,
and the word Dark, in favor of their opinion thus; 1. The word Before the
Sabbath, they say, does mean just before the face or present beginning of the
Sabbath. 2. The word Dark they say does mean when it was full Twilight, namely
when the darkness in the Sky was somewhat more than the light in the Sky;
for as long as the light in the Sky is more than darkness, they say the Sun
is the cause of it; and hence they conclude that the Sun cannot be said to be
set till the darkness in the Sky be more in quantity than the light in the
Sky, and this they make to be the punctual time of the Sunset evening, when
the Jews Sabbath began, namely, when a Man could not see to read, or a Woman to
sew.

Ans. This exposition of the beginning of the Sunset evening, and of the
beginning of the Sabbath, is a newfound devise, I have already showed the
vanity of it in Chapter 4. in my answer to Obj. 2. That the Sunset evening is
truly come as soon as ever the Body of the Sun is gone out of fight, and that
Darkness is then begun, because the shining of the Sun is gone from off the
face of the earth, and Darkness is said to begin at the going down of the Sun,
in Genesis 15. 17. and then the Jews began to set their Night-watches, and then
the purified person began the date of the day of his cleanenesse, and therefore
if the Sabbath it self did begin in the evening at all, it began then, namely
according to the date of the day of the purified person, which began as soon as
ever the Body of the Sun was gone out of sight, as I have showed in chap. 4.
and then if Nehemiah did not set a Watch at the Gates of Jerusalem till the
darkness in the Sky was more than the light in the Sky, he did not that
which was sufficient to preserve the Holy rest of the Holy Sabbath, especially
seeing they began to make some preparation to the observation of the Sabbath,
from the time of the Evening Sacrifice before, as I have observed from the
Hebrew Doctors.

But I perceive that such as hold the Sabbath it self to begin in Such as hold
the Sabbath to begin ^t the Sun*set evening can never prove that Christ lay
three days in his Grave.
the evening, are necessitated to seek out such odd expositions as this of the
time of the Sunset evening, because else they see that they can never prove
that Christ lay three days enclosed in the heart of the earth, Mat. 12. 40. and
they know that Christ rose from the Dead on the first day of the Week, Joh. 20.
19. Hence it follows, that he must be enclosed in the heart of the earth, in
the very self-same Friday in which he was Crucified; for the first day of the
Week in which he arose from the Dead, is called the third Day after, 1 Cor. 15.
4. and in these respects it is of necessary consequence to describe the precise
time both of his Burial, and also of his Resurrection, or else a doubting
Conscience cannot be rightly established in the truth of his three days lying
in the Grave.

But such as hold the Sabbath to begin at the Sunset evening can never prove
it, unless they can prove that Christ was enclosed in the heart of the earth
some distinct time before Sunset; but Luke says, that the time of Christ's
Burial was, when it began to be Starlight, Luke 23. 54.
that is not possible to be done, for Luke says, that the Sabbath began to
lighten (with Starlight) when he was enclosed in his Grave, Luke 23. 54.

Master Broughton, Mr. Weames, and the Syriac do render the Translation so, and
the Seventy use the same Greek word in Job 25. 5. for the light of the Moon,
and it may as well be used for the light of the Stars, for they are called
Stars of light, Genesis 1. 14, 16. Psalm. 148. 3.

Let all the circumstances of time about the burial of Christ be cast up, and
laid together, and then it will put the matter out of doubt, that the burial of
Christ could not be finished till it was Sar-light.

1 Consider the time when Joseph went to Pilate to beg the Body, and that was
not till the Sunset evening was come, Mat. 27. 57. Mar. 15. 42. This evening
that was now come cannot be understood of the first evening, for that was come
at Midday, and Christ was then alive, therefore it must be understood of the
latter evening which was not come till Sunset.

Obj. 2. But Mr. Norton objecteth against this Translation, and In his Treatise
of Christ's Sufferings.
says, that it is not true that Joseph came not to beg the Body of Christ
until Sunset; but Joseph (says he) came as the evening was coming, as the
Greek has it, therefore before it was actually come; and besides, (says he)
he could not otherwise have taken down the Body, and buried it the same day
according to the Law, Deuteronomy. 21. 23. which John testifies they were careful
and mindful of, Joh. 19. 31.

Ans. As touching the translation of the Greek in Matthew and Mark, I have
searched into sundry Translations, and all that I can yet meet withal have it,
When the evening was come; I have also conferred with some that are learned in
the Tongues, and they say it is but a harsh translation to render it, When the
evening was coming; and Tindall does both translate and expound Mar 15. 42
thus, When night was come (because it was the evening that goes before the
Sabbath) But what if the Greek does signify no more but as Master Norton
says, when the evening was coming? yet that translation makes the difference
of time so small that it is not worth the speaking of, for in the like case
Mark says, That at the evening, when the Sun was set, the Jews brought their
diseased persons to Christ to be cured, Mark 1. 32. but Luke says, It was when
the Sun was setting, Luke 4. 40. that is to say, when the evening was coming,
for in proper speech, the latter evening cannot be said to be coming till the
Sun be setting.

And secondly, It seems to me that Joseph of Arimathea durst not go to Pilate
to beg the dead Body before Sunset, for fear of the displeasure of the High
Priests, and therefore he delayed his going to Pilate until the High Priests
had first gone and besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that
they might be taken down, because it was the time of their preparation to
their High Festival Sabbath-Supper, for Joseph knew that the High Priests were
desirous that Christ should hang upon the Cross for his greater ignominy, as
long as other cursed Malefactors used to do, and that was until the Sun was
set, and in this sense Joshua did understand the Law to mean, namely, that they
might Deuteronomy. 21. 23.
hang upon the Tree after the night was begun (which was begun at Sunset) and
therefore he did not command the dead Bodies of the cursed Kings to be taken
down from the Tree until the Sun was down, Jos 8. 29.

I grant that formerly I have expounded this clause in Deuteronomy. 21. 23. Thou shall
not let his Carcass hang all night upon the tree, to mean (not at all in the
night) but since then I find upon better examination that I was in an error,
though Master Norton takes it for a truth, and so in like sort he takes some
plain truths for great errors; but this sentence, they shall not hang all night,
implies, that they may hang some part of the night upon the tree, provided they
were buried the same day, namely in the same Natural day, which lasted after
Sunset until Midnight, as I have showed in chap. 5. in my answer to Object.
16.

And in this respect Joshua let the dead Bodies of the Kings hang still upon
the Tree until the Sun was set; that is to say, until the night was begun;
but if this command of burying them in the same day had meant in the same
Ceremonial day, then the dead Bodies might not continue hanging on the Tree
until the Sun was set, except they had been buried some distinct time before
Sunset; this clause therefore [in the same day] must be understood not of the
same Ceremonial day which ended at Sunset, but of the same Natural day which
continued after Sunset till midnight, as I have showed more at large in
Chapter five, in my answer to Objection sixteen, and in chap. 4. ult. and in
other places also.

The chief Priests were first in their request to Pilate, because it was the
time of their preparation to their solemn High Sabbath-Supper, for it was the
first day of unleavened bread, which was a high Sabbath, and their
Festival-Supper was to begin at Starlight, therefore they besought Pilate that
their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away, Joh. 19. 31.
thus you see that the Priests in regard of their preparation to their
Sabbath-Supper were first in their request unto Pilate, presently upon this
Pilate commanded that their legs should be broken, and Joseph perceiving their
request, first did wisely espy the advantage of time, and without delay he went
boldly unto Pilate, and besought him, that he might take away the Body of
Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave; he came therefore and took the Body of Jesus,
Joh. 19. 38. this was all done in the neck of one another, and this time is
recorded by Matthew and Mark, to be when the Sunset evening was done.

From the Premises I reason thus; If the Sunset evening was come before Joseph
went to Pilate to beg the Body of Christ, then the Sabbath Star might well be
risen before the Body of Christ could be enclosed in the heart of the earth,
for Joseph had many things to do after he had the grant of the dead Body,
before it could be enclosed in his Grave; First, he went to the Shops to buy
several pieces of Linen to wrap the dead Body in, according to the Jews
manner, Ioh. 20. 6, 7. (as we may see the manner in Lazarus burial, Ioh. 11.
44.) and Nicodemus also did take up some time to imbalm his Body, which also
was done with many circumstances according to the Jews custom, Ioh. 19. 40.
(as it is set down by Mr. Ainsworth in Genesis 46. 4. and in Genesis 50. 2.) and then
(though the place of burial were near, yet) it would require both hands and
time to carry him thither, and to roll the stone upon the mouth of his Grave,
before he could be said to be enclosed in the heart of the earth; I grant also
that all this was done with as much haste as might be, because of the Jews
preparation to their Festival Supper, and yet as soon as this was done, or
could be done, their High Festival-Sabbath began to lighten, namely, with the
Evening Star at least, if not with more Stars, for it was a Canon among them,
not to begin their Festival-Suppers till three Stars did appear, and doubtless
Lukes phrase does allude to that custom. This Sabbath that did now begin to
lighten was not the Sabbath it self, for if the Sabbath it self had been begun
at the rising of the Evening Star, then doubtless the holy Women had broken
the holy rest of the Sabbath day, because after all this they went to the shops
and bought Odors, and Ointments, Luke 23. 56. compared with Mark 16. 1. yea and
after they had bought these Odors and Ointments they went home and prepared
them in a readiness to perfume the Body of Christ with them as soon as ever
the Sabbath was past, Mat. 28. 1. If they had bought them before his burial
they would have perfumed his Body before his burial, as Nicodemus did.

Therefore seeing these holy Women did all this work after the burial, and
after the Sabbath began to lighten, it is an evident proof that the Sabbath it
self did not begin neither at the Sunset evening, when the person purified
began the date of his new day, nor yet at the rising of the evening star, for
if the Sabbath it self had been begun at either of these times, then the holy
Women had most grossly broken the holy rest of the Sabbath; But the Holy Text
does witness on their side that they rested the Sabbath, according to the
Commandment, Luke 23. 56.

Hence I conclude from this practice of the holy Women, that though the evening
before the Sabbath does bear the date of the day following to the person
purified, yet in proper speaking it is no part of the Sabbath it self, it is
only to be esteemed the Sabbath but by way of preparation, and no more.

Secondly I answer, That your exposition of the word before may better carry
this sense, namely that this latter evening was indeed before the Sabbath it
self, and I have showed in chap. 5. that the evening of the Sabbath is put by
the Hebrew Doctors, sometimes for the evening before the Sabbath, and sometimes
for the last half of the Sabbath it self; but see more in this Chapter in the
answer to the next objection.

Object. 2. It seems to me that the Sabbath it self did begin and end at the
Sunset Evening by the Jews practice, for they held it unlawful before the
Sunset Evening was come for our Savior to heal diseased persons; But after
the Sunset Evening was come, all manner of diseased persons came flocking to
him for cure, Mar. 1. 32. Hence it appears that the Jews held the Sabbath to be
fully ended as soon as the Sunset Evening was come.

Ans. It is but the bare conjecture that they forbore to bring their sick
persons till the Sabbath was ended: I deny it to be the very reason, I believe
the only reason why they came no sooner, was because they had no sooner
intelligence of his miraculous power to heal; you do barely affirm that the
Jews in general held it unlawful for our Savior to heal diseased persons upon
the Sabbath day, but you are deceived. Tremelius does testify from the ancient
Hebrew Doctors that they held the contrary: They held that the peril of life
did drive away the Sabbath; that is to say, they held it lawful to use any
means to prevent the danger of death upon the Sabbath day. See Tremelius his
Annot. in Mat. 12. 8. in the Syriack Testament; Mr. Ainsworth also does affirm
from the Hebrew Doctors, that they held it to be a Sabbath days work to visit
the sick; for they held that peril of life did drive away the Sabbath. See
Ains. in Exodus 20. 10. See also my former Treatise.

2 I do also apprehend by the circumstances of the story, that the Jews of
Capernaum were not offended with our Savior for his miraculous cure, which he
did upon that Sabbath day (as the malignant Scribes and Pharisees sometimes
were) in healing one in the Synagogue that had an unclean spirit, Mark. 1. 27.

3 They took no offense at him for the curing of Peter's wives mother of her
Feavor, presently after he had left the said Synagogue, v 31. Therefore seeing
they found no fault with Christ for neither of these miraculous cures before
the Sabbath was ended, doubtless they did not forbear to bring their diseased
persons in respect of the Sabbath (for they admired the power of God in these
miracles) and therefore as soon as the public exercise was ended, they spread
his fame, verse 28. and thereupon a multitude of the diseased persons of
Capernaum came to him for cure with all the possible speed they could, as it
appears by their earnest pressing after so short a warning, for I conceive by
the circumstances of the story, that it was but a little before Sunset when
Christ left the Synagogue, and then as soon as he had left the Synagogue he
healed Peter's wives mother, which was another procuring cause that made the
greater flocking to him; but if his miraculous cures had been done sooner,
doubtless the fame thereof would have made the sick persons to have flocked
sooner after him.

I grant that some of the malignant Scribes and Pharisees did sometimes take
offense at Christ for his miraculous healing upon the Sabbath day; But the
people in general rejoiced at all the excellent things that were done by him
upon the Sabbath day, Luke 13. 17. for Christ did now heal a poor crooked woman
upon that Sabbath day, verse 11. And when the Ruler of the Synagogue took
offense at it, Christ (by reasons) put him to silence; and the people rejoiced
that Christ had put him to silence.

Therefore though some of the malignant Jews held erroniously that Christ ought
not to heal upon the Sabbath day, yet that is no good argument to prove that
these Jews of Capernaum did purposely detain their sick persons till the
Sabbath was ended, I deny it to be the Reason; I do apprehend rather that they
did hastily flock to him, rather than deliberately forbear till the Sabbath
might be ended.

4 Mr. Pemble on this place says, That this Evening was the Evening of the
same day wherein Christ had done so much before, as the inference shows plainly.

5 It is evident to me from several testimonies of the Hebrew Doctors, that
they held the Sunset Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the
Sabbath it self, because they held it lawful to The Hebrew Doctors held the
Sunset Evening after the Sabbath, to be a true part of the Sabbath it self.
do many things in the Sunset Evening before the Sabbath, which they did not
hold lawful to be done in the Sunset Evening after the Sabbath.

1 Maymony says thus, The two Loaves of New Corn for the Wave-offering (on the
day of Penticost) were not Baked on the day of Pentecost, because it was a
Sabbath; nor in the Evening before, if it were a Sabbath. See Ains. in Lev. 23.
17.

Two things are evident from this Testimony.

1 That in the judgment of the Hebrew Doctors the Sunset Evening after the
Sabbath, was a true part of the Sabbath it self, because they held it unlawful
to bake the said two Loaves of new corn in the Evening before the day of
Penticost, if it were a Sabbath: But they might without scruple have baked the
said two Loaves in the said Evening before Penticost, as well as on any other
Evening, if they had held that the Sabbath had then been fully ended. See Ains.
in Lev. 23. 6, 7.

2 Hence it is evident, that the Hebrew Doctors did not hold the Evening before
the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it self, no otherwise than by way
of preparation.

3 Mamony gives another instance from the time of baking the twelve Loaves of
Shewbread; he says, That the twelve Loaves of the Shewbread might not be
baked on the Sabbath, nor on a Feast Day, but in the Evening of the Sabbath
they baked it, and set it in order on the morrow. See Ains. in Lev. 24. 5.

Hence this is remarable in this Hebrew Record; That he makes a manifest
difference between the Evening that goes before the Sabbath, and the Sabbath it
self, he calls the Evening before, [the Evening of the Sabbath] by custom
peculiar to the Jews, from the date of the new day to the person purified (as I
have formerly showed) he allows these twelve Loaves to be baked in the Evening
of the Sabbath all the year long, except it fell out to be in the latter
Evening of a Festival-Sabbath; and therefore it does hence follow, that not the
Evening before, but the Evening after their Festival-Sabbaths, was a true part
of their Festival-Sabbaths; And so likewise Tremelius a Christian Jew, does
make the Evening after the Sabbath to be a true part of the Sabbath it self, in
his Translation and note on the Syriak Testament in Matthew. 28. 1.

Therefore by the judgment of the Hebrew Doctors, the Festival-Sabbath was not
ended at Sunset; and thence it follows, that if their festival-Sabbaths were
not ended at Sunset, then their weekly Sabbaths were not ended at Sunset.

4 Maymony says thus, Who so labors in the Evening of the Sabbath, he shall
eat in the Sabbath, See Ains. in Exodus 16. 26.

Hence it follows, that in the judgment of the Hebrew Canons, the Evening
before the Sabbath was no part of the Sabbath no otherwise but by way of
preparation to the Sabbath; for they say, That he that will eat in the Sabbath,
must labor in the Evening of the Sabbath, namely in the Evening before the
Sabbath; This they speak, as I conceive, of their laborious preparing of their
Manna (according to every ones palate) in a readiness against the Sabbath; for
though the Manna was a ready food of it self, without preparing to some
stomachs, yet not to al, til it were cooked to their palate; and it could not be
prepared in this sort without great labor, for it was ground in Mills, and
beaten in Mortars, Number. 11. 8 And in that respect the Hebrew Doctors say, Who
so labors in the Evening of the Sabbath, shall eat in the Sabbath; but in
case they neglected this work in the Evening of the Sabbath, they might not do
it on the Sabbath day, but they must rather fast and endure hunger for their
negligence sake.

Hence it follows, that the Evening before, was called the Evening of the
Sabbath, no otherwise but by way of preparation, and it is called the Evening
of the Sabbath from their new date to the person purified; his new day did ever
begin at the Sunset Evenning.

5 Maymony says thus, Such works as may be done in the Evening before a
Feast Day they do not upon a Feast Day; they may not reap, nor thresh, nor
winnow, nor grind corn, nor the like upon a Sabbath day, for all these things
may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath, killing of Beasts, baking of bread,
kneading of dough, and the like, may be done in the Evening of a Sabbath. See
Ains. in Lev. 23. 7. in like sort their laborious preparation of their Manna
must be done in the Evening of the weekly Sabbath.

Object. 4. By the Evening of the Sabbath the Jews do not mean only the
Sunset Evening, but they accounted the Sabbath Evening to begin at three a
clock in the afternoon before; and in this respect Maymony says thus, It is
unlawful to do works in the Evenings of the Festival-Sabbaths from the time of
the Evening sacrifice, and forward (even as upon the Evening of the weekly
Sabbaths) and who so does work in them shall never see a sign of blessing, and
he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, Though he is not for
it to be scourged or excommunicated, except in the Evening of the Passover
after Midday; who so does work therein after Midday, he is to be scourged or
excommunicated with the Niddui, for the fourteenth of Nishan is not like the
Evening of other Festival days, because in it are the Feast, and the killing
of Sacrifices. See Ains. in Lev. 23. 5.

Ans. I grant that the Jews did make some kind of preparation both to their
Festival-Sabbaths, and to their weekly Sabbaths also, from the time of the
Evening-sacrifice, and forwards, till Bedtime; for though they did not begin
their day of cleanness till Sunset, yet in regard of the many works that were
to be done against their Feast-dayes (which I have immediately named) and in
regard of preparing their Manna, etc. against the Sabbath, their wise men held
it convenient to forbear, and leave off the ordinary works of their calling
from the time of the Evening-sacrifice, and forwards, till bedtime; and in
that respect the Magistrates themselves did forbear to sit in their Courts of
Judicature after the time of the Evening-sacrifice. See Ains. in Exodus 18. 22.
But this degree of preparation had no other command from God, but the general
rule of convenience.

2 It is evident from the said Testimony, that they did not esteem any part of
the Evening, neither before, nor after Sunset, to be as a true part of the
Sabbath it self, because they did neither scourge nor excommunicate any man
that did any servile work in this Evening, as they did for working in any part
of the Passover Evening from Midday till Midnight; but if they had in their
judgment esteemed any part of the Evening before the Sabbath to be a true part
of the Sabbath it self, doubtless they would have punished such Transgressors
more severely than for working upon the Passover Evening, for by Moses Law,
such persons ought to be stoned to death, Numb. 15. 34, 35.

Hence it follows first, That the Evening before the Sabbath (though it be
called the Evening of the Sabbath according to their ceremonial custom, yet
it) was no true part of the Sabbath it self, but in way of preparation only.

Secondly, That the Sunset Evening after the Sabbath was indeed a true part of
the Sabbath it self.

5 It is evident that the Evening after the Sabbath was esteemed to be a true
part of the Sabbath it self, by the testimony of the Evangelist John, in Chap.
20. 19. the Text runs thus, The same day at Evening, being the first day of the
week; John calls this Evening not the second, but the first day of the week,
and yet it must needs be now a good space after Sunset, for there were two
Disciples now present that came from Emaus, and it was toward Evening before
they came from Emaus, and they could not well come from thence to Jerusalem in
less than three hours space, for it was sixty Furlongs from Emaus to
Jerusalem, Luke 24. 13. 29. 36.

Mr. Goodwin, and others, allow eight Furlongs to an English or Italian mile;
but the Hebrew Doctors allow but seven Furlongs and a half to an English mile.
See Ains. in Lev. 16. 21. The New Testament does not follow the Italian
Furlong, but the Greek Furlong (or stadium Olympicum) which contains six
thousand feet; and the Hebrew Doctors say that two thousand Cubits make a mile.
See Ains. in Exodus 16. 29. The New Testament does follow the Greek Customs as
frequently as they followed the Greek Tongue; Therefore in reason as the New
Testament was written in Greek, so it should follow the Greek stadium rather
than the Italian; besides, I conceive that the Italian stadium came not into
common use until after the New Testament was written. So then by the Hebrew
Doctors account, it was eight miles from Emaus to Jerusalem; that is to say, it
was Eight English miles: Now if you will allow but three hours time for the
going of these eight miles, it must needs be after Sunset when they came to
the Apostles; and after they were come, they spent some time in relating unto
the Apostles what had happened to them the same day as they went to Emaus, and
as they were making this Relation Jesus came and stood in the midst of them,
Luke 24. 36.

These circumstances considered, it must needs be after the date of the Jews
Ceremonial day before Christ came in among them, and yet the Evangelist calls
this time of the Evening, the same day in which Christ rose from the dead; and
secondly, he calls it the first day of the week. So then, by these two
expressions the Evangelist puts the matter out of doubt to such as will be
satisfied by plain consequences of Scripture, that this latter Evening when
Christ came into the house to the Apostles, was a true part of the former day,
and yet it was after Sunset, and therefore it was after their Ceremonial day
was begun.

6 And lastly, I may well bring hither all those five Arguments which I alleged
in Chap. 5. to prove the latter Evening of the fourteenth day of Nishan to be a
true part of the fourteenth day, and therefore it follows by good consequence,
hat the latter Evening of the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it self.

Obj. It appears to me that the Natural day begins at the Sunset evening, for
the Lord tells Ezekiel in the ninth year of Jeconiahs captivity, that he
should be dumb until the day that Jerusalem should be destroyed, and until a
Messenger should come to Ezekiel to tell the news thereof, Ezekiel. 24. 26, 27.
this is the Prediction, now the accomplishment of this Prophecy is set down in
Eze. 33. 21, 22. In the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth Month, and
in the fifth day of the Month, then one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came
unto Ezekiel, and said, The City is smitten; now says Ezekiel, The hand of the
Lord had been upon me in the evening before he that had escaped came, and had
opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning, and when he had opened my
mouth I was no more dumb. From these two Scriptures compared it is evident,
that the evening before the Messenger came, and the morning after he was come,
are termed the same day; therefore it follows by good consequence that the same
day began in the evening.

Ans. This is a strange collection to prove the evening to be the beginning of
the Natural day; the vanity of this collection will appear by the opening of
two words in this Prophecy, which must not be taken as you do, in strict
propriety of speech, but in a figurative sense, I mean the word Day, and the
word Dumb.

1 I say the word Day must not be taken in a strict sense for a proper Natural
day of twenty four hours, but it must be taken Figuratively for a time to come,
as it appears by the computation of time; for Ezekiel is said to be dumb in the
ninth year of Jeconiahs captivity, in the tenth Month, and in the tenth day of
the Month, Eze. 24. 1, 2. in which day Ezekiels wise dyed, verse. 18. which was
the pleasure of his eyes, verse. 16. and her death was for a sign unto the Jews,
that the Temple which was the pleasure of their eyes, verse. 21. should be
destroyed) and then in that day (namely when the Temple should be destroyed, he
that escapes in that day should come to Ezekiel and tell him; And in [that
day] viz. in time to come, Ezekiels mouth should be opened unto him which
escaped to tell him, and then he should speak and be no more dumb, ver. 26, 27.

This is the Prediction; now compare the story of events, and that lies thus,
The Temple was burnt on the tenth day of the fifth Month, in the eleventh year
of Zedekiah, Jer. 52. 12, 13. and there is no record to be found that any
Messenger came to Ezekiel to tell him in the same day, neither is it possible
for any man to come from Jerusalem to Chaldea in one Natural day of twenty four
hours, therefore the Messenger that came to him in (that day) came to him in
that day which is Figuratively put for the time to come, for the Messenger came
not to Ezekiel until seventeen Months after that the Temple was destroyed, for
he came not till the fifth day of the tenth Month, and in the twelfth year of
Jeconias captivity, Ezekiel. 33. 21. therefore this phrase the same day must not
be understood of the same Natural day, but of day at large, for the term day is
often put for a large time to come, as in Ezekiel. 23. 38, 39. and Ezekiel. 33. 12.
and in Deuteronomy. 27. 2 See Ains.

2 Ezekiel is said to be dumb in the ninth year, Ezekiel. 24. 12. 27. till the
Messenger came to him in the twelfth year of Ieconiahs captivity, in all which
space Ezekiel was not dumb from ordinary speech (as Zachary was, Luke 1. 20.)
neither yet was he dumb from Prophesying against other Nations, as it appears
by Eze. 26. 1. and Eze. 29. 1. and Eze. 31. but he was dumb or silent from
Prophesying any more against the unbeleeving Jews, as chap. 3. 26. until this
Messenger came with special tidings, to certify him how all things were
accomplished as he had foretold, and now at the coming of this special
Messenger Ezekiels mouth was opened again, to utter another Prophecy of the
utter ruin of the remnant of the Jews that were left, Ezekiel. 33. 2, 3. and from
this time forth he was no more dumb; that is to say, he was no more restrained
from Prophesying to them of their utter ruin: So then, this Messenger was sent
to Ezekiel on purpose, to tell him the present state of things, and to inquire
of him what should be the future event of the remnant that were left.

Ezekiel could not choose but hear of the burning of the Temple long before this
Messenger came to him, partly by the poor Captives, and partly by the
Soldiers, and also he could not choose but hear of the death of Gedaliah before
this special Messenger came; but such accidental tidings did not answer to the
sign that was given for the time of his new Prophesying, for the sign was this,
That a special Messenger should be sent unto him from Jerusalem to Chaldea (in
a day) that is to say in a time to come, and then Ezekiels mouth should be
opened unto him, to utter some new Prophecy to him, though it was not according
to their expectation; for he fore-tels, that the remnant that were left should
likewise come to destruction.

Besides ^he hand of Prophecy that came upon Ezekiel in the Evening before the
Messenger came, may be taken as well for the first, as for the latter Evening;
for God did often give Visions to his Prophets in the first Evening, at the
time of the Evening Sacrifice, Act. 3. 1. Dan. 9. 21. Act. 10. 3, 9. Therefore
unless it can be proved that this Evening was the Sunset Evening, no
concluding argument can be drawn from this Text to prove the Natural day to
begin at the Sunset Evening; no, though the term Day, and the term Dumb had
been spoken properly.

So then from all the premises, I conclude, that not the Evening before, but
the Evening after the Sabbath was a true part of the Sabbath it self, and
therefore they that take liberty to busy themselves about worldly matters in
the Sunset Evening after the Sabbath, do profane that holy time that God has
sanctified to his own use.

CHAP. VIII. Proving that the punctual time of Christ's Resurrection was in the
morning, just at Sunrising.
Doubtless it is a matter of necessary consequence, not only to prove clearly
the punctual time of Christ's burial, but of his Resurrection also; for if the
time of his Resurrection be uncertain, how can a doubting conscience be
satisfied that Christ lay three days in the heart of the earth, according to
the Prediction? Therefore as I have proved the time of Christ's burial to be
finished when their Festival-Sabbath began to lighten by the Evening-star, so I
say also that the time of his Resurrection was just about the time of
Sunrising on the first day of the week.

Christ did not rise from his grave before daybreak, as some would have it,
nor at daybreak, as others would have it, by uncertain guesses. Matthew says,
that Mary Magdalen went out of the door of her house in the first day of the
week when it began to dawn, intending to perfume his burial with the sweet
Odors that she had prepared in the Evening before the Sabbath, Matthew. 28. 1.
But Mark says, That the Sun was just risen when she came to the Sepulcher,
Mark. 16. 1. she spent all that space of time between daybreak and Sunrising,
partly in calling upon other holy women to go with her, Luke 24. 10. and partly
in going so much ground as was from her lodging to the Sepulcher, and then when
she was come to the Sepulcher, there was a mighty Earthquake, Mat. 28. 2. and
then his grave was opened; such a like Earthquake there was at the death of
Christ, which opened diverse of the graves of the Saints, and after the
Resurrection of Christ, they did rise also out of their graves, and came into
the holy City, and appeared unto many, Mat. 27. 52, 53. By this Earthquake at
Sunrising when Mary Magdalen came to the Sepulcher, it is evident that Christ
did not rise out of his grave until these holy women came to be witnesses of
the time of his Resurrection. I confess that many Interpreters do think that
Christ was risen before these holy Witnesses came to the Sepulcher, but such
conjectures may not be admitted, for it is a point of necessary consequence to
be proved, That Christ lay three days in the heart of the Earth; but if you
say, That Christ was risen before these holy Witnesses came, then you cannot
clearly prove that Christ lay three days in the heart of earth; for it may be
demanded how long was he risen before they came? If you say it was but one hour
before, I may as well say it was seven or eight hours before, and then how can
you satisfy a doubting conscience that Christ lay three days, and three
nights in the heart of the earth? I cannot think that Christ would suffer his
own Prediction to remain so obscure without manifest proof of the full
accomplishment of it: Therefore I conclude, that Christ rose not out of his
grave till the holy women came to be Witnesses of the same, which was also
evidently declared unto them by this Earthquake at their coming to the
Sepulcher, just at Sunrising, though they could not make that use of it till
afterward.

Object. 1. This Earthquake might be past before the holy women came to the
Sepulcher, and they might know it afterward only by the Soldiers relation.

Ans. Christ did never show himself to any wicked man after his Resurrection,
Joh. 14. 19. Joh. 16. 20, 22. Act. 10. 41. Therefore it is not like that he
would make the Roman Soldiers to be the only Witnesses of this Earthquake
which did evidence the time of his Resurrection. I conceive the holy women
would not give much credit to the testimony of the Roman Soldiers, except this
Earthquake had been general to all the parts of the City, as well as to that
particular place, but it seems to me that this Earthquake was not generally
spread over the City, but it was limited only to that particular place where
Christ's Sepulcher (...), as a special testimony of the time of his
Resurrection: In like (...) that place only where the Apostles were (when they
were threatened by the Hgh Priests) was shaken as a testimony of encouragement
to them, not to be afraid of Tyrants, Act. 4. 31. Act. 2. 2. Act. 12. 7. and so
there was an Earthquake that opened the particular place where Paul was
imprisoned, Act. 16. 26. the bare testimony of the Soldiers would have been
but of small credit to prove so weighty a matter as the time of Christ's
Resurrection was: Therefore I conclude, that Christ arose not from his Grave
till these holy women came to testify the time of his Resurrection by an
Earthquake, which happened at their first coming to his Sepulcher, and that was
just at Sunrising: I conceive that the holy women at first were amazed, and
did not know what use to make of this Earthquake, Joh. 20. 9. but afterward
they did plainly perceive that it was a manifest demonstration of the time of
his Resurrection; and after this Earthquake, Mary Magdalen went to the
Apostles, and told them that Christ was risen from the dead, and she followed
the Apostles back again to the Sepulcher; And 3. when they saw no body in the
Sepulcher, they returned home. 4 But Mary Magdalen staid still behind; and then
Christ himself did appear unto her as John does testify.

From all the premises it is evident, that Christ lay in the heart of the earth
about four hours of the sixth day, and the whole Sabbath, and about five hours
of the first day of the week, namely, from Midnight till Sunrising; and after
this sort Christ lay three days, and three nights, in the heart of the Earth.

But those that begin the Sabbath at the Sun-set-Evening can never prove that
Christ lay three days in the heart of the Earth: Therefore that opinion must
needs be of evil consequence: First, Because it falsifies the said Prediction.
And secondly, Because it leads men to do servile works in the latter Evening of
the Lords day, as manyfold experience of men's worldly practices does testify
in New England as soon as the Sunset Evening of the Lords day is come.

It this Treatise may be of any use to satisfy a doubting conscience touching
the time of Christ's Burial and Resurrection, and touching the limits of the
Lords day, Give glory to God, who gi^^ gifts to men for that purpose. Even so
AMEN.

FINIS.
