Youths Tragedy, A POEM Drawn up By way of Dialogue, for the Caution, and
Direction of the younger sort.
The Prologue.
If thou art serious, then attend, and see,
If not, yet stay, that thou may serious be.
YOVTH. HOw pleasant is it, when the Sun displayes,
From ARIES's Golden Fleece, his Golden Rays,
How do the Creatures triumph for to see,
Imprisoned NATVRE, set at liberty.
How does the EARTH rejoice, that she is seen
Clothed in a rich imbroid'red VEST of Green.
FLORA now smiles, to see her self so fair,
And comes abroad for to perfume the Air.
The Heavens are pleasant, darksome Clouds do fly,
And give a Prospect of an Azur'd Sky;
The pretty winged Quire, from their sweet Throats,
Fill every place, with their Melodious Notes.
And what is YOVTH? but like another Spring,
And therefore Young man, now rejoice, and sing,
Discharge sad Thoughts, follow thy Recreation,
Whilst that thy Blood has a free circulation.
Let Old BARZILLAIES now refuse the Court,
Thy nimble parts, adapted are for sport,
Let thy heart cheer thee, and now choose delight,
According as thine Eye shall thee invite.

The DEVIL and YOVTH. Devil. Bravely resolved, give up thy strength, and time,
To please thy self, and all things shall be thine.
Go view from SOVTHERN to the ARCTICK Pole,
The glory over which the Heavens do role,
And make thy choice, when done, put forth thy hand,
And please thy self, it is all at thy command.
RICHES shall at thy Feet full Bags fling down,
And give a Golden Chain, and Scarlet Gown,
HONOR will quickly court thee, and shall set
Upon thy Head, a Golden Corroner,
PLEASURE shall strew thy paths with Fragrant Flowers,
And Solace thee within her Shady Bowers;
Only this word of Counsel, must thee guide,
Trouble thy Head with nothing else beside,

Youth. I Will take thy Counsel, CONSCIENCE now adieu,
I see I shall have little need of you,
I am resolved to suffer no control,
But to pursue these things with all my SOUL.

WISDOM and YOVTH. Wisdom. Pursue with all thy SOUL, nay fond YOVTH stand,
And view the Lie, that is lodged in thy right hand,
He that these great things to thee does propose,
Is free to promise what he cannot dispose,
Neither can thou acquire, with all thy haste,
Far lesser things, if GOD endeavors blast.
But grant thou had what is promised, yet thy mind
Instead of JOY, would but VEXATION find,
Enlarged desires will keep thee from CONTENT,
And what cannot satisfy, will but TORMENT.
But could the WORLD complete JOY to thee bring,
Yet at the best, it is but a transient thing,
These WORLDLY things which thou enjoy'st to day,
To morrow may make Wings, and fly away.
Thy Soul's Immortal, look what does agree
Unto its NATURE, that must Satiate thee,
There Is naught but the great FOVNTAIN GOOD that will
Suit with thy SOUL, and thy vast SPIRIT fill.
Come then, and tread those Paths that will thee bring
Unto the everlasting flowing SPRING
Of pure, unmixed, intellectual JOYS,
Why should thou cheat thy self with empty TOYS.

Youth. The way is Long, and Thornie, that does lead
Unto these JOYS, and those that do it tread,
Water their Steps with Tears, and break their Rest
With those sad Sighs and Groans which fill their Breast.
WORMWOOD, and GALL, on each side of it grow,
CROSSES, and JEARS, this dolorous way do strew,
And all along this Path you may epsy,
Here scatt'red a right Hand, there a right Eye,
Here a dear Lust, there a dead Comfort lies,
By SELF-DENIAL, made a Sacrifice;
And on the Hills do fired Beacons flame,
Which round about, invading FOES proclaim:
To whom I either must become a Prey,
Or through their Hostile Troops must fight my way.
Pardon me then, if that I do refuse,
Such DOLEFVL WAYS of Trouble, for to choose.

Wisdom. Though at the first, this WAY may seem to be
A Thornie, Rough, Unpleasant Path to thee,
Yet do but try it, what at first seems hard,
Will easy prove unto thee afterward.
For when thy heart, shall be enlarged with love,
Unto those glorious things which are above;
Then will thou run these Ways with great delight,
For in them, there is strength to the upright.
Let not those Tears affright thee, that are spent
The future FLOODS of sorrow to prevent,
No Wine so precious, as what does arise,
From the sweet springs, of penetential eyes,
No frame like this, where comfort does so thrive,
For GOD the contrite spirit does revive.
Nor let it daunt thee, that thou must deny
Thy YOVTHFVL LVSTS, and dear self MORTIFY,
The blessed end is, that thou may DESTROY
Those SVCCORS, that would hinder thy true JOY,
And whilst Thou Conflicts thus, and giv'st the FOYL
Thou Wilt sing with those that do divide the SPOIL.
Let not the CROSS dismay thee; God will fit
It to thy Back, or thy Back unto it.
And what Affliction, he does to thee measure,
It Is for thy profit, and not for his pleasure,
That with more even steps thy SOUL may press,
Forward unto its final happiness.
Fear not to Fight, the Conquest shall be sure,
To him that does unto the End endure,
For by a Hand of Strength, he shall be led
Ipon the Necks, of all his FOES to tread.
And on a THRONE of GLORY shall fit down
With songs of PRAISE, and a triumphant CROWN.
Call not these Paths then DOLESOM, YOVNGMAN cease,
All WISDOMS WAYS, are PLEASANTNESS and PEACE.
Whilst a good CONSCIENCE lodges in thy Breast,
Thou need'st not doubt of a continual Feast.
Ask those that follow WISDOM, and they will say,
They feed on hidden MANNA in their way,
By arts of FAITH, and LOVE, they now possess,
That inward Sweetness, which they cannot express.
Strong CONSOLATIONS here do fill their CVP,
Whilst with eternal LOVE their Souls do Sup.

Youth. I understand not how these JOYS commence,
YOVTH must have something that may please the sense;
Therefore forbear until thou offer'st that,
Which may be suited to my present State.

Wisdom. Fond YOVTH, thou know not what is true delight,
It Is not to please the sensual APPETIT,
This will debase thy NATVRE, and the FRVIT,
Will be to lay thee level with the BRVITE.
That which ennobles, and does truly raise,
Are VISIONS, of those BEAMS which GOD displayes,
From his sweet reconciled FACE, which make
The SOUL of his blessed NATVRE to partake.

Youth. These are but darksom RIDDLES, canting STREINS,
Fitted to suit with MELANCHOLY Veins;
What can thou offer now unto my EYE,
That will the GLORY of this WORLD outvie.

Wisdom. Whilst thou a darksom RIDDLE this do call,
Thou show'st thy woeful Darkness since the fall,
For though an instinct still remains to BLISS,
Yet want Light to guide thee where it is.
But will the good things of this world content?
Then view what WISDOM does of this present:
HONOR and RICHES her left hand enfolds,
And in her right hand length of days she holds;
Which she gives forth to them that do her love,
So far as they may real blessings prove:
If what thou have be mixed with a curse,
It will prove to thee VANITY, nay, worse.
That hand of Mercy that gives forth the Treasure,
To make it Mercy, must give forth the Measure;
That hand must guide thee how it must be used,
MERCIES prove JVDGMENTS when they are abused.
Take all thy good things then from WISDOMS hand,
And use those good things as she does command.

Youth. Lady, excuse me till another day,
There Is time enough hereafter for this way;
Let me my youthful days please in their choice,
And then I Will pomise to obey thy VOICE;
When AGE has quenched within, this lustful fire,
And shall in private weary limbs retire;
This will a season be to bend my mind,
Unto those ways where I may WISDOM find.

Wisd. Vain YOVTH, vain YOVTH, hereafter is not thine,
He that has now no heart, may have no time.
That Captain which to day does terms afford,
May storm to morrow, and put all to'th' Sword;
And he that this day will not spread his sail,
To morrow, if he would, may find no gale:
Or he that gives Grace to the penitent,
May not REPENTANCE give to the negligent.
But will thou in old AGE these ways embrace?
Are weary limbs fit for to run a race?
And when the day is ready to shut in,
Is that a time this Great work to begin?
Shall SATAN be presented with the prime,
And WISDOM only have the Dregs of Time?
In depth of Winter, when the Heavens are spread
With a black Vail, and all lights darkened;
When Clouds do thick return after the rain,
And their repeated showers pour down amain;
When that Tempestuous STORMS beat round about,
Is this the only Season to set out?
Surely, if serious, this thou will not say,
Why is it then, vain YOUTH, thou would delay?
Oh that there were within thee once a heart,
From all the ways of FOLLY to depart.
Those gaudy things with which she takes thine eye,
Thou will be sure to find but VANITY.

Youth. The WISE MAN, though he said so, yet would try
Before he did believe it; so will I.

Wisd. But having tried it, he has fixed a Buoy,
That others might not here themselves destroy.
His own EXPERIENCE he hangs out for light,
That thou may see to steer thy way aright;
He sets a mark upon this dangerous shoal,
That upon it thou might not wrack thy Soul.
By Cautions, Warnings, Tears, and sad Remorse,
He shows the Hazard of this woeful course.
If after all this, when that thou have seen
Those tops of MASTS where sad shipwreck has been,
Yet thou will venture foolishly to stray,
Though he was spared, thou may be cast away.
But should thou spared be, it hard would prove,
Fast rooted habits ever to remove:
For like the Leopards spots, and NEGRO'S skin,
So Custom proves in a way of sin.

Youth. Well, trouble me no more, I must fulfill
Those strong propensions that are in my Will.

Wisdom. And will thou rush, vain YOVTH, without all fear,
Like to the Horse, upon the charged Spear?
Is Life a Trifle? Is a Future state
Not worth the caring for? and will thou hate
Thy precious, SOUL? will thou inhumane be
Unto thy self? oh, wretched CRVELTY!
Will thou the way of FOLLY now pursue,
And turn thy back on WISDOM? then adieu.
But let me tell thee, that another day
Her path thou wilt find, like the Strange WOMAN'S way,
Who comes forth with Smiles, in rich attire,
And with her kisses YOVTHFVL LUST does fire,
In her curled Tresses LETHAL NETS do lie,
And from her Eyelids killing Darts do fly,
Between her breasts surprising SNARES abide,
Under her Beauty Deadly VIPERS hide.
With honey strains her subtle lips does court
The SIMPLE one, to her destructive sport;
With speeches smoother than the finest OIL,
She does betray into her fatal TOIL.
By wanton, amorous glances, she allures,
And with embracing arms her prey secures.
Thus by her flattering ways the Captive's led,
Without all fear, to her perfumed bed;
Not thinking that her woeful Guests do dwell
Within DEATHS chambers, and the vaults of HELL.
But when a stranger's filled with his wealth,
And when he has consumed all his health,
When that his HONOR, and his LABOR lies
Within her House, a slaughtered SACRIFICE,
When ROTTENNESS enters into his bones,
And fills his flesh with pain, his breast with groans;
How does he deeply now reflect upon
Those years, he gave unto the cruel one!
How does he find that burning COALS he placed
Within his bosom, whilst he her embraced!
How does he now from his EXPERIENCE cry,
He like a Bird, unto the SNARE did fly!
And whilst unto her way his steps he bent,
He, like an OX unto the slaughter went;
And that same pleasure which he did so like,
Now, as a dart, does through his Liver strike.
This is the way of FOLLY, this the end,
Her Feet to DEATH, her steps to HELL do tend.
Like to those streams which through green Meadows glide,
Till in the Dead Sea they at last do slide;
So runs her Course, through PLEASURE though it take,
It ends in JUDGMENT, and a fiery LAKE.
YOUNG MAN, farewell, oh, mind thy future state,
Take Counsel now, before it be too late.
Oh now remember those invited GUESTS,
That being called slighted the Marriage Feast:
But for so great contempt did dearly pay,
Where MERCY could not gain, there WRATH did slay.

YOVTH. What strange Impressions do my Spirits feel?
How do my former Resolutions reel?
What strange CONVVLSIONS seize upon my Mind?
What inward quick DISTORTIONS do I find,
How do my Thoughts press forth on every side,
And in two great BATTALIAS do divide;
Assaulting each the other with great Force,
Sometimes LUST gaining Ground, sometimes REMORSE:
With armed troops, the SENSUAL APPETITE
Does beat down all before it in the Fight,
Till CONSCIENCE, with fresh succors does oppose,
And, by strong hand, her Forces overthrows.
AFFECTIONS see it, and do haste to bring
Relief and Succor to the broken WING:
And so with furious rage, they down do fell
All that their fierce Impressions would repel;
The WILL well backed with the chiefest flower
Or Veteran Soldiers, with a mighty power
Does on the Gross of the Battalia fall,
And questions not but for to carry all.
And now the JVDGMENT with its utmost might
Makes strong resistance, and prevents a flight;
And with brave Courage, and repeated blows,
Represseth the great fury of her Foes.
And whilst they thus engage with Warlike hands,
VICTORIA now between them doubtful stands.
This is the War that gives my Mind no rest,
My JVDGMENT tells me WISDOM'S ways are best:
My CONSCIENCE checks me, that I don't obey,
And shows the danger, if I do delay.
My WILL, and my AFFECTIONS do oppose,
And would with Sensual Pleasure have me close:
Thus in sad Fears and Cares my thoughts do roll,
Whilst that I have these workings in my Soul.
What I shall do, I know not, this I find,
That strong CONVICTIONS do assault my Mind.

The DEVIL, YOVTH, and the NVNCIVS. Devil. YOVTH, What Is the matter, will thou
quit the field,
And to a Melancholy Fancy yield?
Will thou expose thy self to taunting JEARS,
Whilst thus thou load'st thy breast with needless fears?
Go fill thy hand, and head with those affairs,
That this WORLD calls for, and so choke these cares:
Or take thy Pastime at some pleasant Play,
And with those streins of Wit drive FEAR away:
With Scenes and Objects go and feast thine EYES,
And feed thy LVSTS with great Varieties.
Or, to thy old Companions straight resort,
And so divert thy self with YOVTHFVL SPORT.
Go pierce the choicest Liquors, and drink down
Full draughts thereof, till thou these TROUBLES drown:
Or join thy self unto the Jovial Blades,
Who hunt forth Pleasure, in their Maskarades.
Let those Cross-workings that thy Soul does meet,
Be prostrate laid at some fair LADIES feet.
Why should thy Day be stained with a Cloud,
And all thy Comforts under Darkness shroud?

Nunc. The YOUNG MAN yields, this Counsel he obeys
And in the paths of FOLLY now he strayes,
And whilst in PLEASVRE he his SOUL does drench,
All his CONVICTIONS he at last does quench:
And so his Heart grows hard, his CONSCIENCE seared,
And now he mocks at that which once he feared;
From frequent ACTS, he comes for to Devise
That against which, at first, his heart did rise.
(He that will venture on a way of sin,
Many a dreadful step may take therein,)
His Time it is but short, for you may see
In the next Scene his sad CATASTROPHE.

YOVTH. Youth. How do I now in Pleasures bosom rest,
Whilst Checks and Fears are banished from my breast!
Those MENACES that on my THOVGHTS did throng,
I have repulsed, the threatened man lives long;
Is not this better than to whine away,
With pensive, pewling MOPES, my pleasant day?
How joyful is it now unto my sight,
To see my self adrift in all delight?
And as this is a day of mirth to me,
So shall to morrow more abundant be.

NVNCIVS. Nun. Like to the Post that swiftly passes by,
Or like the SLAVE that does from bondage fly,
Or like a nimble Ship, that with full sail
Does run her course before a prosperous gale:
Or as the Eagle that her Prey espies,
Like Lightning, with swift wings unto it flies;
So TIME now speeds, to let the YOUNG MAN know
That all his way and walks are a vain show.

TIME and YOVTH. Time. With winged swiftness I do hither fly,
To let thee know thy fatal end draws nigh.
Like to the Grass, or like the fading Flower,
So withers all thy Glory in an hour;
Too late EXPERIENCE now must teach thee this,
Thy life a SHADOW, and a VAPOVR is.
I shall no more turn thy neglected Glass,
A few sands only now remain to pass;
My vvhetted Sithe comes next for to be used,
To let thee know, TIME will not be abused.

Youth. My aged Father, turn thy Sithe away,
Cut down the ripened Ears, let green ones stay;
Go where the Fields are white, whose stalks do bend,
Under their burden, and there put an end
Unto those pressures, but vvith-hold thy hand
From the green Blades, let immature ones stand.
I am too young yet for the Sithe of TIME,
Come when my Locks shall be as white as thine.

Time. Forbear, fond YOVTH, TIME's not at thy command,
The tender bud often feeels my cropping hand;
Have thou not often read Elegiack Verse,
Composed to celebrate a VIRGIN Hearse?
Have thou not seen the Mother, with wet eyes,
Sprinkle the dust wherein her Young Son lies;
How often has DEATH white Trophies, to declare,
Those he leads captive forth, they young ones are?
I know where lies my Work, advice pray spare,
Where I should reap, and where I should forbear,
I count thy SANDS, and when the last I see
Fly to it is heap, you are ripe enough for me:
TIME will not stay, look here, thy Glass is broke,
And now comes Death to give the Fatal stroke.

DEATH, NVNCIVS, and YOVTH. Death. YOVTH, come away, for thou must with me go
To the dark REGIONS that do lie below;
Come, this same hand must seize upon thy breath,
And lead thee down into the shades of DEATH.
Here is no dwelling for thee, but thou must
Take up thy lodging with me in the Dust;
And in thick Darkness make thy dismal bed,
Whilst cravvling WORMS under thy head are spread;
The pleasant light no more thine Eyes shall see,
But with CORRVPTION thou must covered be.
Those thoughts that are gone forth for to purvey
To Feast thy LVSTS, in this thy yonthful day;
And all those pleasing Hopes thou did so cherish,
Of long continued Bliss, must this day perish.

Nun. Whilst that the YOVTH the King of TERRORS views
His trembling limbs a cold sweat all bedevvs,
His Pulse beats quick, his gashly Face looks pale,
His spirits sink, and his stout heart does fail;
As when Defendants from out works are beat,
They to their main strength make a swift retreat,
That, by united Force, they may oppose
The fierce attempts of their approaching Foes;
So to the Heart, his scattered Forces flow,
That there they may keep off the fatal blow;
But when this will not do, a parley's beat,
And now his Enemy he begins to treat.

Youth. Oh DEATH, forbear me, but a little while,
Until my Vessel I provide with Oil,
I am not yet prepared with a Light
To comfort me in this same dismal Night.
Let not my Feet on the dark MOVNTAINS fall
For lack of Light to guide my steps withal.
Oh, let my naked SOUL put on her VEST,
Why should I fare like the unwelcome Guest,
In stormy weather, pull not down my Tent
Before I have a better Tenement?
Oh let me stay, that I may make a FRIEND,
For to receive me, at my JOVRNEYS end.
Oh let me truly LIVE, before I DYE,
I want Provision for ETERNITY.

Devil. Vain YOVTH, already thou have had thy Day,
But GRACE was slighted, TIME was sinned away.
Could nothing waken but the MIDNIGHT Cry
For to provide, when it is too late to buy?
Is it a time thy NAKED SOUL to dress,
When that the KING is come to view his GVESS?
Have thou a Habitation still neglected,
Until the hour thou come to be ejected?
When thou art Harbourless, and Storms begin,
Have thou a Friend to seek to take thee in?
Ah, careless SOUL! how woeful is thy state,
That know not how to want, or I to wait!
Come, come away, I am not sent to treat,
But for to bring thee to the JVDGMENT SEAT.

Youth. How shall I now appear be ore that FACE
That rends the ROCKS, and MOVNTAINS does displace;
That melts the HILLS, and makes the EARTH to quake;
That flings down STARS, and does the HEAVENS shake;
That makes those vast EXPANSIONS for to roll,
And shrink themselves together, like a scroul?
How shall I stand before that dreadful THRONE,
From whence bright Lightnings and great Thundrings come?
Who can abide the Fierceness of his Ire,
Whose Indignation's poured out like Fire?

Nun. But go he must; Death pierced his tender side,
And in his Heart blood his bright Dart he died.
Out flies the trembling SOUL, a Guard does hale
It to that Court admits of no Bail.
Her Mittimus is drawn, she is sent away,
To lie in Prison till the JVDGMENT Day.
Let Us lay our ears unto the Doleful Pit,
And hearken there what does become of it.

THe SOUL and the DEVIL. Soul. Deceitful Devil, Will thou now torment
That SOUL, thou lately flatt'redst with Content?
Are all those Promises thou made of Bliss,
And future Glory; are they come to this?

Devil. My Promises, vain SOUL, they were mistook,
I used them but as Baits to hide my Hook;
My end's accomplished, I the prey have caught,
And now I Will use thee as my CAPTIVES ought;
With Chains of Darkness I must bind thee fast,
And in these FLAMES of WRATH I must thee cast.

Soul. O wretched SOUL! how have thou lost that place
Where SAINTS and ANGELS do behold the FACE
Of Everlasting GLORY, and do sing
Eternal HALLELVIAHS to their KING.
Upon whose Heads are Crowns of GLORY worn,
And by whose hands Triumphant PALMS are borne:
Who in the Bosom of dear LOVE do rest,
And on the purest JOYS for ever feast;
Whilst with the DAMNED SPIRITS I do make
My habitation in this FIERY LAKE;
The Flaming PILE whereof is kindled by
The Breath of that incensed MAJESTY,
Which like a stream of Brimstone, where it runs,
All things before it into FIRE turns.
Oh dismal place! where Vollies of Outcries,
And hideous Howlings like to Thunder flies:
The horrid noise, and dreadful shrieks that came
From the PHILISTINES, when that massy Frame,
Bereft of both its Pillars, down did fall,
And into Death and Ruin crushed them all;
The frightful Rorings, and the woeful Cries,
Which SODOM sent unto the Angry Skies,
Whilst on their wicked heads they forth did pour
(Of Fire and Brimstone) a consuming shows;
Are instances too short for to declare
Those Wailings that among the DAMNED are.
Oh Woeful State! their TORMENTS who can tell,
That with Devouring Fire for ever dwell?
The Wracking Wheel, on which the Bones are broke,
By a most gradual and deliberate stroke;
The Fiery Pinchers, which deep Wounds do tear,
That scalding SULPHUR may be poured there;
The Stripes of SCORPIONS, that long Furrows make,
With cutting SAWS that through the MARROW rake:
The Stings of DRAGONS, and the rending Claws
Of ravenous LIONS, for their hungry Jaws;
The CAULDRONS that with Plumbean liquor boil,
The GRIDIR'NS whereon living Flesh does broyl;
With thousands of like TORTURES, do not bear
Proportion to the TORMENTS that are here:
And yet this is the Portion of my Soul,
Which now is like that dreadful, bitter Roll,
Filled full with Lamentations, Mournings, Woes,
And floods of Wrath, which from Dire Vengeance flows.
Horrid reflections likewise do I find,
Adding great Anguish to my Tortured Mind,
Whilst I consider, that for empty Toys,
I have for ever lost substantial JOYS;
And whilst I think how often I have rejected
That Counsel which to Peace my steps directed;
How often I have extinguished that same light
Which CONSCIENCE brought to guide my feet aright;
How all my precious TIME I vainly spent,
And now no TIME is left for to Repent:
This like a dreadful WORM does ever gnaw
Upon my VITALS with insatiate MAW.
Oh now that Death, which late my heart strings broke,
Would come and ease me by a deeper stroke!
Oh, how I would as a sweet Cordial, rate
That blow which should this SOUL Annihilate!
If such a wish but granted I might have,
I would account that hand that killd, did save.
Oh, this would Mercy prove, but none remains,
Not the least drop to cool me in these FLAMES.
I now must Dying live, and Living dye,
Scorcht in these FLAMES to all Eternity.

The EPILOGUE.
The end is Endless, he that will not take
Example now, shall an Example make.
FINIS.
