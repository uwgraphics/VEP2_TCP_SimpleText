The (...) Lexi(...) in st^^^ who departd this life the 28 day of (...) the
great grief of all good Subjects.


With mourning pen, and melting eyes,
with bleeding heart, and sobbing Cries.
here lament the loss of one,
who was the brightness of the throne.
Our loss is her eternal gain.
and yet we cannt but Complain,
as having lost the sweetest Queen,
as ever in the Realm was seen
