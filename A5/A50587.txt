A Memoriable Song on the unhappy hunting in Chevy Chase between Earl Piercy
of England and Earl Douglas of Scoland.
To the tune of Flying Fame.
GOd prosper long our Noble King,
our lives and safetyes all,
The woeful hunting once there did
in Cheevy chase befall,
To drive the Deer with hound and horn
Earl Piercy took his way,
The child may rue that is unborn
the hunting of that day.
The stout Earl of Northumberland
a vow to God did make,
His pleasure in the Scottish woods
three summers days to take:
The chiolest Hearts in Chevy-chase
to kill ^o bear away,
These tidngs to Earl Douglas came,
in Scotand where he lay,
Who sent Earl P^^rc^ present word,
h^ would prevent his sport,
The Enlgish Earl not fearing this,
did to the woods resort
With fifeen hundred Bowmen bold,
all cho^en men of might
Who knew full well in time of need
to aim their shafts aright.
The gal^ant Gray-hounds swiftly ran
to chase the Fallow Dear,
On Monday they began to hunt.
when daylight did appear,
And long before high noon they had
an hundred fat Bucks slain,
Then having dined the Drovers went
to rowse them up again.
The Bowmen mustred on the Hills
well able to endure.
The backsides all with special care
that day were guarded sure:
The hounds ran swiftly through the woods
the nimble Dear to take,
And with their cries the Hills and Dales
an Echo shrill did make.
Lord Piercy to the Quarrey went
To view the tender Dear,
Quoth he Earl Douglas promised
this day to meet me here:
But if I thought he would not come,
no longer would I stay,
With that a brave young Gentleman
thus to the Earl did say,
Lo yonder does Earl Douglas come,
his men in armor bright,
Full twenty hundred Scottish spears
all marching in our sight.
All men of pleasant Tividale
fast by the Rivers Tweed.
Then cease your sport Earl Piercy said,
and take your Bows with speed.
And now with me my Countrymen
your courage forth advance,
For never was there Champion yet
in Scotland or in France,
That ever did on horseback come,
but if my hop it were
durst encounter man for man
with him to break a Spear.
Earl Douglas on a milk white Steed,
most like a Baron bold,
Rode foremost of the company,
whose armour-shone like gold.
Show me he said whose men you be,
that hunt so boldly here,
That without my consent do chase
and kill my fallow Deer?
The man that first did answer make,
was noble Piercy he,
Who said, we list not to declare
nor show whose men we be.
Yet will we spend our dearest blood,
thy chiefest Hearts to slay
Then Douglas swore a solemn Oath,
and thus in rage did say:
Ere thus I will out-braved be,
one of us two shall dye,
I know thee well an Earl thou art,
Lord Piercy so am I:
But trust me Piercy pity it were,
and great offense to kill
Any of these our guiltless men,
for they have done no ill:
Let thou and I the battle try,
and set our men aside,
Accursed be he Lord Piercy said,
by whom this is denied.
Then stepped a gallant Squire forth,
Witherington was his name.
Who said he would not have it told
to Henry our King for shame,
That ever my Captain fought on foot,
and I stood looking on:
You two be Earls said Witherington,
and I a Squire alone:
I Will do the best that do I may,
while I have power to stand,
While I have power to weild my sword,
I Will fight with heart and hand.
Our English Archers bent their Bows,
their hearts were good and true,
At the first flight of Arrows sent,
full four score Scots the^ slew.
To drive the Deer with hound and horn
Douglas had on the bent,
A Captain moved with mickle pride,
the Spears to shivers went.
They closed full fast on every side,
no slacknesse there was found,
And many a gallant Gentleman
lay gasping on the ground;
O Christ it was great grief to see,
and likewise for to hear,
The cries of men lying in their gore,
and scattered here and there.
At last these two stout Earls did meet,
like Captains of great might,
Like Lions moved they laid on load
and made a cruel fight:
They fought until they both did sweat,
with sword of tempered steel,
Until the blood like drops of rain.
they trickling down did feel.
Yield thee Lord Piercy Dowgla^ said,
in faith I will thee bring
Were thou shall high advanced be,
by James the Scottish King.
Thy Ransom will I freely give,
and thus report of thee,
Thou art the most courageous Knight
as ever I did see.
No Douglas quoth Earl Piercy then.
thy proster I do scorn,
I will not yield to any Scot
that ever yet was born,
With that there came an Arrow keen
out of an English Bow,
Which struck Earl Douglas to the hear^
a deep and deadly blow.
Who never spoke more words then these
Fight on my merry men all,
For why my life is at an end,
Lord Piercy lees my fall.
Then leaving life Earl Piercy took
the dead man by the hand,
And said Earl Douglas for thy life
would I had lost my Land.
O Christ my very heart does bleed
with sorrow for thy sake,
For sure a more renowned Knight
mischance did never take.
A Knight amongst the Scots there was,
which saw Earl Dow^las dye
Who straight in wrath did vow revenge
upon the Earl Piercy
SIr Hugh Mongomer^ was he called,
who with a Spear full bright,
Well mounted on a gallant Steed,
ran fiercely through the fight,
And past the Eng^ish Archers all,
without all dread or fear,
And through Earl Piercies body then
he thrust his hatefull-Speare.
With such a vehement force and might
he did his body gore,
The Spear went through the other side,
a la^ge cloth yard and more.
So thus did both those Nobles dye,
whose coura^e none could stain,
An English Archer then perceived
the Noble Earl was slain*
He had a Bow bent in his hand,
made of a trusty tree,
An Arrow of a cloth yard long
unto the head drew he:
Against Sir Hugh Montgomery, then,
so right his shaft he set.
The gray-g^^se wing that was thereon,
in his heart blood was wet
This fight did last from break of day,
till setting of the Sun,
For when they rang the Evening Bell,
the Battle scarce was done.
With the Earl Piercy there was slain
Sir John of Ogerton.
Sir Robert Ratliffe and Sir John,
Sir James that bold Baron,
And with Sir George and good sir James
both Knights of good account,
Good Sir Ralph F^bby there was slain,
whose prowess did surmount:
For Witherington needs must I wall,
as one in doleful dumps,
For when his legs were smitten often,
he fought upon his stumps.
And with Earl Douglas there was slain
Sir Hugh Montgomery,
Sir Charles Murrel that from the Field
one foot would never fly.
Sir Charles Murr^l of Ratliffe too,
his sisters sisters Son was he,
Sir David Lamb so well esteemed
yet saved could not be.
And the Lord Markwel in likewise,
did with Earl Douglas die
Of twenty hundred Scottish peers
scarce fifty five did fly.
Of fifteen hundred English men
went home but fifty three
The rest were slain in Cheevy Chase
under the greenwood tree
Next day did many widows come
their husbands to bewail,
They washed their wounds in brinish tear
but all would not prevail:
Their bodies bathed in purple blood,
they bo^e with them away,
They kissed them dead a thousand times
when they were clad in clay.
This news was brought to Edinburgh*
where Sco^lands King did reign,
That brave Earl Douglas suddenly
was with an Arrow slain.
O heavy News King Iomes did say,
Scotland can witness be,
I have not any Captain more
of such account as he.
Like tidings to King Henry came
within as short a space
That Piercy of Northumberland
was slain in Chevy-chase.
Now God be with him said our King,
since twill no better be,
I trust I have within my Realm
five hundred as good as he.
Yet shall not Scots no^ Scotland say,
but I will vengeance take,
And be revenged on them all,
for brave Earl Piercies sake:
This vow full well the King performed,
after on Humble Down,
In one day fifty Knights were slain,
with Lords of great renown.
And of the rest of small account
did many hundreds dye,
Thus ended the hunting in Chevy Chase,
made by the Earl Piercy.
God save the King nnd bless the Land*
in Plenty, Joy, and Peace,
And grant henceforth that foul debate
twixt Noblemen may cease.
FINIS.
