amongst, and with other Churches. Our Chu^es h^e, as (^y the grace of Christ)
we believe and profess the sam^* (...) (...) ^e (...) ^f ^he Gospel, which
generally is received in ^ll the reformed (...) (...) ^st in ^rope: so (...),
we desire not to vary from the ^octrine of f^ (...) ^eld for by ^he churches
of our nat^ve country. For though it be (...) (...) (...), that can breed us
(...) of (...) min^; (...) (...) w^e for to have the glor^ous fa^h of our Lord
Jesus with respect of persons: yet as P^ul who wa^ (...) (...), ^rofessed to
hold forth the doctrine of just^fication by faith, and of the (...) of the de^,
(...) as he know his godly countrymen did, who were ^wes by nature (Gala^. 2.
15. Acts 26. 6, 7.) so we, who are by nature; Eng^sh m^n, d^ desire to hold
forth the some (...) of religion (especially (...) (...)) wh^ we see and kn^w
to (...) (...) by the churches of England, accor^g to the truth of the Gospel

The more we (...), (that which we do, and have cause to do with incessant
(...) and (...)) he (...), and unbr^therly, and unchristian contentions of our
godly brethr^n, and countrymen, ^n matters of church government: he more
ern^stly do^ we desire to see them joined together in one common faith, and
our selves w^ (...). For th^s and, h^ng perused the publ^k confession of faith,
agreed uponly the Reverend assembly of D^ines at (...), and find^ng the sum^
and su^stance thereof (in matters of doctrine) to express not the own judgments
only, (...) o^rs also: and being likewise called upon by our godly Mag^strates,
to d^w up a public (...) of that faith, which is constan^ly taught, and
genera^y (...) amongst us, we thought good to p^esent unto them, and with them
to our (...), and w^h them to all the church^s of Christ abroad, our prof^ssed
and hearty (...) and (...) to the whole (...) (...) faith (f^r (...) of
doctrine) wh^h (...) Reverend (...) (...) (...) (...) H^nourable (...) of

conf^ssion, which (...) (...) of con^roversie in (...) (...); (...) whi^ we
ref^re our selves to the draught of church-discpline in the ensueing treatise.

The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vo^e of the
Synod of the Elders and messengers of our churches assembled at Cambridg, the
last of the sixth month, 1648: wo^ch jointly passed in these words; This Synod
having perused, and considered (with much gladness of heart, and thankfullness
to God) the confession of faith published ^f late by the Reverend Assembly in
England, do judge it to be very holy, orthodox, and judicious in all matters
of faith: and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the substance
thereof. Only in those things which have respect to church government and
discipline, we refer our selves to the platform of church discipline, agreed
upon by this present asse^^ly: and do therefore think it meet, that this
confession of faith, should be commended to the churces of Christ amongst us,
and to the Honored Court, as worthy of their due consideration and acceptance.
Howbe^, we may not conceal, that the doctrine of vocation expressed in Chap
10. S 1. and summarily repeated, Chap 13. and 1. passed not without some
debate. Yet considering, that the term of vocation, and others by which it is
described, are capable of a larg, or more strict sense, and use, and that it is
not intended to bind apprehensions precisely in po^t of order or method, there
has been a general condescendency thereunto.

Now by this our professed consent and free concurrence with them in all the
doctrinalls of religion, we hope, it may appear to the world, that as we are
a remnant of the people of the same nation with them: so we are professors of
the same common faith, and fellow heirs of the same common salvation. Yea
moreover, as this our profession of the same faith with them, will exempt us
(even in their judgme^ts) from suspicion of heresy: so (we trust) it may
exempt us in the like sort from suspicion of schism: that though we are forced
to dissent from them in matters of church discipline: Yet our dissent is not
taken up out of arrogance of spirit in our selves (whom they see willingly
condescend to learn of them:) neither is it carried with uncharitable
censoriousness toward them (both which are the proper, and essential
charracters of schism) but in meekness of w^sdom, as we walk along with them,
and follow them, as they follow Christ: so where we (...) a ^fferent
apprehention of the mind of Christ (as it fails out in some few points (...)
church order) we still reserve due reverence to them (whom we judge to be,
through Christ, the glorious l^ghts of both nations:) and only crave leave (as
in spirit we are bound) to follow the Lamb w^thersoever he goes, and (after
the Apostles example) as we bele^ve, so we speak.

And if the example of such poor outcasts as our selves, might prevail if not
with all (for that were too great a blessing to hope for) yet with some or
other of our brethren in England, so far as they are come to ^ind and speak
the same thing with such as dissent from them, we hope in Christ, it would not
only moderate the harsh judging and condemning of one another in such
differences of judgment, as may be found in (...) ch^ysest sa^nts: but also
preven (^y the mercy of (...)) the peril of the distraction and (...) of all
the churches (...) both k^ngdoms. Otherwise, if brethren shall go on to bite
and devour one another, the Apo^ feare^ (as we als^, ^th s^dness of (...) a^)
(...) will tend to the (...) of them, and (...) which the Lo^d prevent.

We are not ignorant, that (besides these (...) of Heresy and Schis^) other
exceptions also are taken at our w^y of church govern^: (...) (as we conce^)
u^ as li^le (...).

As 1 That by admitting none into the fellowship of our Church, but saints by
c^lling, we (...) p^sh-churches of the b^st (...), to make up one of o^r
cong^gations: which is not only, to gather churches o^t of churches (a thing
(...) ^f ^n Sc^pture:) but also to weaken the hearts and hands of the best
Minist^rs ^n the par^shes, by d^spoyling them of the ^st ^earers.

2 That we provide no course for the gayning, and (...) in, of ignorant, and
erroneous, and (...) (...), whom we (...) to receive into our churches, and so
exclude from the (...) (...) of (...).

3 That in our way, we sow seed^ of division and h^ndrance of edificat^o^ in
every f^ly: whilst admitting into our churches only voluntar^es, the husband
w^ll be ^f on^ church, the wife of another: the parent, of one church, the
children of (...) the ma^ster of one church, the servant, of another. And so
the parent and ma^sters being of d^fferent churches from their child^n and
servants, they cannot take a j^st ^ccount of their profiting by what they
hear, yea by this (...) the (...), parents, and ma^sters, shall be chargable
to the (...) of (...) other churc^es and church-officer^, besides their own:
which will prove a charge and b^rden unsuppo^ble.

(...) (...) (...), as to (...). For (...) churches out of churches, we cannot
s^y t^ it is a (...) (...) (...) (...). The ^st (...) church was (...) out ^f
the Iew^sh (...), (...) of (...) (...) (...) that church, and (...) (...) of
(...) (...) ^f (...), part^y of (...) Ga^leans: who though t^y k^pt some (...)
(...) parts of pu^k (...) wi^h the T^ple: yet (...) the (...) they frequen^ the
(...), no^ (...) (...) (...) for the (...) of their (...) causes, b^t (...)
(...) (...) (...) with the Apostles c^ch ^ll ^he ord^nances of the gos^. And
for the (...) (...) church of the (...) at Antoch, it appe^reth (...) ^ve ^een
g^hered and (...) partly of the ^sed b^hren of the (...) at Ierus^lem (whe^of
so^ were men of Cyprus, and (...)) (...) (...) of the (...) (...). Acts. ^1.
20, 21.

If it be sa^d the first christ^an church at Ierus^lem, and that at Antioch
were gathered not out of any ch^stian church, but out of the Jewish (...) and
Synagogues, which were shortly aft^r to be abolished: and their gathering to
Ant^och, was upon occasion of dispersion in time of persecution.

We desire, it may be considered, I That the members of the Jewish Church were
more strongly and st^tly tied by express holy covenant, to keep fellowsh^p with
the Jewish church, t^ll it was abol shed, then any members of christian
parish-churches are wont to be tied to keep fellowsh^p with their
par^sh-churches. The Episcopal Canon^, which bind them to attend on th^er
parish church, it is likely they a^e now abolished with the Episcopa^y. The
common Law ^f the Land is satisfy a (as we concive) if they attend upon the
worship of God in any other church though not (...) their own parish. But no
such like covenant of God, nor any other religious (...) upon them to attend
the worship of God in their own par^sh church, as did lie upon the Jews to
attend upon the wo^ship of God in their Temple and Synagogue.

2 T^ugh the Iew^sh Temple Church at Ierus^em was to be abolis^, vet that does
not make the desertion of it by the members, to be lawful, ^ll (...) was al^o
she^. Future abolition is now errant for present dese^o: unless it be lawful
^n some case (...) the chu^chis yet in present standing to (...); to wit,
either for avoiding of present polutions, or for hope of greater (...), and so
f^r better (...) to conscience in either future events ((...) for^ of (...)) to
not ^olve present relat^on. Else wives, children, servants, might desert (...)
(...), pa^ents, ^asters, when they be mortally sick.

3 What the members of the Jewish ch^ch did, (...) to the church a^ Antioch, in
time of persecution, it may w^ll be con^ved, ^e (...) of any christ an church
may d^ the lik, for satisfaction of con^. Pe^ce of (...) is m^re (...) then the
pe^ce of the outwa^d (...) and (...), (...) (...) of cons^e^ce is m^re (...)
(...) to a sincere hea^, (...) (...) from (...).

If it be s^d, these members of the Christ an Ch^ch at (...) (...), that joined
to the church at Antioch, removed their (...) together with th^r relations:
which ^f the brethren of the (...) way (...) (...), it w^ll much abate the
grievance of their depart^ from their presbyter all churche^.

We verily could w^sh them ^o to a^, as ^ll approv^ng the (...) (...) (...)
^bitation, ^n case of ch^ging church-relation^ ((...), that it may be done
without too much ^riment to their outward estate) and w^ for our pa^tes, have
done the same. But to put a necessity of removal of habi^ ^n in such (...),
(...) is to fo^nt and cherish a corrupt principle of making civ^l ^ation, if
^ot a (...) cause, yet at least a proper adiunct of church-relation; which the
truth of the Gospel does no^ ackno^ledg. Now to (...) an error to the
prejudice of the tr^th of the Gospel, is no^ to (...) (...) (...) according to
the truth of the G^pel, as Paul (...), Galat. 2. 14.

4 We do not think it meet, or safe, for a member of a presbyteriall Church,
for with to desert his relation to his Church, betake himself to the fellowship
of a (...) Church, though he may d^scern some def^ct in the estate, or
government of his own.

For 1 Faithfullness of brotherly love in Church-relation, requires, that the
members of the Church sh^ld first convince their brethren of their sinful
defects, and duly wait for their reformation, before they depart from them.
For if we must take such a course for the healing of a private brother, in a
way of brotherly love, with much ^eekness, and patience: how more more ought
we so to walk with like tendrness, toward a whole church.

Again 2 By the hasty departure of ^ound members from a defective church,
refo^mation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and corruption increased.
Whereas ^n the contrary, while sincere members breathing after purity of
reformation abide together, they may (by the blessing of God upon their
faithful endeavors) preva^le much with their Elders, and neighbors toward a
reformation; ^t may be, so (...), as that their Elders in their own church
shall receive none to the Lord* table, ^ut visible saints: and in the Classis
shall put forth no authoritive ^ct but c^tive only) touching the members of
other churches: nor touching their own but (...) the consent (sile^t consent at
least) of their own church: which two things, (...) they can ^bteyn with any
humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavors, we (...), they might (by the grace
of Christ find liberty ^f consc^ce to (...) (...) relation with their own
pre^byteriall church, w^hout scru^le

5 ^t to add a word farthe^, (...) the gathering of C^urches out of Ch^rches,

If any (faith he) wronged with unj^st vexation, or providing for his own (...)
or in test^ony against sin^ depart from a church where some evils are
tolerated, and join himself to another more p^re, yet without co^demning of
the church he l^veth, he is not therefore to be h^ld as a schismatic, or as
guilty of any other sin. Where the (...) (...), which the (...) Docter

c^use of de^re, Though all of them do not concur together. Neither will such a
practice dispoyle the best M^nisters of the p^ shes of the^ best he^ers.

For 1 Sometimes the M^sters themselves are willing to join with their better
sort of hearers, in this way of reformation: and then they and their h^rers
cont^nue still their Ch^ch relati^ together, ye^ and confirm^t mo (...) and
strongly, by an express re^ewed covenant, th^h the Ministers may still continue
their w^ted pre^ching to the w^le p^sh.

2 If the M^ster, d^ (...) the way of those, w^om they otherwise (...) their
best members, and so refuse to join with them therein; yet ^f those members can
procu^e s^e other Mi^ster, to join with them in their ow^ way, and st^ll (...)

(...) assembly, as to attend constantly upon the (...) of their former Church:
and either after or before the public assembly of the parish take an
opportunity to gather together for the (...) of Sacraments, and Censure^, and
other church ordinances amongst themselves. The first Apostolic (...)
assembled to hear the word with the Jewish church in the open courts of the
Temple: but (...) gathered together for (...) of (...), and other acts of
church order, from house to house

3 Suppose, Pre^byteriall churches should communicate so^e of their best gifted

they accou^t^t (...) (...) to their garden, and orchards, but rat^ (...).
Nevertheless we go not so far: we neither seek, nor ^alk the choyse-members
of the parishes but accept them being offered.

If it be sa^, ^hey are not offered by the M^nisters, nor by the par^sh churc^s
(who have most right in them) but only by themselves.

It may j^stly be dema^nded what right, or what power have either the ministers,
or parish church over them. Not by solemn church covenant: for that, though it
be the fi^est engagement, is not owned, but rejected. If it be, by Their
joining with the parish, in the calling and election of a minister to such a
congregation at his first coming, there is indeed just weight in such an
engagement: nor do we judge it safe for such to remove from such a minister,
unless it be upon such grounds, as may justly give him due satisfaction. But if
the unio^ of such members to a parish Church, and to the ministry thereof, be
only by cohabitation within the precincts of the parish, that union, as it was
founded upon humane law: so by humane law it may easily be released. Or
otherwise, if a man remove his habitation, he removes also the bond of his
relation, and the ground of offense.

4 It need not to be feared, that all best hearers of the best ministers, no
nor the most of them, will depart from them upon point of church-governme^t.
Those who have found the presence and power of the spirit of Christ breathing in
their ministers, either to their conversion, or edification, will be slow to
change such a ministry of faith, and holiness, for the liberty of
church order. Upon which ground, and sundry other such like, their be doubtless
sundry godly and judicious hearers in many parishes in England that do and
will prefer their relation to their ministers (though in a presbyteriall way)
above the Congreg^tionall confoederation.

5 But if all, or the most part of the best hearers of the best ministers of
parishes, should depart from them, as preferring in their judgments, the
congregationall way: yet, in case the congregationall way should prove to be of
Christ, it will never greiv the holy hearts of godly ministers, that their
hearers should follow after Christ: yea many of themselves (upon due
deliberation) will be reaedy to go along with them. It never greived, nor
troubled John Baptist that his best disciples, departed from him to follow
after Christ. Joh. 3. But in case the congregationall way should prove to be,
not the institution of Christ (as we take it) but the inve^tion of men: then
doubtless, the presbyteriall form (if it be of God) will swallow up the other^
as Moses rod devoured the rods of the Egyptians. Nor will this put a necessity
upon both the opposite parties, to sh^ft for themselves, and to seek to
supplant one another: but only, it will call upon them (...) to seek and to
follow the truth in love, to attend in faithfullness each unto his own flock,
and to administer to the^ all the holy things of God, and their port o^ of food
in due season: and as for others, quietly to forbear them, and yet to instruct
them with meekness that are contrary minded: leaving it to Christ (in the use
of all good means) to reveal his own truth in his own time: and mean while
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. (...) p. 3.

To the 2 Exception, That we take no co^rse for the gayning and healing and
(...) in of ignorant and erroneous, and scandal^s persons, whom we refuse to
receive into our churches and so exclude them from the re^midy of church (...)

We conceive the receiving of them into o^r (...) w^d ^ather loose (...)
cor^pt our Churches, ^hen gain and heal the^. A little (...) laid in a lump
of dough, will sooner le^n the whole lump, then the whole l^mp w^ll sw^eten i^.
We therefore find it safer, to squ^re rough and unhew (...), bef^e he ^e laid
n o the buil^ing; rath^r then ^o h^nimer and hew the^, ^hen ^hey lie ^renly ^n
the build^ng.

And accordingly, w^ means (w^e u^e y^ and (...) such ^s are ignorant or

their (...), till they approve their judgments to be sound and or^hodox, and
the lives ^ubdued to some hope of a godly (...). Wh^t can Classical (...) (...)
(...) (...) self do more (...) (...) case.

The 3 Exception wrapp^th up in ^t a three fold domestical inconvenience: and
each o^ them meet to be eschewed. 1 Disunion in families between each rel^tion:
2 D^sappointme^t of (...), for want of opportunity in the governors of
familyes to take account of the heard by the^r children and servants. 3
Disoursments of chargeable maintenance to the several churches, whereto the
(...) persons of their familyes are joined.

All which inconveniences either do no^ fall out in congregationall-church^; or
are easily redressed. For none are o^derly admitted into
congregational-churches bu^ such as are well approved by good testimony, to be
duly observant of familyrelations. Or if any otherwise disposed should creep in
they are either orde^ly heal^, or d^ly removed in a way of (...). Nor are they
admitted, unl^ss they can g^e some good account of their pr^iting by (...),
^fore the Elders and brethren of the church: and much more to their (...), and
masters. Godly Tutors in the university can t^ke an account of their pup lis:
and godly (...) in the C^ty can take account ^f their children and servants,
how they profit by the wo^d they have heard in several churches: and that to
the greater ed^fication of the whole f^mily, ^y the variety of such
administrations. Bees may bring the more honey, and wax into the hive, when they
are not l^mited to one garden of flowers, but may fly abroad to man^.

No^ ^s any ch^rge expected from (...), children, or servants to the (...) of
congregationall churches, (...) her th^n they ^e (...) w^h personal (...),
(...) (...), wh^h may enable the to (...) of such (...) as they have, and (...)
Such as they have not. God accepts not Robbery for a sacrific^. And though a
godly householder may j^stly take himself bound in conscience, to cr^tybute to
any such Church, whereto (...) wife, or children, or servants do stand in
relation: yet that will not aggr^ate the burden of his charge, no more then if
they were received members of the same Church whereto himself is related.

But why do we stand thus long to plead exemptions from exceptions? the Lord
help all his faithful servants (whether presbyteriall, or congregational.) to
judge and shame our selves before the Lord for all our former complyances to
greater enormity^ in Church Government, then are to be found either in the
congregationall, or presbyteriall way. And then surely, either the Lord will
clear up his own will to us, and so frame, and subdue us all to one mind, and
one way, (Ezck. 43. 10, 11.) or else we shall learn to bear one another
burdens in a spirit of meekness. It will then doubtless be far from us, so to
attest the discipline of Christ, as to detest the disciples of Christ: so to
contend for the seameless coat of Christ, as to crucifi^ the living members of
Christ so to divide our selves about Church communion, as through breaches to
open a wide gap for a deluge of Antichristian and profane malignity to swallow
up both Church and civil stat^.

What shall we say more? is difference about Church Order beco^ the inlett of
all the disorders in the kingdom? has the Lord indeed left us to such hardness
of heart, that Church Government shall become a snare to Z^on, (as sometimes
Moses was t^ Egypt, Exodus 10. 7.) that we cannot leave (...) and contending
about it, till the kingdom be destroyed? did not the Lord Jesus, when he
dedicated his sufferings for his church, (...) his also unto his Father, make
it his earnest and only p^ayer for us in this world, that we all might be one
in him? John. 17. 20, 21, 22, 23. And is it possible, that he (whom the Father
^eard alway^, John. 11. 42.) should not have this last most solemn prayer
heard, and granted? or, shall it be granted for all the saints elsewhere, and
not for the saints in England; so that amongst them disunion shall grow even
about Church-union, and communion? If it be possible, for a little faith (so
much as a grain of mustardse^d) to remove a mountain: is it not possible, for
so much strength of faith, as is to be found in all the godly in the kingdom,
(...) remove those Images of jealousy, and to cast those stumbling-blockes out
of the way, which may hinder the free passage of brotherly love amongst
brethren? It is true indeed, the National covenant does justly engage both
parties, faithfully to endeavor the utter extirpation of the Antichristin
Hierarchy, and much more of all Blasphemies, Heresies, and damnable errors.
Certainly, if congregational discipline be Independent from the inventions of
men, is it not much more Independent from the delusions of Satan? what
fellowship has Christ with Belial? light with darkness? truth with error?
the faithful Jews needed not the help of the (...), (...) (...) ^y the Temple
of God: yea they rejected their help when it w^ offered, (...) 4. the 1, 2, 3.
And if the congregationall w^y be a way of truth (as we believe) and if the
brethren that walk in it be zealous of the truth, and hate every false way (as
by the rule of their ho^y discipline they are instructed, 2 John. 10, 11.) then
verily, there is no branch in the National coven^, that engages the
covenanters to abh^re either Congregationall Churches, or their way: which
being duly adminstred, do no less effectually extirpate the A^christian
Hierarchy, and all Blasphemies, Heresies, and perni^ous errors, then the other
way of discipline does, which is more generally and publicly received and
ratifyed.

But the Lord Jesus (...) with ^ll ou^ h^ts in ^ret: and ^e (...) is the King
of his Ch^ch, let him ^e ple^ to excer^ise his Kingly power in our spirits,
that so his k^ngdome may come into our Churches in P^rity and Peace.

CHAPTER I. Of the form of Church Government; and that it is one, immutable,
and prescribed in the Word of God.
1 Ecclesiastical Polity or Church Government, or discipline is nothing else,
but that Form and order that is Ezekiel 43. 1^ Col. 2. 5 1 Timothy 3 15
to be observed in the Church of Christ upon earth, both for the Constitution
of it, and all the Administrations that therein are to be performed.

2 Church Government is Considered in a double respect either in regard of the
parts of Government themselves, or necessary Circumstances thereof. The parts
of Government are prescribed in the word, because the Lord Jesus Christ the
King and Lawgiver of his Heb^ 3. 5. (...)
Church, is no less faithful in the house of God then was Moses, who Exodus 25 40
from the Lord delivered a form and pattern of Government to the Children of
Israel in the old Testament: And the holy Scriptures are now 2 Timothy 3 16
also so perfect, as they are able to make the man of God perfect and
thoroughly furnished unto every good work; and therefore doubtless ^o the well
ordering of the house of God

3 The parts of Church Government are all of them exactly described (...) Tim
3 1^ 1 Chronicles ^5 13. Ex 20 4 1 Timothy 6 13 v 16. Heb 1^ 27 28. 1 Cor 15 24.
in the word of God being parts or means of Instituted worship according to the
second Commandment: and therefore to continue one and the same, unto the
apearing of our Lord Jesus Christ as a kingdom that cannot be shaken, until
he shall deliver it up unto God, even the Father. So that it is not left in
the power of men, officers, Deuteronomy 12 32. Ezekiel 43 8. 1 Kings 12, 31 32 33
Churches, or any state in the world to add, or diminish, or alter any thing in
the least measure ther^in.

number of them who are conflicting with their enemies upon earth.

3. This Militant Church is to be considered as Invisible, and Visible.
Invisible, in respect of their relation wherein they stand to Christ, as a body
unto the head, being united unto him, by the spirit 2 Timothy 2 19. Rev 217. 1 Cor
6 17. Ephesians (...) (...). Rom (...). (...). 1 ^hes (...) (...). Is^ 2. 2 (...) Tim

of God, and faith in their hearts: Visible, in respect of the profession of
their faith, in their persons, and in particular Churches: and so there may be
acknowledged an universal visible Church.

4 The members of the Militant visible Church, considered either as not yet in
church order, or as walking according to the Acts 19. (...). Colos 2. 5. Matt

church order of the Gospel. In order, and so besides the spiritual union, and
communion, common to all belivers, they enjoy more over an union and communion
ecclesiasticall-Politicall: so we deny an universal visible church.

5 The state of the members of the Militant visible church walking in order*
was either before the law, Oeconomical, that is Genesis 18. 19
in families; or under the law, National: or, since the coming of Christ, only
congregational. (The term Independent, we approve Exodus: (...) 6.

6 A Congregational-church, is by the inst^titution of Christ a part of the
Militant-visible-church, consistin^ of a company o^ Saints by calling, un^ed
into one body by (...) holy covenant, for the public worship of God, and the
mutual edification one of another, in the Fellowship o^ the Lord Jesus.

also by this means is Blasphemed: and the holy things of God defiled and
Profaned, the hearts of godly gri^ved: and the wicked themselves hardened: and
helped forward to ^nation. the example of such does endanger the sanctity of
others. A little Leaven Leaveneth the whole lump.

2 The children of such, who are also holy.

3 The members of churches though orderly constituted, may in time degenerate,
and grow corrupt and scandalous, which though they ought not to be ^olerated in
the church, yet their continu^ce ^erein, through the defect of the execution of
discipline and Ju^ (...), does not immediately d^ssolv the being of the church,
as appears in the church of Israel, and the churches of G^latia, (...) (...),
(...), and (...).

(...) (...) yet we conceive, the substance of it is kept, where there is
(...) real Agreement and consent, of a company of faithful persons to meet
constantly together in one Congregation, for the public worship of God, and
their mutual edification: which real agreement and consent they do express by
their constant practice in coming together for the public worship of God, and
by their religious subjection unto the ordinances of God the^e: the rather, if
we do consider how (...) 19 5 (...) 8 (...) and 24 3 1^. (...) 24 ^8 to 24

Scripture covenants have been entered into, not only expressly by word of
mouth, but by s^crifice; by hand writing, and seal; and also sometimes by silent
consent, without any writing, or expression of words at all.

5 This form then being by mutual covenant, it follows, it is not faith in
the heart, nor the profession of that faith, nor cohabitation, nor Baptism; 1
Not faith in the heart? because that is invisible: 2 not a bare profession;
because that declares them no more to be members of one church then of
another: 3 not Cohabitation; Athiests or Infidels may dwell together with
beleivers: 4 not Baptism; because it presupposseth a church estate, as
circumcision in the old Testament, which gave no being unto the church, the
church being before it, and in the wilderne, without it seals presuppose a
covenant already in being, one person is a complete subject of Baptism: but one
person is incapable of being a church.

Christ, the Ministerial, is either extraordinary; as the Apostles, Prophets,
and Evangilists: or Ordinary; as every particular Congregational church.

2 Ordinary church power, is either the power of office, that is such as is
proper to the eldership: or, power of privilege, such as be longs unto the
brotherhood* the latter, is in the brethren formally, and immediately from
Christ, that is, so as it may according to order Ro^ ^4 (...). Acts 1 23 (...)

his tender compassion has appointed, and ordained officers which he would not
have done, if they had not been useful and need full for the church; yea,
being Ascended into heaven, he received gifts ^ph 4 12 ^3

3 These officers were either extraordinary, or ordinary, extraordinary as
Apostles, Prphets, Evangilists, ordinary as Elders and (...).

The Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, as they were called extraordinarily
by Christ, so their office ended with themselves whence it is, that Paul
directing Timothy how to carry along Church-Administrations, 1 Co^ 4 9.
Gives no direction about the choice or course of Apostles, Prophet, or
Evange^sts, but only of Elders, and Deacons. 1 Tim^ 1, 2 (...), 8 to 13 Tit 1.

and when Paul was to take his last leave of the church of Ephe^s, he committed
the care of feeding the church to ^o there, but unto the Elders of that church.

The Pastors special work is, to attend to exh^tation: and therein to
Administer a word of Wisdom the Teacher is to attend to D^mo, and therein to
Administer a word of Knowledge: and either of them to administer the Seals of
that Covenant, unto the dispensation whereof the are alike called: as also to
execute the Censu^e, being but a kind of 2 Timothy 41 2 ^it (...) 9
application of the word, the preaching of which, together with the application
thereof they are alike charged withal.

perfecting of the Saints, and edifying of his body, which Ephesians 4 11 12 Cap 1 22

Saints, and body of Christ is his church; Therefore we account Pastors and
Teacher, to be both of them church officers, and not the Pastor for the church:
and the Teacher only for the Schools, Though this we gladly acknowledge, that

such in good Litrature, or learning, (...) ^am 10 12 (...) 10 20 2 king 23

church.

CHAP VII. Of Ruling Elders and Deacons.

(...) 9. 1 Timothy 5 17. 1 Cor 1^ 23.
Teacher. The Ruling Elders are not so called to exclude the Pastors and
Teachers from Ruling, because Ruling and Govern^ng is common to these with the
other; whereas attending to teach and (...) 13 17 1 Timothy 5 17
preach the word is peculiar unto the former.

2 The Ruling Ever, work is to join with the Pastor and (...) Tim 5. 17.
Teacher in those acts of spiritual Rubc which are distinct from the ministry
of the word and Sacraments committed to them. of which sort, these be, as
follows. 1 to open and 2 Chro. 23 19. Rev 2^ 12. 1 Timothy 4 14. M^ 18 17. 2 Cor
2 7. 8 Act 2. 6

church: by Ordination of officers chosen by the church: and by excommunication
of notorious and obstinate offenders renounced by the church: and by restoring
of poenitents, forgive^ by the church. II To call the church together when
there is occasion, and seasonably to dismiss them again. III To prepare matters
in private, that in Acts (...). 1^ 22. 23.
public they may be carried an end with less trouble, and more speedy
dispatch. IV To moderate the carriage of all matter, in the church assembled.
as, to propound matters to the church, to Order Acts 6. 2. 3 c. 13. (...) 15 2

mind of Christ, with the consent of the church. V To be Guides and leaders to
the church, in all matters what-soever, pertaining to church administrations
and actions. VI To see that none in the church live inordinately out of rank
and place; without a calling, or Idly in their calling. VII To prevent and
heal such offenses in life, Acts 20. 28 v 32. (...) These 5. 12. Jam. 5. 14 Acts

a word of admonition. IX And as they shall be sent for, to visit, and to pray
over their sick brethren. X and at other times as opportunity shall serve
thereunto.

3 The office of a Deacon is Instituted in the church by the Act 6. (...). v 6
Pail 1. 1 1 Timothy 3. 8 1 Cor 12. 28 1. Tim 3. 8. 9
Lord Jesus. sometime they are called Helps.

The Scripture tells us, how they should be qualified: Grave, not double
tougued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy. lucre. they must first be
proved and then use the office of a Deacon, being found Blameless.

The office and work of the Deacons is to receive the offerings of the Acts 4.
(...) c 6. 2. 3 c 6. 2
church, gifts given to the church, and to keep the treasury of the church: and
therewith to serve the Tables which the church is to provide for: as the Lords
Table, the table of the ministers, and of such Romans 22. 8.
as are in necessity, to whom they are to distribute in simplicity.

4 The office therefore being limited unto the care of the temporal good
things of the church, it extends not unto the attendance 1 Cor 9. (...)
upon, and administration of the spiritual. things thereof, as the word, and
Sacraments, or the like.

5 The ordinance of the Apostle, and practice of the church, 1 C. 16. 1. 2. 3
commends the Lords day as a fit time for the contributions of the Saints.

6 The Instituting of all these officers in the Church, is the 1 Cor 11. 28 Ephesians
4. 8. 11 Acts 20. 28
work of God himself; of the Lord Jesus Christ; of the holy Ghost. and
therefore such officers (...) he has not appointed, are altogether unlawful
either to be placed in the church, or to be retained therein, and are to be
looked at as humane creatures, mere Inventions and appointments of man, to the
great dishonor of Christ Jesus, the Lord of his house, the King of his church,
whether Popes, Patriarchs, Cardinals, Archbishops, Lord (...), Arch-^eacons,
Officials, Commissaries, and the like. These and the rest of that Hierarchy and
Retinue, not being plants of the Lords planting, shall all be certainly Matt
15. 13
be rooted out, and cast forth.

7 The Lord has appointed ancient widows, (where they may be had) to minister
in the church, in giving attendance to the (...) Tim 5. 9. 10.
sick, and to give succor unto them, and others, in the like necessities.

CHAP: IIX. Of the Electon of Church Officers.
NO man may take the honor of a Church Officer unto himself, Heb. 5. 4
but he that was called of God, as was Aaron.

2 Calling unto office, is either Immediate, by Christ himself: such was the
call of the Apostles, and Prophets this manner of calling Galat (...). 1 Acts
14. 23 cap 6. 3
ended with them, as has been said: or Mediate, by the church.

3 It is meet, that before any be ordained or chosen officers, they should
first be (...) and prove^; because hands are not suddenly (...) Tim 5. 22 c p 7
10 Acts 16. 2 cap 6. 3
to be laid upon any, and both Elders and Deacons must be of honest and good
repo^t.

4 The things in respect of which they are to be Tried, are those gif^s and
virtues which the Scripture requires in men, that are to be elected into such
places. viz, that Elders must be blameles^, sober, apt to teach and endued with
such other qualifications as are laid down, 1 Timothy: 3 and 2. T^t: 1. 6 to 9.
Deacons to be fitted, as is directed, Acts. 6, 3. 1 Timothy: 3. 8, to 11.

5 Officers are to be called by such Churches, whereunto they Act 14. 23 c 1.
23. c 6 3. 4. 5.
are to min^ster. of such moment is the preservation of this power, that the
churches excercised it in the presence of the Apostles.

6 A Church being free cannot become subject to any, but by Gal 5. 13
a free election; Yet when such a people do choose any to be over them in the
Lord, then do they becom^ subject, and most willingly submit to their ministry
Hebr. 13. 17
in the Lord, whom they have so chosen.

7 And if the church have power to choose their officers and ministers, Romans 16.
19
then in case of manifest unworthyness, and delinquency they have power also to
depose them. For to open, and shut: to choose and refuse; to constitute in
office, and remove from office: are acts belonging unto the same power.

8 We judge it much conducing to the wel-being, and communion Cant. 8. 8. 9
of churches, that where it may conveniently be done, neighbour-churches be
adv^sed withal, and their help made use of in the trial of church officers,
in order to their choice.

9 The choice of such Church Officers belongs not to the civil-magistrates,
as such, or diocesan-bishops, or patrones: for of these or any such like, the
Scripture is wholly silent, as having any power therein.

CHAP: IX. Of Ordination, and Imposition of hands.
Church Officers are not only to be chosen by the Church, but also Acts. 1^.
(...) cap 14. 23 1 Timothy 5. 22
to be ordained by Imposition of hands, and prayer. with which at the
ordination of Elders, fasting also is to be joined.

2 This ordination we account nothing else, but the solemn N^m. 8. 10 Act 6.
5. 6 cap 13. 2. 3
putting of a man into his place and office in the Church wher-unto he had
right before by election, being like the installing of a magistrate in the
common wealth.

Ordination therefore is not to go before, but to follow election, Acts. 6. 5.
6 cap 14. 23
the essence and substance of the outward calling of an ordinary officer in the
Church, does not consist in his ordination, but in his voluntary and free
election by the Church, and in his accepting of that election, wher-upon is
founded the relation between Pastor and flock, between such a minister, and
such a people.

Ordination does not constitute an officer, nor give him the essentials of his
office. The Apostles were elders, without Imposition of hands by men: Paul and
Barnabas were officers, before that Imposition of hands. Acts. 13. 3. The
posterity of Levi were Priests, and (...)

(...) the Church that had power to receive him into their fellowship, has also
the same power to cast him out, that they have concerning any Matt. 18. 17
other member.

7 Church Government, or Rule, is placed by Christ in the 1 Timothy 5. 17 Hebr.
13. 17 (...) These. 5. 12
officers of the church, who are therefore called Rulers, while they rule with
God: yet in case of mal-administration, they are subject to the power of the
church, according as has been said before. the Holy Ghost frequently, yea
always, where it mentions Church-Rule, Romans 12. 8 1 Timothy (...). 17 (...)
Cor. 12. 28 29. Hebr. 13 7. 17.
and church government, ascribes it to Elders: whereas the work and duty of the
people is expressed in the phrase of obeying their Elders; and submiting
themselves unto them in the Lord: so as it is manifest, that an organick or
complete church is a body politic, consisting of some that are Governors, and
some that are governed, in the Lord.

8 The power which Christ has committed to the Elders is to feed and rule the
church of God, and accordingly to call the church Acts. 20. 28 cap 6. 2 Number.
16. 12 Ezekiel. 46. 10 Acts. 13. 15
together upon any weighty occasion, when the members so called, without just
cause, may not refuse to come: nor when they are come, depart before they are
dismissed: nor speak in the church, before they have leave from the elders: nor
continue so doing, when they ^osh. 4. 4.
require silence, nor may they oppose nor contradict the judgment or sentence
of the Elders, without sufficient and weighty cause because such practices are
manifestly contrary unto order, and government, and in-lets of disturbance, and
tend to confusion.

9 It belongs also unto the Elders to examine any officers, or Rev. 2. 2 1 Timothy
5. 19 Acts. 21. 18 22. 23 (...) Cor. 5. 4. 5
members, before they be received of the church: to receive the accusations
brought to the Church, and to prepare them for the churches hearing. In
handling of offenses and other matters before the Church they have power to
declare and publish the Counsel and will of Number. 6. 23. ^o 26.
God touching the same, and to pronounce sentence with consent of the Church:
Lastly they have power, when they dismiss the people, to bless them in the name
of the Lord.

10 This power of Government in the Elders, does not any wise prejudice the power
of privilege in the brotherhood; as neither the power of privilege in the
brethren, does prejudice the power of government in the Elders; but they may
sweetly agree together, Acts. 14. 15 vi. 2^. c 6. 2 (...) Cor. 5. 4 2 Cor. 2.
6. 7
as we may see in the example of the Apostles furnished with the greatest
church-powr, who took in the concurrence and consent of the brethren in
church-administrations.

Also that Scripture, 2 Cor 2. 9. and chap 10: 6. do declare, that what the
churches were to act and do in these matters, they were to do in a way of
obedience, and that not only to the direction of Hebr. 13. (...)
the Apostles, but also of their ordinary Elders.

11 From the premises, namely, that the ordinary power of Government belonging
only to the elders, power of privilege remains with the brotherhood, (as power
of judgment in masters of censure, and power of liberty, in matters of liberty:)
It follows, that in an organick Church, and right administration; all church
acts, proceed after the manner of a mixed administration, so as no church act
can be consummated, or perfected without the consent of both.

CHAP: XI. Of the maintenance of Church Officers.
THe Apostle concludes, that necessary and sufficient maintenance is due unto
the ministers of the word: from the law of nature 1 Cor. 9. 9^ 15. Matt. 9^ 38.
c 10. 1^ 1 Timothy 5. 18
and nations, from the law of Moses, the equity thereof, as also the rule of
common reason, moreover the scripture does not only call Elders laborers, and
workmen, but also speaking o^ them does say, Gala. 6. 6.
that the labourer is worthy of his hire: and requires that he which is taught
in the word, should communicate to him, in all good things; 1 Cor. 9. (...)
verse. 14. 1 Timothy 5. 18
and mentions it as an ordinance of the Lord, that they which preach the
Gospel, should live of the Gospel; and forbideth the muzl^ng of the mouth of
the ox, that treads out the corn.

2 The Scriptures alleged requiring this maintenance as a bounden duty, and
du^ ^eci, and not as a matter of alms, and free gift therefore people are not
at liberty to do or not to do, what and when they pleas in this matter, no
more then in any other commanded duty, and ordinance of the Lord: but ought of
duty, to minister of their ca^ail ^ngs to them, that labor amongst them Rom
15. (...). (...) Cor. 9. 11.
in the word and doctrine, as well as they ought to pay any other work men
their wages, or to discharge and satisfy their other debts, or to submit
themselves to observe any other ordinance of the Lord.

3 The Apostle, Gal: 6, 6. injoyning that he which is taught Gala. 6. (...)
communicate to him that teaches ^ad good things: does not leave it arbitrary,
what or how much a man shall give, or in what prop^on.

but even the later, as well as the former, is prescribed and appointed by the
Lord. (...) Cor. 16. 2


4 Not only members of Churches, but all that are taught in in the word, are to
contribute unto him that teaches, in all good Galat. 6. 6
things. In case that Congregations are defective in their contributions, the
Deacons are to call upon them to do their duty: if their call Act. 6. 3. 4
suffices not, the church by her power is to require it of their members, and
where church-powr through the corruption of men, does not, or cannot attain
the end, the Magistrate is to see ministry be duly provided for, as appears
from the commended example of Nehemiah. Neh. 13. 1^
The Magistrates are nursing fathers, and nursing mothers, and stand charged
with the custody of both Tables; because it is better to prevent ^say. 49. 23
a scandal, that it may not come and easier also, then to remove it when it is
given. Its most suitable to Rule, that by the churches care, (...) Cor. 8. 13
(...),
each man should know his proportion according to rule, what he should do,
before he do it, that so his judgment and heart may be satisfied in what he
does, and just offense prevented in what is done.

CHAP: XII. Of Admission of members into the Church.
THe doors of the Churches of Christ upon earth, do not by Gods 2 Chronicles. 23.
19. Mat. 13. 25. and 22. 12
appointment stand so wide open, that all sorts of people good or bad, may
freely enter therein at their pleasure; but such as are admitted thereto, as
members ought to be examined and tried first; whether they be fit and meet to
be received into church-society, or not. The Eunuch of Aethiopia, before his
admission was examined by Acts. 8. 37
Philip, whether he did believe on Jesus Christ with all his heart the Rev. 2. 2
Auged of the church at Ephesus is commended, for trying such as said they were
Apostles and were not. There is like reason for trying Acts 9. 2^
of them that profess themselves to be beleivers.

The officers are charged with the keeping of the doors of the Church, and
therefore are in a special man^er to make try all of the fitnes Rev. 2^. 1^ 2

such as were Ceremonially unclean should enter therinto. Act 2. 38 1^ (...). c

2 The things which are requisite to be found in all church members, are,
Repentance from sin, and says in Jesus Christ. And therefore these are the
things whereof men are to be examined, at their admission into the church, and
which then they must prosess and hold forth in such sort, as may satisfy
rational charity, that the things are there indeed. John Baptist admitted men
to Baptism, confessing Matt 3. 6.
and bewayling their sins: and of other it is said, that they came, and Acts
19: 5.
confessed, and showed their deeds.

3 The weakest measure of faith is to be accepted in t^ose that desire to be
admitted into the church: because weak christians if sincere, have the substance
of that faith, repentance and holiness which Ro^ 14. 2
is required in church members: and such have most need of the ordinances for
their confirmation and growth in grace. The Lord Jesus Matt 12. 20.
would not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed, Isay 4^. 15.
but gather the tender lambs in his arms, and carry them gently in his bosom.
Such charity and tenderness is to be used, as the weakest christian if sincere,
may not be excluded, nor discouraged. Severity of examination is to be avoided.

4 In case any through excessive fear, or other infirmity, be unable to make
their personal relation of their spiritual estate in public, it is sufficient
that the Elders having received private satisfaction, make relation thereof in
public before the church, they testifying their assents thereunto; this being
the way that tends most to edification. But whereas persons are of better
abilityes, there it is most expedient, that they make their relations, and
confessions personally with psa^ ^6. 16
their own mouth, as David professes of himself.

5 A personal and public confession, and declaring of Gods manner of working
upon the soul, is both lawful, expedient, and useful, in sundry respects, and
upon sundry grounds. Those three thousands. Acts. 2. 37. 41. Before they were
admitted by the Apostles, did manifest that they were pricked in their hearts
at Peter's sermon, together with earnest desire to be delivered from their
sins, which now wounded their consciences, and their ready receiving of the
word of promise and exhortation. We are to be ready to ^der a reason of the
hope that is in us, to every one that asks us: th^fore 1 Pe^ ^3. (...),
we must be able and ready upon any occasion to declare and show our
repentance for sin, faith unfamed; and effectual calling, because these are
the reason of a well grounded hope. I have not hidden ^ebr 11. (...) ^phe 1.
(...).
thy righteousness from the great congregation. Psalm: 40. 10.

6 This profession of faith and repentance, as it must be made by such at their
admission, that were never in Church-society before: so nothing hinders, but
the same way also be performed by such as have formerly been members of some
other church, and the church to which they now join themselves as members, may
lawfully require the same. Those three thousand. Acts. 2. which made their
confession, were members of the church of the Jews before, so were they that
were baptized by John. Churches may err in their admission: Matt. 3. 5, 6
Gallat. 2. 4 (...) Tim. 5. 24
and persons regularly admitted, may fall into offense Otherwise if Churches
might obtrude their members, or if church members might obtrude themselves upon
other churches, without due trial, the matter so requiring, both the liberty
of churches would hereby be infringed, in that they might not examine those,
concering whose fitness for communion, they were unsatisfied: and besides the
infringing of their liberty, the churches themselves would u^avoidably be
corrupted, and C^nt. 8. 8
the ordinances defiled, whilst they might not refuse, but must receive the
unworthy: which is contrary unto the Scripture, teaching that all churches are
sisters, and therefore equal.

7 The like trial is to be required from such members of the church, as were
born in the same, or received their membership, and were baptized in their
infancy, or minority, by virtue of the covenant of their parents, when being
grown up unto years of discretion they shall desire to be made partakers of
the Lords supper: unto which, because holy things must not be given unto the
unworthy, therefore it Matt. 7. 6 (...) Cor. 11. 27
is requisite, that these as well as others, should come to their trial and
exami^ation, and manifest their faith and repentance by an open profession
thereof, before they, are received to the Lords supper, and otherwise not to be
be admitted there unto.

Yet these Church Members that were so born, or received in their childhood,
before they are capable of being made partakes of fall communion, have many
privileges which others, not church-me^bers) ha^not; they are in covenant with
God; have the seal thereof upon the (...) Baptism; and so if not regenerated,
yet are in a more hopeful way of attayning regenerating grace, and all the
spiritual blessings both of the covenant and seal; they are also under
C^rch-watch, and consequently subject, to the reprehensions, ad non^tions, and
censures thereof, for their healing and amendment, as need shall require.

CHAP: XIII. Of Church Members their removal from one Church to another, and
of letters of reco^mendation, and dismission.
Church Members may not remove or depart from the Church, and so one from
another as they please, nor without just and weighty Hebr. 10. 2^
cause but ought to live and dwell together: for as much as they are commanded,
not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. Such departure* tends to
the dissolution and ruin of the body: as (...) (...)
the pulling of stones, and pe^ces of timber from the building, and of members
from the natural body, tend to the destruction of the ^.
whole.

2 It is the^rfore the duty of Church Members, in such times and places when
counsel may be had, to consult with the Church whereof they are me^mbers, about
their removal; that accordingly Prove. 11. 14
they having their approbation, may be encouraged or otherwise desist. They who
are joined with consent, should not depart without consent, except forced
thereunto.

3 If a members departure be manifestly unsafe, and sinful, the church may not
consent thereunto: for in so doing, they should Rom 14. (...). 1 Timothy 5. 22. Acts
21. 14.
not act in says: and should partake with him in his sin. If the case be
doubtful, and the person not to be persuaded, it seems best to leave the
matter unto God, and not forcibly to detayn him.

4 Just reasons for a members removal of himself from the church are, I If a
man cannot continue without partakig in sin. II In case Ephe. (...). 1^ Acts
9. 2^. and ver 29. ^0 chap 8 ^1
of personal persecution, so Paul departed from the desciples at Damascus.
Also, in case of general persecution, when all are scattered. III In case of
real, and not only pretended, want of competent subsistence, Nehe ^3. 10
a door being opened for better supply in another place, together with the
means of spiritual edification. In these, or like cases, a member may
lawfully remove, and the church cannot lawfully detayne him.

5 To separate from a Church, either out of contempt of their holy fellowship,
or out of (...) or for greater inlargements 2 Timothy 4. 1^

spirit of (...) in respect of some unkindness, or (...) (...) R^m 16. 17 Jude.

and heared with a spirit of meekness, and of which evil the church is not yet
co^vinced, (...). 4. (...). (...) (...) 3. 13 (...) 6. 1* (...)
(though perhaps himself be) nor admonished: for these or like reasons to
withdraw from public communion, in word, or seals, or censures, is unlawful
and sinful.

6 Such members as have orderly removed their habitation ought to join
themselves unto the church in order, where they do Is^y 56. 8 Acts 9. 26
inhabit if it may be otherwise, they can neither perform the duties, nor
receive the privileges of members; such an example tolerated in some, is apt
to corrupt others; which if many should follow, would threaten the dissolution
and confusion of churches, contrary to (...) Cor. ^4. 3^
the Scripture.

7 Order requires, that a member thus removing, have letters (...). ^8. 27
testimonia^; and of (...) from the church whereof he yet is, unto the church
whereunto be desires to be joined, lest the church should be deluded; that the
church may receive him in faith; and not be corrupted by receiving deceivers,
and false brethren. Until the person dismissed be received into another
church, he cease ^ot by his letters of dismission to be a member of the
church whereof he was. The church cannot make a member no member but by
excommunication.

8 If a member be called to remove only for a time, where a Church is, letters
of Recommendation are requisite; and sufficient for Rom 16. 1. 2 (...) C^r. 3.

communion with that church, in the ordinance, and in their watch: as Phoebe, a

removing, and healing of offenses in the Church: for the reclayming and
gayning of offending brethren: for the deterring of others from the like
o^eces: Jude. 29. D^ut. 13. 11 1 Cor. 5. 6 R^m. 2. 2^
for purging out the leaven which may infect the whole lump: for vindicating
the honor of Christ, and of his church, and the holy profession of the gospel:
and for preventing of the wrath of God, that may Rev. 2. 14. 15. 16. and 2^
justly fall upon the church, if they should suffer his covenant, and the
s^ales thereof, to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders.

2 If an offense be priv^ (one brother offending another the offender is to

receive it, or the word of complaint, if he refuse it:) for if he refuse it,
the offended brother is by the mouth of the Elders to tell v (...)
the church. and if he hear the church. and declare the same by pe^te^t
confession, he is recovered and gained; and if the church discern him to be
willing to hear, yet not fully co^v^ced of his offense, as in case ^f Tit.

or suspend him from the holy fellowsh^p of the Lords s^pper, till his offense
be removed by penitent confession. If he Matt. 18. (...)

3 But if the offense be more (...) at first, and of a more ^ous (...), to wit,
such as are conde^^ed by the light of nature; 1 Cor 5. (...) 5. and v (...)
then the church without such graduall proceeding, is to cast out the offender,
from ther^ holy co^munior, for the further mortifying of his (...) and the
healing of his soul, in the day of the Lord Jesus.

4 In dealing with an offe^der, great care is to be taken, that we be neither
overstrict or rigorous, nor too indulgent or remiss: our proceeding here^ ou^ht
to be with a spirit of ^ekness, considering our Galat. 6. (...).

being the end of the^e e^deavours, we must not daub with u^tempered mortar,

6 Excommunication being a spiritual punishment, it does not prejudice the
excommunicate in, nor deprive him of his civil rights, and therefore touches
not princes, or other magistrates, in point of their civil dignity or
authority. And, the excommunicate being but as a 1 Cor 14, 24 25.
publican and a heathen, heathens being lawfully permitted to come to hear the
word in church assemblyes; we acknowledge therefore the like liberty of hearing
the word, may be permitted to persons excommunicate, 2 Thef 3. 14
that is permitted unto heathen. And because we are not without hope of his
recovery, we are not to account him as an enemy (...)
but to admonish him as a brother.

7 If the Lord sanctify the censure to the offender, so as by the (...)
grace of Christ, he does testify his repentance, with humble confession of
his sin, and judging of himself, giving glory unto God; the Church 2 Cor 2.
7, 8
is then to forgive him, and to comfort him, and to restore him to the wonted
brotherly communion, which formerly he enjoyed with them.

8 The suffering of profane or scandalous livers to continue in fellowship, and
partake in the sacraments, is doubtless a great sin in those that have power
in their hands to redress it; and do it not. Nevertheless, ^ev (...). 14, ^5.
ver. 20
inasmuch as Christ and his Apostles in their times, and the Mat 23. 3. Acts 3.
(...)
Prophets and other godly in theirs, did lawfully partake of the Lords
commanded ordinances in the Jewish church, and neither taught nor practiced
separation from the same, though unworthy ones were permitted therein; and
inasmuch as the faithful in the church of Corinth, wherein were many unworthy
persons, and practices, are never commanded to absent themselves from the
Sacraments, because of the (...) Cor. 6 chap 15. 1^
same: therefore the godly in like cases, are not presently to separate.

9 As separation from such a Church wherein pr^pha^e and scandalous livers are
tolerated, is not presently necessary: so for the members thereof, otherwise
worthy, hereupon to absta^n from communicating with such a church, in the
participation of the Sacraments, is unlawful. For as it were unreasonable for
an in^ocent person to be 2 Chronicles. 30 18. Gen 18. 2^.
punished, for the faults of other, wherein he has no hand, and whereunto he
gave no consent: so is it more unreasonable, that a godly man should neglect
duty, and punish himself in not coming for his ^t
portion in the blessing of the seals, as he ought, because others are
suffered to come, that ought not: especially, considering that himself does
neither consent to their sin, nor to their approaching to the ordinance in
their sin, nor to the neglect of others who should put them away, and do not:
but on the contrary does heartily mourn for Ezekiel 9* (...)
these things, modestly and seasonably stir up others to do their duty. If
the Church c^nnot be reformed, they may use their liberty, as is specified,
chap 13. sect: 4. But this all the godly are bound unto, even every one to do
his endeavor, according to his power and place, that the unworthy may be duly
proceeded against, by the Church to whom this matter does appertain.

CHAP: XV. Of the communion of Churches one with another.
ALthough Churches be distinct, and therefore may not be confounded one with
another: and equal, and therefore have not dominion one Rev 1. 4 C^nt. 8. 8.
Rom 16. 16. 1 Cor 16. (...) Acts 15. 2^ Rev 2. (...)
over another: yet all the churches ought to preserve Church Communion one with
another, because they are all united unto Christ, not only as a mystical, but
as a political head; whence is derived a communion suitable thereunto.

2 The communion of Churches is exercised sundry ways.

I By way of mutual care in taking thought for one another C^nt 8. 8.
welfare..

II By way of Consultation one with another, when we have occasion to require
the judgment and counsel of other churches, touching any person* or cause
wherewith they may be better acquainted then our selves. As the church of
Antioch consulted with the Apostles, and Elders of the church at Jerusalem,
about the question of circumcision of the gentiles, and about the false
teachers that broached that doctrine. Act^ 15. (...)
In which case, when any Church wants light or peace amongst themselves, it
is a way of communion of churches (according Acts 15. 6.
to the word) to meet t^ether by their Elders and other messengers in a synod,
to consider and argue the points in doubt, or d^fference, and ver: 22. (...)
having found out the way of truth and peace, to commend the same by their
letters and messengers to the churches, whom the same may concern. But if a
Church be rent with divisions amongst themselves, or ly under any open scandal,
and yet refuse to consult with other churches, for healing or removing of the
same; it is a matter of just offense both to the Lord Jesus, and to other
churches, as bewraying too much want of mercy and faithfulness, not to seek to
bind up the breaches and wounds of the church and brethren; and therefore the
state of such a church calls Ezekiel 34. 4.
aloud upon other churches, to exercise a fuller act of brotherly communion,
to wit, by way of admonition.

III A third way then of communion of churches is by way of admonition, to
wit, in case any public offense be found in a church, which they either
discern not, or are slow in proceeding to use the mea^es for the removing and
healing of. Paul had no authority over Peter, yet G^ll 2. (...) ^o 14.
when he saw Peter not walking with a right foot, he publicly rebuked him
before the church: though churches have no more authority one over another,
then one Apostle had over another; yet as one Apostle might admonish another,
so may one church admonish another, and yet without usurpation. In which case,
if the church that lies under offense, do not harken to the church which does
admonish her, the church is to aquait other neighbour-churches with that
offense, Math 18. 15. 16. 17. by ^portion
which the offending church still lies under, together with their neglect of
the brotherly admonition given unto them; whereupon those other churches are to
join in seconding the admonition formerly give^: and if still the offe^ding
church continue in obstinacy and impenitency, they may forbear communion with
them; and are to proceed to make use of the help of a Synod, or counsel of
neighbour-churches walkig orderly (if a greater cannot convenie^tly be had) for
their conviction. If they hear not the Synod, the Synod having declared them to
be obstinate, particular churches, approving and accepting of the judgment of
the Synod, are to declare the sentence of non-co^munion respectively concerning
them: and thereupon out of a religious care to keep their own communion pure,
they may justly withdraw themselves from participation with them at the Lords
table, and from such other acts of holy co^m^ion, as the communion of churches
does otherwise allow, and require. Nevertheless, if any members of such a
church as lies under public offense; do^ not consent to the offense of the
church, but do in due sort bear witness against it, they are still to be
received to wonted communion: for it is not equal, that the in^cent Gen 18. 25.
should suffer with the offensive.

Yea furthermore; if such innocent members after due waiting in the use of all
good means for the healing of the offense of their ^wn church, shall at last
(with the allowa^ce of the counsel of ne gh^our-churches) withdraw from the
fellowship of their own ch^ch (...) offer themselves to the fellowship of
another; we judge it lawll for the other church to receive them being
otherwise fit) as if they had been orderly dismissed to them from their own
church.

IV A fourth way of communion of churches, is by way of particip^n: the members
of one church occasion^lly coming unto another, we willingly admit t^em to
(...) with us at the Lords t^le, it being the seal of our communion not only
with Christ, nor only with the members of our own church, but also with all the
churches of the saints: in which regard, we refuse not to baptize 1 Cor 1^. 13
their children presented to us, if either their own minister be absent, or
such a fruit of holy fellowsh^p be desired with us. In like case such churches
as are furnished with more ministers then one, do willingly afford one of
their own ministers to supply the place of an absent or s^ck minister of
another church for a needful season.

V A fifth way of Church Communion is, by way of ^mendation when a member of
one church has occasion to reside in another Rom 16. 1.
church; if but for a season, we commend him to their watchf^ll ffellowsh^p by
letters of recommendation: but if he be (...) to settle his abode there, we
commit him according to h^s desire, to the ffellowship Acts 18. 27
of their covenant, by letters of d^smission.

VI A sixth way of Church Communion, is in case of Ne^, to minister relief and
succor one unto another: (...) of able members Acts 11. 22
to furnish them with officers: or of outward ^pport to the necessityes verse
20. (...) (...). 13. 26. 27.
of poorer churches; as did the (...) of the Gentiles contribute liberally to
the poor s^ints at Jerusalem.

3 When a compa^y of beleivers purpose to gather into church fellowship, it is
requisite for their sa^er proceeding, and the maintaining of the communion of
churches, that they sign^fie their intent unto the neighbour-churches, walking
according unto the order of the (...) 2. 1. 2. and 9. by proportion
Gospel, and desire their presence, and help, and right hand of fellowship
which they ought readily to give unto them, when their is no just cause of
excepting against their proceedings.

4 Besides these several ways of communion, there is also a way of
propagation of churches; when a church shall grow too numerous, it is a way,
and fit season, to propagate one Church out of an (...) (...) ^0. (...) (...)
8, 9.
other, by sending forth such of their members as are willing to remove, and to
procure some officers to them, as may enter with them into church estate
amongst themselves: as Bees, when the hive is too full, issue forth by swarms,
and are gathered into other hives, so the Churches of Christ may do the same
upon like necessity; and therein hold forth to the^ the right hand of
fellowship, both in their gathering into a church; and in the ordination of
their officers.

CHAP: XVI. Of Synods.
SYnods orderly assembled, and rightly proceeding according to the pattern,
Acts. 15. we acknowledge as the ordinance of Acts 15. 2. 1^ 1^.
Christ: and though not absolutely necessary to the being, yet many times,
through the iniquity of men, and perverseness of times necessary to the
wel-being of churches, for the establishment of truth, and peace therein.

2 Synods being spiritual and ecclesiastical assemblyes, are therefore made up
of spiritual and ecclesiastical causes. The next efficient cause of them
under Christ, is the power of the churches, sending forth their Elders, other
messengers; who being met together in the name of Christ, are the matter of
the Synod: and they in argueing, Acts 15 2, 3
debating and determining matters of religion according to the ^cts 6.
word, and publishing the same to the churches whom it concerns, ^cts 7. to 23
do put forth the proper and formal acts of a Synod; to the convictio^ verse
31. Acts 164. 15
of errors, and heresies, and the establishment of truth and peace in the
Churches, which is the end of a Synod.

3 Magistrates, have power to call a Synod, by calling to the Churches to send
f^rth their Elders and other messengers, to counsel and assist them in matters
of rel^ (...): ^t ye^t the constituting of a (...) Chron ^9 4. 5. to 11.
Synod, is a church act and may be t^d by the churches, even when civil
magistrates may be enemies to churches and to churchassemblyes. Acts 15.


4 It bel^ngeth unto Synod, and counsel^, to debate and determine controversies
of faith, and ca^ of cons^; to clear from the Acts 15. 1, 2 6. (...) 1 Cl^ 1^.
1^.
word holy directions for the ^ly worship of God, and good government of the
church; to bear wit^ against ^al administration and Corruption in doctrine or
man^ers in any particular Church, and to (...) Ch^ 9. (...) 7. Act. 15. 24 verse
(...). 29
give directions for the reformation thereof: Not to exercise Church Censures in
way of discipline, nor any other act of church authority or jurisdiction: which
that presidentiall Synod did forbear.

5 The Synod^ directions and determinations, so far as consonant to the word
of God, are to be received with reverence and submission; not only for their
agreement therewith which is the ^ncipall ground thereof, and without which they
bind not at all:) ^t also second^ly, for the power whereby they are made, as
being an ordinance Acts. 15.
of God appointed thereunto in his word.

6 B^ is d^ficult, if not impossible, for many churches to c^ altogether in one
place, ^n all their^ ^rs universally: therefore they may assemble by their
delegates o^ messengers, as the church of Antioch went not all to Jerusalem,
but some select men for that purpose. Acts 1^.
Because none are (...) (...) be more fit to know the state of the churches,
not to advise of ways for the good thereof then Elders; therefore it is fit
that in the choice of the messengers for such assemblies, they have special
respect unto such. Yet in as much as not only Paul and Barnabas, but certain
others also were sent to Jerusalem Acts 15 (...) verse 22, 23.
from Antioch. Acts 15. and when they were come to Jerusalem, not only the
Apostles and Elders, but other brethren also do assemble, and meet about the
matter; therefore Synods are to consist both of Elders, and other
church members, endued with gifts, and sent by the churches, not excluding the
presence of any brethren in the churches.

CHAP: XVII Of the Civil Magistrates power in matters E^c^es^l.
IT is lawful, profitable* and necessary for christians to gather themselves
into Church estate, and therein to exercise all the ord^ of christ according
unto the word, although the consent of Act 2. ^1. (...) (...) (...) (...) 2, 3
Magistrate could not be had thereunto; because the Apostles and christ^ans in
their time did frequently thus practice, when the Magistrates being all of them
Jewish or pagan, and mostly persecuting enemies, would give no countenance or
consent to such matters.

2 Church Government stands in no opposition to civil gove^ment of
co^mon-welths, nor any intrencheth upon the authority of (...) (...) (...)
Civil Magistrates in their jurisdictions; nor any whit weakneth their John 1^.
^6 Acts 25. 8.
hand^ in governing; but rather strengthens them, and farthereth the people in
yielding more hearty and consc^onable obedience u^t^ the^, whatsoever some ill
affected persons to the ways of Christ have suggested, to alienate the
affections of Kings and Princes from the ordinance of Christ; as if the
kingdom of Christ in his church could not rise and stand, without the falling
and weakening of their government, which is al^o of Christ: whereas the contrary
is most true, that they may both stand together and flourish the one being
helpful unto the Is^y 49. 23.
other, in their distinct and d^ administrations.

3 The power and authority of Magistrates is not for the restra^ing of churches,
or any other good works, but for helping in and furthering thereof; and
therefore the consent and countenance of Magistrates Rom 13. 4. (...) Tim 2. 2.
when it may be had, is not to be ^ghted, or lightly esteemed; but on the
contrary; it is part of that hon^ur due to christian Magistrates to desire and
crave their consent and approbation therein: which being obtained, the churches
may then proceed in their way with much more encouragement, and comfort.

4 It is not in the power of Magistrates to compel their s^bjects to become
church members, and to partake at the Lords table: for the priests are
reproved, that brought ^worthy ones into the ^tuarie: ^ek 44. 7. 9
then, as it was unlawful for the priests, so it is as unlawful to be done by
civil Magistrates. Those whom the church is to cast out (...) Cor 5. 11

Holy Ghost, for the putting forth their authority in matters of religion: on
the contrary, such Kings as have been failing this way, are frequently taxed
and reproved by the Lord. and not only the Kings of Judah, but also Job,
Nehe^h, the king of Nin^veh, Darius, Artaxerxes, Nebucad^ezar, whom none looked
at as types of Christ, (thouh were it so, there were no place for any just
objection,) are co^me^ded in the book of God, for exercising their authority
this way.

7 The object of the power of the Magistrate, are not things merely inward, and
^o not subject to his cogni^ance and view, as unbeleife hardness of heart,
erroneous opinions not vented; but only such things as are acted by the outward
man; neither is their power to be exercised, in commanding such acts of the
outward man, and punnishig the neglect thereof, as are but mere inve^tions, and
devices of men; 1 Kings 20. 2^. verse 42.
but about such acts, as are commanded and forbidden in the word; yea such as
the word does clearly determine, though not always clearly to the judgment of
the Magistrate or others, yet clearly in it self. In these he of right ought
to putt forth his authority, though oft-times actually he does it not. Deuteronomy 13.

civil authority.

communion of other churches, or shall walk incor^gibly or obstinately many
