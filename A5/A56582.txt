THE Path of Life, And the way that leads down to the Chambers of Death.

OR, The steps to Hell, And the steps to Heaven.

In which all men may see their ways, how far they have gone downwards to
destruction, that they may make have to recover themselves, least by taking the
next step downwards to their everlasting misery, they be not necessitated to
take the 7, 8, 9 and then there be no remedy.

So seeing themselves having ascended toward Heaven, they may not be
sloathfull but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the
Promises.

Set forth in Copper Prints, that by the outward and visible we may the easier
see that which is inward and invisible.

Vocation Calling is a work of ye spirit whereby whom he has chosen to be his
he bringes to know it and by the call of ^he outw^rd word and inward spi^^^ he
is brought to such a hoppe as works ye heart to morning and brokennes and is
turned from darkness to light and from the power of Saton to God ^ 26 Acts 18
I. VOCATION.
CAlling is a work of the Spirit; by the voice and call of the outward word and
inward spirit, crying to their souls thus, Come out of her my people and
return to me: come out of thy former corrupt estate, of sin, subjection to
Satan, curse, misery, lewd customs, error of the wicked, hell, and return to
the blessedness which thou have lost. Calling is that whole workmanship of God,
whereby he pulls the soul from a bad estate to a good; be it longer in working
or shorter, dark^r or clearer, easier or harder, its the drawing it from
da^knesse to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, Acts 26.18. that from
whence its drawn, is an unregenerate estate: that whereto is faith, It may be
conceived to stand in these two parts, either the preparing work of calling, or
the finishing: The former is that by which the Lord finding the heart incapable
of a promise, brings it and prepares it to be such a one as may see it self
capable and under a condition of beleiving: for it succeeds the condition of
the Law, and instead of do this, says, believe this and live; it is partly
legal, and partly evangellicall: when the Spirit of God by both, leaves such
an impression in a troubled soul under the Spirit of bondage to so much hope
as works the heart to mourning and brokennes, to desire of mercy, to esteem it,
and to be nothing in its own eyes in comparison of it; together with
unweariednesse till it has obtained it: all which are the preventions and
assistance of the Spirit of calling, drawing the soul home to God, by such
steps and degrees as the soul is capable of, for when the soul thus prepared
sees that the promises belong to her, and that she may and must believe it,
then the Spirit stamps this gift of faith to receive it. If the Law has thus
settled a load upon conscience then she may conclude that she is under a
condition of ease, and hope of pardon; if thou feel then that the Lord has
thee at his infinite advantage, thou may conceive some comfort in the midst
of thy frights, and allthough thou may find it hard to graple with the
promise as thou would; yet (as one who is under an exactor) would chose to
put himself upon the mercy of his adversary, rather then be quite undone, (if
he will not show him favor yet he is but as he was, an undone man) but perhaps
his enemy may be moved with compassion toward him: so here, a poor soul may
and ought to choose the hazard of a promise (allthough hard to believe) rather
then be desperate and disdain to come in to seek reconciliation: Let all then
who would be under hope prove themselves to be under streights; for no other
a^e under a posibility of mercy, but lie under the absolute condition of wrath;
when they see the season let them ply fittest medisons, as a word in season is
as apples of gold, sure it is that for lack of Counsel Gods people do
miscarry often times, as appears in their agonies and f^ars, that when their
spirit is unable to sustain it self, they are ready to faint and give over,
yea sometimes lay violent hands upon themselves, oh in such a state discern ^he
state of such a poor soul and pity it, Be ye oh Priests of the Lord clothed
with sackcloath, 2 Chronicles. 6. 41. Do not apply your selves harshly to a heart
overloaden already, rather give wine to snch that they may forget their
sorrow, Prove. 31. 6. Blessed is he that considers wisely of such a condition,
let terror serve for the desperate and refractory sinners, that they may come
under Gods chain, but such as are bound in it already must not be oppressed
more, as if there were no succor for them, no balm in Gilead; but let this
door of hope stand upon the latch ready to open unto them, for God will not be
angry for ever least flesh should fail: Although our hope be small yet because
our strength is great; con^ider whether it is not better to venture upon
uncerstain hopes then upon assured woe; thy case is as the four leapers, 2
Kings 7. 4. If we say, we enter into the City, then the famine is in the City,
and we shall dye there; and if we sit here; we dye also: now therefore come and
let us fall in^o ^he host of the Syrians, if they save us alive we shall live,
and if they kill us we shall but dye: so they ventred, and the Lord was with
their resolutions, do thou so in the strength of God and prosper. It is a
sweet sign that the Promise is digested by the soul, and not suffered to pass
away as a sound of waters; when thou can not chose but fasten upon it in some
confused measure, yet thou see not any certain escape, as a man in the waters
struggling for life though he be not sure to avoid drowning, yet in his
coufusion is able to lay both his hazards in the balance, and resolves upon
the less, on the one side he knows that the mercy of water is cruel drowned
he must without help, on the other side he sees a reed put toward him which
he cannot tell whether he shall be able to reach, or whether that will save
him; what does he? he chooses an uncertain hope before a certain death, here I
dye, here I may live, if I might escape how happy were I? the reed is offered
me to save me, I can but perish, if I perish I perish, but I will surely make
toward it, I will not perish wilfully: wait upon the Lord, let there be no
crevis of light but thou may spy it, for as the Lord would have loos hearts
to be beaten from their holds, so he studies how to speak to fainting hearts
least they fail, Isa. 57.18. God has comfort for thee, and thy mourners, yea
for them afar off as well as nere, if thou seek not thy own ends abhorring to
think themselves well because the Law has them under bondage till the Gospel
have comforted them.

II. UNION.
THis supposes the cutting off a sinner from God and all influence and
communion with his grace, and by faith so brings the soul unto God, that its
united, made one, and incorporated again into him, by the flesh of Union The
sole can no more reciue ought from God tell it be married unto Christ and be on
with him by faith than bodey and soul can imparte or reciue to or fro tell on
hence issues all ve^tew vigor and power into us that is meat for our support
either earthley or Sprituall tell our Vnio^ be pefected in glorey 4. Ru^h 11.12
Christ united to his Godhead, and its the work of the Spirit of Christ making
the Lord and the soul one spirit, and causing the soul to partake by virtue
thereof of all that power of his both in privileges and graces which follow,
for its sure the soul can no more receive ought from God till it be one with
him by Christ, then Christ could have merited any thing for us, till the Diety
and flesh were really united together, and no more then the body and soul can
impart or receive to and fro till they be one, Ephesians. 5. 13. John 2. 17. by all
which its evident that till we be one with God in Christ we are without him in
the world, the Lord abhorring all r^lations that want union, but if once united
then he is in us we in him, he dwells in us we in him as inhabitants in his
house and the soul in the body, he is one with us we are of him, 1 Cor. 1.30.
in him, John 17. flesh of his flesh, he is our husb^nd and we are his spouse,
and therefore hence flows all virtue vigor and power into us that is meet for
our support either earthly or spiritu^ll till our union be perfected in glory,
we are ingraffed into him as a science into a stock which fet^heth all its
nourishment thence, as the to seals of baptism and the Lords supper do tipifie
there being no possibility of the communion of the latter without the union of
the first.

Union is the first privilege of the condition of a man called issuing from
hence, being indeed the complement of faith, for faith determines calling and
begins union whereby the beleiving soul is so brought home and knit to God in
Christ that it loses her former corrupt estate of cutting off from God and puts
on a new of being one with the Lord and he with it, that so that soul may be
freight with true titles and intrest to all good things which either the Lord
can convey or the soul receive, and that in a far better kind and measure
then ever Adam was.

Union with God is necessary to all that would partake of his grace, for as it
was in the Creation till the Lord had breathd the spirit of life and himself
in him, Adam could have no communion with God, so it is in the second creation,
no benefit, no fruit thereof can come to the soul, till this second creation
and union be, but this as by a channel the rest follow, reconciliation with
amity, adoption with worship and liberty, etc. hence it is that our Savior
presses this, He that abides not in me, is as a branch cut from the vine,
which withers; contrarily, he that abides in me draws life from me and
nourishment, he lives in me, as the living arm receives virtue of motion and
strength to be useful to the body from the head.

The union of Grace is not like that of creation, neither in the measure, nor
in the instrument of it; not in the measure, for in the creation there was a
total and imediat union in that kind, and it was a perfect one having Gods
image in it without let or impeachment; but this union of Grace is an imperfect
union for measure in this life, because the relics of corruption and the old
Adam as dross mix themselves with the soul, suffers not God and it to knit
fully, but as it is with the science put into the clift of a stock, if there be
any dross in the clift between the stock and the science it cannot be close
and grow perfectly: so here, the Lord and the soul cannot be so nere in this
life, because there is fo much scurf within us that God and we cannot close,
God being contrary or disagreeing with Baal; and this appears further in this,
that the estate that answers Paradise is not of Grace, but that to come in
glory, when corruption and sin and death shall be swallowed up in corruption,
full righteousness and life, not that there is not even here a true and real
union, but not a full and entire one: The instruments of unions are unlike, for
that of creation needed no other tie or bond save the immediate presence of God
in his image, which had then no sin nor let to divide it; but the union that is
now, is encumbered with lets and enemies, must needs be maintained by a band of
greater perfection then any is in us; the nearer infused grace of light and
holiness joined Adam and God, and that free will in his nature upheld that
Image of God in her exercise and action; but it is otherwise now in this decay
of nature, there must be wrought in the soul another instrument to knit us to
God, and hold his grace in continual exercise; Faith must needs be the knitter
of this union, because it resists that perfectly which cuts us off from God, I
mean guilt and curse, I say, it self is imperfect, yet it resists perfectly,
because it is given by God to this purpose to receive a perfect discharge, in
Christ, from all that sin which cuts us off, and from that excommunication and
separation from God, which came there by faith: then is that which eff^cts this
union in this life absolutely that holiness which is infused here into us is
imperfect, and therefore cannot fully knit us to a perfect God, faith only can
hold Christ to the soul, who is this life of union, and so keep us close and
knit to God, even when our image of God in holiness is weak by this means; so
soon as faith has abolished that which formerly cut off union it sets the soul
in state of union as before, and so breeds in it the true life of grace through
pardon and forgiveness and coming to God. Faith rests not in this her uniting
quality, true it is she holds this her work through the whole life of
believers, to cover the defects of Gods image and to help true and full union
on foot supplying all wants, but she still strives to settle the b^ginning of
holiness also in the soul and an union, thereby also it applies it weakly and
in part, yet it truly applies it, and even here infuseth by the Spirit a most
true being of Gods image, and makes the soul partaker of the divine nature
thereby, even that partisipation which in glory shall be one and the same for
kind though fuller for measure. The Spirit effects this union by the word of
Promise and the Seal, according as Christ was given by God to bring all unto
him and to present them unto him spotless and unblameable, so does the word
convey this Promise of Christ to the soul, as by Christ it comes to pass that
those who are cut off were afar off aliens from the community of Israel and the
life of God were made near and one, Ephesians. 4. 16.

The effect of this union, inhabiting, and indwelling of the spirit in that
soul which is become one with himself that so it may enjoy communion and
f^llowship with him in that Intercourse of all graces, protection, upholding,
and rule as seem best to himself; so that now God in Christ by the spirit is
that to the so^l which before her lusts were all in all, Lord and King, light
and defense, Heaven and happiness, as we see that the owner dwells in his
house, the King in his Kingdom, and the soul in the body, both for the welfare
of the posessed and the honor of the posessor, the same house of the soul, the
same seat which was before is still, but new rule and law, much ado there is
between Christ and old usurping inmates, lust, world, self-love, pride, and
revenge, yet the soul gives that presidency to her Lord and resignes up keys
and posessions to him, she is under his authority, she swayes here by this
kingdom set up in her, defends his house from all thieves and intruders, he
makes laws and wrights them in their hearts, so that as the wife is the glass
of her husbands purposes, will, and affections answering him as the face does
the face in water, so does the Church answer Christ's ruling her, not
withstanding her disquieting with old tirany of corruption in the world,
whatsoever influence, power, or authority, any had, either civil,
matrimonial, or of family, can bear over their body or the soul over the
natural body, that may be said of this Lord, who is Father of all the families
of his Church, Husband of his Spouse, Lord of his subjects, the soul of his
body, to act, direct, defend, provide for, and be all in all to her, till he
bring her to glory, as a principle union causes communion, so does he
communicate himself, all his wisdom, humbleness, holiness, experience, to
her, imparts himself to her as her needs are, in her streigts he is her
redemption, in her fears peace by justification, in her complaint of corruption
her sanctification, to mortify her, renew her, and so of the rest; this is to
make her an habitation to himself by the spirit, not now and then to come
stranger like, or upon pleasure, as to a banquet house for a day, but to walk
in the midst of her to chase away all distempers, and to allow her to walk
before him in and out as his own, receiving honor from her as the brightness
of his image, and affording to her protection for his own glory.

It is true all hang bies and time-servers, who have it at their tongues end,
they are Gods, and they shall be saved how few soever they are, but they cannot
prove it by any ingrafting of union, no plucking off from the old stock appears
in them, no planting into a new, no life of grace, no Christ to be theirs, no
bringing to God by his flesh and the union of it to God, no promise to fasten
upon by which there may come one spirit of God to be between them and God, and
to unite both, as the spirit knit the soul and body in one, so faith to
handfast them, to marry them, to cut off their old separation, to forgive and
reconcile them, and to restore them by the union of favor, acceptance, and
life, to the union of Gods Image, his qualities and holiness; away you
counterfeits, this rule argues that you are none of the Lords, because old
union continues; can a twig live in two stocks at once, if it cleave to the one
must it not renounce the other? therefore tremble, ye are still cut off as
branches that withers and are as yet none of Gods, but in the gall of
bitterness.

Regeneration The infant that is born does not more beray ye na^urall li^e by

brought forth apea^s in ye operation and wor^kes of ye new creature for that by

Ezekell 4
III. REGENERATION.
THe begetting of the soul to God, which is none of his before the other be an
instamping of the Image of God really in the soul.

Most men quite omit to oversee this Regeneration of faith, and begetting the
soul to God, thinking there is no Regeneration, save only renewing of the will,
and changing of the corrupt nature of old Adam from bad to good; so hereby they
grow to this absurd error, namely, to imagine that whencesoever any duty of
mortification or holiness is urged, by and by, and without any more ado they
are the parties spoken to, and s^ of themselves can mortify their own lusts,
cease to swear lie or blaspheam.

Most eminent is that of Tit. 3. 5, 6. According to his mercy he saved us, by
the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost which h^ shed on us
abundantly through Christ our Savior, that being justified by his grace we
might be made heirs of life: who sees not an evident Regeneration of the soul
unto God to be wrought before renewing of Gods Image. A like place is that of
I^mes 1. 18. Of h^s own will he beg it us, that w^ might be a k^nde of his
first fruits of the creation: What is this first fruits? the early work of
faith, creating the soul again to God, and giving it the birth right of the
first born beloved and accepted of God, by the word and faith, which is the
instrument of the spirit, by which Paul had begotten them to God.

The word presents to the soul her loss of God, not in a few beams or rays of
his, but his whole divine nature, life, and being; life we know is the
excellency of being, things thar are without life are in a sort esteemed not to
be, and those creatures that have a kind of life without motion and sense,
although they have a growing life, yet are but half subsisting, as trees, and
plants, a Gnat in respect of her life is a more excellent creature then a
Cedar, the porest cripple is of more excellent nature then the goodliest
Elephant, a reasonable being and life exceeds a sensable life as much as a
sensable exceeds a natural or vegetable, how much more then does a divine and
spiritual being exceed a reasonable, if a mere supernatural life of common in
lightning and knowledge of Gods revealed will, which is but a quality, does so
much exceed reason, as the spirit of an Angel exceeds that spirit of a godly
man, how much more then does a spiritual life and being of a beleiver exceed a
supernatural life of knowledge alone, all which I speak to show that Adam
lost, when he lost the spiritual being of his Creation, the Image, life, and
nature of him that created him after his own pattern. This loss of our being,
and true life of God, the Lord, by his Law presents life to that son^e, in
which he purposes to quicken up his second life of grace, by the Lord Jesus,
that quickening Spirit, 1 Cor. 15. By this loss man is stripped and deprived of
the glory of God, that is, that excellent beauty and honor, which that life of
God did reflect upon him: so that Jacob said of Re^ben, Thy dignity is gone. I
say not that sin has bereft man of his being, but that divinenesse of being
sustained hi^ reasonable nature in a most firm manner of subsisting, so that
there is a desolation of this Image, and nothing left save the bare ruins of a
frame without beauty or amiablenes. He is become a mere emptiness, a Chaos,
and dunghill of confusion, the very relics of himself: even as the sad and
dismal earth, being bereft of the Sun, and influences of Heaven, differs from
the sweet season of May, or the summer, wherein she is clad with all her
beauty. It is a sad sight to see a Carkas^e void of life and breath of man, but
to see such a Carcass as wants life, to creep, and breath, and stink in the
loathsomeness of it, were worse: what a sight is it then to behold a man endued
with natural life and breath, to walk and crawle up and down void of the life
of his life, dead, a mere Carrion, breathing death, death of grace in his
natural life, and stinking even above ground, even in the nostrills of God and
man, who are able to smell and discern: Breathing corruptions in Gods
nostrills, and casting the noisome savor of it before men; loathsome Oaths,
drunkenness, swearing, cursing, deceit, lying, falsehood: Not to speak of
inward loathsomenesse, of self-love, carnal ease, unclean thoughts,
infidelity, hypocrisy, security, prophanenes, and the like; all these the Lord
by his word discovers to the soul. And besides, that foul delusion of his
heart, which makes him to think his wound to be healed, when he can keep it
sweet: As if a Prince cast out of his Throne, justly deposed from his Crown,
into a Dungeon, should applaud himself in some of his best Robes and apparel:
So it is here, when hypocrites can furnish themselv^s with some of Gods attire,
and pride themselves in their knowledge, parts, wealth, wit, credit, and
esteem, or some gifts of restraint, and morrall virtues, and abstainance from
evil, so they conceive themselves thereby to be the persons they are not, and
take a counterfeit show of Parots tongues, or an Apes laughter, or an Image
chattering, to be the true life of grace, these the Lord does discover to the
soul effectually and stirringly, where he will regenerate and beget again, he
will cause the odiousness of spiritual death and deprivall of God, to pierce
the soul to the quick, and will give it sense and conscience thereof.

No little infant having lost father, mother, and friends, all at once, no
idiot deprived of his wit and understanding, are more senseless of their
condition then this soul is, for being deprived of God, it is withal a fool
deprived of the senses of it, and as a fool pleases himself as much in his
babble as in all the inheritances he has lost; so does this fool in his
painted sheath of carnal qualities and indowments of nature, which in truth
do as little grace him, as the gaudy Coat of a fool stripped of his wits: As it
was with Nebuchadnezzar, being driven from his Kingdom and men, to live among
Beasts. Whether really or in his opinion he lost as well the reflection of his
mind to tell him in what case he was as his understanding it self, yea much
more; so is it here a most miser^ble spectacle, to behold a creature miserable,
and thinking it self posessed of all rich clothing and furnished with all
necessaries. Once the Counsel of France fearing the mutiny of the people, upon
the death of the King, devised a policy to array the dead body with all his
wonted atire, and robes, putting the Scepter into his hand, and a Crown upon
his head, so placing him upon his bed, and all his Chamber richly beset, and
his curtains about him, and his pale face painted, that so by his being given
out, and by some beheld, might delude the people: So it is here, the dead soul
be^ooled with her own delusions, being wholly miserable, pleases her self with
a dream that she is otherwise, and this serves her instead of life it self:
Where the Lord will Regenerate to a new life, he brings the soul to the sense
of her loss, by the light of his Law shining as in dark places, as the light
of the morning discovers to a man, robbed in the night, at once what a
condition he is left in, and seases it with a spirit of misery and beggary,
really ignorant now what to do, wringing his hands, and saying, what shall
be^ome of me? how shall I live and pass my life? how shall I avoid the pinch
of beggary, the shame of an undone man, that sorrow that will ensue? I say,
when once the Lord savingly works this, for else it may vanish, he does in
season present the soul with the news of another life to prevent utter sinking,
and stays the heart thereby; he shows it, that as lost and forlorn as she is,
yet there is a way to restore her former integrity again.

Now as touching the way of the Lords first in lightments of the soul in it;
And secondly applies and fastens it upon the same, he enlightens it into
kindness. First about the order of this way: Secondly about the way it self.
Touching the order of it he tells her, That for as much as she once had this
life and Image of God created in her, and has wilfully lost it; therefore
before he can restore her to it the second time, his justice, which is wronged
by her sins, and has justly accused her for it, must first be satisfied, and
the soul must apprehend this Sanctification to her self as her own, and by
this means her guiltiness and curse must be washed off, and removed out of his
way, for otherwise how can he and the corrupt soul be brought together, what
communion can there be between sin and pureness? Secondly, He enlightens the
soul in the way it self, to wit, that in his wisdom and love he has granted
his own Son, true God, and the nature which was offended, to suffer the
imputation of guilt, and the death which it procured in the nature, and for the
nature of guilty man, and by this suffering he satisfied justice to the full;
so that hereby by the way that sin had shut up might stand and lie open, for
the restoring of poor lost souls to their former nature and life of God again.
Having thus enlightened the soul about this way, he then applies it to the soul,
and that by a second closer work of his grace, for he applies this work of
Regeneration by the instrument of his word and promises, which is as a seed of
his Regeneration, cast into the womb of the soul by hearing it preached; as St.
James says, Of his good will begot he us by the word of truth: This word
carries with it a forming power of the second birth, even a creating of God in
the soul. Again, Secondly, The efficient cause is the spirit of Regeneration,
taking the word and casting it into the soul, there hatching and cherishing the
same till it has formed Christ therein, who is the second Adam, the true way
and life, that quickening spirit. And Thirdly, He effects this in the soul by
the power of faith, which receives this seed of the word, and this quickening of
the spirit, and posesseth the soul therewith.

Faith does these two things. First, it receivs the way of this life into the
soul, which is the putting away of guilt and curse, which Adams sin contracted,
and that is pardon and forgiveness. Secondly, it receives therewith, and at
once, the actual and real properties, and nature of God to inherit and dwell in
the soul; and howsoever when Divines speak of this work, they must properly
settle Regeneration upon the latter, yet in working and practice it is most
certain that it consists in them both, I say, Faith, as St. Peter speaks,
does make us partakers of the divine nature in both, though the conceiving of
such a mystery exce^ds us; The Lord offers to a lost soul this word of promise,
I will that thou O dead soul shall live in my Son, I being satisfied by his
death, am content that thy soul receive again this life of mine again, I have
no pleasure in the death of a sinner, wherefore turn ye your selves and live,
yea awake thou that sleep and stand up from the dead and Christ shall give
you life, the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear
it shall live; these and the like promises do offer life to all dead souls that
need it, both life here, and hereafter glory.

Conception the least step of this life, by which the soul retains and keeps
this seed of life, suffers it not to pass away and be spilt as an hypocrites,
but digests and holds the Promise to its self, till it have bred it longing of
the appetite, lustings after a kind of alterations of spiritual appetite, and
a desire after this life; this is that Isaiah means, Chap. 55. 4. Incline your
hearts and he^rken unto me; that is, be so affected with this p^omise of life,
that you do incline toward it and make to it, that we walk in Gods way
appointed to bring you to it, be aff^cted seriously with the excellency of this
life^ and the happy change that God offers you, that your souls do diligently
ensue it in the means; so that in this first work is contained the whole work
of the Lords preparing the soul for the receiving of this life, standing in
those many affections created in the same by the glad tidings of this word of
life; that is, it stirs the soul to mourn for so long living a dead life, and
resi^^ing the offers of life, and resting in the show of a false conception, it
does long after this exceeding great privilege to be partaker of the nature
and life of God, it does prize it above the most excellent inferior life of
this world, though it were Solomon's felicity in comparison of it, it empties it
self and is voyded from all other hopes and desires of life, even as the womb
that conceives must be clear from all former conceptions, it uses all means
which God has appointed with all eagerness of soul restles till it obtaines
it.

The quickening power of the spirit of Promise, whereby the Lord infuseth this
life of God into the soul, which is nothing else save the souls breaking
through the manifold struggles and strifes which self and unbelief do work
within, her self does obey the voice and command of the Promise, that so it may
live, as we see the nature of all fruits has many changes, pangs, and strives
within the womb ere it come to the birth; So here, the soul has manifold
resistance and oppositions in her self against the Promise, but cannot tell
what to say of her self, whether she should live or no, often gives over the
Promise as to good, discourageth her self by the presence of a body of death
which still abides, and a weak base heart choosing to lie stinking in her grave
of death, and sottish ease, and lusts, that so she may turn back to her old
vomit, and avoid the trouble and difficulty of this new birth: when the soul
comes out of the womb into the light; that is, discovers her self to be alive,
and apprehends, as I may say, her own life that God has begotten her unto
himself, which is the highest step and degree of life which is bred in her, for
as the fruit in the womb being quickened, yet wants the full proportion of its
parts till the forming power of generation do by weeks and months more and more
perfect and fashon them all to a comely being, and creature, which at last is
brought forth: so here, the poor soul having received the life of God into her
by her weak and poor Faith, scarce felt and perceived, yet by the secret power
of the spirit goes from degree to degree, that although she has no other life
at the birth then in the quickening, yet this life is more apparent and visible
every day then other, till at last the spirit fall in travel, and bringing
forth Christ formed in the soul, so that the soul appears unto her self, and
not others, to live and to believe, because now she is in the light perfect and
brought forth, so that the infant that is bo^n, does not more beray the
natural life by weeping, laughing, breathing, feeding, sleeping, stirring,
feeling, growing, then the life of a believing soul once brought forth appears
in the operations and works of the new creature; and this is the effect of the
sealing spirit of Baptism added to the Promise, and stablishing the weak Faith
of this poor infant, till it know it self to live and declare it to others by
the fruits of Regeneration.

IV. JUSTIFICATION.
WHich is contrary to the estate of guilt and curse by sin, and by this benefit
the soul obtains an earnest of quietness, and peace toward God, and that by
clearing him, and acquitting him, at his Tribunal, as if she had never
offended fully and perfectly.

A most peculiar bl^ssing, contrary to those garboyls and horrors which
conscience felt being under wrath, as also to that rotten peace which he walked
with through error, either one or other of these is the state of all justified
ones, but when as once the soul is set at liberty and discharged by
proclamation from these, there being no enemy to accuse, neither will the Lord
hold thy soul gilty, but speaks peace to it, so that by this means it draws new
breath and lives at other terms of content and complacency then before; look
what peace and welfare Adams innocence reflected upon him before he sinned,
that does Justification cast upon the soul by forgivenes, fears are all
scattered by this perfect love of God received by Faith, no guilt or accusation
by sin, or any enemies without or within can now take place: look how different
the sta^e of poor man is when he is molested with suites and put in fear of
loosing his whole estate by the wrong of an adversary, from that which he feels
after he has got the day and is past all former fears; such is the odds
between the sinful and the Justified soul, she turns unto her rest, as David
speaks^ and eats, drinks, sleeps, and works in peace, that her flesh which was
withered, and her bones consumed with the scorching h^at of conscience, the
wound whereof who can bear? now returns as the flesh of a little child, hence
the holy Ghost never cease to magnify this benifit, as Isa. 57. I create the
fruit of the lips, peace to him that is near and afar off; its a work only
belonging to God, and above the first creation, for the Lord is the only
former of the conscience, and therefore its a work equal to Gods power to
create peace in it, and to restore it being lost, is far greater; the Sea
raging and calmed, does not more differ then the peace of conscience from the
rage and distemper of it; therefore its said, that Christ settled peace and
stilled this raging Sea of conscience, Ephesians. 2. 15. Having abolished in his
flesh the enmity, so settling peace through the blood of his cross; so that by
this means we may turn our mourning into dancing, the Lion and the Lamb may
feed together, and the Child may put his finger into the hole of the Aspe,
inward peace, being outward, with Angels, Iusstification Look what peace and
welfaire Adams inosencey reflec^ed upon him before he had sinned yt does
Iustisication cast upon ye sole by forgiunes fears are all scatred by this
perfect love of God r^^iued by faith eauen as Nebozar^idan Captain of
Nebocadnesors guard said to ^mprisoned Jeremiah eauen this day have I losed the
from ye ^onds which war upon thy hands 40 Jeremiah 4 verce
with men, with Devils, Death, and enemies: So again, Christ is called Isa. 8.
The Prince of our peace, noting, that it was the work of the Priesthood
assisted with his Kingdom to purchase it, and likewise his third work of
Prophecy was taken up in it, for he was an anointed Isa. 61. to that purpose,
To preach glad tidings of peace ( Romans 10. 15.) to the meek; and to this
purpose he is called a witness, both of declaring his truth, and also
declaring the controversy between Gods justice and our souls; for look how
one sufficient witness in a Court may by his verdit settle a man's whole estate
upon him, and recover his wright; so the Lord Jesus by his blood bears witness
that our sin and curse is gone, settling pardon and salvation upon us, desiding
the question, and making peace; and in this sense we read Heb. 12. that The
blood of the Covenant speaks better things then that of Abell, that crier in
Cains conscience nothing save revenge and horror, but this cries peace; to
conclude, the like is that which 1 Pet. 3. 20. the Apostle says of Baptism,
The seal of the Covenant in the blood of Christ that saves us not by washing
away the filth of the flesh but by the answer of a good conscience to God by
the resurrection of Christ: what is that? surely this, that when the Lord asks
the soul in what plight it is, the conscience steps out and answers, Lord it is
well with me, it was as ill as it could be, but now its as well as can be, thou
have changed all in a moment, for in stead of war I have peace: This is the
first step to all other benefits, no peace, no joy, no liberty, no adoption,
nothing at all, its the first ripe fruit of the Paradise of God, equalling the
fruit of the tree of life, do thou look upon a believer, thou see a
precious object, a son of peace, he carries that within his bosom which cost
the Son of God his heart blood which far exceeds all Gold and Pearls, for which
he has peace within, he is at league with all fears, and in the suburbs of all
prosperity, he has peace with every stone of his field, and may visit his
habitation wit joy, his life, health, wife, children; so that they say, away
base companions, ye have fought long enough in my m^mbers, James 4.1. and
wasted my peace, I will not buy you at so dear a rate, as sorrow and
repentance, nor forfeit my peace for all the fruit I have got by you, which is
shame and death; that peace of God that passes understanding shall so rule me
that I Will renounce you all before I Will loose one dram of my peace; bring me
such peace as Christ has brought me by forgivenes, and then I will say
somewhat to you, but ^ill then farewell for ever: Nay, yet more, this peace
follows them in afflictions; when the Lord se^ms to have a controversy with
them, and to write bitter things against them, in their married estate,
children, name, health, calling, succ^sses in their Ministers, neighbors and
best friends; for this world is full of time-servers, even then they have peace
to stand by them, and as Isaiah ^aith, Chap: 27. 4. they have already taken
hold of peace, and had peace that is held in their ^treets; as one said, I will
bear my pain patiently, because I know ^he hardest, and that I shall never
feel the pain of the wicked; therefore I should not fear if I were in the vail
of death, for thy rod and staff do comfort me; if now my peace were to make,
it were woeful with me, but I bles^e God, I am now in peace, and in joy the
fruit of it. Nay, lastly, this peace is joined with a complacency and joy of
heart, telling the soul its happy and t^erefore cannot lie hid in the soul
idely; but as ^eaven which seasons and savours the lump, so does this aff^ct
the heart with a liking and joy in her welfare; no fool is so tickled with his
Paradise, as this soul is really joyed in this benefit; all ye that would have
your teeth water after these dainties, behold them and be in love with them to
desire them your own por^ion, buy this Jewel but sell it not, beware you grow
not to slight it, nourish it in your souls: First, by abhorring all sins,
that wast the conscience, and other spiritual secret filth, which might spring
up as a bitter root to defile their sweet peace, poison not this welspring of
life from whence all the issues of life and death do proceed in, show peace if
we desire holiness, Heb. 12. take heed of any secret closings with sin upon
any false colors, dispensations, and distinctions, in a nibling kind, and
dallying with some kind and degree, as when we dare not attempt greater, for
when once our peace staggers, surely it will prove defiled; keep it therefore
as a Jewel, entire, sound, and honest, and so we shall find it even as the
tender eyesight if it be lasht never so little, nay if it have but a more
fallen into it, it is troubled straight way, so will our peace be, therefore
preserve it from the daily soil of appearances of lawful liberty, from the
incroaching of ease, worldliness, formality, and the like; renewing it often
by faith in the Covenant of pardon, and renewing our own Covenant, that by
daily and often reckning we may long keep him our friend, who has given us our
peace as the pledge thereof.

V. RECONCILIATION.
COntrary to the blemish of enmity with God, and God with us, bringing us into
amity and favor with him again, Ephesians. 1. 5. Paul calls it our acceptance and
belovednesse with God: finding of mercy with God is a ground of finding favor
in his sight, then we return to our former esteem and beauty in the eyes of
God, we stand before him as favorites find access to him, going in and out
with welsprings, Col. 1. all former treachery being forgotten, and this adds
yet a further weight to the former benefit. Peace is not perishing as a
blessing, yet admission to former royalty and dignities is more: Princes often
pardon their subjects, as David did Absalom, granting them their lives for a
prey, when yet they keep Reconcilliation As favorites we find access to him
going in and out with well pleasing all former ^reachorey being forgotten peace
in not per^ybing is a blessing the admishion to former royallteyes digneyteyes
is more so that the ring the Robes the fated Callfe is brought out for the
reconsiled Prodigal 15 Luke ^^
them far off their presence, and suffer them not to return to their places,
nor to enjoy their favors; but the Lord having as great power to purge the
heart of a traitor as to pardon the offense, admits every justified person to
be his friend, clothing him with a robe of righteousness, Hos. 14. 2. Calling
her beloved which was not beloved.

The benefit of reconciliation offered by Christ, is the firm solid argument
and friendship of the soul with the Lord of Heaven, who before was our deadly
adversary; the soul which was before an enemy to God, and by him denounced,
persued, and outlawed, cut off from the liberty and protection of a subject, is
now by this means restored again to love and amity, as if never any traitor
before; i^s now become the Lords Hephsiba, his delightful one, amiable one,
his favorite and fri^nd in most inward manner, yea received into dearest
account and acceptance; for from hence issues a Covenant of God made with the
soul and the soul with him.

Dear brethren, break into leagues, and swear brotherhood, surely the Lord
loves his with his heart as his own ^oul, his Covenant with them is most firm
and everlasting, an absalute Covenant, for its establis^ed in the blood of the
Covenant, which to day yesterday and for ever holds firm and sure; by virtue
of this Covenant he is not a^hamed of us, but vouchsafes us to be his, Deuteronomy.
25. 17, 18, 19. The Lord has avouched ye this day to be his peculiar people,
as ^e has promised ye, etc. As the Lord disclaimed us and disowned us in
Adam, so by the reconciliation of the second Adam he vouchsafes and
acknowledges us to be his; and hence all the names and titles in Scripture, of
dearnesse, and peculiarnesse, of belovednesse, of fair ones, Doves undefiled,
such as in whose love the King can delight his Ammi and Ruhama, his Jewels, and
secret precious ones, and the like.

Hence our behavior and course becomes acceptable, as Ab^ls Sacrifice for his
persons sake was accepted; so that in all our services^ and allegiance we are
well pleasing through him in whom first God was well pleased, and that not in
one act or two of special nature, but in all our course, in our walking in and
out with him as a favorite with his Prince; yea he loves us not the worse for
our blemishes, but covers them, and looks upon us as his, upon his own gifts,
not our shame, saying, Thou art black yet comely; so that he can content
himsel^e in us, when as our in^irmities are many and great, as a lover who
cannot espy any indeficient thing, face, gestures, speech, carriages, of her
whom he loves.

Hence also flow the most excellent favors of his spirit conferred upon us,
that he might the more take pleasure in us, as the Bridegroom does in his Bride
and Spouse whom he has adorned; hence are those habilliments, of the ring, the
shoes, the robe, the fat Calfe brought forth for the reconciled prodigal;
hence those pearls wherewith the Lord inricheth his married Bride, Hos. 2. 19.
I will betroth thee to me in righteousn^s, judgment, loving kindness, and
mercy: These are the Jewels of highest price, which the Lords treasure can
afford, humbleness, meekness, the clean linen of innocence, pureness,
uprightness, love, tenderness, contrary to her filthy rags, which he takes
from her, and all that he might joy in her: nay I might say, that
Reconciliation is the true ground of a Church it self, and a body of the
Saints, at lest the beauty of a Church; If Uni^n be the ground,
Reconciliatition is that which affords luster and beauty to it.

The all sufficiency of God as a fountain is set open by this ^luce of
Reconciliation, for hereby the Lord can beteam the soul all support, and all
that is needful for this and a better life, as we see inward friends will
strip themselves ere they will let one another want: and this all-^ufficiency
reaches to soul and body, all things are yours as you are Christ's and Christ
Gods; we see Princes delight in casting royal favors upon favorites, nothing
falls beside them; hence are the boons of all spiritual prerogatives of Saints
of all the Ordinances of God bestowed upon his Church, Paul, Apollo, Cephas,
all gifts, and all administration are cast upon them, to serve for their good
preaching, and all her efficacious Sacraments, and all their sealing powers,
Communion of Saints, and the like, the secrets of his will hid to others; hence
also are all earthly blessings, which the good will of him who dwells in the
bush can confer, all are theirs posession and right, and made pure unto them;
marriage with her blessing is their credit, love, esteem, welfare and riches,
long life and good days, their dwellings, posterities, and the like; they may
say, they are all mine given me of God, nay although they be common favors
even in these they taste a peculiarnesse, the ungodly find all blessing^ to be
common, the godly taste a peculiarnesse in the common^st; their sleep is sweet
unto them, their health is precious, and they can visit their house with joy,
the enmity of the whole frame is reduced to an amity with them, there is a
league made with Heaven, Earth, and Hell, that nothing shall hurt them, Heaven
shall not be as brass, nor the Earth as iron, the beasts of the field shall be
at league, enemies shall turn friends, because their ways please God; diseases,
plagues, famines, death shall not hurt them, no afflictions shall sting them as
a fiery dart, but as sent in love, and from very faithfulness for good, Psalm.
119. Hos. 2. yea and I will hear the Heavens, and they shall hear the Earth,
and the Earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil, and they shall
hear Jezerel. Most excellent is that in Col 1. 20. That Christ has brought all
shattered pieces of the world together again into one head, glory to God, and
good will toward men, and peace on Earth; Reconcliation reaches to this.

He discovers himself to such a soul that he has offered to her a price of
Reconciliation, even the blood of the Covenant, not only to compound and
mitigate some extremities of enmities, but even to abolish it all and nail it
to his Cross: this ransom sati^fies Justice, for all the damages and affronts
given to Gods Majesty, this breaks down the wall of separation, and cansells
the records of Heaven, wherein all our rebellions were written, and all those
curses which God denounces against such, that perfect agreement might be made,
not raking the dunghill of our corruptions to pick out inditements, but cutting
off all quarrels, and establishing a Law of forgetting them, and Covenant of
amity for ever wi^h the soul.

Reconciliation fastens the offer of being reconciled to God upon ^his poor
soul by the instrument of faith, the best make-peace that ever was, which faith
overpowers the enmity of the soul by the exercise of amity and mercy in God,
and as it were compells it to be reconciled, she apprehends so much
compassion in the bosom of God as to drowned all enmity ^herein, as in the
bottom of the Sea, and so to kiss the Son, swear allegance and come in. This
have I said of the way to attain this benefit of Reconciliation somewhat more
largely, that by this other benifits may be conceived, both by Ministers in
their manner of handling, and by private Christians in the savor of applying
these privileges, which if they were rightly discerned great light would
appear, not only in the offer of Christ, but even in all the new Testament,
which runs still upon one or other of these.

Adam and the Lord fell out, and their enmity was as the bars of a Palace, but
now by this Reconciliation they become nearer then ever: this Covenant is
eternal as the Rainbow, it walks without fear of any preminary or Out lary
from God wheresoever it goes, yea his very affections shall be no mark of his
wrath, for all whom God loves he chastne^h, Crosses and Covenants do not
interfere; but even then a soul may say, thy Covenant is sure mercy O Lord,
thou have afflicted me in very mercy, Psalm. 119. If I sin thou will chasten me
with the rod of men, but thy loving kindness thou will never remove, thy
league is not as the league of sworn brethren in evil, as Simeon and Levi, but
pure, therefore firm: oh let this honorable privilege draw all to partake of
it.

Abhor all base roots of bitterness, rising up to defile this amity, and
weaken it. First, abhor all enmity of unbelief, suspicion of God, distrust of
his promises, as if he meant nothing less; this is the deepest villainy, never
leave till thy large heart can better answer the Lord then Iehonadab answered
Iehu's question, is thy heart right as mine: ye doubtless make us of all
Ordinances especially the Supper of Christ, the Simball of this amity, to seal
it up to thy soul, beteam him to so much faith as to abhor to revive that
enmity which Christ has slain, and nailed to his Cross. And Secondly, take
heed of all falsehood in thy Covenant with God; if thou be loose to him, and yet
expects him to be close to thee, thou will be deceived.

VI. ADOPTION.
ANswering to her contrary misery through sin, to wit, bastards, and loss of
the right and blessing of Children. Adam was the Son of God by Creation, Luke
3. By his fall he lost it, is become a bastard, stripped himself of his
royalties, birthright, and inheritance, the dignity of the first born, dominion
and Lordships of the creatures, title to Paradise and immortality.

Adoption is the enfranchisement of the soul into her former estate of Sonship
again, being freed from the spirit of bondage and slavish fear, Gal. 4. 6. For
as a man freely, and without desert, takes one that is not his own Adoption The
Lord restors a sinner to his favor liulyhud sunshipp Lordshipp and
coheireshipp with Christ God does in him aknoledg ye for his Child hare of God
and Cohaire with Christ he powers into ye ye spirit of grace and supplicatio yt
as Jacob thou may wrastell with him and prevail is Hosea 34.
Child to become his own, changing his name, adopting him into his family, and
settling his inheritance upon him, which belonged to one descended from his
loins: so does the Lord here, he restores a sinner to former livelihood,
sonship, Lordships, with Christ the heir of all; and ^his benefit aptly follows
the former, for having received us to f^vour he does as a Prince reconcile^ to
a Traitrous son, restore him to the right of his Crown; so does the Lord for
all his, not only restoring them to the old but to a far better then they lost
even the right of a Saint in light: As a son resembles his father, so did we of
the Lord Almighty, resembling our origin^ll in all light and holines^e, we
carried both in mind will affections senses body gestures authority and
presence the glory of our Father about us, were to God most accepted in our
walking before him, ^o the creatures most honorable and awefull as Gods
deputies, in the sight of the Angels most excellent, and in our selves most
happy by the reflex and view of our own integrity of ^onship; so that we had
whatsoever an earthly vessel could contain; being thus heirs of all and sons of
immortallity, planted in a Paradise of exquisite perfection, even in the
habitation of our glory, when we were full of it we prostituted our selves
willing to trangresse the bonds of Children, and sons, and the Law of our
creation, so that we must either be better then sons, and the law of our
creation, and be equal with God, or else nothing; and so by yielding to the
Devil we fell from God, eat the forbidden fruit, tainted not our spirits
only and beings but our blood also, and became most degenerate bastards and
slaves in our condition not having one dram left in us of that saint like
nature temper and integrity which we had, instead of bearing the Image of
Heaven we bear the Image of Ear^h, stripped of our honor and put down to the
lowest form of baseness, and made mere shaddows of what we had been,
forfeited all our royalties, not only of inward content, esteem, peace and
beholding the face of God as children, but also of outward titles to the Earth
and to Paradise dominion of creatures, brotherhood of Angels, and being thrust
out of the Garden we became drudges of the Earth, slaves to Satan, and lived in
continual fear of death and wrath as prisoners, and to hide our heads in.

The eternal word, and also flesh, by the power of the holy Ghost, did by his
bloody satisfaction ever entreat ^ur Father, pacifies his justice, and washed
off our r^bellions and guilt with the curse thereof from us, that so we might
pass into the former privilege of Sonship, and whatever honor of grace
appertained thereunto, and that by adoption; for as a rich Prince having lost
his Son, takes another Child, not his own, and strips him of his name and
family, and causes him to take his own name upon him, and ^o become his own,
and gives him right to all that he has, and makes him his hei^e; so does the
Lord take us poor lost bastards, strips us of our names, and takes us into his
stock, arrays us in his own robes, sets us at his own table, causes us to
forget our fathers house, all the baseness thereof, restores us to the right
of Sons of the Almighty, begat of his own seed and Spirit, and gives the
Liberty of Sons, the title to all his creatures, with pureness without fear of
ever being cast out any more, till we come to possess Heaven with himself for
ever: Indeed there is difference between Gods adoption and man's, for man adopts
no Child if he have one of his own, but the Lord having a most beloved Son of
his, yet adopts us to be coheirs; a man adopts Sons such as may in some kind
content him, but the Lord adopts bastards showing that he looks not at any
thing in us but what his grace can beteem us: a man adopts to an earthly estate
of better quality then before, but the Lord adopts to a better estate in nature
even from earth to heaven to a better then Adam lost; a man adopts to an
inheritance which may leave the heir as bare of it as it ^ound him, ^he Lord
adopts to an estate unchangeable which can nevet be lost as Adams was but is
eternal and undefeatable, in these our privileges of adoption exceed our
creation, and now we become better sons then ever, as Job after his ^ecovery
greater ^hen before, even the first fruits of his creatures and the birthright
of them.

Here we are heirs under age and in our minority, we seem therefore little to
differ from servants, ye^ from abjects, wondering often with our selves yea
doubting how God should mean us such excellencies hereafter and yet endure that
we should be so base the while, we are as the Doves among the pots ^ulled with
the color of corruption smeared with the baseness of affections, tanned by
the sun of persecu^ion, made the scorn of men and spectacle of Angels, yea we
serve for mere tenisballs, for bastards, to toss up and down, but yet we are
even here Jacobs of God having the birthright, Jacobs seed was almost 500 years
old ere they recovered the birthright. In a word this world is a total eclipse
of our adoption in respect of other men's esteem; yet the seed of God for our
regeneration abides constantly in us, as the Sun by his means, it is with us in
secret far otherwise then the malignant world could imagine; if the Jews could
have known the Lord of life they would never have killed him, but our honor is
purposely hidden from them that our baseness might conform us here to our
head.

A true Son and daughter of God partakes of the Sonship of Christ their head,
the Angels worship Christ the same when he was brought into the world, and for
his sake the Angels are ministering Spirits, for the good of us and ours, the
Father acknowledging Christ saying, This day have I begotten thee, so does God
in him acknowledge thee for his Child and himself thy Father, the Father made
Christ the heir of all things and all things which the Father has are thine as
thou art Christ's, Christ was pitied by the Father in that he feared, and thy
Father will be afflicted with thee in all thy afflictions.

Christ was faithful in all Gods house, as a Son fulfilling all
righteousness; if ^hou be a Son thy faithful fear and obedience should show
it, the Lord Jesus being the Lord of all yet denied all even to a pillow to
lean his head on and a hole to hide himself in, and thou if a Son shall and
wilt deny thy self and take up thy Cross and learn obedience by suffering
despise the world and compute all dung to win his acceptance: Briefly, if a Son
then thou art an heir of God and coheirs of Christ; whatever is wanting here
shall be supplied in Heaven, yet here thou shall partake all the good things of
God, for why whom does a Father provide for but for his Children? whose is all
that he has save theirs? Again, if a Son then thou know the way to the
Throne of grace even to the Father in the mediation of Christ, and there can
with the spirit of a Son groan at least unutterable desire to the Lord that
thou might be once free from bondage to this body of death, from unbelief,
and an unsavory heart, from worldliness, from the error of the wicked, and
this sinful world, and the like. Oh with humble confidence thou will make
known thy request to God, and that in secret, such as none but thy self can be
privy to, and wilt improve this liberty, then strangers and slaves shall not
dare to come nere; by these few try thy self, and if thou find the spirit of
Adoption to be a stranger, leave not till the Lord have created it, if he have
done it stand fast in this privilege and maintain it by thy awe and fear of
thy Father, not lest he should cast thee off again, but because being once a
Son thou shall never be disposessed either of thy right here or thine
inheritance hereafter, rely upon thy Father, bear thy self upon him not to
presume to offend him or to try conclusions what a Father can bear, but to fear
him, to keep thy heart in awe childlike tender to prize thy privilege and
wonder that thousands should be left as bastards, and others cast out as
Ishmaels, and thou taken in as a Son and kept in the house not to be cast out,
bless the Lord for ^his and seek no other base props as if they could bear thy
privilege or add to it honor nothing so far as to come into competi^ion with
a Father, Abraham has forgotten thee, but thou art our Father O Lord, Isa. 63.
hold thy Sonship by faith, that so thou may hold with all ^he love of thy
Father, and count it a secret blessing which no servant or stranger can partake
of or understand, in all thy base revolts rest not in any of thy false amends
by duty, till the thought of thy Father has received thee to thy former
condition, use him as a Father, and think not that thou can come too often
unto him in prayer, learn to acquaint with ^im and ( Job 22.) be no stranger,
walk in and out with a mixture of fear and confidence, for as he is a consuming
fire so yet he rejoices to get his childrens hearts, rest on him, consider
what an unspeakable debt of love is in a fathers heart, Ioab told David, and so
Absalom had lived he would not have cared if himself and his had dyed, why he
was his child and all his treachery could not put ou^ love from him, if once
rhou be a child of this father thou may go to him for rescue against all
enemies, Isa. 63. 15. thy name may be Elimelech or Abimelech, my God my Father
is a King he will be even with them that touch his anointed, Ephesians. 1. 18, 19.
see there ^he great hopes which a Son of this father has title to, what
endeavors are so poor which a father respects not in a child, who shall ever
separate a Son from his Father, could Satan come betwe^n God and Job. Chap. 1.
Children, wives, servant^, friends, brethren, all carnal relations may fail,
this is everlasting, Isa. 63. 16.

Psalm 13
VII. REDEMPTION.
REdemption to two things. First, thraldom and slavery to sin, and so to all
enemies who by sin strove to hold the soul under fear and bondage. Secondly, to
the sting and dint of all such crosses as sin has brought into the world, as
the tokens of Gods displeasure for it. Touching the first, Redemption sets the
soul at liberty from all that servitude and tyranny, it buys out and restores
the soul to the liberty of the released and ransomed ones, makes it free only
to righteousness, and that for ever bears the ear for God, and yet not to
make the soul slavish but a servant being delivered from all enemies, yea death
it self, the last enemy, to serve the Lord in righteousness and holiness
always: From hence issues an heart in larged to God, so fearing him as
fearing nothing else, not serving in the oldnesse of the letter but in the
newness of the spirit, delivered from the Ordinances of Moses, the traditions
of Pharisees and Papists, the bonds imposed unjustly by bad men upon conscience.
Hence, secondly, flows a right to the protection and providence of God and to
his holy hand over us and ours against the violence of outward enemies, or
those crosses which threaten our lives, health, liberty, and welfare begun in
this life ending at the resurrection. And lastly, to those two may be added
freedom to Gods service, to find it an easy yoke and a light burden, yea to
count it our happiness to deny our own wills, because bodies and souls are
bought with a price, that we should not be at our own but at his will who
dearly bought us, see 2 Cor. 5. 15. The will has lost her freedom to all true
good and is tied to evil only and continually, the conscience has lost hers
by guilt and accuses in stead of excusing, or else excused deceitfully, or
else is senseless of either, sorrow begins at home by sin but ends abroad, for
by this means whatsoever fear or evil sin has incurred that the Devil abuses
to hold the soul under by, as the wrath of God, the pureness and terror of
the Law, the one to tempt the other to terrify the day of account and last
Judgment, the time of death which is the sentence, in this life eternal
misery hereafter, besides many calamities here either felt or feared, from
which though a sinner be actually saved, yet not secured of, but all the life
long subject unto bondage; by these Satan enslaves the soul, so that either
their bondage by sin i^ used by the Lord as a step to deliver from bondage to
sin; sin has set up a court in the conscience of man, in this court the debt
or crime impleaded is sin, the pleader and informer is Satan, the rule of
proceeding is the Law of Justice, the evidence given or witness is conscience,
the Judge the Lord, the penalty is death and destruction; during the substance
of this court in what a pickle is man; the strong man Satan by this house of
conscience holds this sinner bound and shut up under brazen bars and bolts not
to be broken open by a mortal opposite but rules and keeps all at peace and at
his own pleasure.

Now mark, as we see in Courts of men take away all copy holds and buy all
free, and then the Courts are of small value, removes debts and pleas, and what
should the Kings Bench come to? if the Court be down, what shall become of the
Seargents, Writs, Arrests, Executions, Outlaws, or fines and forfeits? so it is
here, the Lord Jesus begins with sin and guilt, he removes them, pays the price
the ransom of his blood, it makes a satisfaction ^or them to justice, and by
this means delivers the soul from both the guilt and dominion of sin, the
chief thing being gone the rest fall off themselves, there i^ no place for
pleading, for sentence, for evidence, for punis^ment, in the fall of the Court
all falls which ^ppertains unto it at once, and the soul freed from the one is
freed from the other together, and fears no Bayliffe, no ill conscience, no
D^vil, but beholds all things disabled and cannot hurt, we are sold under sin
and therefore thereby fear that God will punish the Law, Hell will excecute, we
fear that we shall not believe or repent, we think God an enemy, fear his
wrath, and tremble at both law and Gospel as things too pure and too sweet,
rebelling and distrusting both one and other; now Christ redeemed us from sin
and therefore from all bondage thereto and thereby.

VIII. GLORIFICATION.
GLorification of the whole man after the R^surrection in Heaven, it exceeds
Adams happiness, consisting in the partaking of that purchased possession of
glory and immortali^y, not of Paradise upon Earth but in the presence of God;
this is that benifit which answers the per^ection of Adam though far above it,
for it shall be a filling up the soul with the perfect Image of God in light
and holiness, and that by sight of the glorified sense beholding God as he is
holy transform^d by the mirror of his Majesty to glory, so far as our souls
and bodies are capable to ^he uttermost, and this b^nefit is the fullness of
the former, it is the execu^ion of the election of God, for we were chosen to
glorify, its the perfection of our imperfect union in this life, its the end
of our calling, for we are called to honor and immortallity, its the fullness
of our Adoption, for we have here the right but there the inheritance of sons,
its also our final Redemption and sanctification, because there all tears
shall be wiped awa^ and death shall be no more, and we shall do the will o^ God
as the Angels, and be sanctified throughout in body^ soul and spirit without
spot or blemish, and so live eternally.

The Holy Ghost to describe the state of the glorified by presen^^^^ to us a
perfection of all soul contentments It is a ^illing up of ye sole with a
perfect Image of God in light and holiness and yt by sight of ye glorified sen^e
behold^ing God as he is and holey trancs^rmed by ye meror of his magestey from
glorey to glo^ey so far as o^r sole and bodey are capiable to ye utmost then
shall ye rightiou^ shine as ye sun in ye Kingdom of ye father 13 Math 43
for ever, so that look what poor wavering and fading contents the carnal mind
or senses of sinful man would weakly please it self in here, as we see
Heath^^s^ and Turks promise carnal delights of pleasant fields, goodly
gardens, rich apparel, royal fare, exquisite beauties and the like, those
the Lord presents us wit^all in Heaven, fully, perfectly, eternally, for
measure, kind, and continuance; love thou ease, here as a sabbath of
spiritual perfect ease for ever; love thou marriage, here is a Spouse
trimmed for the Bridegroom and decked with all costly furniture to be knit to
him without devorse and enjoy him for ever: Commonly look what men come short
of in their d^serts, they fancy the enjoying of it to be their happiness; and
hence came those manifold filicities that we read men have framed to
themselves, poor men would have riches, rich men love pleasure, Epicures seek
honor and dignities, honorable ons seek transcendency and aff^ct Crowns
victories and grope after that which is not, for death comes and equals them
with the basest and most abject and unhappy, but Heaven affords wealth and a
treasure which no th^efe can dig through or steal, pleasures at the right hand
of God for evermore, a throne and majesty to sit and judge the world^ Crowns of
gold, victory, and trium^^ (...) will not wither nor fade away, He (...) ever
there is no sad thought of death to make them wearisome.

Do men set up their delights in this world and the things which i^ affords,
Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and influences of Heaven^ brave Cities and dwellings,
Music, feastings, apparel, learning and knowledge, or to stand before
Princes, or long life, or perfect strength and vigor of body, or sweet friends
inheritance, or liberty, or peace, or whatsoever, lo Heaven has not one of
these to fill her inheritance but all in one, for each soul to enjoy ^his other
world has the eternal Son of God to be the light thereof, every little Star
is as the Moon, the Moon as the Sun, the Sun seven times greater, the Heaven of
this third Heaven is made of Cristall for purity, the influences thereof is the
presence of God, there is a perpetual spring time Summer and the Autumn of
delight, and fruit far exceeding the happy Islands, the City thereof is
Jerusalem above built of all precious stones pearls and gold both houses walls
gates and pavements, their music is the song of Moses and the Lamb such as
conquers sing^ their feast is the eating and drinking of a passover in the
kingdom, their Ordinances ar^ the perpetu^l sacrifice of prayers and
thanksgiving, joy and Hallelujahs from Sabb^th to Sabb^th uncess^ntly, the
company thereof is innumerable Angels the souls of just and perfect men the
general assembly of the first born the God and Judge of all with Jesus the
mediator of the Covenant, their apparel is with pure linen without spot rich
robes of Kings and Queens, their knowledge shall be as the Angels of God they
stand before the face of God, their life is immortal without end, their bodies
senses members in the vigor of age as some think like Christ's middle age
between thirty and forty glorified and enabled to be incorruptible and to see
and enjoy God, their friends, God, the Lamb, Angels, and Saints, their
inheritance, birth, mansion houses and territories not made with hands but
immortal and undefiled et^rnall in the Heavens, the liberty of it is full
redemption, the peace of it is the perfection of this peace here, which
understanding, and the joy of it is exaltation so great that that it shall be a
perpetual ecstasy in respect of this and yet able to contain it self, and
yet which is more that which eye has not seen or ear heard nor has it entered
into the heart of man to conceive, has God there prepared for those that love
him, as the saying is, there is satiety without fullness, pleasure without
weariness, eternity without dimention, quantity without defect, and what not
even above all that the most curious or craving man can ask or think.

The holy Ghost teaches us to confine this boundless glory into these two
terms, either an negative or a positive happiness, the former whereof stands
in the absence and voydnesse of all which comes short of this or opposes it, a
piece of this happiness stands in this, that Paradise upon Earth is gone, a
created thing is turned into an uncreated; that here the misery of mort^llity
is swallowed up and abollished, sorrow, poverty, sickness shame, bondage,
infirmity, death, wrath, enmity, curse, are removed and all tears wiped away,
the grace of faith, hope, pa^ience; here our excellency having brought to the
door shall take leave of word, prayer, Sacraments, Ordinances betokening
weaknes^e shall cease as needless things, much more corruption and
imperfection of Grace, even as it was an addition of regret to Dives that h^
being afar off saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, so shall it be a piece of Saint^
Heaven that they have passed the second death and vengeance of the wicked, as
it was Noah's happiness that he shunned the lot of the old world: but the chief
happiness of Heaven is positive, when the persons of the elect shall be so
enlarged in their souls and bodies and in each facul^y and member thereof, as
to enjoy and comprehend and behold the Lord perfectly as they are comprehended;
this is indeed the blessed union which Adam lost and yet never had in this
perfection, for the mind to be filled with the fullness height and depth of
Gods understanding, as the vessel cast into the Sea is filled with the water
of it and can hold no more, and beholding in this mirror of his the naked
truth of all mysteries and secret ways and administrations of God now dark and
hidden, election, providence, afflictions of the Church, patience over the
enemies thereof, and the like, there shall be a perfect age of knowledge; here
we see through a grate weakly, but there perfectly; so the soul shall enjoy the
image of Gods holiness and be transformed into it, perfect love, obedience,
righteousn^sse, and in both these shall have perfect joy and cont^n^ment, as
being satisfied with this image. Let us lay up Treasures therefore before hand
for our selves and look to it, that the Gospel have been the means to reveal
this immortallity and light unto us, that it has made us partakers by hope of
that inheritance of the Saints in light, and a part with all that are
sanctified by faith in Christ, be we sure that this hope has caused all that
fond and vain bables of this world to stink as vile to us in comparison hereof
as serving for nothing but to be consumed to dros^e, when this glory shall be
rev^aled then their use shall be b^se, now we must use them bu^ let us use them
and not enjoy them, use them as Citizens of Heaven, where they shall bare no
mastery, as Ioane Pressed said ere she were burnt, Oh that the Lord would give us
one spark of this grace, the want of which makes us more like such as are for
the dunghill than Heaven, should the heir of a Crown play at putpin or
span-counter with every base boy, how should then the hope and honor of a
Prince shine in him.

What manner of persons should we be in spiritual respects also? if we look
for such promises how should we purge our selves in body and spirit from all
uncleanness^ finishing our sanctification in Gods fear, if no Tode or venomous
thing will live upon the Irish shore, shall we think any unclean thing can live
there, Oh what manner of persons ought we to be the whilst purging our selves
as he is pure?

FINIS.
THE Ages of Sin, or Sins Birth and grows. With the Stepps, and Degrees of
Sin, from thought to final Impenitencie.
Suggestion.
Original -- Concupis^ence Does make
Our Nature like a foul great-Bellyed Snake:
For, were not Satan apt to tempt to Sin;
Yett, Lustful- Thoughts would breed and brood, Within:
But, happy. He, that takes These Little- Ones,
To Dash their Brains (Soon) against repentant- St^nes.
Rumination
When lust has (thus) Conceived It brings forth Sin,
And Ruminating-thoughts Its Shape begin.
Like as the Bears oft-licking of her whelps,
That foul deformed Creatures Shape much helps.
The danger's great, our Sinful thoughts to Cherish,
^to^ thire growth, or thy poor Soul will perish.
DELECTATION.
If, Sinful Thoughts (once) nestle in man's heart^
The Sluice is open, Delight (then) plays its part:
Then, like the old-Ape hugging in his armes^
His Apish-young-One; Sin, the Soul be charms
And, when our Apish impious-Thoughts delight us
Oh, then^ (alas) most mortally They bite us.
CONSENT.
For, where Sin works Content, Consent will follow;
And, This, the Soule^ into Sins Gulf, does swollow.
For, as two rav^ning Wolves (for, it is their kind)
To suck Lambs-blood, do hunt with Equall-minde:
Even so, the Soul and Sin Consent, in One,
Till, Soul and Body be quite overthrown.
Act.
Sin and the Soul^ ^^us ^^^^ng stricken Hands,
The Sinner (now) for Action ready stands;
And Tyger-like swollowes-up, at One-bitt,
What ever impious Prey his H^^^^ does fit
Committing Sin, with eager (...)
Selling his Soul to work (...)
Iteration.
From eager-Acting Sin, comes Iteration,
Or, frequent Custom of Sins perpetration;
Which, like great Flesh-Flies liting on rai^-Flesh,
Though often beat-off, (if not killed) come afresh:
Hence, Be'lzebub is termed Prince of fflesh-fflies,
'Cause Sin, still, Acts, until (by Grace) It Dies.
GLORIATION^
Custom in Sin takes Sense of Sin away,
This makes All-Sin seem but a Sport, a play:
Yea, like a rampant-Lyon, proud and Stout,
^nsulting, over his Prey, staulking about,
The Saucy-Sinner boasts and braggs of Sinne^
As One (oh woe) that does a City win.
Obduration.
When Sin brings Sinners to this fearful pass,
What follows, but a hard Heart, Brow of brass^
A Heart (I say) more hard then Tortess-back,
Which, nether Sword nor Axe can hew or hack;
Judgments nor Mercies, Treats nor threats can cause
To leave-off Sin, To Love or fear Gods Lawe^.
FINAL -- IMPENITENCY.
And (now, alas) what is Sins last Extent?
A hard-Heart makes a Heart Impenitent.
For, can a Leopard change his Spotted Skin?
No^ Nor a Heart accustomed (thus)^ his Sin.
Then, Conscience, head long, casts Impenitence.
With horrid ffrights of Hellish Recompense.
