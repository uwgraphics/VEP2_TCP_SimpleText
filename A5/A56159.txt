The Stationer to the Reader.
Reader,
I Have with much importunity (after many denials) obtained and published a
perfect Catalogue of all Printed Books and Papers of Several Subjects, Kinds
(besides many other Treatises yet Un-published) written by William Prynne of
Lincolns-Inne, Esquire; not out of any vain glorious Ostentation of the Authors
indefatigable industry, and manifold good services to this Church, Kingdom,
Parliaments, and our Kings themselves (whose Rights and Liberties he has
always Vindicated, upon every Emergent occasion, against all Opposites and
Underminers, to the loss of his own Liberty, Estate, and Hazard of his Life,
without the least thought of recompense or reward) but for these two principal
Reasons.

First, To free the Author from those old and new Spurious Impostures which
have been injuriously fathered on him by Walker the Ironmonger, Saunderson, and
sundry other Imposters, to his Dishonor, and the Readers Delusion. Secondly, To
prevent all Imperfect Catalogues, and to discover what Copies of his have been
published by Erroneous Manuscripts, varying from the Original, without his
knowledge, (by some who aimed more at their own private benefit, then the
public) his only end in compiling all these ensuing Treatises, being only Gods
glory, the public good of our Church, State, King, Kingdom, and preservation
of our Religion, Laws, Liberties, Properties, Government and Parliaments
Privileges, against all Underminers of them by force or fraud, not any private
gain, he freely giving his Copies to those who Printed them; and disbursing
above one hundred pounds out of his own purse, to publish and disperse sundry
of these Treatises and Papers for His Majesty's and the Parliaments service,
and his Countries public good, when none durst undertake to print them, for
fear of utter ruin, by Usurping, Arbitrary, tyrannical Civil and Military
powers. If thou reap any Information, Consolation, Reformation or Edification
by any of these Publications, let the Author enjoy thy Prayers and just
Respects, and his Stationer thy Custom.
